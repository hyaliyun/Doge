The population was 7,508 at the 2010 census. It was estimated to be 7,447 by the City of Aurora as of July 1, 2019. History The Honey Creek area, near Aurora was originally settled by pioneers from Tennessee, including James D. Hillhouse, E. B. Hillhouse, Reverend A. A. Young, James Barrow and James Gibson. They were later instrumental in founding Aurora.http://auroramohistoricalsociety.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/early- history-of-aurora/ Their descendants include actor Brad Pitt and novelist and national security analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. Aurora was platted in 1870 by Stephen G. Elliott. It was reportedly named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn. Galena ore was discovered in 1885 while digging a well on the farm of Thomas D.

The zinc from the Aurora mines was of exceptional purity and high grade. By 1893, 12,651 tons of zinc ore were mined and shipped from Aurora. The mines attracted prospectors and miners.

The population was 1,292 at the 2010 census. In 2010, the town annexed property along Route 97 into Barry County to a point just north of U.S. Route 60. It was estimated to be 1,309 by the City of Pierce City as of July 1, 2019. History There was once a small village called St. Martha about two and a half miles west of Pierce City. It was surveyed for William Robert Wild on Section 30, Pierce Township, May 9, 1870. Wild committed suicide there on June 8, 1870. Nothing remains of the village. =Founding and spelling= Pierce City was laid out in 1870 as a stop on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. It was originally spelled Peirce City, named for Andrew Peirce, Jr. of Boston, president of the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway. The Pierce spelling was used erroneously by the United States Postal Service and adopted officially in the 1930s.; cited in A 1982 attempt to revert to Peirce was rejected by the United States Census Bureau. =1901 lynchings and expulsion = On August 19, 1901 a large white mob took three African-American men from jail in Pierce City and lynched them. French and William Godley, and Peter Hampton\\"Lynchings in Missouri\\", Saline County, Missouri: GenWeb Project, n.d.; accessed 12 April 2018 were suspects in the murder of a young white woman. Two of the men were quite aged and were unlikely suspects; none had a chance at a trial. These are the only recorded lynchings in Lawrence County.Lynching in America/ Supplement: Lynchings by County, 3rd edition , Montgomery, Alabama: Equal Justice Initiative, 2015, p. 7 Unrest continued, and the white mob burned five black homes, and drove \\"30 families into the woods\\", affecting the roughly 300 black residents in the town. (It had about 1,000 white residents.) Most of the African Americans lost all their land and property; whites simply took over the empty properties. This was part of a pattern of violence in southwest Missouri in the early 20th century; there were also large public lynchings in Joplin and Springfield, resulting in many African Americans abandoning the region for less hostile territory. \\"Monett, Peirce City, Rogers, Ark., and several other towns around here have driven the negros out.\\" By 1910 only 91 African Americans remained in Lawrence County and their numbers continued to decline.Kimberly Harper, White Man's Heaven: The Lynching and Expulsion of Blacks in the Southern Ozarks, 1894-1909, University of Arkansas Press (2012), p. 253 The incident has been considered an act of ethnic cleansing. In reaction, Mark Twain wrote the essay The United States of Lyncherdom, which was published posthumously. In the 21st century, some descendants of the people who had been driven out of Pierce City threatened to file a lawsuit for the city's failure to protect their families and to recover the value of their families' properties, but none has been filed. There have been other grassroots efforts to acknowledge these crimes and injustices. =Notable buildings= The Lawrence County Bank Building and Pierce City Fire Station, Courthouse and Jail are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =May 2003 tornado= One of the most notable tornadoes of the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence was the one that hit in Pierce City. According to reports, nearly all of the buildings in the town were damaged, destroyed, or liable to collapse. Damage was most severe in the historic downtown business district, where approximately 90 percent of the businesses and homes nearby were severely damaged, and they later had to be torn down. A nearby National Guard Armory, regularly used as the town's storm shelter, sustained heavy damage. J. Dale Taunton was killed; he was one of the several dozen people who had fled to the shelter.Raging Winds...

History The town was settled in the early 1870s and was originally known as 'Pax', then later as 'Belle Plaine'. It was incorporated in 1896 and renamed in memory of its founder, Capt. Greene Casey Stotts, who died in 1876. Stotts held a command in the US Army during the Civil War, distinguished himself while in charge of the 76th Enrolled Missouri Militia, Co. D, the 7th E Missouri Militia, Co. C, and the 15th Missouri Cavalry, Company C. He later represented Lawrence County in the Missouri state legislature. Stotts discovered galena and hemimorphite deposits west of the town and began to develop the lead mining industry that later fueled Stotts City's booming growth. He founded the Stotts City Mining Company in July, 1873. The Lawrence County Land & Mining Company, formed in 1888, handled the product of the Stotts City Mining District. In its heyday, Stotts City was home to several banks, a large hardware store, The Farmers Exchange Co-op, a cooperative enterprise of the local grain and dairy farmers, a school and numerous churches, and even had a volunteer brass band and a newspaper, The Stotts City Sunbeam, published from 1901 until the end of 1907. The population of Stotts City peaked at 902 in 1900. By 1910, the population dropped to 548. Soon after the end of World War I, the demand for lead ore from the Lawrence County Land & Mining Company subsided, as groundwater issues made it increasing difficult and expensive to mine. With a depressed agricultural industry in the 1920s, the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression, Stotts City suffered a further reduction in population, a loss of retail businesses and closure of its one remaining bank. By December 1942, the mines and the Stotts City Mining Company were closed. The construction of U.S. Route 66 north of Stotts City and later, Interstate 44 south of town, provided an opportunity for increased commerce. Establishments such as \\"Hattie's Hamburger Heaven\\" became regional favorites. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Farmers Exchange Co-op provided feed grain and seed for most of western Lawrence County. Until the mid-1970s, Stotts City bore a remarkable resemblance to the classic movie 'western town', with its wide main street and rows of buildings with false fronts. The old bandstand, at the corner of Mt. Vernon and Center streets, still stands; a relic of the late 19th century, as does the old native-stone schoolhouse and First Baptist Church, both built in 1898. Several descendants of the earliest residents of Stotts City still live in the area. Industry Stotts City is surrounded by cattle and dairy farms, and the area is known for world-class thoroughbred horses. In 1981, Jim and Sallie Stearns established the Stearnsy Bears, with manufacturing in Stotts City. These heirloom-quality teddy bears have been featured on Hallmark and American Greetings cards, and are shipped worldwide. Notable people Capt.

The population was 2,377 at the 2010 census. Canton is the home of Culver-Stockton College, a small liberal arts college affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). It also had the oldest continuously operating ferry across the Mississippi River, which closed in April 2014. Four members of the United States House of Representatives have come from Canton, and are buried in the city's Forest Grove Cemetery. Canton is part of the Quincy, IL-MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. History High school The city of Canton, believed to be named in honor of Canton, Ohio, predates the surrounding Lewis County by three years, having been founded in 1830, whereas the county would not be created from part of Marion county until 1833. It was founded by Issac Bland, Robert Sinclair, and Edward White‚Äîthe latter constructing the town's first home in February, 1830. The building also doubled as Canton's first business, a tavern. Canton's early history could well be called a tale of two cities. The village of Tully, founded in November, 1834, was just a mile north of fledgling Canton and had a slightly better area for steamboats to anchor. Being the preferred spot to load and unload cargo, Tully slowed Canton's growth for the first two decades of its existence. However a series of floods, especially a major one in 1851, destroyed much of Tully. The few remnants of Tully were destroyed in the early 1930s during the construction of Lock and Dam No. 20. Lock & Dam No. 20, the former location of Tully. Canton, with its somewhat higher ground but still close river proximity experienced rapid growth over the next nine years after Tully's demise and by 1860 had a population of over 2,000 people. The town was officially incorporated on January 28, 1851. Ferry service across the Mississippi River dates back as far as 1844 in the Canton area, the first being at Tully. On February 24, 1853 a charter was granted for the \\"Lewis-Adams\\" river ferry. The early ferries were paddlewheel craft with the power supplied by horses on treadmills. Local travelers and those heading westward in pursuit of a new life meant heavy use of the ferry, with early fares being 50 cents per wagon and 10 cents for travelers on foot. In an era where railroads were still few Canton, along with Alexandria, Missouri several miles upriver to the north, became major trading and shipping points for towns and counties on the northeast Missouri interior. A stage line ran from Canton as far west as Kirksville, some eighty miles away in Adair county, prior to the American Civil War. WPA mural in Canton, MO post office Henderson Hall looks out over Canton from atop \\"The Hill\\" Another key event in Canton's history came about in 1853 with the founding of \\"Christian University\\", now known as Culver-Stockton College. Closed for a period of time during the Civil War, the college reopened in 1865 and has been a foundation of the community since. Henderson Hall, a.k.a. \\"Old Main\\", on the Culver- Stockton campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a strategic river port, Canton was involved considerably in the Civil War. Loyalties were heavily mixed and both the Union and Confederate armies recruited heavily in the town and surrounding area. Federal troops occupied Canton in July, 1861 to quell recent unrest and quash recruiting for the Missouri State Guard and pro-Confederate guerrillas by Lewis county residents Martin E. Green, Joseph C. Porter and others. On August 2, 1862 Colonel Porter ordered a raid on Canton. One resident was killed and another, a Union sympathizer, kidnapped by the bushwhackers, who also stole large quantities of weapons, medicine and other supplies. Flooding at Canton in June, 2008. The river crested at its second-highest level ever at Canton, 27.73 feet. Canton continued its role as gateway to northeast Missouri agricultural after the war, with several industries catering to those needs. Pork processing had begun in the 1840s, with thousands of hogs being slaughtered by the late 1870s. Iron plows, wagons, a patented hand corn planter, and buttons‚Äîusing mussel shells from the nearby river‚Äîwere some of the diverse items manufactured in Canton in the 19th century. Limited rail service had existed in Canton in antebellum times but the tracks were destroyed during Civil War fighting. Rail service was finally restored to the town in 1871 with the arrival of the St. Louis, Keokuk & Northwestern Railroad. While the Mississippi river has been the lifeblood of the town, it has also been Canton's nemesis throughout the years. Major flooding has occurred many times in the town's history. Some of the more notable, in addition to the aforementioned 1851 flood, were in 1929, 1973, 1993 and 2008. The 1929 flood was caused by a levee break. Within an hour of the break two square miles of the town and surrounding countryside were underwater, including more than 200 homes and the Canton school building but no lives were lost. During the New Deal era, Jessie Hull Mayer won the federal commission to complete a mural in the Canton post office. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Mayer's mural, Winter Landscape was installed in 1940 and was restored in 1971, with additional restoration work performed in 2005. Periodic flooding of the downtown area happened again after World War II, but was largely ended by construction of a bigger and stronger levee in the 1960s. Due to the new levee the Mississippi Flood of 1973, the Great Flood of 1993 and the June 2008 Midwest floods left Canton with far less damage than previous events and spared the town from the fates of other river towns. In June, 2013 a new \\"levee walk\\" and wetlands area was added to the Canton riverfront. The 2,000 foot trail provides both recreation and educational possibilities about the river and its habitat. Tornadoes have also been unkind to Canton. Several smaller ones have touched down in or very near the town in its history, with most doing little damage. However, a large tornado struck Canton on May 10, 2003 damaging an estimated 100 structures, 40 of them severely, but leaving only four persons injured. The Culver-Stockton College fieldhouse, which just hours earlier had contained a large crowd for spring commencement, was virtually destroyed while the dome on Henderson Hall was also ripped away. Henderson Hall is one of three locations in Canton listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the others being the Lock & Dam No 20 Historic District, and the Lincoln School building, a former school for African-American children in existence from 1880 to 1955.

The population was 98 at the 2010 census, and according to this census, Monticello is the county seat with the smallest population in the State of Missouri. The town is named in honor of President Thomas Jefferson's estate in Virginia. Monticello is part of the Quincy, IL-MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Lewis County, Missouri courthouse in Monticello as it appeared in the mid-1870s. History Following the establishment of Lewis County on January 2, 1833 two commissioners, Stephen Cleaver and Joshua Fensel, were tasked with finding a suitable location for the county seat. They passed on selecting already established villages like Tully and Canton along the Mississippi River and instead selected a location near the geographic center of the new county. An early settler, Andrew P. Williams, donated sixty acres of land and the town was laid out in the fall of 1833. However it would not be surveyed until the next year. The county court appointed Judge J.A. Richardson the task of selecting lots upon which to build the courthouse, county jail, a schoolhouse, and church. The streets of the new county seat were also to be named, with those running north to south being Decatur, Jackson, Perry, Washington, and Water, while the east-west cross streets were christened Benton Clay, Greene, Jefferson, and Lafayette. The first houses were built in the town by William Graves, James H. McBride, and William P. Richardson very soon after the town was laid out. A hotel owned by William Ellis would follow. The first Lewis County courthouse in Monticello was a single-story primitive log structure which stood about 100 yards from the current courthouse site. Completed by June, 1834, it was used only until a more substantial two-story brick courthouse could be built in 1839. Despite the North Fabius being navigable only by rafts, flatboats, and assorted small craft Monticello at first did a thriving business as a supply point for central and western Lewis County, as well as portions of neighboring Knox and Scotland counties. The Lewis County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. =The Civil War= The Monticello area, like much of Lewis County, was pro- Confederate during the American Civil War. Perhaps the town's most significant contribution to the Southern cause was one of its most notable citizens, Martin E. Green. He and his brother, U.S. Senator James S. Green had come to Lewis County from Virginia in the mid-1830s. While James became a lawyer and politician, Martin operated a successful sawmill near Monticello. He would also enter politics, becoming a judge of the Lewis County court. With the outbreak of the Civil War and a riot at Canton on July 4, 1861, Judge Green called on Lewis County's pro-Confederate citizens to assemble under the banner of the Missouri State Guard at a training camp on the Fabius River at \\"Horseshoe Bend\\" not far from Monticello. A few weeks later Green's forces would be defeated by pro-Union Missouri Home Guards at the Battle of Athens in neighboring Clark county. Green and his band of northeast Missouri cavalrymen would go on to fight at Lexington, Missouri, Battle of Pea Ridge (Arkansas), and elsewhere in the trans-Mississippi theater. Green would rise to the rank of Confederate Brigadier General before being killed at the Siege of Vicksburg in late June, 1863. Meanwhile, other units of Confederate bushwhackers and pro-Union forces would continue to clash in the county. On July 9, 1862 Confederate guerrilla leader Raphael Smith, a pre-war tanner in the area, raided Monticello with a force of eighty men. There they captured or \\"liberated\\" various supplies and forced one the towns ardent Union supporters to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. Smith's group would again attempt to raid Monticello a few weeks later on September 1, but were driven off by the approach of a 300-man Union cavalry patrol. =Post-bellum= Times were difficult for Monticello in the years following the Civil War. Two railroads built through the county, in 1871 and 1872 respectively, bypassed Monticello for reasons that still remain unclear considering its status as county seat. Rail lines fostered better trade and allowed for towns such as Durham, Ewing, La Belle, and Lewistown to thrive and outgrow Monticello. In 1875, the need for a new county courthouse gave rival towns the chance to try and steal the county seat designation away from Monticello. In both newspaper articles and public meetings, residents of Canton, La Grange, and Lewistown all attempted to sway the county government. Lewistown citizens pledged up to $25,000 to build a new courthouse at no cost to the county, while La Grange offered to match or better that offer. Canton meanwhile, the county's biggest and most prosperous city, topped both with a pledge of $40,000 to establish the county government there. However, the efforts of all three towns were in vain and no real challenge to Monticello as the county seat would happen again despite its dwindling population. By 1878, the Monticello business district included the following: The Lindell Hotel at the corner of Perry and Lafayette streets, the Monticello Savings Bank and United States Post Office on Lafayette across from the courthouse, the Southern Hotel, the Monticello House (a boarding/hostel house), the schoolhouse, two churches, a weekly newspaper, the Monticello Journal and the Monticello Seminary. The latter was established by the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1872 but closed by 1887. The population of Monticello was estimated at 350 by the late 1890s. The town's development and population remained mostly stable through much of the 20th century; however, the farm crisis of the 1980s and the lure of better opportunities for the community's young in larger cities led to a steep decline in the last two decades of the century. By the 2000 United States Census, the population was only 126 residents. There are still a handful of businesses operating in Monticello owing to its county seat designation. Notable among them are a bank and the Missouri Department of Revenue license bureau. Children in the Monticello area now attend school at Lewis County C-1, a.k.a.

The population was 280 at the 2010 census. History Silex had its start in the 1880s when the railroad known as the Northern Hannibal Railway was extended to the town for the purpose of transportation. A post office called Silex has been in operation since 1882. The community was named after the main cash crop production of silicon sand. The Silex original township was located approximately a quarter mile north of the current old town portion now. The original town was located next to the Hannibal Railroad, and many of the town's inhabitants worked in the silicon mine. As many settlers and farmers moved to the area for work and settling, the town started to grow. The town relocated to what is now called the old town portion of Silex due to space issues. The town had shut down the production of silicon sand due to imperfections in the sand, and most of the settlers stayed and began to farm. The town became a center point for shopping, trade, social events and festivals that brought many from afar. Some of the town's rich history of farming and mining is standing today. I would call them historic but not listed, as a building that is still standing on MO Hwy E also known as Main Street has the engraved carving of 1908 when the building had been built. Also to be noted is Duncan Mansion located on top on the bluff looking over the city. There are few buildings standing in the old town portion of Silex due to flooding. The town has sustained several floods that devastated the townspeople due to flash flooding. The town is surrounded by local waterways, creeks, and a river. Flooding In 2008, Silex flooded and displaced most of the residents. This had a major impact on the small town, forcing it to come up with other options. With the county as a whole facing financial difficulties in revenues and the town also losing business from the flood, the trustees decided to move the residents out of the flood way and plain. After the town applied for a relocation grant from USDA, it was granted partial funding for the move in sections. First and foremost: moving the residents to a safe location. Some accomplished this by agreeing to build a new home at a special rate and were given grant funds to do so, and some residents took a portion of the grant funding and simply picked their house up and moved it up on the hill in the city's new Stephens Bluff addition. With the move of a whole town, there were many complications in the process and these are ongoing. One is removing the old households, many of which had contaminated pipes because of the age of the homes, and re-engineering city utility services. The move of the town to its new location has taken the people out of harm's way. But with the difficult time of the economy, the town still has an open project to this date on the original plans and struggles to meet Department of Natural Resource requirements because of the relocation project. The town had applied for infrastructure grants and received one in late 2008 for a sewer project. That came at a price of issuing bonds to pay for the project which was another out of pocket expense for residents. This is still an ongoing project to this date with the finalization of the project to be completed in December 2015. Before the project was finalized, the town was hit with another flood in the spring of 2015. With a small work force, city employees scrambled and only one boil order was issued, and city services continued. Many residents were stunned that they had lost water in the new town portion, but during the storm that had dropped seven inches of rain on the city and points north, the new water tower was struck by lightning and disabled the pump. With all of the town's sewer lift stations underwater and the town's sewer treatment plant also submerged, this was a major test for the city. The workers and even the town Chief of Police jumped into action. Several people who lived just outside of town had to be rescued by boat from the second story windows of their home. \\"This was the fastest I have ever seen it come up and I've lived here all my life\\", said local resident Johnny Thompson. The 2015 flood has been the highest flood event on record for the town. Reminiscence of this is painted on the rear wall of Baragiola Hardware and Lumber. Currently The town has recently annexed a portion of Missouri Highway E towards 61 to Mo RA and plans to grow the town, while keeping a small town feel. The city's administrator and Chief of Police William Barnes II gave the town its first city logo and slogan in early 2016. The City of Silex's slogan is \\"A rural City Moving Forward\\".

Prior to completion of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad in 1859, the city was minimally developed with cheap frame houses, with little pretense of architectural beauty or design. The building materials being hewed and sawed from the oak and walnut timber surrounding the town, as timber originally covered the site. The railroad gave an impetus for town improvements. Soon two and three-story brick business buildings were constructed in place of the former frame structures. From 1865 to 1870, the city improved rapidly, then a lull lasted until 1875, when the erection of the beautiful three-story, $36,000 school building was started, now known as \\"Middle School.\\" From that time on Chillicothe made a slow, steady growth up to 1886, when the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad was built through here. That year also saw the introduction of the \\"Water Works\\" and electric lights. The city continued to modernize in the early 20th century. =The Missouri Training School for Girls= The Missouri Training School for Girls (1889-1981) was the correctional facility of the Missouri Division of Youth Services.

The village was incorporated in 1874. Mineral springs, hotel and camp grounds Medicinal effects of the waters in Mooresville Mineral Springs were reported before 1850 when hogs appeared to develop immunity from cholera after drinking from the springs. A photo of the springs area was published in 1892. The bath house provided a place for patients to bathe in the mineral waters. The spring house, decorated with a large letter \\"M\\", was next to it. In the early 20th century a wooden dance floor was installed in the area between the bath house and spring house. Dr. Theophilus Fiske (1834-1908) operated the Mineral Springs Hotel and Sanitarium across the road from the springs. Patients from virtually every state stayed at the hotel or in rented rooms of nearby residents while seeking relief from stomach ailments. Others came to enjoy the social atmosphere at the White Horse Inn or to camp with their families at the nearby free camp grounds. Dr. Fiske's brother Nathaniel \\"Nat\\" Fiske (1844-1919) lived near uptown in the first house southwest of the depot. Some spare rooms in the house were rented to travelers, and \\"HOTEL\\" was painted in large letters on the north side of the house for incoming train passengers to see. A sign shown in a photograph from the time may have been placed on Nat Fiske's hotel for the benefit of travelers interested in going to his brother's hotel in \\"Springtown\\".

The population was 1,366 at the 2010 census. History The beginnings of La Plata can be traced back to March 17, 1827 when Drury Davis established a trading post near the town's current location. The ensuing few years saw Davis joined by family and friends to create a small village that included a blacksmith shop, an inn, and stagecoach station. La Plata was platted in 1855. It was named after the city of La Plata, in Argentina. The name is of Spanish origin meaning \\"silver\\". Two men, Louis Gex and Thomas Saunders, were the primary force behind the town's platting, and drew straws to choose the community's name. Saunders wanted to name the town Charlottesville to honor a favorite sister, while Gex pushed for the name La Plata. Gex won out and the town is believed to have been first incorporated on September 29, 1856. Another of the early settlers who helped in creating the town was Dr. W. W. Moore, who erected La Plata's first hotel. The North Missouri (later known as the Wabash Railroad) came to town in 1867, and the Santa Fe Railroad twenty years later, passing through La Plata on its route from Chicago to Kansas City. The combination of the two railroads made La Plata an ideal shipping point for timber, livestock, grains, and other goods for northern Macon County and southern portions of neighboring Adair County as well. As part of this growth, the town was incorporated as a fourth-class city on April 4, 1881 with Jacob Gilstrap serving as first mayor. La Plata's first major industry, a creamery, was established in 1883. The facility had the capacity to produce up to 1.25 tons of butter per day. However, fire destroyed the creamery and it was never rebuilt. Other light agriculture-related industry has existed in the town over the years, including a large chicken hatchery and turkey hatchery. Two major oil pipelines pass through La Plata as well, the Prairie Pipeline being the first in 1912. A \\"tank farm\\" of large storage tanks was located for many years on the city's northern edge. The Wabash railroad through La Plata was abandoned after it was merged in 1991 with the Norfolk and Western Railway, but the Amtrak station is still in operation on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail system, and the town is served by the Southwest Chief. A small but active business community still exists in the town. The first school, named Long Branch for a nearby creek, was established in 1868. It was replaced, in 1872, by a five-room brick schoolhouse. Today, children of La Plata and the surrounding rural area are educated by the La Plata R-2 school district. The Lester and Norma Dent House, John T. and Mary M. Doneghy House, Gilbreath- McLorn House, and La Plata Square Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 5,471 at the 2010 census. History Macon was platted in 1856. Like the county, Macon was named for Nathaniel Macon. A post office called Macon City was established in 1856, and the name was changed to Macon in 1892. In May 1898, there was a string of break-ins in the area of Macon. The break-ins included the theft of food and items, as well as assaults on women. In late June, there was a break-in at the home of John Koechel, a blind broom maker. During this break-in, there were references to previous assaults, an attempted assault, and a theft of two sacks of flour. Police officers followed a trail of tiny white specks to the home of Henry Williams, who was later arrested with no resistance. The night of Williams' arrest, crowds formed at the courthouse, while a local pastor, Rev. G. A. Robbins, plead for the crowd to allow the law to take its proper course. The crowd moved on to the jail, and demanded Sheriff A. J. Glenn give up Williams, Glenn and his deputies refused the crowd's demands. A man called Mr. McVicker made a speech to attempt to pacify the crowd, but was knocked out by a thrown brick. The crowd knocked down the fence, stole the key, and unlocked Williams' cell, confronting the cowering man. The mob of 200-300 men decided they would hang him from a bridge instead of electrical lights, so they would not offend the women and children in the morning. In the early morning hours of June 30, 1898, Henry Williams was lynched on the Wabash bridge, he maintained his innocence when asked if he wanted to say anything. In November 1919 four African-Americans were arrested for allegedly robbing a white farmer. They were held at the Macon prison but on Saturday, November 15, 1919, a white mob drove into town and demanded that the Sheriff hand them over. At first he refused but when the mob threatened to use dynamite to destroy the prison the four black men were handed over and they were then driven to Moberly, Missouri and lynched.

The population was 3,985 at the 2010 census. The city is surrounded on three sides (east, west, and south) by the easternmost parcel of the Mark Twain National Forest. History The Fredericktown Courthouse Square Historic District, Fredericktown Missouri Pacific Railroad Depot, Fredericktown United States Post Office, Madison County Courthouse, and St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroad Depot are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Exploration= The history of Fredericktown revolves around the history of lead mining. The earliest beginnings of Fredericktown occurred around 1715 when local Indians guided French explorers to the area which at that time was part of the Upper Louisiana in order to show them sources of lead which the French had hoped would also contain silver. The French Governor of French Louisiana Sieur Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, failed to find silver, but succeeded in recruiting other French investors in The Company of the West, organized in 1717, to exploit the mineral resources of Louisiana.Historic Resource Survey Phase 1 City of Fredericktown, Missouri http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/survey/MOAS001-R.pdf =Early Settlement= The earliest European settlement in the area near what is now Fredericktown was Mine La Motte, a small community about six miles (10 km) to the north. Mine La Motte was first settled by Europeans to mine a large vein of galena lead ore distributed in dolomite that reached the surface there. The need for a local source of lead for ammunition made Mine La Motte one of the earliest European settlements in the interior of the North American continent. Another earlier settlement was the French Catholic community of Saint Michel, Missouri, which is located just north of the current Fredericktown site on the other side of Saline Creek. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Americanization of the area began in earnest with an influx of second and third generation German Reformed Church settlers from the next county eastward, Bollinger County. Other American settlers were drawn to the area as well, including Moses Austin, founder of the American settlement in Texas, who mined for lead between 1800 and 1820 before going on to Texas. In 1818, the area was organized to form Madison County. The name was chosen to honor James Madison, who had been the two-term President of the United States up until two years earlier (from 1809 to 1817), and who had handled the Louisiana Purchase as Secretary of State for Thomas Jefferson. At the time that Madison County was organized, the land south of Saline Creek was owned by Col. Nathaniel Cook. A new town was laid out on Col. Cook's higher, less flood-prone land, and named Fredericktown in honor of Col. Cook's close friend from Bollinger County, Col. George Frederick Bollinger. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Geology Fredericktown is nearly unique in the United States for the variety of minerals and metals that have been found and commercially mined nearby, including lead, iron, copper, silver, cobalt, nickel, zinc, tungsten, and small amounts of gold, all of which have been mined at various times within of the town. The mines immediately east of the town, in what has been called the Old Lead Belt, were at one time one of the largest sources of lead in the United States. One of the oldest, and possibly the oldest, lead mines on the North American continent can be found six miles (10 km) north, in Mine La Motte. While little or no iron has ever been mined in Madison County, very large deposits of mostly hematite with associated magnetite exist to the west in Iron County. These deposits have been mined since at least Civil War times. Also west of Fredericktown but still within Madison County is the Silver Mines Recreation Area,Silver Mines Recreation Area, US Forest Service which is situated along a steep river gorge of the St. Francis River. This area contains the ruins of both a 1920s silver mine and a World War II era tungsten mine. Examples of the minerals that were once mined can still be found in the abundant tailings on the south side of the St. Francis River, just downstream of a now-breached stone dam. They consist of metallic-appearing sulfides such as sphalerite, arsenopyrite, and marcasite embedded in opaque veins of quartz. Careful searchers can also find crystals of wolframite, a tungsten ore that was mined briefly during World War II when access to other sources was cut off, and small grains of topaz, which caused the earlier silver miners of the area considerable economic grief by wearing out their diamond-tipped drills more quickly than anticipated. Both highly magnetic magnetite and slightly magnetic ilmenite (titanium ore) grains can be found in patches of black sands left along the beach of the main swimming area. Madison County also contains unique igneous rocks not found anywhere else, such as Devonite, a colorful decorative stone found only in a single igneous intrusion dike on Mount Devon. Fredericktown is located at (37.559436, -90.294533). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (3.17%) is water. Also found west of Fredericktown but still within Madison County is Black Mountain. Highway E runs along the base of Black Mountain, beside the St. Francis River. While Black Mountain is only the 42nd highest (above sea level) in Missouri, Black Mountain has the largest difference in elevation from the base to the summit. The St. Francis River, at the base of Black Mountain, is approximately 540 feet above sea level. The summit of Black Mountain is 1,502 feet above sea level, which is a difference of approximately 962 feet. In contrast, Taum Sauk Mountain, the highest in Missouri, only rises about 700 feet from its base, because it rises from an already elevated plain. Taum Sauk is the highest mountain in Missouri; Black Mountain is the tallest.

It was originally called Proctor, after James G. Proctor, who was an early settler. The name was rejected because there was another Procter in Missouri. It was then changed to Cove because of its semicircular shape. That name was also rejected because of another similar name in the state. Chester was suggested but again was rejected because there was another Chester on the rail line. Ultimately, the railroad company imposed the name \\"Olean,\\" after Olean, New York, apparently on a lark, as no documentation survives explaining any reasoning for choosing a city with no connections to the town in Missouri, which in turn had no connection to oil. Attribution to Dr. W.S. Allee appear not to be true, as Allee never lived in or visited New York State. At the turn of the 20th century, Olean contained a gristmill and a canning factory.

History Charleston is the largest town on the Missouri side near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers at Bird's Point (11 miles east on U.S. Route 60). Its history has been tied to traffic on the rivers. Settlement initially occurred on the north side, in what in 1805 was called Matthews Prairie. After purchasing for $337, Joseph Moore laid out Charleston in 1837. Some say the community derives its name from nearby Charles Prairie, while others believe the name is a transfer from Charleston, South Carolina. In 1845, it was selected as the county seat. A post office named Charleston has been in operation since 1847. The Battle of Charleston was fought on August 19, 1861. Killed in the battle were one Union soldier and thirteen Missouri State Guard soldiers. On September 1, 1861, Confederate General M. Jeff Thompson robbed the Union Bank of Charleston. Thompson, who handed the cashier a note, gave the cashier an hour to get approval from superiors to give him keys to the vault. After receiving the money, he left a receipt for $57,000 and discovered later that only $56,000 was in the bags. The city was the epicenter of the October 31, 1895 5.9 earthquake on the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The quake damaged virtually every building in Charleston, creating sand volcanoes and cracking a pier on the Cairo Rail Bridge.

History The City of California was established in 1834. The seat of justice of Moniteau County was originally known as Boonesborough. When Moniteau County was organized in 1845, it was decided that Boonsborough would become the county seat. Because the county court was unwilling to pay for land in Boonsborough, a site was selected one-mile (1.6 km) west and this would become the new county seat. In 1846, the Post Office required a new name to be selected for Boonsborough since there was already a Boonsborough in Missouri. The city was renamed California on January 25, 1847 for the territory on the West Coast that was just then drawing attention due to progress of the overland railroad. That same year, a courthouse was erected on the square. California was incorporated in 1848 and elected its first city officials in 1858, ten years later. The Weekly California News printed its first edition on September 18, 1858 and has since been Moniteau County's oldest established business still in operation. Today it is known as the California Democrat. By the end of the Civil War, California's population was around 1,000. The city had 10 dry goods stores, 2 drug stores, a tobacco factory, a large steam flouring mill and carding machine, a high school, a printing office, and a bank. In 1867, money was appropriated for a new courthouse, which was completed in 1868 and is still in use today.History of California from Moniteau County, Missouri History =Historical places of interest= In addition to the Finke Opera House, Gray-Wood Buildings, and Moniteau County Courthouse listed below, the Old Barnhill Building and Old California City Hall and Fire Station are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Tipton 8 Ball Water Tower The city of Tipton has a water tower painted like an \\"eight ball\\". This water tower originated in 1968, when Ewald Fischer (a native of Tipton) built his billiard table factory‚ÄîFischer Manufacturing Co., which claimed to be the largest builder of pool tables in the United States. The company was purchased by the Spalding Company and the plant soon closed when Spalding sold it in 1976 to Ebonite Billiard, which was a subsidiary of Fuqua Companies. By then, the water tower was repainted. However, the residents of Tipton wanted to have the eight ball back, so it was painted again. Today, the water tower is generally regarded as the world's largest eight ball.http://www.tiptonmo.com/information/8ball.htm Geography Tipton is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and Missouri Route 5.

The population was 200, per the census data in the 1911 Cram's World Atlas.Cram's Unrivaled Atlas of the World. New York: George F Cram, 1911. The population was however down to nine residents according to the 2000 United States Census, and following the 2010 Census, the village was reported as uninhabited. Generated using American FactFinder. The Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site is located in Florida, with Mark Twain State Park nearby.  History  Playing quoits in Florida, 1919 Mark Twain was born in Florida in 1835. He said his birthplace was \\"a nearly invisible village\\"Mark Twain quotations - Florida, Missouri and \\"The village contained a hundred people and I increased the population by 1 per cent. It is more than many of the best men in history could have done for a town\\". The village of Florida was laid out in the winter of 1831. The community took its name from the state of Florida. The founders were Robert Donaldson, Joseph Grigsby, Hugh A. Hickman, a Doctor Keenan, John Witt, and Major W.N. Penn. Hickman owned and operated a mill approximately one half-mile south of Florida, while Penn had a dry goods store near there as well. Penn soon moved his store into Florida proper, becoming the town's first business. In the early years there was some hope of the town becoming a regional point of commerce and shipping. Florida is located at the confluence of the North, South, and Middle forks of the Salt River. It is 48 miles upstream from its mouth emptying into the Mississippi River at Louisiana, Missouri. The location was thought to be strategic because it was felt to be a potential \\"growth center\\" in the settlement of northeast Missouri. For example, John Clemens, father of Mark Twain, along with other investors, had formed the Salt River Navigation Company in 1836 in hopes of developing this water commerce. Several boatloads of flour were shipped from Hickman's mill to the Mississippi and returned with sugar, coffee, and manufactured goods. However, fickle river levels on the Salt made consistent shipping via barge or riverboat impractical. Having no railroad and with river shipping no longer an option, Florida was destined to remain a small village attending to the commerce needs of area farmers. The Clemens family, seeking better opportunities, left Florida for Hannibal, Missouri, when young Samuel was around five years old. He would continue to visit Florida for extended summer vacations at his uncle John Quarles' farm. Such summer memories and social interactions with Quarles house servants formed many of the sketches and perspectives that Clemens placed in his novels. The Quarles farmhouse remains as an active archeological project available to the public near Florida. = Civil War = As part of the area known as Little Dixie, Monroe County's residents largely sided with the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The area around Florida was the scene of two small battles during the conflict. The first happened in July, 1861. Brigadier General Thomas A. Harris of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard had established his headquarters at Florida in June, and by early July he had nearly five hundred troops in the immediate vicinity under his command. When informed of this growing threat by Union sympathizers and Federal spies, Union commander Nathaniel Lyon, in St. Louis, ordered action be taken. On July 8, 1861, Federal forces consisting of six companies of regular infantry plus a company of Hannibal Home Guards ‚Äî around six hundred men total ‚Äî and a cannon with crew, set out from Palmyra, Missouri, toward Florida. Learning of their approach, General Harris sent a unit of approximately fifty men to reconnoiter and harass the Federals. The opposing forces clashed at a place called Hagar's Hill, four miles north of Florida. Hidden by thick timber and brush, the State Guardsmen ambushed the Federals, opening fire at very close range. The Federal troops quickly regrouped and returned heavy fire with their superior numbers, causing the State Guard force to flee. Casualties were surprisingly light with one State Guardsman killed and a few others slightly wounded. The Federals had none killed but three seriously wounded. Meanwhile, the bulk of State Guard and various Confederate bushwhackers had outflanked the Federals and attacked Monroe City, Missouri, and its vital railroad line. This forced the Federals to turn back from the march on Florida. The second Civil War action to happen near Florida occurred about one year later. On July 22, 1862, a Confederate force (numbers vary between 300 and 400 men) under Colonel Joseph C. Porter were traveling south through Monroe County after a raid on Memphis, Missouri, and the Battle of Vassar Hill in Scotland County. At Florida, they were surprised by a detachment of Federal cavalry, approximately fifty men, under Major Henry Clay Caldwell. Despite being vastly outnumbered the Federals engaged Porter's force and a battle ensued for approximately an hour. After suffering six killed, twenty-two wounded, and two captured, Caldwell and his cavalry retreated to Paris, Missouri. Porter, having only one killed and three wounded, also left the area, continuing on toward Callaway County, clashing with Federal forces again on July 24, near Santa Fe, and at the Battle of Moore's Mill on July 28. = Postbellum = Florida in 2016 Florida continued a pattern of slow growth after the Civil War, reaching its peak population of 280 residents in 1880. The 20th century was not nearly so kind to the community, however, especially after World War II, as businesses closed and families moved away to find better opportunities in cities. The construction of Mark Twain Lake in the mid-1960s permanently flooded some of the valuable farmland around Florida, although it opened more opportunities for recreation and tourism. In 1960, the state of Missouri created the Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site. Twain's birthplace was moved into a climate-controlled museum setting, which also contains exhibits and displays such as rare first edition books, a hand-written manuscript of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and furnishings from his home. A red granite monument elsewhere in Florida marks the original site of Twain's birth home. In addition to the Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site, the Crigler Mound Group Archeological Site and Merritt Violette House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Florida is now located along a man-made lake called Mark Twain Lake. The Salt River originally flowed near the bluff on which Florida stands.

The population was 3,116 at the 2010 census. New Madrid is the county seat of New Madrid County. The city is located 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Cairo, Illinois, and north of an exclave of Fulton County, Kentucky, across the Mississippi River. thumbKentucky Bend and surrounding area The town is on the north side of the Kentucky Bend in the Mississippi River, which is also known as \\"New Madrid Bend\\" or \\"Madrid Bend.\\" The river curves in an oxbow around an exclave of Fulton County, Kentucky. Scientists expect the river eventually to cut across the neck of the peninsula and make a more direct channel, leaving the Kentucky territory as an island. New Madrid was the epicenter of the very powerful 1811‚Äì12 New Madrid earthquakes. History New Madrid, Missouri, 1854 New Madrid was founded in about 1778 by Spanish Governor Bernardo de G√°lvez, who was appointed to rule Spanish Louisiana (the land west of the Mississippi River). He welcomed settlers from the United States, but required them to become citizens of Spain. In addition, they had to agree to live under the guidance of his appointed empresario, Colonel William Morgan, an American Revolutionary War veteran from New Jersey. Morgan recruited a number of American families to settle at New Madrid, attracting some 2,000 people to the region.Lynn Morrow, \\"New Madrid and its Hinterland: 1783-1826,\\" Bulletin of the Missouri Historical Society (1980) 36#4 pp 241-250 In 1800, Spain traded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. After trying to regain control of Saint-Domingue (the present Haiti), where a slave rebellion was underway, Napoleon gave up on his North American colonies, agreeing to sell this territory to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The area is noted as the site of a series of more than 1,000 earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, ranging up to approximately magnitude 8, the most powerful non-subduction zone earthquake ever recorded in the United States. New Madrid lies far from any plate boundaries, but it is on the New Madrid Seismic Zone.The series of earthquakes took place in December 1811 and January 1812. They created, among other land features, Reelfoot Lake. See Stewart and Knox, The earthquake that never went away, pp. 17-25. The major earthquake was felt as far away as the East Coast. During the Civil War, the Battle of Island Number Ten took place on the Mississippi River near New Madrid. In the antebellum period, this fertile floodplain area was developed for cotton plantations, based on the labor of enslaved African Americans. They were emancipated after the Civil War and worked to make new lives. As whites struggled to re-establish dominance after the Reconstruction era, they intimidated and attacked blacks under the guise of Jim Crow laws, working to suppress voting and control their activities. Three African-American men are documented as being lynched by whites in New Madrid, the county seat, near the turn of the century: Unknown Negro, on November 29, 1898; Louis Wright, a musician in a minstrel show accused of altercations with whites, hanged on February 17, 1902;\\"A Black Minstrel Lynched in New Madrid, Missouri (1902)\\" , This Cruel War blog, 16 February 2017; accessed 12 April 2018 and unknown Negro, May 30, 1910.\\"Lynching in Missouri\\", Saline County, Missouri/MOGenWeb Project, 1996-2018; accessed 12 April 2018 By the turn of the 20th century, some industry was being developed in New Madrid, which contained two lumber mills, a grist mill, a stave and heading factory, and a cotton gin.

Students attend New Madrid County Central R-I School District in New Madrid. =History= After the founding of the community of Parma, rapid growth led to the formation of a school system. From the late 1890s to 1910, various one room structures in the Parma area were utilized for education. The first structure for strictly school purposes was erected in 1910. By 1935, an increasing student population demanded the need for a larger high school building. With 9.9 square feet per pupil, Amendment No. 3 or The School Bond was placed on the ballot. After a summer of strong campaigning from the school district and other community leaders, Amendment No. 3 passed by a vote of 284-29 on October 19, 1935. Construction commenced in the fall of 1936 and the first classes began in the fall of 1937. The original 1933 gymnasium burned in 1944. Once again, the citizens of Parma banded together to fund construction of a new gymnasium which was completed by fall of 1944. The athletic teams, known as the Parma Pirates, were the pride of the school and surrounding community. In 1980, the Parma Consolidated School District No. 5 was consolidated into the New Madrid County Central R-I School District. Over the next several decades, the school complex fell into a state of disrepair. A major fire in the fall of 2010 brought the entire high school complex to the ground. =2017 Memorial= 2017 Memorial In the summer of 2016, several PHS alumni and former community leaders formed the Parma School Memorial Committee. They were successful in their efforts to raise funds to construct a large monument on the grounds of the old high school building. The memorial was dedicated on July 1, 2017. =Public library= Parma has a lending library, a branch of the New Madrid County Library.

With a population of 11,835 as of the 2010 census, the city is a part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region with an estimated 176,849 (2011) residents. Neosho lies on the western edge of the Ozarks. The name \\"Neosho\\" is generally accepted to be of Native American (most likely Osage) derivation, meaning \\"clear, cold water\\", referring to local freshwater springs. The springs attracted varying cultures of Native American inhabitants for thousands of years. It was also ideal for the later white settlers, who founded the city in 1833., National Park Service It was incorporated as a municipal government in 1878. Nicknamed \\"City of Springs\\", Neosho has long served as an agricultural center and, since 1888, is home of the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest in the National Fish Hatchery System. It is known locally as the \\"Gateway to the Ozarks\\", and since 1957 as \\"the Flower Box City\\". History =Settlement: 1829‚àí1845= Starting in the late 1820s, settlers of English, Scottish, German, Welsh, and Scots-Irish ancestry began moving into the area. The first of these settlers was Lunsford Oliver, who arrived from Tennessee in 1829 and located near Shoal Creek, giving his name to Oliver's Prairie. His nearest neighbors were in Springfield, sixty miles to the east. In 1831 he was joined by Nathaniel Turner, John Smith, Joseph Ross, Campbell Pure, Blake Wilson, Levi Lee, Carmac Ratcliffe, and George McInturf. McInturf built a corn mill, the first mill of any kind in the region. Soon afterward came Mathew H. Ritchie, who founded the town of Newtonia near Oliver's Prairie, and John W. McCord, who settled near Walbridge Spring with Levie Lee and founded the town Neosho to the west. In these years the region was called \\"Six Bulls\\", a colloquialization of \\"six boils\\", referring to the large streams that flowed through the area - Shoal Creek, Center Creek, Indian Creek, Spring River and North Fork. By 1835, at least three schools had been established along Shoal Creek, and a teacher named Billingsley taught near Neosho. The earliest known religious effort dates to 1836, when Methodist Circuit riders visited the area and held meetings in log cabins. In 1843, Rev. Anthony Bewley was appointed to the Neosho and Granby circuit, establishing the first permanent churches in Six Bulls. Rev. John W. McCord was involved in organizing Neosho Presbytery, a Cumberland Presbyterian congregation at New Salem Campground, on May 15, 1837.http://www.cumberland.org/HFCPC/Presby/Neosho1837.htm These early settlers were sometimes visited by the Native Americans who had recently been relocated from Georgia to the Indian Territory, a few miles to the west, and who periodically came into the area on hunting expeditions. Newton County was originally contained in Crawford County and afterward in Barry County. It was separated from the Barry County on December 31, 1838, and established as a county under its present name, given in honor of the often fictionalized American Revolutionary War veteran Sergeant John Newton the fellow of Sergeant William Jasper of Fort Moultrie fame. It then included the present counties of Jasper, McDonald, and Barton, which were successively created from it. The first county court session was held at Reed's residence on April 13, 1839, Judge Foster P. Wright presiding. John Reed, Hugh Shannon, and Jacob Testerman sitting as judges under appointment by Lilburn Boggs the Governor of Missouri. John Reed was made presiding judge, Thomas Mosely, Jr. clerk, John Haskins assessor, and Isaac Gibson sheriff. Townships were established and roads laid out by this body. On November 12, the commissioners reported Neosho as the permanent seat of justice and James Wilson was appointed a special commissioner to lay out the town. The first elected county judges were Edward V. Warren, Larkin Newton, and Samuel V. Warren, and Samuel M. Cooley, with Milton Sexton as clerk in 1840. That same year, Milton Sexton, as superintendent, built the first courthouse, a log structure occupied in March 1841. In 1840, Lemuel B. Hearrell conducted a school on Hickory Creek, which at times numbered forty pupils. In 1841, Charles S. Yancey became circuit judge of the Thirteenth Judicial District, to which Newton County was attached. The first state representative was John Wilson. In 1842, he opened the first school in Neosho and taught Latin and higher mathematics. The Southern Methodist presence in the area dates to 1845. During the 1840s, mining became a part of Neosho when lead was discovered. Neosho's early commercial development was dominated by lead and zinc mining and Newton County established one of Missouri's earliest commercial operations. Lead was transported by wagon from Neosho to Indian Territory, then shipped down the Arkansas River and Mississippi River to New Orleans. =Realignment: 1846‚àí1861= In 1846, a strip wide was detached from northern Newton and attached to southern Jasper County. A survey of the community was undertaken in 1846 by F. M. Duncan, which laid out the courthouse square and surrounding blocks. According to the survey, the town covered an area of about 40 acres and was laid off beginning at the \\"west edge of the large spring and ... northeast of a large white oak\\", which included land originally belonging to John McCord. Part of McCord's relinquished land was returned to him, which he then subdivided because of its proximity to Neosho. This subdivision, later incorporated into the city limits, is still called \\"McCord's Addition to Neosho\\". On August 20, 1847, Neosho was legally incorporated with William C. Jones, Jackson C. McKay, Samuel Rice, William B. Holmes, and William B. Mooney as trustees. A Baptist congregation was organized at Neosho in 1847, with the Rev. W.H. Farmer as pastor, who served until 1859. In 1849, McDonald County was created by an act of the state legislature from the southern portion of Newton County, reducing it to its present dimensions. The same act named John Williams of Taney County, James Williams of Barry County, and Chesley Cannifex of Greene County as commissioners to locate the seat of justice within of the new geographical center of the county and made the temporary seat at the home of John Reed, one and one-half miles east of the present site of downtown Neosho. Later the same year, a log jail was built. The design of the courthouse square followed that of the Shelbyville Square Plan, which has lots arranged to face a central courthouse block. A brick courthouse built in 1850 at a cost of $3,000 replaced the earlier log structure and over the next decade, numerous residential and commercial buildings were constructed in and around the courthouse square. The first newspaper printed in the county was the Neosho Chief, founded in 1854 by J. Webb Graves. It afterward became the Neosho Herald and was removed in 1861 to Arkansas, where the material was captured by the Union Army. By special act passed on August 3, 1854, Congress laid out a monthly Pony Express mail route from Neosho to Albuquerque, New Mexico with an annual budget of $17,000. Although following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, this region had come to be of great commercial and military importance, the line was not a commercial success. In March of the following year, the route was changed to run from Independence to Stockton, California, via Albuquerque. =Civil War: 1861‚àí1865= During the Civil War, the county was occupied alternately by the opposing forces. Several engagements were fought in and around Neosho, Newtonia, and Granby, at some places more than once; frequent skirmishes took place between small units and raids by predatory parties who belonged to no army. The schools were closed during the war and most of the schoolhouses destroyed. The new courthouse was occupied by troops of both armies during the war and finally destroyed circa 1863. After the war, the county records were found intact in a cell in the jail, where they had been concealed by R.W. Ellis, the county clerk, before he left to join the Confederate Army in 1861. On July 3, 1861 the Union force of Col. Franz Sigel moved from Neosho to find and trap Gov Jackson's Missouri State Guard force, reported to be somewhere near Lamar, Missouri. Sigel, believing that another Union force should be chasing them from their Union victory at Boonville on June 17. Col. Sigel knew that Sterling Price and another Confederate Army were south of his position, so he garrisoned Neosho. Captain Conrad and his Rifle Company B of the 3rd Missouri Infantry, numbering about 80 men were selected. When Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch agreed to General Price's request for assistance with the Missouri State Guard, he moved north. Hearing of the Union force at Neosho, they sent four companies of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles and Cpt. Carroll's Company of Arkansas State troops to capture them. On July 5, the garrison sent forces north to Carthage to ascertain the situation, as the Battle of Carthage was ongoing. Col. McIntosh ordered a two pronged advance to Neosho, but the western force found its route longer than expected. McIntosh ordered the surrender of the company of Union troops as his Mounted Infantry companies double quicked within two hundred yards of the court house where the Union force was stationed. With no pickets to the south and a force to the west of town the demand of surrender, they accepted unconditional surrender just as the second force arrived on scene. Captain Conrad's men were paroled on July 8 and were escorted the first four miles for the numerous threats on their lives by Neosho locals. They marched back to Springfield, unarmed, 85 miles in fifty hours. On October 21, Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson and the pro-Southern members of the Missouri General Assembly who had been forced to flee from Jefferson City on the approach of the Union Army, held their next to last legislative session at Neosho. On October 28, 1861, they established a provisional capital in Neosho. Governor Jackson and the Missouri General Assembly met in the Masonic Hall, numbering thirty-nine members of the House and ten of the Senate. They passed an ordinance of secession and the event was celebrated with cannon firing by General Sterling Price's State Guardsmen who were camped in the adjacent hills. The Confederate States government accepted the results of the vote, and Missouri was admitted as the 12th state of the Confederacy. However, the pro- Union members of the General Assembly had already convened, and supported by the occupying Union troops, had declared Jackson removed from office, as well as all who favored the South. The pro-Union members then set up a their own provisional government and appointed Hamilton R. Gamble to be governor. Missouri would have three governors during the course of the Civil War, one elected by the people (Jackson) and two appointed by the pro-Union government (Gamble and William Preble Hall). General Price made an effort to organize a Confederate defense of Missouri and initially succeeded, but any chance for concerted pro-Southern action ended when he was defeated in March 1862 at Pea Ridge. During 1862, various engagements between the hostile forces occurred in the vicinity of Neosho. In 1863, Neosho was garrisoned by Union troops, part of the time with American Indian soldiers occupying the courthouse. On October 4, 1863, a portion of the town was burned by Confederate General Joseph Shelby, who appeared with 1,100 men and, after shelling the courthouse, received the surrender of Union Captain McAfee and his 200 men. Confederate casualties in the fight were seven dead and 22 wounded. No court was held from May 22, 1861 until after the war, when on June 19, 1865, when Tipton O. Wood, Frederick Gallimore, and James R. Pearson sat as a county court with W.I.I. Morrow as clerk and Harvey Conly as sheriff; all were temporarily commissioned by the Governor. In 1866, elections were finally held and order was established. In 1866 a board of education was organized, consisting of Lyman Beebe, J.H. Price Sr., R.V. Keller, E.H. Benham, Hubbard F. Jones and Edwin Ebert. A school site was purchased and the existing building repaired. In 1867, a small two-story building was erected for courthouse purposes and the county officers were provided for there and in private buildings until 1878, when a substantial stone and brick building was completed at a cost of $16,250. In 1887, a jail was built. The first circuit court session was held at the house of Judge John Reed on July 22, 1839, Judge Foster P. Wright presiding. Debate flourishes to this day regarding the legitimacy of these actions, or for that matter those of the Union men who deposed him from office. Claiborne Jackson continued to serve as governor in the Confederate- held portions of the state. But by the end of 1861, Union forces would occupy almost all of Missouri. Jackson took refuge in Arkansas, dying in Little Rock the following year of cancer. A Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas in early 1862 sealed Missouri's fate as a Union border state. =Reconstruction: 1866‚àí1899= Following the Civil War, Neosho became a prominent commercial center of southwest Missouri during the late 19th century. The population of the small community grew in size from approximately 500 to 2,725 between 1870 and 1900. During these decades dozens of brick commercial buildings were built around the central courthouse square containing a wide variety of private businesses including lumber yards, livery stables, general stores, and hotels. In addition to retail shops and stores the city also boasted numerous manufacturing companies such as wagon factories, mills, and even a cigar factory. A new brick courthouse was constructed in 1878 followed by a county jail in 1888. Southern Belle offered passenger service to Neosho until 1969. The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad reached Neosho in 1870. The A& P eventually became the San Francisco and St Louis railroad. In 1878, Neosho was incorporated and the first permanent courthouse was constructed in the center of the town square. In 1887 the Kansas City-Fort Smith and Southern Railroad entered Neosho. The KCFS& S served the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest Federal Fish Hatchery still operating today, which was built the following year. This railroad was eventually sold to the Kansas City Southern Railroad which still operates and runs through Neosho today. In the 1882, after the vineyards of France, Spain, and Portugal were struck by the deadly phylloxera louse, it was determined that grapes bred by Neosho winemaker Hermann Jaeger were resistant to the louse. His work proved to be a savior for the great vineyards of Europe. Working with other scholars and grape growers, Jaeger supplied cuttings from his Monark Springs vineyards to help replant those lost in Europe. For his contribution to the grape and wine industries of France, Jaeger was awarded the coveted French Legion of Honour, the highest award that that nation can bestow on a civilian. By 1898, there were 101 schools in Newton County with 139 teachers and 7,618 pupils. The permanent school fund was $23,260.28. The population of the county in 1900 was 28,001. By the start of the 20th century the city Neosho was a thriving community connected by three rail lines and exporting a variety of products and agricultural produce. The courthouse square continued as Neosho's commercial and governmental center well into the 20th century. Numerous commercial buildings were constructed from 1900 to 1930 including the four-story Haas Building on the north side of the square. The Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad ran from the Arkansas resort town of Eureka Springs to Neosho where it connected with the Frisco and Kansas City Southern tracks in 1908. =20th century= On August 5, 1914 there was a head-on collision between motorcar No. 103 of passenger train of the Missouri & North Arkansas Railroad Company and locomotive No. 805, of a regular passenger train of the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, near Tipton Ford, a few miles north of Neosho. Because Motorcar No. 103 was carrying about 105 gallons of gasoline at the time, 43 passengers died, many burned beyond recognition, several others were injured, and the motorcar was entirely demolished. Two days later the city held a funeral on the Newton County courthouse lawn for more than 30 unidentified individuals, who were buried in a mass grave in the Neosho I.O.O.F. cemetery. Newton County's Art Deco-style courthouse, built in 1936 During the Great Depression, the federal government assisted financially in the construction of the Neosho City Hall and Municipal Auditorium, as well as the current Newton County Courthouse. Funded by the Works Progress Administration, the original courthouse was razed in December 1935 to make way for the current Carthage stone, Art Deco-style courthouse, which was designed by architect Neal C. Davis, a Newton County native. Construction of the new courthouse began in April 1936. In 1938, another Davis-designed, WPA-funded project, the Auditorium and City Hall, was completed. This building was extensively restored and modernized in a multi- million project completed in September 2008. Neosho is the home of Fort Crowder. Originally established as Camp Crowder south of town in 1941 at the height of World War II, the post was to serve as an armored training center. By 1943 the army had acquired in Newton and McDonald counties. As the facility was constructed, it was re-designated as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training center. It was named for Enoch Crowder, a Missouri general who was instrumental in developing the draft for World War I and the Selective Service. The post also served as an infantry replacement center; later in the war, it had a small German prisoner-of-war detention facility. Some of the soldiers stationed at Camp Crowder included Carl Reiner, Dick Van Dyke, Mort Walker, Tillman Franks, and Jean Shepherd. Writers for the 1960s-era The Dick Van Dyke Show, made the post the setting where Rob and Laura Petrie, portrayed by actors Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, met; Rob was a sergeant in Special Services and Laura was a USO dancer. The camp was well known to its residents for being muddy and swampy during the rainy season. The cartoonist Mort Walker, who was stationed there, later used it for his fictional \\"Camp Swampy\\" in his long-running newspaper comic strip, Beetle Bailey. Camp Crowder was deactivated in 1951. While the core of the post was retained, many of the temporary barracks were declared surplus and sold. The base's movie theatre was disassembled and reassembled on the campus of what is today the University of Missouri ‚Äì Kansas City. It served as the Kansas City Playhouse until being torn down for a new theatre. A portion of its wall, which contains statues of Comedy and Tragedy, are landmarks on the university campus. Neosho obtained the permanent barracks as surplus and adapted them as the core of the community college campus for Crowder College. The Flower Box City Since 1957, Neosho has been locally well known as \\"The Flower Box City\\"; that year it earned the All-America City Award for its beautification efforts. In 1955 the town had received a $5,000 grant from the New York Community Trust for that purpose. Local companies provided lumber at cost, and the Jaycees formed an assembly line to build more than 200 wooden flower boxes. Pet Milk Company donated 400 used wooden barrels for container gardens, and town nurseries supplied plants at reduced rates. The city dressed up trash cans and parking meters around the courthouse square with flower baskets. In 1957 Neosho earned a coveted All-America City Award from Look magazine and the National Municipal League. (The Life magazine photojournalist Wallace Kirkland covered the 1957 city for the magazine. A life collection of his photographs from this assignment, many previously unpublished, can be found in the Life photo archive, hosted by Google). Since then, the Flower Box Promotion Committee has supported beautification and awarded 'Beauty Spot' prizes each spring and summer to homes and businesses with outstanding yards, flower gardens, and flower boxes. Fort Crowder In the early 1950s, local congressman Dewey Jackson Short, senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, secured authorization and some funding to build two permanent barracks and a disciplinary barracks to reactivate the former Camp Crowder as a permanent installation, Fort Crowder. Its mission was to be the Army's military police training school. After Short's defeat in the 1956 election, the fort was deactivated. About of the post was turned over to the U. S. Air Force, which constructed Plant 65. The rocket engine manufacturing facility was operated by contract to North American Aviation, later known as Rocketdyne. This facility became Rocketdyne's primary manufacturing and testing complex for the H-1 rocket engine, used by the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets. These rockets were used in NASA's Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project programs until its contract ended in 1968.

This spring issues at the base of a high bluff of Mississippian limestone from a series of cavernous openings developed along a bedding plane, and flows through the city park. Bell's Iron Spring Also known as historically as Walbridge Spring, located east of the Big Spring and a block east of the courthouse square, Bell's Iron Spring played an important role in Neosho's development. Originally rising in the valley and capable of supplying a city of 50,000 people, though hidden from view for many years, this spring is currently the focus of an ongoing restoration project, which includes plans to re-expose the spring and redevelop the surrounding property as a public historic park. Due to the recent discovery of the presence of endangered Ozark cave fish in the spring, the city is working closely with Missouri Department of Conservation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Hatchery springs Hearrell, McMahon, Bartholic, and Elm Springs supply water to the Neosho National Fish Hatchery. In 1888, Hearrell Spring, named after Lemuel B Hearrell, began supplying water to the newly built hatchery. In 1908, McMahon Spring was added to supply the hatchery's fish rearing ponds, after its condemnation under the governmental power of eminent domain. In 1964, after the closing of nearby Fort Crowder, additional water was supplied by Elm Spring and Bartholic Spring. With Hearrell Spring producing nearly the same volume of water as Big Spring, the combined flow of these four springs is about 2,000,000 gallons per day as it arrives at the hatchery.\\"Neosho National Fish Hatchery\\", Department of Natural Resources, Missouri While Hearrell Spring arises at the hatchery, water from the other springs is piped several miles by pipeline from their origins to the hatchery.

This makes for a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa) with moderate precipitation and extremes of hot and cold. Summers can be very humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico, and during July and August daytime highs can reach into the triple digits. Winters vary from mild days to bitterly cold, with lows reaching into the teens below zero a few times a year. Neosho is situated in \\"Tornado Alley\\", a broad region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms. Neosho has had many severe outbreaks of tornadoes, including an EF4 tornado hit the Neosho area on May 10, 2008 and traveled about in two states, as well as a major tornado that caused massive destruction on April 24, 1975 which resulted in three killed and many injured. The region is also prone to ice storms, such as the 2007 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks.

The population was 158 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village of Stella is located 17 miles southeast of Neosho. History The first known settlers of this area arrived in the early 1820s. The area of Stella was previously a fishing community called Springs. In October 1880, the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad sold a portion of what became Stella to Moses Eagle for $200. Moses Eagle's family arrived in the area in 1844. Stella became an incorporated town in 1930. The village was named after Moses Eagle's granddaughter. The water-powered grist mill was built in 1867 by Eagle. The Bank of Stella was established circa 1900. The area's first newspaper, the Amicus Curio, was started in 1901 by a doctor from Kent, Missouri, with the Stella Enterprise and the Stella Weekly Record established after that. The Horner Institute merged with the Stella Academy in 1911 and was located there until moving to Purdy in 1912. The Stella Baptist Church was established in 1886, with the actual church built circa 1911, the Stella Methodist Church circa 1896, while the Stella Church of Christ was established after 1950. The Lentz-Carter Merchandise Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Cardwell Hospital =Clarence C. Cardwell= Despite Stella's small size, for nearly 60 years the Cardwell Hospital, later the Cardwell Memorial Osteopathic Hospital, attracted people from the largely rural surrounding areas of Newton County, Barry County and McDonald County for their healthcare needs. Cardwell Hospital was opened in 1920 by World War I veteran Clarence C. Cardwell, who had been born only two miles outside of Stella in 1892.Newton County Highlights; by Neosho Christian Schools; 2002; Page 75 At first the hospital was only four rooms, but later expanded to meet the needs of the local community. By 1930 a second doctor had joined the staff at Cardwell and it had 10 beds available for patients.Newton County Highlights; by Neosho Christian Schools; 2002; Pages 75 & 76 A fire in 1942 damaged the hospital, but Cardwell quickly had the building rebuilt.Newton County Highlights; by Neosho Christian Schools; 2002; Page 76 Cardwell continued running the hospital with his wife, Ida Cardwell, and their daughter, Cleta Cardwell, until his death in November 1956.Cassville Republican; Obituaries; November 29, 1956 At the time of his death the Cardwell Hospital was reported to have grown to 100 beds. Following Cardwell's death in November 1956, the Cardwell Hospital was closed for a short time, until it was purchased from Ida and Cleta Cardwell by Silas and Lillian Fountain and reopened on February 11, 1957, as the Cardwell Memorial Osteopathic Hospital. The Fountains, a married couple from Sulphur Springs, Arkansas, had both graduated from the Kansas City College of Osteopathy and Surgery.http://www.obitcentral.com/obitsearch/obits/mo/mo-jasper157.htm Their daughter Mary Sue Fountain served as the hospital administrator. Following her husband's death on June 29, 1973, Lillian Fountain continued running the hospital until 1977. Lillian Fountain died on October 13, 1996. =Hospital closure and EPA clean up= The former Cardwell Hospital in Stella, Missouri in 2004, shortly before it was torn down and removed because of asbestos contamination. Cardwell Memorial Osteopathic Hospital closed in 1977, but the building was soon reopened as a residential care facility owned by Don and Vera Littlefield. But this venture proved short lived and the building was vacant by the mid-1980s. After sitting empty for nearly 20 years, the residents of Stella, seeking to revive the town's business district, proposed a plan to convert the empty hospital building into a multipurpose building complex, which would house a clinic, a library, city hall, retail space and residential units. However, due to considerable asbestos contamination at the site, the decision was made to remove the now derelict structure. Because of the nature of the contamination, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the former Cardwell Hospital building a superfund site and assisted the town in removing it.http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha//FormerStellaCardwellHospital/FormerStellaCardwellHospitalLHC052208.pdf In the summer of 2006, the former Cardwell Hospital was torn down and the site was decontaminated, making it safe for other uses.Joplin Globe; Hospital being razed; July 26, 2006 Following the removal of the building, the site was redeveloped as the Stella Veterans Memorial park, which is dedicated to veterans from the Stella area. =Community of doctors= During the years of the Cardwell Hospital, especially during Clarence Cardwell's ownership, the town of Stella is thought to have produced more than 30 doctors and dentists, most of which are believed to have had experience working in the former Cardwell Hospital during their youth.http://genealogytrails.com/mo/mcdonald/history_towns/history_towns_stella.html Geography Stella is located on the northeast side of South Indian Creek, one-half mile north of the Newton-McDonald county line.

The government sent the community $10,000 which was put under the administration of Wren Peve, a local businessman. Mr. Peve kept accurate track of the spending and when all the needs were met it was found that there was a surplus. Peve then wrote a check and sent that surplus back to Washington. The cleanup was under the direction of Landon Wallace; the local Ford salesman and also the Hopkins Fire Chief.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 11,972. Maryville is home to Northwest Missouri State University, Northwest Technical School, and the former home of the Missouri Academy of Science, Mathematics and Computing. Maryville is the second largest city (first is St. Joseph, Missouri) wholly within the boundaries of the 1836 Platte Purchase which expanded Missouri's borders into former Indian Territory in northwest Missouri.  History  Maryville was platted on September 1, 1845. Maryville's name originates from the town's first postmaster, Amos Graham. Graham was one of the original settlers of what would later become downtown Maryville, and the city was named after his wife, Mary.A Biographical History of Nodaway and Atchison Counties Missouri, Compendium on National Biography, The Lewis Publishing Company, 1901. Retrieved September 6, 2009. In addition to his above historical role, Graham was also one of the original Nodaway County Commissioners and served as the first county clerk when the county was formally organized in 1845. Maryville, which is near the geographic center of Nodaway County, was also named the county seat in the same year. The first house in Maryville was built by Jack (John) Saunders, who was a large slave owner. The first courthouse was built in 1846. Formerly, county government affairs would be held in the home of an early settler, I.N. Prather. An updated courthouse was constructed in 1853, the second of only three in the city's history. The current courthouse was built in 1881 with a design by Edmond Jacques Eckel and George R. Mann. Mann would later go on to design the Arkansas State Capitol. The courthouse is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is adorned with a sculpture of a pineapple, the sign of welcome. The original court complex included one of the country's only rotary jails. The jail was torn down in 1984 and replaced with a new structure on the same site. The city was incorporated in 1856, annulled in 1857, reincorporated in 1859, annulled during the Civil War, reincorporated in 1869, disincoporated again in 1869 and finally formally incorporated on July 19, 1869. when the Kansas City, St. Joseph, and Council Bluffs Railroad (later acquired by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad) arrived. The Wabash Railroad arrived in 1879. Both railroads no longer operate in the city and no railroads are operated anywhere in Nodaway County. = Missouri governors = In 1872 Albert P. Morehouse started the Nodaway Democrat, which became the Maryville Daily Forum. Morehouse would become governor. He lived in a house on Vine Street. Coincidentally, the house would later be occupied by Forrest C. Donnell before Donnell became a governor and U.S. Senator. The Forum was a chain-owned newspaper for nearly 100 years and in 2013 it reverted to local ownership by the Cobb Group. In 1889 the Maryville Methodist Seminary opened. In 1891 Elizabeth Howell (who operated Howell Millinery in Maryville) contributed to the development of the Lazy Susan when she received an American patent for \\"certain new and useful Improvements in Self-Waiting Tables\\". Howell's device ran more smoothly and did not permit crumbs to fall into the space between the Lazy Susan and the table. In 1894 Mary Augustine Giesen moved to Maryville and opened St. Francis Hospital. = Kentucky Derby connections = In 1901, the horse Elwood was foaled at Faustiana Farms, owned by Mrs. J.B. Prather, on the west side of Maryville. It won the Kentucky Derby in 1904 and was the first Derby winner to be bred by a woman. Faustiana was located where the Maryville Country Club is today. Mrs. Prather also has connections with the second horse to be owned and bred by a woman to win the Derby ‚Äì Black Gold in 1924, which was the great grandchild of Faustus, the namesake of the Faustiana farm. Elwood and Black Gold are two of 10 Kentucky Derby winners with Nodaway County connections. Trainer Ben A. Jones won the Derby in 1938, 1941, 1944, 1948, 1949 and 1952. His son Jimmy Jones won in 1957 and 1958. They operated a horse farm at Parnell, Missouri until their deaths (although their racing fame is tied to Calumet Farm in Kentucky). Memorabilia from their horse racing days are St. Francis Hospital and at the Nodaway County Historical Society Museum. = Northwest Missouri State University founding = In 1905, Maryville won a contest to get the Fifth District Normal School, which would become Northwest Missouri State University. It offered $58,672 and , including the Methodist Seminary, to the state. The college was on the northwest corner of the city, nearly adjoining the Wabash train station. The most significant structure on the land transferred to the state was the Thomas Gaunt mansion, which is also on the National Register and is the college President's residence. Gaunt owned an extensive nursery on his property, which was on a birch-lined street and is now the Missouri Arboretum. The most recognizable building on the campus today is the Administration Building, designed by John H. Felt. It is on the National Register and resembles Brookings Hall at Washington University, which was the Administration Building of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. = Herbert Hoover connections = In 1928 there was speculation that Maryville would become the \\"Western White House\\" for Herbert Hoover when it was discovered that he owned a farm 15 miles south of town. The farm was actually only 80 acres and he had acquired it after holding the mortgage for his Stanford University Class of 1895 roommate Samuel Wilson Collins. It was Iowa- native Hoover's only farm and Hoover visited it in 1933 after leaving office. He was accompanied by his former Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde. Hoover's vice president Charles Curtis visited Maryville on October 4, 1932 where spoke at the Administration Building after being rained out of a planned appearance at the Courthouse. = Harry Truman connections = Harry S. Truman (along with Bess and Margaret Truman) made the last of several visits to Maryville on August 3, 1962 when he dedicated the current post office. Truman had extensive ties to Maryville. During World War I Truman was a member of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment in the Missouri National Guard, which is headquartered in Maryville. Truman commanded Battery D in the war of the 129th. The 129th official motto is \\"Truman's Own\\" because of the affiliation. During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive during World War I in 1918, Truman prophetically told his troops, \\"\\"Right now, I'm where I want to be ‚Äì in command of this battery. I'd rather be here than president of the United States.\\" Among the original 129th soldiers was Edward V. Condon (1893‚Äì1974) who later operated the Condon Corner Drug Store across the street on the Square after the war. Truman dedicated the 129th's armory on the northwest side of Bearcat Stadium on the college campus on February 20, 1955. The 1955 armory was repurposed as the Jon T. Rickman Electronic Campus Support Center in 2003, when a new armory was built further west of the campus near the Maryville Country Club, which is the site of the original Faustiana Farm complex. Many of Maryville's most active citizens have ties to the 129th, including Leigh Wilson (1881‚Äì1978), who rose to rank of Brigadier General. Wilson, who operated the Wilson Motel in Maryville, as well as the Hitching Post restaurant, was one of the biggest proponents for broadening Maryville's economic base away from the college. Truman's sister Mary Jane Truman, who was active in the Order of Eastern Star, visited Maryville and Nodaway County several times for Eastern Star events before, during and after the Truman presidency. In 1969, Maryville received an All-America City Award. In 1987, the Palms Bar in town began sponsoring the \\"World's Shortest Saint Patrick's Day Parade.\\" The parades, which are less than a block long, have been getting shorter each year as other towns compete for the title. One of the mainstays of events has been a garbage truck driving down the street at the beginning, pouring out buckets of green water as a Maryville homage to the dyeing of the Chicago River green. In 2015, the parade moved from being a block off the square to actually being on the square after it became sponsored by Burny's Sports Bar. In 1994, Mozingo Lake opened east of Maryville. Its Mozingo Lake Golf Course has courses designed by Donald Sechrest and Tom Watson (which opened in 2016). In 1996, the Maryville Treatment Center, a minimum security prison, opened in a renovated Franciscan Sisters of Mary Motherhouse which had been built in 1947 and has a landmark yellow steeple on the bluffs above the One Hundred and Two River on the east side of Maryville. = American football = Maryville became a football powerhouse in 1994 when Mel Tjeerdsma became coach of Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football. The Bearcats played in 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016 NCAA Division II Football Championship games winning in 1998, 1999, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016. The basketball team won another national title in the NCAA Division II Basketball Championship in 2017. In addition the Maryville High School football team appeared in 1996, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 (winning in 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2017, in addition to an earlier championship in 1982) state championship games. The dual championships have earned the town nickname of \\"Title Town.\\" The high school has the unique mascot of \\"Spoofhounds.\\" Both schools have green and white for their school colors. Adam Dorrel, a Maryville High graduate, succeeded his former boss Tjeerdsma when he retired as coach in 2010 and kept up the tradition winning the national titles in 2013, 2015 and 2016. Crime = 1931 lynching = In 1931, a notorious lynching occurred in Maryville when a mob of 2,000 to 4,000 people burned alive African American Raymond Gunn, who was awaiting trial, charged with the attempted rape and killing of a 20-year-old white school teacher, to which he intended to plead not guilty. One woman held her young girl up so the girl could get a better view of the naked man afire. A Maryville policeman directed traffic as Gunn burned. After the fire was out, hundreds of the mob poked around in his ashes for souvenirs, with the pieces of his charred remains and teeth and bone fragments divided among them. While the Sheriff said he knew who had committed the killing, nobody was ever charged. The lynching attracted national attention and was frequently invoked in the unsuccessful campaign to pass the Costigan-Wagner Bill, which would have made it a federal crime for law enforcement officials to refuse to try to prevent a lynching. = 2012 sexual assault = A controversial case arose in 2012 when Matthew Barnett, 17 at the time, was arrested for the rape and sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. A 15-year-old boy was accused of doing the same to the girl‚Äôs 13-year-old friend, and a third boy admitted to recording Barnett's alleged assault on a cellphone. A significant controversy arose in 2013 when the county prosecutor dropped felony and misdemeanor charges against Barnett, grandson of influential former state representative Rex Barnett, and the Nodaway County prosecutor dropped the felony sexual exploitation charge against the third boy.Arnett, Dugan (October 12, 2013). Nightmare in Maryville: Teens‚Äô sexual encounter ignites a firestorm against family, The Kansas City Star The victim was relentlessly bullied and harassed, she first attempted suicide when she was 16 years old.

Hackers Target Town After Dropped Sexual-Assault Case, Time, October 14, 2013 In 2014, a special prosecutor was put in charge to reinvestigate the case. Barnett pleaded guilty to misdemeanor second-degree endangerment of the welfare of a child for leaving her outside her house, and was sentenced by Missouri Circuit Judge Glen Dietrich to four months in jail that were suspended in favor of two years probation. Barnett was sentenced in juvenile court for the assault. The incident is featured in the 2016 Netflix documentary Audrie & Daisy. Daisy Coleman killed herself on August 4th 2020.

The name ultimately chosen was in honor or Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell who was at the peak of influence in creating Irish homerule when Parnell was incorporated. The elder Horace Jones started a ranch on the northeast side of Parnell where he raised Angus cattle and saddle horses. At the ranch Ben (along with his son Horace \\"Jimmy\\") trained a horse named Seth which was in the top 20 of the national thoroughbred sires list from 1925‚Äì28. This in turn got the attention of Herbert M. Woolf, owner of Woolford Farm in Prairie Village, Kansas and Ben trained Lawrin which won the Kentucky Derby in 1938. The two were lured by Warren Wright, Sr. to train horses at Calumet Farm in 1939 where they racked up a record training 7 Kentucky Derby winners (1941, 1944, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1957, 1958) and two Triple Crown winners (Whirlaway and Citation). Ben's record of 6 wins remains a Derby record. He was succeeded by Jimmy as trainer and Jimmy was the trainer of record for the 1957 and 1958 wins although Ben stayed on as Calumet manager until 1961. Jimmy stayed at Calumet until 1964 when he became manager of racing at Monmouth Park.http://www.stfrancismaryville.com/AboutUs/Documents/Jimmy%20Jones%20web.pdf After he retiring in 1976 Jimmy returned to 1,750 acre ranch in Parnell.

The population was 6,168, according to the 2010 Census. History Caruthersville lies in Missouri's Bootheel on the Mississippi River. The word \\"Pemiscot\\" comes from the word meaning \\"liquid mud\\" in the Fox language. Mississippi waters have frequently flooded the flatlands, creating fertile alluvial land valued for farming. Settling the floodplain has resulted in periodic problems for residents, as there are regular floods despite (and because of) elaborate constructed systems of levees and flood controls. Native Americans inhabited the land of the Caruthersville area for thousands of years before European settlement. The Mississippian culture built huge earthwork mounds throughout the Mississippi Valley. One such earthwork remains in this county, rising 270 feet above sea level about four miles southwest of Caruthersville. It stands in contrast to the surrounding delta-like plain. In 1857 John Hardeman Walker and G. W. Bushey laid out and platted the town of Caruthersville. The town was named for Samuel Caruthers, who first represented the area in the US Congress. The City of Caruthersville was incorporated on May 18, 1874. The first few decades of the town's growth can be documented through Sanborn Maps, which recorded building ownership, materials, and use.Sanborn Maps for Missouri: Caruthersville, University of Missouri Digital Library. Accessed 2011-03-14. In 1893, Missouri's General Assembly created the Saint Francis Levee District to construct protection for that part of the Saint Francis River basin lying within the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. This act authorized taxes for the purpose of building, repairing, protecting, and maintaining levees in the district. =20th century to present= White violence against African Americans increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as they were pushing them out of the political system and voting across the South.

Altenburg and the other communities‚ÄîDresden, Frohna, Johannisberg, Paitzdorf, Seelitz, and Wittenberg‚Äîwere all named by settlers for towns in the Saxony region of their native country. These settlers would form the backbone of what would later become the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. Trinity Lutheran Church was established in 1839 in a log cabin, and was later replaced by a limestone, and then a frame church. Soon after arriving, the immigrants constructed a school in Altenburg. Made of native timber, this \\"Log Cabin College\\" introduced the new idea of a co- educational school, a rarity at the time.

The location of the town was determined by two mineral springs, which were highly prized on account of their medicinal qualities, which led to the construction of a bath house by Thomas King in 1883.

The population was 102 at the 2010 census. History Some of the earliest Europeans to put down roots in the area were English and Scotch-Irish Presbyterian settlers from Rowan, Iredell, Cabarrus, and Mecklenburg counties in North Carolina who settled to the south in Brazeau in 1817. Soon after, in 1821, they were followed by English and Scotch-Irish Methodists also hailing from North Carolina, settling in the present area of Longtown. Among the earliest families were the Abernathys, Farrars, and Rutledgers.'Gone But Not Forgotten'-Missouri Pioneers These settlers were part of a large exodus from the Piedmont region of North Carolina following the War of 1812. In 1826 these settlers built their first log meeting house which was replaced with York Chapel Methodist church in 1836. The settlement was initially known as the ‚ÄúAbernathy Settlement‚Äù, although at this point the settlement could not be considered an organized community, as the population lay scattered on farms in the surrounding area. Emil Urban and Oliver Abernathy were the first merchants in the settlement. By 1860 a core community had formed along the King‚Äôs Road (French: Le Chemin du Roi, Spanish: El Camino Real), known today as King‚Äôs Highway, but also known then as the Perryville-Jackson Road. In April 1874 the town had been incorporated as \\"Longtown\\". Two theories abound to the origin of the name. One early explanation gives that the town was named after a German couple that immigrated to the area ‚Äì Johann and Maria Lang (Lang being German for ‚Äòlong‚Äô). The other explanation given is that the town was named after John Long, one of the earlier settlers. The first mayor was Velentine Bergmann.A Directory of Towns, Villages, and Hamlets Past and Present of Perry County, Missouri Compiled by Arthur Paul Moser A post office was established in 1883 (closing in 1966).Missouri Postal History Society Up until 1881 the Protestant German population had been members of the Frieden (Peace) Lutheran Congregation in nearby Friedenberg. However, due to the dirt roads becoming impassable in wet seasons or freezing temperatures in winter, the need for a local church had grown. In 1882, Rev. A.G. Wetzel organized the Cross Congregation Lutheran Church, Ohio Synod, in the school house in Longtown with former members of the Peace Lutheran Congregation of Friedenberg who followed the distinctive teachings of the Ohio Synod. However, the church faced poor prospects because of limited membership. Another Lutheran church - Zion Lutheran Church Missouri Synod - was established in 1897 with Rev. G.D. Hamm acting as the first pastor. The original Zion Lutheran church was built of wood, but by 1912 had been replaced by the present brick church. By 1883, the members of Cross Lutheran church had been asked to leave the schoolhouse as the building belonged to \\"Longtowners\\". Rev. Wetzel moved to a different location, more north-east of Longtown and organized and built the Cross Lutheran Church, Ohio Synod. The small church only existed for 15 years from 1883 to 1898.

The population was 8,225 at the 2010 census. Perryville is the county seat of Perry County. History =18th century= In the 18th century, the area of present-day Perryville was under French and Spanish colonial administration. The region was part of the New Bourbon district (a sub-district of the Ste. Genevieve district) of the Upper Louisiana colony, also known as the Illinois Country. Looking to expand the population, Spanish authorities agreed to allow American Catholics settle in Upper Louisiana. A Maryland Catholic and descendant of Lord Baltimore's Catholic colony, Isidore Moore, along with a number of other Maryland Catholics, who had settled in Marion, Nelson and Washington counties in Kentucky in the 1780s, looked to take up the invitation. Twenty-year-old Isidore Moore scouted both sides of the Illinois Country in 1792, at which time his visit to Kaskaskia had discouraged him, and again in 1797 when he visited St. Louis and the grasslands south of Ste. Genevieve. In 1800, Moore once again scouted the grasslands west of the Mississippi, which he found favorable. This grassland would later become known as \\"The Barrens\\" due to the open grassland with few trees. =19th century= On February 9, 1801, Isidore Moore received a concession from Spanish authorities and returned to Kentucky for his family and other families closely interrelated through marriage: the Tuckers, Haydens, Cissells, Hagans, Laytons, Brewers, and others. Some of these families had already arrived in the winter of 1803-1804 had built cabins to establish settlement rights. It is not clear why or how Perryville came to be selected as the county seat of Perry County, Missouri, but the site was selected by Robert T. Brown, Joseph Tucker, and Thomas Riney, who had been appointed to select the seat of justice for Perry County.State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html On August 7, 1821, Bernard Layton deeded to the commissioners in exchange for one town lot. Fifty-three of the 99 town lots were sold for $1,486.25, which was used to build the first courthouse. The one existing today is actually the third such structure. It was built in 1904 at a cost of $30,000. Perryville and Perry County were named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, Naval hero of the War of 1812.The Centennial History of Perry County Missouri 1821-1921 Committee of Citizens 1921 reprinted by the Perry County Historical Society; Perryville MO: 1984 One of the long time stories concerning early Perryville is that the first store in Perryville, a log structure, was built by Jean Ferdinand Rozier on the north side of the square. This is not true. Rozier had a store in Perryville but not the first. It was on the north side of the square on Lot 57 which was not even owned by anyone before 1829 and Ferdinand Rozier bought the property in 1835. Barnabas Burns had a storehouse on the east side of the square by the late 1820s. Levi Block built his two-story brick building, which is still standing, by 1830.Land Record in County Court House The upper story serves as the first town hall for the small settlement. Perryville was first incorporated in 1837, but records show the incorporation was allowed to lapse. In the early 19th century, Henry Burns built a home on South Spring Street. Later, William P. Faherty bought the house, which is now a museum operated by the Perry County Historical Society. As both merchandisers and consumers grew in sophistication, so did the types of establishments in the county. Built in 1843, the Hoose Hotel, often called the \\"white house\\", was a prominent structure in early commercial days. The Hoose Hotel was located at the site presently occupied by Eagle Bank and Trust Co. and The Total Package and served as a hotel, a brewery and an auction block. In 1856, the town was again incorporated and by 1874 it had its first fire engine. Fourth Class City status was attained in 1879 and the following year Charles A. Weber was elected its first mayor. With the building of the Chester, Perryville and Ste. Genevieve Railway, prosperity came. Largely because of its role as the seat of county government and because of its central location, Perryville began to develop as the major commercial and service center in Perry County. The population jumped from 897 in 1890 to 1275 in 1900. In 1893 the telephone arrived. =20th century= The first horseless carriage, deemed a \\"locomobile\\" by The Perry County Republican newspaper, was reported in Perryville in 1903. The first power plant was built in 1913 to provide Perryville with electric lights. This building is currently being renovated by the Perry Art Alliance. In 1923, the Chamber of Commerce was formed, and Perryville launched its first industrial development offensive by raising $100,000 to build an industrial building in the hope of persuading International Shoe Company in St. Louis to open a Perryville plant. The venture was successful and the opening of the International plant spurred a cycle of growth which included the paving of city streets and a host of new businesses and city services. In 1940, a second International production facility, known as the Kiefner Branch, opened in Perryville. However, in 1964 an economic downturn forced the closing of International's original Magnolia branch plant. The loss of 250 jobs in the Magnolia plant closing heightened interest in a more diverse industrial base. The efforts of the Chamber of Commerce, Perryville Development Corporation, and city officials led to the development of the Perryville Industrial Park and the establishment of an Enterprise Zone. The City of Perryville hired its first City Administrator in 1976. The Perry County Industrial Development Authority was established in 1983. Over time, tenants in the Perryville Industrial Park include TG Missouri Corporation, T-N-T Plastics, Wilkes Integrated Packaging, Falcon Foam, Industrial Foam Products, Perry County Sheltered Workshop and Missouri Corrugated Box. =21st century= Among contemporary manufacturers in Perryville is Gilster-Mary Lee Corporation, with two facilities (a baking mix plant and a breakfast cereal plant).

As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 21,387.2010 United States Census Sedalia is also the location of the Missouri State Fair and the Scott Joplin Ragtime Festival. U.S. Routes 50 and 65 intersect in the city. Toponymy Until the city was incorporated in 1860 as Sedalia, it had existed only \\"on paper\\" from November 30, 1857 to October 16, 1860. According to local lore, the town council changed the name from Sedville to Sedalia in part because \\"towns that end in -ville don't amount to anything.\\" (Lawrence Ditton Sr.). Here is another account: History Indigenous peoples lived along the Missouri River and its tributaries for thousands of years before European contact. Historians believe the entire area around Sedalia was long occupied by the Osage (among historical American Indian tribes). When the land was first settled by European Americans, bands of Shawnee, who had migrated from east of the Mississippi River, lived in the vicinity of Sedalia.Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.5. The area that became the European-American city of Sedalia was founded by General George Rappeen Smith (1804‚Äì1879), who also founded nearby Smithton, Missouri. He filed plans for the official record on November 30, 1857, and gave the area the name Sedville.Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.8. The original plat included the land from today's Missouri Pacific Railroad south to Third Street. The version jointly filed by General Smith and David W. Bouldin on October 16, 1860, displayed the city extending from Clay Street to the north and to Smith Street (today's Third Street) in the south, and from Missouri Street in the west to Washington Street in the east; and, although Smith and Bouldin predicted that the city would grow to the north, it grew in a southern direction.Ihrig, et al., 1960, pp.2, 8. =Railhead= Following a victory for those proposing the \\"ridge route\\" for the railway over those advocating the \\"river route\\", the railway reached Sedalia in January 1861.Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.7. Sedalia's early prosperity was directly related to the railroad industry. Many jobs were associated with men maintaining tracks and operating large and varied machine shops run by both the Missouri Pacific and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad lines. The Missouri-Kansas & Texas Railroad was widely known as the \\"KATY,\\" from its \\"K-T\\" stock exchange code. Sedalia was an important railhead for the massive Texas cattle drive of 1866. It maintained stockyards to receive cattle from drives and shipping through much of the 19th century. For nearly a century, Sedalia's economy was tied to the railroads. By the end of the 19th century, the MK&T; had numerous buildings and a wide variety of workers in the city: the MK&T; shops, stockyards, roundhouse, and the hospital for employees working in the Sedalia Division were among the Katy's properties in Sedalia. After the KATY reduced its operations in the 20th century, its railroad right-of-way through much of Missouri was converted to a 240-mile multi-use trail. The KATY Trail is used by bikers, walkers and horseback riders. This has been the largest new trail developed in the nation among the late 20th-century federal and state \\"Rails to Trails\\" projects. =Civil War= During the Civil War, the U.S. Army had a small garrison in the area, adding to its boomtown atmosphere of accelerated development as merchants and traders attracted to the military business came to the area. In postbellum, two railroads were constructed connecting it to other locations, and Sedalia grew at a rapid pace, with a rough energy of its travelers and cowboys. From 1866 to 1874, it was a railhead terminus for cattle drives, and stockyards occupied a large area. At the same time, the town established schools (racially segregated for white and black children), churches, and other civic amenities. On October 15, 1864, Shelby's Confederate cavalry brigade surrounded the Union post of Sedalia. The post commander, Colonel John D. Crawford, fled. Captain Oscar B. Queen of Company M, 7th Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, surrendered the post shortly thereafter.\\"From Sedalia: It's Late Defence and Capture\\" (Missouri Democrat, October ?, 1864) , History Sites Missouri State Guard Brigadier-General M. Jeff Thompson subsequently paroled the prisoners of war and moved on, leaving Sedalia to itself.Mueller, (2007), pp.85‚Äì86 =Late 19th century= Sedalia in 1869 While the Civil War delayed development of the town in some respects, Sedalia was the terminus of the railroad for three years. Once the war was over, many of the thousands of Union soldiers who had been stationed more or less permanently at Sedalia and recognized its potential, made the choice to migrate there from their former homes in other areas. The population grew rapidly.Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.13. In the late 19th century, Sedalia was well known as a center of vice, especially prostitution, which accompanied its large floating class of railroad workers and commercial travelers. In 1877 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Sedalia the \\"Sodom and Gomorrah of the nineteenth century.\\" Middle- class businessmen made money off illegal prostitution as building owners and lessees; others did business with people in the industry, who banked, used lawyers, etc., in town. Residents were reluctant to raise taxes and services were provided from the fines charged to prostitutes. In the 1870s brothels were distributed throughout the city, but in the 1890s, they became more concentrated above businesses on West Main Street, as the middle class tried to isolate less desirable elements in town.Whites (2004), \\"Ladies of the Evening,\\" pp. 155-157 These establishments also employed musicians, particularly piano players, contributing to a thriving musical culture. It fostered the development of many artists, including the renowned ragtime composer Scott Joplin. =20th and 21st centuries= While the city attracted many commercial travelers and railroad workers, its population of married couples and families also grew. By 1900 its population of more than 15,000 made it the fifth-largest city in the state. The entrepreneurial middle class created more formal separations between its residential areas and those of working class whites and African Americans. During World War II, the military built Sedalia Glider Base in Johnson County to the west. After the war, this facility was transferred to the Strategic Air Command. It was converted to a bomber base, the Whiteman Air Force Base, named after 2nd Lt. George A. Whiteman, an Army Air Corps pilot who was killed during the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After a massive construction program, the base became the center of 150 ICBM silos and administrative offices. These were decommissioned in the 1990s. Sedalia is home to the nation's first sheltered workshop, which opened in 1965. The expansion of the railroad and cattle drives in the late 19th century brought many male laborers to the rough town on the frontier. It sparked the related rise of a notorious \\"red light district,\\" with numerous prostitutes who did business with the men in saloons and brothels, which also featured musical entertainments. As more families settled in the area, they made the culture more stable, creating institutions such as schools and churches. In the late 20th century, structural changes in the railroads meant the loss of many industrial jobs, but the city has held on to a population close to its 1960 peak while developing new bases for the economy. The city is informally known as the \\"Trailer Capital of the Midwest,\\" due to the high number of trailer manufacturers and dealers in the area. Residents have emphasized the colorful history of the town for heritage tourism, and identified many significant historic structures for state and national recognition. Good quality retail and craft items are sold in the historic districts and buildings of the city. =Registered Historic Places= The following Sedalia locations have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\\"Registered Historic Places in Pettis County, MO\\", Wikipedia * Building at 217 West Main Street, former brothel Building at 217 West Main Street NRHP nomination * G and G Veterinary Hospital * William H.

(1960 p. 12)The significance of the description of \\"bona fide population\\" is that \\"from 1861 to 1864 Missouri was under martial law and Sedalia, as a military post, was governed by the post commander. There was no mayor, council or executive or legislative body except the military power\\" (Ihrig et al., 1960 p.12).

Many singers and actors make the annual trip to the fair. Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and other presidents have given speeches on the fairgrounds, though not during the State Fair. In 1974, the Missouri State Fairgrounds was the site of the Ozark Music Festival, one of the largest but least remembered major music festivals of the 1970s. While the plan was for the pop/rock/bluegrass festival's selling about 50,000 tickets, an influx of about 184,000 fans and many rock bands strained the capacity of the fairgrounds and the city. Some estimates put the crowd count at 350,000. It counts as one of the largest music events (Rock Festivals) in history. The festival, hosted by Wolfman Jack, took out a full-page ad in Rolling Stone magazine and attracted people from outside the region. =Film= The 1948 film Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! premiered at Fox Theatres. The premiere was attended by Lon McCallister, Colleen Townsend, Luanne Hogan and Betty Ann Lynn.

In the American television movie The Day After (1983), aired by ABC, Sedalia is destroyed when the Soviet Union attacks the Minuteman II Missile silos around the area. At the time of the movie's release, 150 of the missiles were located in the Sedalia area in underground silos. They had been sited there since activation in early 1964 of the first Minuteman missiles under the control of the 351st Missile Wing located at Whiteman Air Force Base. The release of the movie led to a significant (if belated) increase in local community concern about the missiles. Concern remained high until all the missiles were dismantled between 1992 and 1997 as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and Russia. Minuteman II missile launch Sedalia was featured in two widely seen 1977 films: Heroes, starring Henry Winkler and Harrison Ford; and the made-for-TV movie Scott Joplin, starring Billy Dee Williams.

The population was 630 at the 2010 census. History The town is named for Lt. General Jimmy Doolittle of World War II fame who bombed Tokyo in a daring raid, which helped to turn the tide of the war in the Pacific. The settlement was originally called Centertown because it was halfway between Rolla and Newburg. This name, coined by a local man named Monroe Ramsey, caught on over the years. The town boomed in the spring of 1941 when construction of Fort Leonard Wood, 20 miles away, began in earnest due to the war effort. Thousands of workers poured in and slept anywhere they could. In some places, it was said beds never got cold because different shifts shared occupancy. So the two mile stretch which was unofficially called Centertown grew and boomed and a local businessman, Lou Hargis, felt it was time for an incorporated city. The idea of naming the new city after General Doolittle was well-received, along with the idea of having General Doolittle dedicate the town after the war effort. The original trustees of the town when it was incorporated were Lou Hargis, Mr. Durham (principal of the Newburg High School), Bob Crain (an employee of the Missouri Bureau of Mines, resident of Rolla), and Ike Towell (operator of a local filling station and grocery store). They continued as interim trustees until April 1944 when a general election was held and a mayor and city officials elected. It was those five men who presented themselves at the courthouse \\"to announce the birth of a town and give it a hero's name.\\" In 1946, Lt.

The population was 470 at the 2010 census. History Newburg was founded in 1883 by St. Louis ‚Äì San Francisco Railway as a division point for the railroad, where engines would stop for repairs and to change crews. It is currently used heavily by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad as a maintenance stop, with a large supply of railroad materials along the double tracks.Newburg History Iron working was attempted twice in Newburg. Easy access to the railroad made heavy industry a viable business. Construction of the Ozark Iron Works began after 1867, but the business went bankrupt in 1877. The Knotwell Iron Company attempted to use the facilities in 1880, but quit shortly afterwards due to a severe drop in iron prices. After World War II, the railway switched from coal to diesel engines, which could run much longer distances without refueling. The Newburg stop was closed, removing the roundhouse, turntable, and freight yards. A single \\"Frisco\\" caboose remains near the old freight yards.

The population in the 2010 United States Census was 19,559. Rolla is located approximately midway between St. Louis and Springfield along I-44. The Rolla, Mo Micropolitan Statistical area consists of Phelps County, Missouri. It is the home of the Missouri University of Science and Technology, well known, both nationally and internationally, for its many engineering departments and computer science department. The headquarters of the Mark Twain National Forest is located in Rolla. In addition, this is part of the Ozark Highlands American Viticultural Area, with vineyards established first by Italian immigrants to the area. History The first European-American settlers in Phelps County arrived in the early 19th century, working as farmers and iron workers along the local rivers, such as the Meramec, the Gasconade, and the Little Piney. In 1844, John Webber built the first house in what became the City of Rolla. Nine years later, railroad contractor Edmund Ward Bishop, considered to be the founder of Rolla, settled in the area. The state officially established Rolla as a town in 1858. Two stories account for how Rolla was named. One story, widely regarded as a folk legend, and acknowledged as such by the Phelps County Historical Society, arises from the competition between Rolla and neighboring Dillon, Missouri, to be designated the county seat. When Rolla was made the county seat in 1861, the residents of Dillon, having lost a round, were allowed to choose the name of the new city and named it Rolla, after a good-for-nothing hunting dog. The more widely accepted story came from a citizens' meeting about naming the town. Webber was said to prefer the name Hardscrabble (which was used to describe the soils in the region) and Bishop pushed for the name Phelps Center. George Coppedge, representing new settlers from North Carolina, wanted to name the community after Raleigh. Bishop broke the three-way tie by agreeing with Coppedge as long as the name was spelled properly for the region, Rolla. With numerous settlers from the South, many residents of Rolla leaned toward the Confederacy during the American Civil War and the town was taken by Union forces in June 1861. They built two minor forts ‚Äî Fort Wyman and Fort Dette ‚Äî during their occupation. Rolla was also the location of Camp Glover and Camp Davies. From 1863 to 1865, Rolla was the regimental headquarters of the 5th Missouri State Militia.Hewett, J. (1994). Supplement to the Official records of the Union and Confederate Armies.

The brewery closed in 1919 when Prohibition was signed into law.

Military personnel assigned to training areas on the south end of the post sometimes choose to live in the unincorporated area of Big Piney in Pulaski County, or the northern Texas County communities of Plato and Roby. Seven main school districts are fully or partly within the borders of Pulaski County, not counting two small districts which are mostly within other counties and only have only a few dozen residents within Pulaski County. All seven school districts have a high percentage of Fort Leonard Wood military dependents, and over two-thirds of Waynesville students fall into that category. The cities of Waynesville and St. Robert and the Fort Leonard Wood army installation, along with their surrounding rural areas running east to Devil's Elbow, are served by the Waynesville R-VI School District which is by far the largest in the county. Other districts serving Pulaski County include the Laquey R-V School District, Richland R-IV School District, Swedeborg R-III School District, Crocker R-II School District, and Dixon R-I School District. The Plato R-V School District is in Texas County but serves the southern portion of Pulaski County. Waynesville Schools include Williams Early Childhood Development Center (Pre-K - Kindergarten), Wood Elementary (K-5), Pick Elementary (K-5), East Elementary (K-5), Freedom Elementary (K-5), Waynesville Sixth Grade Center (6th), Waynesville Middle School (7 & 8), and Waynesville High School (9-12).

The major east-west route is 20px Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was 20px U.S. Route 66, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through Devil's Elbow, St. Robert, Waynesville, Buckhorn, and Hazelgreen. Names for U.S. Route 66 vary - at different places, it's called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road. The major north-south routes near Waynesville are: * 20px Route 17 which crosses Interstate 44 at exit 153 at Buckhorn, runs east through Waynesville, turns north to Crocker, and then runs north out of the county to Iberia. South of Interstate 44, Highway 17 hugs the western edge of Fort Leonard Wood, passes near Laquey, and circles south of the post until it runs out of the county and eventually joins Highway 32 in Roby. * 20px Highway T which runs north from Highway 17 at Waynesville to Swedeborg, where it meets and ends at Highway 133 about halfway between Richland and Crocker. Major attractions along U.S. Route 66 include the Old Stagecoach Stop in downtown Waynesville, which is now a museum but began as a tavern and boarding house and is the oldest standing structure in the county. It was used as a Civil War hospital for Union troops who were garrisoned above the city in Fort Wayne, which was demolished after the war.

Notable people * George Caleb Bingham - Missouri's most famous artist, Bingham's family moved to a farm outside of Arrow Rock in 1827. In 1837, Bingham built a brick home in Arrow Rock that is now a National Historic Landmark. Bingham traveled widely, painting hundreds of portraits of prominent citizens, but is most famous for his genre scenes of frontier and river life painted in the 1840s and 1850s. Bingham held positions in Arrow Rock town government and in state government. He retained his home until 1857, when he went abroad to study art in Paris and D√ºsseldorf. From 1860 on, he lived in Independence, then Kansas City, but continued to visit Arrow Rock relatives to the time of his death. * Dr. John Sappington - The first physician in Saline County, Dr. Sappington acquired thousands of acres and settled several miles southwest of Arrow Rock in 1819. AS a wealthy planter, he also wielded considerable political influence in the Democratic Party, although he never held office. He was lifelong friends with Missouri's senior federal senator Thomas Hart Benton His brother-in-law Roger Breathitt was President Andrew Jackson's private secretary. Dr. Sappington experimented with cinchona bark from Peru to treat malarial fever, the scourge of the Missouri and Mississippi valleys. Although he did not how the disease was transmitted, he isolated quinine from cinchona bark from Peru, where it was used as treatment. By 1832, he earned high income by mass-marketing quinine pills. For nearly a century, quinine remained the most effective treatment for malaria. Four of his daughters married two men who became governors of Missouri. (One man married three sisters in succession, as the first two died young). Sappington's grandson by one of these sons-in-law, also became a politician and a Missouri governor. * Claiborne Fox Jackson - Owned stores and warehouses in New Franklin and Arrow Rock by 1831 and was appointed Arrow Rock's first postmaster in 1832. He married three Sappington daughters, Jane, Louisa and Eliza in succession. Jackson aided pro-slavery forces in Bleeding Kansas during the 1850s. Elected governor in 1860, Jackson supported Missouri's secession from the Union in 1861. Forced to flee the state by Union forces, he formed a ‚Äúgovernment-in-exile‚Äù, first in Neosho, Missouri, then in Marshall, Texas. * Meredith Miles Marmaduke - became a Santa Fe trader from 1824 to 1830. He married Lavinia Sappington and settled near Arrow Rock. Marmaduke platted the town of Arrow Rock in 1829 and the county seat of Marshall in 1839. Elected Lt. Governor in 1840, he served as Missouri's eighth governor upon the death of Governor Thomas Reynolds in 1844. Marmaduke was one of the few pro-Union men in Saline County during the Civil War. * John Sappington Marmaduke, the son of Meredith Marmaduke, was born on the family farm outside of Arrow Rock and is Dr. Sappington's grandson. He graduated from West Point in 1857 and served in the Second U.S. Cavalry under Col. Albert Sidney Johnston. When the Civil War broke out, he resigned his commission and enlisted in the Missouri State Guard. After their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Boonville, Marmaduke enlisted in the regular Confederate Army. He rose to the rank of Major-General and became Governor of Missouri in 1884 but died in office. * Henry Hungerford Marmaduke, also the son of Meredith Marmaduke, enlisted in the Confederate Navy and served as a midshipman on the ironclad CSS Virginia (formerly USS Merrimack) and was wounded during the Battle of Hampton Roads, Virginia. By the Civil War's end, he was commanding naval gun emplacements guarding the James River approach to Richmond. After the war he served in the U.S. Consular Service and cataloged Confederate Naval Records for the U.S. Navy. * Vincent Marmaduke, also the son of Meredith Marmaduke, served in Missouri's Constitutional Convention of 1861. He voted against secession from the Union but was arrested in 1863 for refusing to take the loyalty oath. In June he was banished to the South ‚Äúand was put through the lines at Vicksburg.‚Äù He enlisted in the Confederate army and was sent to Europe to purchase arms for the Confederacy. He returned to the United States sometime in the summer of 1864 and became involved in a plot to free Confederate prisoners of war from Camp Douglas and burn Chicago. He was arrested but acquitted by a military tribunal but some of the other conspirators were not as fortunate. * Asa Finley - settled west of Arrow Rock in 1818. In 1822 and 1826, he was elected State Representative from Saline County. In 1824, he became the first judge of Arrow Rock Township. Finley was a close friend and confidant of Dr. Sappington. * John Beauchamp Jones - tended a store in Arrow Rock from 1834 to 1839. In 1840, Jones became the joint proprietor and editor of the Baltimore Sunday Visiter. Late in 1841, Jones became the editor and publisher of the party organ of President John Tyler's administration, the Daily Madisonian, continuing publication after the end of Tyler's presidency in 1845, until the paper went bankrupt later that year. Over the next several years, Jones wrote several popular books including Wild Western Scenes (1841) and The Western Merchant (1849) based on his experiences in Arrow Rock. In 1857, Jones established the Southern Monitor, a Southern-leaning weekly newspaper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to be \\"a Southern Organ in the North.\\" During the Civil War, Jones was the chief clerk in the passport section of the Confederate War Office in Richmond, Virginia. After the war, he edited his war diary for publication, but died before publication. The diary was subsequently published as A Rebel War Clerk's Diary at the Confederate States Capital. The diary provides the only continuous narrative of the inside workings of the Confederate government from the time it was established in Richmond through the end of the war and is considered a major primary source by many historians. * William Becknell - dubbed the ‚ÄúFather of the Santa Fe Trail‚Äù, served as a Missouri Ranger during the War of 1812 and for several years afterwards, managed the Boone's Lick salt works in adjacent Howard County. In Franklin, he organized the first successful trade expedition to Santa Fe in 1821 and in 1822, was the first to use wagons on the trail.

She was a Missouri delegate to Democratic National Conventions throughout the 1960s. Mrs. Hailey was the first woman in Missouri history to hold a cabinet level position, during the administration of Governor John Dalton. She was a founding member of the Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc., and actively promoted the town‚Äôs preservation. History Arrow Rock was the name from a prominent flint-bearing bluff on the Missouri River. The name first appeared on a French map from 1732 as ‚ÄúPierre a Fleche‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúRock of Arrows.‚Äù Edwin James on the 1819 Yellowstone Expedition wrote, \\"Arrow Rock is so called from its having been formerly resorted to by neighboring Indians for the stone used to point their arrows.\\" The two dominant Native American tribes in the area encountered by French traders early in the 18th century were the Missouria and the Osage. The bluff continued to be landmark to explorers and travelers for over 150 years. Lewis and Clark passed by on June 9, 1804 and noted ‚ÄúSeveral small Channels running out of the River below a Bluff [Cliff of rocks called the arrow rock ] & Prairie (Called the Prairie of Arrows)‚Äù In 1808, William Clark passed through the area again on his way to construct Fort Osage noting a ‚ÄúBig Arrow Rock‚Äù and a ‚ÄúLittle Arrow Rock‚Äù just upstream from it. He declared the area would ‚Äúmake a handsome spot for a town.‚Äù During the first half of the 19th century, this region of central Missouri was called \\"Boonslick Country\\" so named for the Boone's salt lick about four miles east of Arrow Rock in adjacent Howard County. The term \\"lick\\" derived from wildlife licking salt from the ground around the briny springs. Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone sons of famed frontiersman Daniel Boone manufactured salt here from 1805-1812, shipping it to St. Louis. Their partners and co-operators James and Jesse Morrison continued the salt business until 1833. Salt boiling continued intermittently until the 1860s. The site of this early frontier industry is now managed as Boone's Lick State Historic Site by the Missouri Division of State Parks. Euro-American settlers arrived in 1810 establishing small settlements several miles to the north and to the south of the Arrow Rock bluff and in the river bottoms on the opposite side of the Missouri River. During the War of 1812, these settlers built small defensive forts as protection from Ioway, Sac & Fox Indians allied to Great Britain. When Fort Osage closed in 1813, the fort's factor (trader) George C. Sibley moved his operation to the Arrow Rock bluff during the winter of 1813 -1814 to carry on trade with the Osage Indians. This helped maintain their loyalty the United States during the war. By 1815, a ferry was established at the site of Arrow Rock. Westbound settlers poured into the area, crossing the Missouri River on the Arrow Rock ferry. Santa Fe trading caravans departing from Franklin began crossing at the ferry in 1821. From 1819 to 1833, the ferry was owned by Judge David Todd, the uncle of Mary Todd Lincoln. Judge William B. Napton noted that 1827 was especially busy year for the ferry as the population of Saline County swelled that year. In 1849 and 1850 the covered wagons of emigrants to California \\"were hardly ever out of sight at Arrow Rock.\\" Napton, Past and Present of Saline County, p. 109 Several Arrow Rock residents continued to be involved in the Santa Fe trade as late as the beginning of the Civil War. The town was founded in June 1829 and originally called ‚ÄúPhiladelphia.‚Äù Some documents refer to it as ‚ÄúNew Philadelphia.‚Äù However, in 1833 the state legislature changed the name because the locale was better known as ‚ÄòArrow Rock‚Äô. Joseph Huston, one of the town commissioners built a two-story brick building in 1834. Due to Arrow Rock's location on the Missouri River and along the Santa Fe Trail travelers undoubtedly asked Huston for overnight accommodations. He began building frame or log additions to the brick building and by 1840 was widely known as a hotel-keeper. The J. Huston Tavern also housed a store and a ballroom used for dances and a meeting hall. As the building passed to other owners, it became known as the Neill House, Scripture House, City Hotel and Old Tavern. The J. Huston Tavern houses the oldest continuously operating restaurant west of the Mississippi and is today operated by the Missouri Division of State Parks in partnership with the Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc. Settlers in the Arrow Rock area were predominantly migrants from the Upper South of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. They brought slaves and southern culture with them. The town developed as a thriving river port, exporting tobacco and hemp from plantations in the region. Hemp was the most important cash crop in Saline County before the Civil War. was made into ropes and bags for baling cotton. Wheat, corn, beef, pork and mules were also shipped from Arrow Rock to supply the cotton districts of the Mississippi delta. The agricultural production of the Boonslick Country depended on slave labor just as cotton production did in the South. This symbiotic relationship led most residents of Arrow Rock and the Boonslick Country to support the South during the Civil War. Saline County and other Missouri counties with a high population of enslaved African Americans later became identified as ‚ÄúLittle Dixie.‚Äù According to historian Dr. Christopher Phillips, Arrow Rock represented a unique blending of western frontier idealism and southern traditions. Arrow Rock's population peaked at 1,000 by 1860. Even as late as 1872, the town was considered one of the busiest river ports between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. During the Civil War there were no major battles in the area, but guerrilla raids and murders disrupted agricultural production and river commerce. Union militia enforced martial law on the town during most of the war. Town government conducted little business in 1861 and 1862 and did not convene at all from 1863 to 1865. The population began to decline after the war and railroads began supplanting steamboat commerce. Arrow Rock failed in its bids to secure a rail line and a bridge across the Missouri River. The rapid post war growth of urban areas such as Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago began drawing away residents with the promise of better jobs. The town was swept by disastrous fires in 1864, 1872 and 1901. By the turn of the 20th century the population had declined to around 300. Prior to the Civil War, Arrow Rock's black residents worked as household or domestic slaves or as laborers at the docks and business warehouses. Many were skilled tradesmen who were rented out by their masters to business contractors. Much of the town's infrastructure such as the massive stone gutters lining Main Street, were built by enslaved African-Americans. Following emancipation in 1865, Arrow Rock's African- American population grew as former plantation slaves moved into town. Gradually they were able to purchase their own homes, mostly on the north side of town. By 1880, 51% of the town's population was African-American. Owing to segregation of the time, they had to develop their own churches, schools and social institutions. The last black resident of the community died in 2009. Arrow Rock's connection with the Santa Fe Trail led to national recognition by the Old Trails Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in 1912. As DAR interest in the community grew, they persuaded the Missouri legislature to purchase and preserve the \\"Old Tavern\\" (J. Huston Tavern) in 1923. Acreage around the Tavern was purchased as a state park. This was the beginning of publicly funded historic preservation in Missouri and one of the first units of the new Missouri State Park system. The park grew to 169 acres about a third of which lies within town boundaries. In 1976 the facilities designation was changed from park to historic site to better reflect its cultural mission. The Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc. formed in 1959 to help preserve historic structures outside the state historic site boundary. They give guided tram tours of town from April though October and work closely with Arrow Rock State Historic in conducting education and interpretive programs about the village. Odd and Interesting Town Ordinances December 23, 1847 Article 6 of Laws for Conducting Town Meetings; \\"It shall be the duty of all members of said Board of Trustees to be present at every meeting, and for failing so to do, shall forfeit and pay the sum of fifty cents, unless excused from said fine, upon a reasonable cause given for said absentee absence.\\"Hamilton, Jean Tyree \\"Records of the Town of Arrow Rock, 1840‚Äì1875\\" Transcribed 1960, copy at Arrow Rock State Historic Site January 1849 ‚ÄúBe it ordained &c; that any one guilty of fighting, or loud and boisterous quarrelling, or engaging in any mob, or making unusual noises, furious or violent riding within the corporation, upon conviction before a magistrate shall be fined in any sum not less than two dollars and fifty cents and not more than twenty dollars.\\" March 28, 1850 \\"It was resolved that Benjamin Hawpe be appointed Captain of Patrol and that William Parks, E. K. Chase & William H. McCowan be and are hereby appointed patrols for the Town of Arrow Rock for six months from date whose duty it shall be to guard the Town and prevent the unlawful meeting of Negroes and see that no Negro is out from home after nine o‚Äôclock at night without a pass and if so found shall be dealt with as the Law directs.\\" September 6, 1858 the Town Board ordained \\"...that any person guilty of firing or setting off fire works, fire crackers or throwing turpentine [lighting then throwing it in the air] and gass balls [explosive carbide] ...shall on conviction be fined not less than one or more than five dollars for each offense.\\" March 10, 1868 \\"Be it ordained from & after this date by the trustees of the corporation of the town of Arrow Rock that all and any Billiard Table within the corporate limits of this town, or within one half a mile of the same shall pay an annual tax of Ten Dollars, tax, the same due semiannually in advance.\\" The board apparently felt their authority extended beyond the corporation limits. June 2, 1871, the Town Board acting on a complaint from Mr. L. D. Lindsey ordered the Constable to suppress the game of croquet because the players \\"frequently indulge in profane and obscene language.\\" The Board has never rescinded the order so modern day residents periodically will get up a game of \\"outlaw croquet\\" in town. April 8, 1872, the Town Board ‚ÄúOrdered that the privy in rear of Levy Bros. Store be declared a nuisance, also D.D. Greens‚Äô Cow-yard.‚Äù Archaeology Archaeologist Dr. Timothy E. Baumann McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of East Tennessee began conducting surveys in 1995 to explore African-American life and culture from the slavery period through emancipation and into the early 20th century. He has led teams in excavating several households, a schoolhouse, a church, and a Masonic Lodge that were part of Arrow Rock's African-American community. Dr. Baumann confirmed that the Masonic Lodge had been built over the site of the Caldwell Pottery Works, the third largest pottery works in Missouri during the 1850s and 1860s. Remains of a beehive kiln, outbuildings and thousands of shards of pottery and testing clay were uncovered. In 2005, the probable site of Sibley's trading house for the Osage was surveyed, although few remains were found due to the temporary nature of the post and subsequent agricultural activities on the grounds. Dr. Baumann continues to serve as a museum consultant for Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc. He has also excavated slave quarters at two neighboring plantation sites, Prairie Park and Oak Grove. Several excavations have been carried out on state historic site property. Archaeologists from the University of Missouri have conducted several surveys and excavations on the grounds identifying the remains of a 19th-century mercantile store, the town's first public school and a livery stable. Larry Grantham and Brant Vollmann former archaeologists with the Missouri Division of State Parks have conducted limited excavations of a small 19th century store and the grounds around the Dr. Mathew W. Hall House and the J. Huston Tavern. Members of the Missouri Archaeological Society surface surveyed several empty town lots in 2016 and found evidence of 19th century businesses and warehouses. No evidence of a permanent Native American village has been located at Arrow Rock. However, evidence indicates the area had been a major manufacturing site for flint points dating back at least 10,000 years. Arts Arrow Rock's tradition in the arts has its roots in the residency of George Caleb Bingham. He began painting portraits of local residents in 1833. His earliest extant portraits are those of Dr. John Sappington and Jane B. Sappington done in 1834. These two portraits along with a second set of portraits of Dr. and Mrs. Sappington he completed in 1844 an 1875 portrait of James M. Piper, several original lithographic prints and Bingham family memorabilia are on display at the Arrow Rock State Historic Site Visitors‚Äô Center Museum. Jane Froman (1907‚Äì1980) was a popular singer and actress during the 1930s through 1950s. She had her own television show in the 1950s and was known for her charitable work with sick children. A native Missourian, she retired to Columbia Missouri. From 1969 through 1972 she did charitable work for a music camp to help children develop musical abilities. Established in the Old Schoolhouse of Arrow Rock, it was named as the Jane Froman Music Center. The center attracted nationally known artists to Arrow Rock for summer concerts and she performed Christmas concerts there.Jane Froman, Missouri's First Lady of Song by Ilene Stone, Univ. of Mo Press, Columbia Mo, 2003 pp.96-100 Although the music center closed in 1972, it gave impetus to development of other artistic venues in town. The Arrow Rock Lyceum Theater was established in 1960 in the abandoned Baptist Church. Missouri's oldest repertory theater, the Lyceum now produces Broadway caliber musicals and plays from June through September with special holiday productions in December. Actors come from as far away as New York and California and audiences are drawn from across Missouri. A 408-seat auditorium was added in 1995 and the old church building itself now serves as the box office and concession area. In 1973, a musical version of Mark Twain's \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was filmed here. The movie, Tom Sawyer, starred Johnny Whitaker as Tom, Jeff East as Huckleberry Finn, Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly, Warren Oates as Muff Potter and Jodie Foster in her third movie role, as Becky Thatcher. Many of the town's buildings and landscapes are recognizable in the film.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070814/ The following year, Jeff East reprised his role in Huckleberry Finn which was partially filmed here. Paul Winfield co-starred as Jim and comedian Harvey Korman as The King.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071634/?ref_=nv_sr_2 On July 4, 2007, the town also celebrated the 35th anniversary of the film. One hundred people participated in a parade and well over 2,000 spectators lined Main Street from the old schoolhouse to Second Street. Johnny Whitaker, Jeff East and Celeste Holm served as parade marshals and shared their fond memories of making the film with the crowd, and renewed acquaintances they had made with local residents during filming. In addition to being the home of the Lyceum Theatre, Arrow Rock continues its tradition of supporting the arts by periodically hosting art and crafts shows and workshops and special concerts throughout the year. The second full weekend of each October the town hosts the Fall Heritage Festival hosting a wide variety of craftspeople, artisans, reenactors and musical entertainment. Parks and public lands Established in 1923, Arrow Rock State Historic Site is administered by the Missouri Division of State Parks. It was one of the first three units to come into the Missouri state park system. The 169 acre site overlooks the Missouri valley and encompasses about one-fourth of the village. The site contains a large visitor center/museum complex, four acre fishing lake, picnic area with a playground, 1 ¬Ω miles of hiking trails and a 48 unit campground with modern amenities. The state historic site is adjacent to the 1,871 acre Jameson Island Unit of the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, administered by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service. Established in 1994 following the disastrous flood of 1993, the wetlands and waterways of the refuge provides critical habitat for endangered species such as pallid and lake sturgeon. The refuge also benefits numerous other wildlife species. The area has seen the resurgence in deer, turkey, beaver and otter populations. Species that were absent such as bobcats, Mississippi kites, bald eagles and pileated woodpeckers have returned in recent years. The refuge has minimal development and offers opportunities for hiking and bird watching. Hunting and fishing are also permitted in accordance with state regulations.

History Sixty-five acres of land for the city of Marshall was donated by Jeremiah O‚ÄôDell, deeded on April 13, 1839. It was named for the United States Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Marshall, when chosen for the county seat. After the first two courthouses in Marshall were lost to fires, the Saline County Courthouse was constructed in January 1882; it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The courthouse is an enduring landmark in the center of the Marshall Square, and a legacy of Nineteenth-Century architecture.http://www.visitmarshallmo.com/play/historical/ The Nicholas- Beazley Airplane Company was an American aircraft manufacturer headquartered in Marshall in the 1920s and 1930s. At its peak, the company produced as many as one aircraft per day. In 1937, production of aircraft ceased, due to economic pressures from the Great Depression. Today, the Nicholas Beazley Aviation Museum is located at the Marshall Airport, with artifacts of interest from aviation history. ConAgra Foods owns the property of the old Nicholas- Beazley Airplane Company factory building, located right off the Marshall square; the factory building was torn down in the summer of 2015 to expand the ConAgra plant.Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company Marshall is rich in music history.

The Municipal Band has been performing for nearly 100 years and usually performs on the Courthouse lawn every Thursday evening during the summer months, filling the town square with music. Marshall is also home to Jim the Wonder Dog. Jim earned his reputation as a 'wonder dog' during the 1930s, puzzling psychologists from both Washington University, St. Louis and University of Missouri in Columbia. Dr. A. J. Durant, director of the School of Veterinary Medicine, tested Jim's abilities in a public demonstration. He concluded that Jim, \\"possessed an occult power that might never come again to a dog in many generations.\\" Jim seemed to have the ability to guess the sex of an unborn baby and answer to orders in many different languages even though his owner, Sam Van Arsdale, only spoke English. Jim the Wonder Dog picked the winner of the Kentucky Derby seven years in a row, and also predicted the Yankees' victory in the 1936 World Series. A joint session of the Missouri Legislature was called in order to witness the talents of Jim. He died March 18, 1937.Jim the Wonder Dog During the Civil War, Marshall was garrisoned by Union Troops. Although Marshall was strategically unimportant, the town was the victim of two Confederate raids and site of the October 13, 1863 Battle of Marshall, the climax of Colonel J. O.

Saline County Courthouse in Marshall  Censorship debate  In October 2006, a resident of Marshall attempted to have the graphic novels Fun Home, by Alison Bechdel, and Blankets, by Craig Thompson, removed from the Marshall Public Library. Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as \\"pornography\\" and expressed concern that they would be read by children. Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in \\"reputable, professional book review journals,\\" and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards \\"the slippery slope of censorship\\". On October 11, 2006, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed Fun Home and Blankets from circulation until the new policy was approved. On March 14, 2007, the board voted to return both Fun Home and Blankets to the library's shelves. Education The Marshall Public School District serves Marshall in K-12 education.

In the spring of 1841, a crude log cabin was built for use as a school near Henry Downing's home and Miss Esther Hathaway was employed as a teacher.A History of Northeast Missouri by Walter Williams. Lewis Publishing Co., Chicago, 1913. pp. 602-604 One of the early names for the unincorporated settlement was Cherry Grove. During the Civil War, on July 1, 1862, a small skirmish took place near Cherry Grove. Cavalry from the second battalion, Eleventh Missouri State Militia, a pro-Union force, engaged a small number of Confederate troops under Colonel Joseph C. Porter. Porter's outnumbered forces were defeated, with four killed and several men and horses captured. The Union forces had one man badly injured, who would die a few days later. At the time of the skirmish, Porter was heavily involved in recruiting men in northeast Missouri for the Confederate cause. The following month, he would suffer a larger defeat some twenty-five miles southwest at the Battle of Kirksville.

Education Chaffee R-II School District operates one elementary school and Chaffee Jr.-Sr. High School. The town has a lending library, the Chaffee Public Library. Economy For many years, the town's economy was centered on textile manufacturing. Because large amounts of cotton are produced by southeast Missouri farmers, and owing to the town's location near the Mississippi River, it made sense to process the cotton locally. However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the town's economy was devastated by factory closings. The Columbia Sportswear factory and the Florsheim Shoe Company announced that they were idling their plants and laying off workers. Nearly 450 jobs were lost in a period of six months. This was compounded by the closure of previous factories such as the Thorngate Clothing Company, which idled its plant in 1996. Out of a population of just 3000 people, this amounted to losing over 60% of the town's employment base.

The population was 67 at the 2010 census. History In 1788, the present site of Commerce was first occupied by French settlers, making Commerce apparently the third-oldest present site settlement in Missouri after St Louis and St. Charles. A trading post established in 1803 served as the center of commerce for the region, hence the name of the settlement. In 1823, the circuit court ordered a board of commissioners to be appointed to lay out lots here. From 1864 to 1878, Commerce was the county seat of Scott County. Commerce was one of the few areas in Scott County to have uninterrupted mail service during the Civil War, as guerilla bands made delivery unsafe for the northern carriers. Commerce, along with the German settlement of New Hamburg, were the two enclaves of Union sympathizers in Scott County during the war. On November 1, 1861, Colonel Oglesby landed in Commerce with about 3,000 men, where his soldiers soon exchanged shots with M. Jeff Thompson. On December 29, 1861, Thompson raided Commerce. On February 21, 1862, General Pope landed here with 140 troops, but when he left a week later his force consisted of 26,153 men. The island in front of Commerce was known as Cat Island at least as early as Mark Twain's time; however, it has been absorbed by Powers Island to the south.

The population was 122 at the 2010 census. History Bethel was founded as a Bible communist utopian colony in 1844 by Dr William Keil (1811‚Äì1877), a Prussian- born preacher. He and his followers, who were almost exclusively German immigrants to America, believed that the Book of Acts required that Christians hold all property and means of production in common and they organized their Colony accordingly. Traditionally male work was communally performed; however, traditionally female work was still individualized and performed in single family households. By 1850, the Bethel Colony had a population of 500; by 1860, 600. It owned thousands of sheep, cattle and horses, and had over 3,500 acres under cultivation. It was the commercial center of the region. However, the construction of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad threatened Dr. Keil's theocracy. In 1855, he led his some of his followers westward over the Oregon Trail, to eventually settle Aurora, Oregon and form the Aurora Colony.Aurora, The Oregon Encyclopedia Other wagon trains followed in subsequent years. The remainder of the Bethel Colony retained their communal ownership of property and shared means of production until three years after his death in 1877. In 1880, the property was divided among the remaining members, thus ending Missouri's most successful communal experiment. The Bethel Historic District, bounded by Liberty, King, 1st, and 4th Streets, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. At least twenty of the buildings constructed by the Bethel Colony are still extant. These houses are on exhibit to visitors and to the public.

The population was 947 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of St. Clair County. During the American Civil War, Osceola was the site of the Sacking of Osceola. History Located on the Osage River, the land that became the town of Osceola was inhabited by the tribe of Osage Native Americans, also known as NiuKonska, Native Americans who gave the river its name. NiuKonska means \\"Little Ones of the Middle Waters\\". Two treaties, in 1808 and 1825, signed by the Osage and the U.S. government gave up all the tribe's land in Missouri. With the way cleared for non-native settlers, more people began to arrive in the St. Clair County area in the mid-1830s. The town was the site of the September 1861 Sacking of Osceola by Jayhawkers (anti-slavery patrols) in which the town was burned and its courthouse looted. The event inspired the 1976 Clint Eastwood film The Outlaw Josey Wales. Prior to the attack the town had a population of around 2,500. However, fewer than 200 residents remained after the event and the population has never again approached those numbers. In September 2011, on the 150th anniversary of the Sacking of Osceola, the Osceola Board of Aldermen passed a resolution asking the University of Kansas to no longer to use \\"Jayhawk\\" as its mascot and nickname. Further, the resolution asks Missouri residents to stop spelling Kansas or \\"KU\\" with a capital letter because \\"neither is a proper name or a proper place\\".

The population was 1,546 at the 2010 census. History Bismarck, situated in the western part of St. Francois County, owes its origin and early growth to the farming interests about it and its location at the intersection of the Belmont branch with the main line of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. Bismarck was first laid out and platted in 1868. It was named after the Iron Chancellor of Germany, Prince Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck, as there was a strong desire to attract German immigrants to the growing railroad area. The railroad ran through the town from the northwest to the southeast. All of the original streets of Bismarck, with the exception of Main and Center, were named after trees. In 1877, Bismarck was incorporated as a town by the County Court and the first trustees were William H. Gullivan, Benjamin Schoch, C. C. Grider, George H. Kelly and A. H. Tegmeyer. In the year 1881, this incorporation was abolished. Since that time, Bismarck has been reincorporated. According to folklorist Margot Ford McMillen the name of the town caused some difficult times for residents following America's entry into World War I. With patriotism running high, a town named for a famous German leader was seen as \\"un-American\\", and prompted some citizens to advocate changing the name to \\"Loyal\\". However the majority of residents soundly rejected the idea. The population about 1910 was 848. It is now 1,579.

The population was 8,759 at the 2010 census. History The city was formed in an unusual four-way merger that took place in January 1994, in which the cities of Flat River, Elvins, Esther and the village of Rivermines joined to form the new city of Park Hills. The formerly incorporated village of Fairview Acres had previously merged with Flat River on November 8, 1983. The name of the new city was selected by entries submitted to a committee made up of citizens of the four cities. The name Park Hills was submitted by Mildred Lee, a lifelong resident and a former teacher of Flat River. The inspiration came from its hilly terrain in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains and the many parks that surround the area. Park Hills is located six miles east of Irondale and 13 miles east of Belgrade. It is adjacent to St. Joe State Park, and nearby the state parks of St. Francois, Hawn, Elephant Rocks, Johnson's Shut-Ins, Taum Sauk Mountain, and Washington. Park Hills is home to Mineral Area College, formerly known as Flat River Junior College. The town is located in the Old Lead Belt, formerly a large lead mining district.

History  = The 19th century =  The early settlers  In 1803 the United States of America negotiated the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France. At that time the western boundary of the United States was the Mississippi River. However, even at that early date there were many Americans who were residents of the Louisiana Country, a vast, roughly triangular-shaped area which extended from New Orleans to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. St. Louis was already a thriving river city. The Chouteaus, the Lacledes, and other early settlers had already established a profitable fur trade with the Indians who roamed the rich fur country along the Missouri River. Many of the early settlers around St. Louis had already been granted vast areas of land by the Spanish king, who ruled this section of North America through an appointed governor who had his headquarters in the city of New Orleans. One of the men who had gained one of these grants from the Spanish king was a Frenchman by the name of Gregoire Sarpy. Sarpy had a tract of about located just southwest of St. Louis in a section known as Carondelet (named after a Governor-General of New Orleans). Sarpy was a partner of another Frenchman, Chouteau, in a very profitable fur trade business. The tract of land that Sarpy owned extended from what is now the city of Webster Groves to a stream the Spaniards called Rio de los Padres and the French called Riviere des Peres (\\"River of the Fathers\\") after the early Jesuit missionaries who had a settlement at its mouth. During the 1820s a Scotsman by the name of Kenneth MacKenzie had immigrated to America, made quite a fortune in the fur trade, and decided to settle down to the life of a farmer. He purchased from Gregoire Sarpy a tract of about , the eastern half of the Sarpy lands, and established a great plantation. MacKenzie's property included all the land between what is now Hazel Avenue to the north, Gravois Road to the south, Laclede Station Road to the west, and River des Peres to the east. This is much of what is Affton today and explains how part of Shrewsbury came to be included in the Affton School District.  MacKenzie lands divided  In 1842 MacKenzie had his lands surveyed and divided into tracts which he put up for sale. During the period from 1835 to 1870 there was much political disturbance in western Europe, particularly Germany, and many of the German immigrants came to this section of St. Louis County to live. Many of the contributors to this story have in their possession the documents, signed by Kenneth MacKenzie, which deeded the 40-acre tracts to their ancestors.  Oakland House  A large tract of this ground was sold in the 1850s to Louis Auguste Benoist, a successful St. Louis banker. He purchased and established a huge plantation which he called \\"Oakland\\". In the spring of 1853, Benoist commissioned George Ingham Barnett, the first European-trained designer in St. Louis, to fashion his country mansion. Barnett was born in Nottingham, England, and studied in London. He came to America in 1839 at the age of 24, and after apprenticing in New York for a short time, he journeyed to St. Louis to establish a practice of his own. Barnett's 50 years of architectural accomplishments would later include the Southern and Lindell hotels, the water tower on North Grand, the Governor's Mansion in Jefferson City, many lavish houses in Lafayette Square, and #7 Vandeventer Place, a body of work that led him to be called \\"the dean of Western architects\\". Benoist built a large mansion, barns, slave quarters, cottages, smokehouses, and springhouses. About one-third of the original Benoist estate now comprises the Lakewood Park Cemetery and is one of the most interesting and historical areas in Affton. The mansion, Oakland House, was purchased by the Affton Historical Society in 1976 and underwent extensive restoration. It is a showplace in the Affton community and is included in the National Register of Historic Places.  Henry A. W. Wagener home  The Henry A. W. Wagener home at 9935 MacKenzie is one that has seen a lot of history and change. The trim, well-kept home that one sees today is really much older than it appears. Wagener's mother, Anna Rothenbuecher Wagener, lived in that home as a child. The home was built in 1843, and underneath its present covering is the original log cabin.  Ulysses S. Grant's cabin  Perhaps the most treasured landmark of the community is Grant's log cabin which now stands in the Busch estate on Gravois Road. The cabin was originally built in 1848 by Ulysses S. Grant on an tract given to him by his father-in- law, Col. Frederick Dent. This tract of ground is just west of the area where Laclede Station and Rock Hill intersect. The cabin was built in the general vicinity of what is now the St. Paul Cemetery entrance. In 1890, the old Grant Cabin was moved from the farm to Old Orchard (near Webster Groves) where Justin E. Joy, a real estate dealer, used to attract attention to a subdivision he was promoting. The cabin was next used in the World Fair Grounds in St. Louis in 1904 to advertise a special brand of coffee. The cabin was finally brought back to Affton when August Anheuser Busch, Sr. obtained it and located it on the present site on Gravois Road. Busch restored it to its original condition and today the cabin remains a point of great interest.  Ten Mile House  According to Charles Scheidt, who lived in Affton from 1882 until he died, the old Affton he remembered was an area of truck gardens. He told of the farmers starting out before dawn to take their produce to the market in horse-drawn wagons. One of the principal markets for the farmers of this area was located in St. Louis, at the wide V where Gravois meets Grand Avenue. There, twice a week, Tuesdays and Saturdays, the farmers would back their wagons to the curb for the day and sell the produce of their fields direct to the residents of South St. Louis who would walk there to do their buying. Other farmers would continue on down Gravois to the old French Market, Soulard or Biddle Markets. One of the last truck gardens was that of George and Marie Sanders. They were located on S Laclede Station Rd. at the current location of Gotsch Intermediate School 8348 S. Laclede Station RD. In the 1950s and early 1960s George worked his land with two mules. The Sanders were well known for the fresh and mostly home grown vegetables and hot house plants sold through their little market located on their property. George trucked the excess to the Soulard Market. The \\"Ten Mile House\\" which had been located at Gravois and Tesson Ferry was a well-known landmark. The name itself had much significance. In the days of the horse and carriage, there were not many road markers as we know them today. Instead, travelers were guided by different buildings along the way. They devised the scale that any building one mile (1.6 km) from the Court House in St. Louis (now the Gateway Arch National Park) would be called the \\"One Mile House\\", meaning one mile (1.6 km) from the Court House. Thus you will still find today a \\"Ten Mile House\\" or an \\"Eleven Mile House\\" by going out the older by-ways such as Manchester or Gravois. The building at Gravois and Tesson Ferry was the building out Gravois Road from the courthouse. The building was originally built by the Detjen family and called Detjen Grove. The original building has been replaced by a mostly empty building that currently houses National Check Cashier.  Johann Aff  Johann Aff began a general store at the \\"Ten Mile House\\" in 1872. Besides owning a truck garden and operating the general store, he also served as the first postmaster of the area. Thus it was that for mailing purposes the area began being referred to as Aff's town and eventually Affton. Johann Aff is buried near Affton, just inside the St. Louis city limits. The story of early Affton would certainly be incomplete without mention of another post office in the area, that of Nursery, Missouri. The Weber Nursery, located approximately on what is now Coral Drive, in the Gravois Gardens subdivision, is described in early history books as one of the most complete nurseries west of the Mississippi River. The nursery did such a tremendous mail-order business that it had its own post office; thus the name Nursery, Mo. Although Affton is generally thought of as a German community, a large settlement of English families made their home here. In fact, the oldest church in Affton is the Episcopal Church, built in 1882. The group met first in the McKenzie School building. In 1882 the congregation built the frame church costing $1,200 on the corner of New Hampshire and Aliceton. The Affton as it was known prior to 1900 is described as having been a good place to live, quiet and beautiful. In the 1890s there was still much timber and game was plentiful. Most of the residents still spoke German, and a stranger coming down MacKenzie Road would attract much attention, but the people of Affton were always friendly.  Gravois Road  The turn of the 20th century found the little community \\"out by the Gravois\\" developing all the signs of a little town. The further development can be traced to the prominence of Gravois Road. The earliest recorded data on Gravois Road is dated 1804, according to Mr. B. Cordell Stevens, a resident of Clayton and president of the St. Louis Historical Society. On an old map this principal thoroughfare of Affton is described as the \\"Road that led to the Salt Spring of Clamorgan in a wagon.\\" James Clamorgan was the name of an early Irish settler who came to Jefferson County and built a home south and east of what is now Fenton. The words \\"Salt Spring\\" refer to the saline spring, common in that region, located near this early homesite. That early trail bore little resemblance to Gravois Road of today. In fact very few, if any, of the original roads in St. Louis County can be recognized as the early trails and turnpikes laid out and traveled by the pioneers who settled this region and picked from the solid wilderness a few traffic routes which later developed into highways and boulevards. In most cases our modern highways, built to meet the needs of fast motor transportation, do not follow exactly the earlier routes which were determined largely by accommodation to the natural terrain. Modern road-building machinery and materials have solved many of the problems with which the early settlers were unable to cope. However, this early \\"big road\\" (it could accommodate a wagon) rapidly became a much-used thoroughfare. This is attested to by the fact that on December 20, 1804, a John Boli was granted a license to operate a ferry across the Meramec River two miles (3 km) below what is now the site of Fenton. Plans for rerouting began with a petition, dated May 23, 1818, addressed to the Circuit Court, asking for a road from Reaszin Sappington's mill to the mill belonging to Wilson P. Hunt whose property was located on the River des Peres. From this point the road was to proceed to the town of St. Louis. Of special interest are the names of some of the signatories of this petition: Wilson Hunt, Theodore Hunt, Joseph Wells, John Sappington, Wm. L. Long, August Chouteau, Antoine Soulard, Bernard Pratte, Sylvester Labadie and many other pioneers around whom the history of St. Louis and St. Louis County is written. Fourteen years later (1832) this \\"Road to Fenton\\" was established and declared a public road. (It was a common practice at that time for individuals to be granted the right to charge a \\"toll\\" on vehicles using a road if these individuals would maintain and keep in repair the roadway near their homes. This practice was common in Western Europe, and the idea was brought over by our early settlers.) According to the records, this new road began at the \\"Three-Mile Post\\", where Gravois Avenue now intersects Arsenal Street. By an act of the Missouri State Legislature, passed February 11, 1839, Gravois Road became a state road. All the roads of those days were of dirt corduroy (logs laid side by side), or of planks, which made for the smoothest riding. In 1845, the Missouri Assembly appropriated a sum not to exceed $7,000 to be apportioned to each township along the route for the macadamizing (a mixture of gravel and tar, a new type of road surface developed by John Loudon McAdam in Scotland) of Gravois Road within the limits of each township. The use of the name of Gravois Road came into being about this time. The name \\"Gravois\\" came from the combination of French words meaning \\"gravelly creek\\", referring to the small gravelly creek that runs through the area. In 1847, the General Assembly authorized the County Court to borrow $50,000 to macadamize all of Gravois Road. However, the general practice in road building until the Civil War period continued to be the \\"plank\\" type of roadway. In some ways this type of road was superior to the newly developed macadam surface, which was of rather soft construction (the steamroller had not yet been invented), the hope being that travel would tramp the gravel and tar to a hard surface. However, the carriage wheels would cut deep ruts into the roadway, and there soon appeared to one side of the right- of-way what in those days was referred to as a \\"summer road\\", a dirt road which was passable only in the summer months. Gravois Road was the first road in the county to be treated with a concrete surface. The experiment was made over a length, extending from the St. Louis city limits at Gardenville, to Grant's Farm, then owned by the late August A. Busch who paid half the cost of construction. The concrete roadway, wide, was laid in 1914. All work was done with horse-drawn equipment. Except for the state-regulated Gravois Road, all the local county roads used the \\"toll-gate\\" system. We have already seen that earlier roads were maintained by the farm residents along the route for the privilege of collecting money from those traveling along the road. To enforce payment, a log, on a pivot, was swung across the road to prevent passage until the toll was collected. However, such a practice was so distasteful to travelers that as the roads became used more and more, pressure was exerted on the county governments to maintain these roads at county (tax) expense. In 1868, a county order was announced that the \\"toll gates on the St. Charles Road, and all those roads designated as county roads, be removed as far as the county line, as their location constituted an injustice to countians.\\" Other roads began to take on the names we know them by today. Tesson Ferry got its name from a settler named Tesson who operated a ferry on the Meramec River. Rock Hill Road received its name from a quarry in a \\"rock-hill\\". MacKenzie of course was taken from the first subdivider when he had his land divided and sold in 40 acre (162,000 m¬≤) tracts. Weber Road was the road going between the Weber Nursery Office and nursery grounds. After MacKenzie Road was paved in 1939 other subdivisions came into being, and the streets often took the names of the farmers who had sold the tract of land. Thus the names of early settlers have become permanent landmarkers: Darlow, Shepperd, Neier, Vasel, Stafford, and Ashwell, to mention only a few. As Gravois Road became more traveled, more settlers came into the area of rich truck farms, and the need for more local businesses was evident. About 1915 Affton had several small businesses, according to Kenneth Keller who has done quite a bit of research on early Affton. Tony Bauer operated a blacksmith shop on the northeast corner of Gravois Road and the Frisco Railroad tracks. August Mehl operated another smithy near Consul Avenue. Affton had three groceries, belonging to the Hummelsheims, the Schneebergers, and Wohlschlaegers. In the Wohlschlaeger's Store was located the second U.S. post office in Affton. Meyer's meat market was also a favorite source of food. Affton also claimed a feed store at the corner of New Hampshire and Gravois (the old building was torn down just a few years ago). A telegraph exchange was operated by Louis J. Keller on Gravois Road between Brenda and MacKenzie. Affton also had a lumber yard, a dry goods and a hardware store, a coalyard, and even an ice cream parlor. By 1915 Affton also claimed more churches: Eden Evangelical, Salem Lutheran, and St. George's Roman Catholic Church. Church services at Eden were conducted regularly in German and only occasionally in English. = Affton today = As recently as 1931 Affton had only about 800 people. There were many small stores and the community was developing, but the Affton area still claimed a very small number of people, mostly truck farmers. With the paving of more streets by the county, subdivision after subdivision began to replace the truck farms. With the development of a more urban population there came the desire for an urban type of government. In the early 1930s there developed a movement to incorporate the area. As a result of the recognized need, Affton became incorporated as a village and employed a policeman and an assistant. However, the little city was doomed almost before it got started due to its inability to meet the financial responsibilities attached to the maintenance of police, court, sanitation and the other agencies of government. Thus, in 1935 the people of Affton voted to disincorporate, and the area has remained without a local government ever since. Small areas within Affton have incorporated since for the purpose of protecting their own immediate sections. The greater part of Affton remains under the direct supervision of St. Louis County. In spite of the failure to meet the needs of incorporation, the citizens recognized the need for community action for fire protection. The Affton Civic League and the Westbrook Fire Protective Association joined forces to canvass the area to raise the necessary funds for fire protection. Through carnivals, dances and subscriptions the group was able to raise enough money to organize and maintain the Affton Fire Association. In April 1946 the people of Affton took a further step when they elected to establish a fire protective district as set forth under the laws of Missouri. Thanks to the work of this small but dedicated group who recognized the need and worked toward its realization, we today have the fine Affton Fire District. With the disappearance of the farms, the growth of the Affton area since 1945 is hard for anyone to visualize. It has just sprung up all over. Now in the 21st century most of the few remaining farms and landmarks of the Affton of yesteryear have disappeared. The ice cream cone that once stood in front of Velvet Freeze at Weber and Gravois was restored by the Affton Fire Department and now stands in front of Mesnier Primary School. But even though the visible signs of their existence may be gone, the standard and habits they have set for us and for those of the future will shine to keep Affton the community we have all grown to love. The Federhofer's Bakery sign and the Phil's BBQ sign are both recognized by St. Louis County as historic signs. Since 1998, when fa√ßade improvement money was available to businesses to make improvements with the money spent by the business being matched with grant money, many businesses along Gravois have made improvements such as the recent remodeling of the local library. In 2003 Commerce Bank built a new building, and in 2004 there was a noticeable increase in new buildings, as Pioneer Bank and Kenrick's Meat & Catering both put up new buildings. With a TIF (tax increment financing), renovations were started in Grasso Plaza with a St. Louis Bread Company opening in September and a Walgreens to open at year end. With a $1 million donation by Bill and Nancy Thompson, graduates of the Affton School District, a new Commons Building was added next to the existing cafeteria, and through wise investing of the funds from a previous tax increase, the school district was able to renovate the athletic fields and add lights to the football field, giving the community a place to meet on Friday nights. Residents are able to use the field when the school is not using it. After 9/11, the residents voted a tax increase for the Affton Fire District so they could build two new buildings, and they were completed in 2004. Education The Bayless School District, Lutheran High School South, Affton School District, and Holy Cross Academy (St. John Paul II campus) are all found in the area known as Affton.

The Berkeley School District opened in 1937 after a dispute over where a school for black people should be located, with the black residents of southern Kinloch and the white residents of northern Kinloch opposing each other. The newly formed school district, mostly white, took over Kinloch High School, which had opened during that year; previously a part of the Kinloch School District, the high school was renamed Berkeley High School. The high school, located in what is now Berkeley, was exclusively for white students. At a later point a new Berkeley High School campus opened in a new location, and the former Berkeley High School became Berkeley Middle School. On June 7, 1975, a U.S. district court ordered the Ferguson-Florissant School District to annex the Berkeley School District and the Kinloch School District; therefore the Ferguson-Florissant district began to serve Berkeley. In December 2003 the former Berkeley High School closed due to expansion of Lambert-St. Louis Airport. In January 2004 McCluer South- Berkeley High School opened.Bosenbecker, Ray.

Family controversy In May 2006, the Black Jack city government made a controversial decision to remove an unmarried couple and their children from their own home on the grounds that the couple was not related enough to each other to satisfy a municipal ordinance. For the purpose of obtaining an occupancy permit, Black Jack defined a family as: * An individual; or * Two (2) or more persons related by blood, marriage or adoption; or * A group of not more than three (3) persons who need not be related by blood, marriage or adoption. Therefore, an unmarried couple with one child would qualify as a family, whereas an unmarried couple with multiple children would not. On August 10, 2006, the ACLU of Eastern Missouri filed a lawsuit against the city, claiming violation of due process and equal protection, and violation of housing laws. On August 15 the Black Jack city council unanimously passed a resolution changing the definition of family to include an unmarried couple and their children.ACLU of Eastern Missouri, Press Release , Complaint to city (PDF), and Petition to court (PDF) References External links * City of Black Jack official website Category:Cities in St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Cities in Missouri ","title":"Black Jack, Missouri"},{"id":"123169","text":"Breckenridge Hills is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States.

History The area that is Brentwood consists of three land purchases: that of Louis J. Bompart who acquired his lot first in 1804, that of the Gay family, and that of the Marshall family. In the 1870s, a man by the name of Thomas Madden arrived and soon became the businessman of the community. He operated a rock quarry, and constructed a tavern, a barbershop, a grocery store, and a blacksmith shop. Due to Madden's prominence in the community, the town was then named Maddenville. With a location on the Manchester Trail, a route that was mostly frequented by mail coaches and prairie schooners going west, Maddenville in the 1800s became a prosperous town on the outskirts of St. Louis, to which it was connected by a streetcar line. In 1919, it was discovered by the residents of Maddenville that the inhabitants of the neighboring Maplewood were planning to elect whether or not to annex their town. To avoid annexation and to establish their own school district, the residents decided to incorporate Maddenville into a village. On December 15, 1919, the town of Maddenville officially became the village of Brentwood. During the late 1920s, the village earned an unhealthy reputation for its numerous gambling houses and illegal activities that took place around the intersection of Manchester Road and Brentwood Boulevard. The first mayor, James L. Willingham (in office from 1929‚Äì1931), ran on the promise to clean Brentwood up and eliminate the casinos, along with the hoodlums who hung around them, which he did. The town then became once again attractive for families. On April 12, 1929, Willingham signed ordinance 1A, which established Brentwood as a city and determined its boundaries.

History =Early history= Bridgeton has a long and uneven history. The first Europeans to interact with Native American peoples and settle there were associated with the area's days as part of the French Illinois Territory. The French explorer, √âtienne de Veniard de Bourgmont traveled the area in 1724, on a trail that developed as the main route between St. Louis and St. Charles. The Spanish gained colonial control in 1768 after France was defeated by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War and ceded its territory west of the Mississippi to Spain; they remained in control until 1804, when the area was transferred to the Americans in the Louisiana Purchase. In a 1799 census, the population of \\"Marais des Liards\\" was given as 337 whites and 42 slaves.Digest of the Laws of Louisiana, Appendix 4 from the American Memory archives of the Library of Congress Bridgeton was first platted in 1794, and named Marais des Liards (Cottonwood Swamp). It was also known as Village √† Robert, named after Robert Owen, its founder, who had received a land grant from the Spanish government. In a Spanish census two years later it had a population (including slaves) of 77 males and 47 females. As the area received more and more English-speaking settlers, the village's name became Owen's Station. Because of its location, including its proximity to a ferry across the Missouri River, Bridgeton became a stop along the way from St. Louis to St. Charles. Meriwether Lewis passed through on his way to meet members who were gathering as part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The city was granted a state charter in 1843; throughout the next few years it was a stop along the way for emigrants seeking the major trailheads to the Oregon and Santa Fe trails. The Jesuits, a Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, came to Bridgeton from St. Stanislaus Seminary and St. Ferdinand Parish of Florissant, Missouri. The order established St. Mary's Church in 1851 as a mission to serve area Catholics; it became a full parish within its first year. The Archdiocese of St. Louis suppressed the parish in 2001 due to the expansion of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, which caused a decline in residential population. =Modern history= By 1950, Bridgeton's population was 276, lower than it had been in the late 1790s and early 19th century. The city expanded in size during the decade, growing through annexation, to . The decade included the founding of the Northwest Chamber of Commerce,About Us from the Northwest Chamber of Commerce website the chamber of commerce for the Northwest St. Louis area, which includes Bridgeton.Community Home from the Northwest Chamber of Commerce website This led into its period of greatest residential growth, the 1960s, during which nearly 8000 single-family homes were built. Denser development was strong during that decade as well, at nearly 2000 units. Unlike with single-family development, the multi-family development continued at about the same average pace during the 1970s and 1980s. While residential construction nearly ended in the 1990s, that decade has seen significant growth in commercial development. Levee-protected floodplains of the river, together with good access to interstate highways, rail, and the airport have translated into continued growth for Bridgeton and nearby communities, and a diversification of the city's tax base. Proximity to Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport proved to be a mixed blessing. Starting in 1995, an expansion plan for the airport, centered on a new runway plan called W-1W, was fought (unsuccessfully) by the city. The new runway led to the elimination of 2000 homes in the city, most notably in the Carrollton subdivision, undoubtedly playing a significant role in the city's recent population decline.

It is a western outer-ring suburb of St. Louis. The population was 9,133 at the 2010 census. In 2009, Money magazine ranked Ellisville #25 on the annual Best Places to Live in America list.  History  Ellisville was settled by Captain James Harvey Ferris of Kentucky before 1837. He brought slaves with him when he settled his property south of Manchester and west of Kiefer Creek Road, and it was here the house that became known as the \\"Ellis House\\" was constructed. The bricks used for construction of the house were handmade by the slaves; it was also called the \\"Brick Place\\" for this reason. Captain Ferris sold the house to Vespasian Ellis, a newspaper editor in St. Louis. The Old School Democrat, the Native American Bulletin, the Washington Temperance Paper, and The Native American were among Ellis' work. In 1842, Ellis became the United States consul to Venezuela. He ran several ads in the Native American Bulletin in an effort to sell his Ellisville farm. As a result, it was sold to William A. Hereford in 1842 or 1843. Hereford was a Virginian and is credited with the naming of Ellisville after his former post office in Ellisville, Virginia. Hereford opened the first post office here on May 2, 1843. Some believe that the Ellis House itself actually served as the post office for a time. All historical accounts of the area give the same history, but none state clearly whether the town was named for Vespasian Ellis or by William Hereford for his Virginia post office. Hereford sold to Samuel Wilson, and he sold to Major Clarkson of Kentucky for whom Clarkson Road is named. Major Clarkson sold to Captain Benjamin F. Hutchinson of Kentucky, a steamboat captain and the owner of at least three steamboats. Captain Hutchinson raised fine horses and planted extensive orchards, greatly improving the surrounding countryside. In 1868, Captain Hutchinson subdivided his farm into small lots. Adam Doering purchased the brick house and a considerable portion of the land. John Henry William Rasch purchased the house about 1896 from the Doerings. The Ellisville House stood until 1969 when it was razed. Geography Ellisville is located at (38.594003, -90.587490).

It is a middle class, second-ring northern suburb of St. Louis. Based on 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the city had a total population of 50,952, making it the 13th-largest city in Missouri and the largest municipality in St. Louis County. History The exact date the first settlers went to the Valley of Florissant is unknown, but it is one of the oldest settlements in the state of Missouri. Some historians believe it was settled about the same time as St. Louis. The first civil government was formed in 1786. Spanish archives in Havana reveal 40 people and seven plantations were in Florissant at the time of the 1787 census. The village, called \\"Fleurissant\\", meaning \\"Blooming\\" in English, by its French settlers and \\"St. Ferdinand\\" by its Spanish rulers, was a typical French village with its commons and common fields.Old St. Ferdinand Shrine, Official Site Originally a separate town, and now an inner suburb of St. Louis, the community was centered on (and frequently called after) the parish of St. Ferdinand. As late as 1889, the town was predominantly French-speaking (while the southern portion of the metropolis was populated by German-speakers).St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 27, 1889; cited in Missouri Historical Review, April 1957, p. 330 The first train line to the area was constructed in 1878‚Äîan extension of the line which went from St. Louis City to Normandy. The last train to Florissant ran on November 14, 1931. Following World War II, Florissant went from a small village community to a large suburban center, as developers such as Alfred H. Mayer Co. began building subdivisions on what was formerly farmland and empty acreage. Around 18,000 houses were built between 1947 and 1980, and the population swelled to its peak of about 76,000 in the mid-1970s, making it the largest city in St. Louis County. James J. Eagan was the first mayor of Florissant after a charter amendment created the position. He ultimately served 37 years from 1963 until his death on November 2, 2000, being re-elected into office nine times, and became one of the longest-serving mayors of any city in the United States. In his final year, he was awarded the title of Best Politician in St. Louis by the Riverfront Times. The civic center off Parker Road is named the James J. Eagan Community Center in his memory.

The population was 298 as of the 2010 census. The oldest African-American community to be incorporated in Missouri, Kinloch was home to a vibrant and flourishing black community for much of the 19th and 20th century. It began to decline in the 1980s, when the City of St. Louis began to buy up property due to an FAA noise-abatement program for nearby St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Between 1990 and 2000, Kinloch lost more than 80 percent of its population, and the city became an increasingly violent and dangerous place to live. In recent years, there have been efforts to rebuild the city. History The current city of Kinloch grew up around Kinloch Park, a commuter suburb first developed in the 1890s. A Mrs. \\"B\\" and her husband are thought to be the first black family to purchase a home in Kinloch Park. As soon as the neighbors discovered the new owners were black they sold their properties, and new sales to permanent white residents of south Kinloch Park ceased. In a few years, more than 30 black families had bought into a six-block area that became called South Kinloch Park. Kinloch, as an African-American community, developed out of a land purchase model similar to the Brooklyn, Illinois model. Since it was not legal to sell directly to blacks, the Olive Street Terrace Realty Corporation sold the parcels to whites for an average price of $150. The new owners then sold the plots to blacks for an average of $350. This allowed the company to use the white people's loans as collateral for further bank notes. To get white investors, the company circulated testimonials of investors who paid in $50 towards a parcel and received returns of $500 to $1,000 on the investment. In an advertisement to the Argus, Olive Street Terrace Realty said, \\"The good colored people of South Kinloch Park have built themselves a little city of which they have a right to be proud. More than a hundred homes, three churches and a splendid public school have been built in a few years.\\" The Kinloch Park development had a horse- racing facility called Kinloch Track. When Missouri outlawed the sport, the grounds were taken over by Kinloch Airfield, which saw some historic flights. The Aero Club of St. Louis hosted the first international air meet in October 1910, where Theodore Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to fly in an airplane. Pilot Arch Hoxsey flew the president around for over three minutes in one of the Wright Brothers' six planes they had brought in. The Kinloch Airfield saw the first control tower, the first meal served on a flight, the first airmail shipped, the first parachute jump, the first aerial photo and the first animal airlifted. Albert Bond Lambert, the first person in the St. Louis area to receive a pilot's license, and fellow members of the Aero Club leased the field in 1920 and renamed it the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in 1923. Two years later, Lambert purchased the field outright; on February 7, 1928, he sold it to the city of St. Louis at cost, allowing it to become the first city-operated airport and the precursor of today's Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. Kinloch was home to the 198th chapter of the Universal Negro Improvement Association UNIA, which fostered black-owned businesses in the area. The chapter chairman was Elijah Woodson. In 1902, the white residents of Kinloch Park decided to withdraw from the neighboring Ferguson school district and built the Nuroad school for whites. Their two-room school was given to black students, who were using the 1885 Vernon schoolhouse built for the children of the servants to the whites in Kinloch. In 1913, the Dunbar Elementary school, named after Paul Lawrence Dunbar, was established for the black children of South Kinloch. Still segregated when it closed in 1975, it holds the record as the longest-operated school for blacks only. In 1924, Kinloch became the first community in Missouri to elect a black man to its school board: the Reverend Walter Johnson, who later became a vocal critic of Kinloch's refusal to build a high school for its black students. Another Vernon School opened in 1927 to educate the black students of Kinloch and west Ferguson. Although the U.S. Supreme Court had ordered desegregation in 1954, the school remained segregated until it closed in 1967. Even though the Kinloch schools remained segregated, the Kinloch students took part in a court-ordered busing program to desegregate other school districts. In 1931, Holy Angels Parish was established and opened Our Lady of the Angels Elementary School. Both the church and school were open until 2002, making it the oldest continuing black parish in the St. Louis Archdiocese. In 1938, South Kinloch was poised to elect a second black board member, with a district that was 543 black students to 349 whites. This was when the white north put on the ballot an attempt to split the school district. This third attempt to divide the district by the protesting and minority whites who attended Nuroad School ended in failure, with 415 unanimous votes against in the black south and 215 unanimous votes for in the white north. This led to the foundation of a new municipality called Berkeley, which included all of North Kinloch Park plus land to the northwest and which formed a new school district. South Kinloch Park became Kinloch. One all-but-forgotten element in Kinloch's success was the electric streetcar line which ran through it to Florissant. Later the line was cut back to just north of Airport Road in Berkeley. At Kinloch, near the beginning of the 1900s, a branch had been constructed to downtown Ferguson, connecting at what was known as various times as Ramona Junction and Ferguson Junction. This clean, economic and efficient transportation gave Kinloch residents the ability to travel with ease to jobs both in the City of St. Louis and the northwestern suburbs. At the Wellston Loop, the line connected with numerous other streetcar and bus lines, giving Kinloch residents a reliable way to get to downtown St. Louis, the suburbs of University City, Clayton, Brentwood, Kirkwood, Webster Groves all the communities along St. Charles Rock Road west to St. Charles, Missouri. Many white people became acquainted with Kinloch as they passed through the area on their streetcar journeys. The substation at the junction of the Berkeley and Ferguson branches still sits on the east side of Hanley Road opposite Suburban Avenue, which had been the streetcar right-of-way into Ferguson. In a heavy segregated culture, black and white rode the streetcars as equals. Anyone could sit wherever anyone wanted and it was not unusual for blacks and whites who otherwise would never have known each other to strike up conversations. In summer streetcar riders always commented on the tantalizing smoky breeze of barbecuing at the Kinloch stop, where the trolleys to Ferguson paused on a graceful, wide curve. =Decline and revitalization efforts= Kinloch, Missouri in 2017. In the 1980s, the City of St. Louis began to buy out property in Kinloch as part of a noise-abatement program for Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. Eventually, the airport took the vast majority of private homes in Kinloch. Between 1990 and 2000, Kinloch lost more than 75 percent of its population. The social and economic effects of this buyout were disastrous for the community. Kinloch became an increasingly violent and dangerous place to live, infested with drugs and crime. The police department faced numerous investigations, and over a 20-year period a number of officers were arrested on corruption charges. In September 2002, St. Louis County police chief Ron Battelle directed his department to take control of law enforcement in Kinloch. The city's population had dwindled to 449, and there was talk of disincorporation, which was renewed in 2011, when Mayor Keith Conway faced federal charges for using city funds to pay for personal expenses, including a vacation home in Florida. In recent years, there have been efforts to rebuild the city. Faith Beyond Walls, a community service organization, has been instrumental in mobilizing volunteers to assist with these efforts. The county police presence remains, though Kinloch continues to operate the Kinloch Police Department, and city officials say it is nearly ready to stand on its own. The City of St. Louis, St. Louis County, Kinloch, Berkeley and Ferguson reached agreement on a redevelopment plan for of land on the northeast corner of I-70 and I-170, along the eastern edge of the airport. Years ago, this land was part of the airport buyout. The redevelopment will offer office, retail, and industrial space and is expected to create about 12,000 jobs, along with tax revenue to be split among the municipalities. The developers, NorthPark Partners, intend to make improvements in Kinloch and donate a new civic center to Kinloch. =2015 election rejection= On April 23, 2015, newly elected mayor Betty McCray was refused entrance to City Hall on the first day of her term. Members of the previous administration claimed voter fraud and that she had been suspended according to the city attorney. Eventually she was allegedly served with impeachment papers. The impeachment hearing was canceled in June 2015, leading McCray to file suit in St. Louis County Circuit Court, asking Judge John D. Warner to require the city to dismiss the impeachment proceeding and to provide access to her office in Kinloch City Hall, as well as barring the city attorney James Robinson from prosecuting her. She also asks for attorney's fees. Public safety Since October 1, 2018 the City of Kinloch is patrolled by the St. Louis County Police Department under the command of Captain John Wheeler from the 2nd Precinct. Kinloch operated donated police cars that it did not register or insure. It operated without paying into the state's workers' compensation fund. Officers injured on the job were responsible for their own medical bills. The City of Kinloch fire protection services are provided by the Kinloch Fire Protection District.

History The historical anecdotes contained in this section were derived from the 2011 book \\"Ladue Found\\", written by Charlene Bry, former editor and owner of \\"The Ladue News.\\" Ladue began as a farming community St. Louis County suburb. After St. Louis City ejected St. Louis County in 1876, Ladue was known as ranges 4 and 5 of \\"Township 45,\\" with Clayton being the political hub. Original Township 45 farming families included the Dennys, Dwyers, Conways, McCutcheons, McKnights (all Irish), Litzsinger, von Schraders, Spoedes, Luedloffs, Muellers, Seigers1868 Per 1868 Pitzman map of St. Louis, as well as 1878 and 1909 maps of St. Louis County (all German), LaDues (French), Warsons, Lays, Barnes, Prices, and Watsons (all English). Once automobiles replaced horse and wagon as the primary mode of transportation, farmers in the area began selling portions of their land to city workers who wished to live outside of the urban setting. Three small villages (Village of LaDue, Village of Deer Creek, and the Village of McKnight) merged in 1936 to become what is now known as Ladue.Ladue Found\\"; Charlene Bry, Virginia Publishing Company, 2011 Ladue was named from Ladue Road, the main thoroughfare in the area that led from St. Louis City to wealthy entrepreneur Peter Albert LaDue's large property at the current intersection of Warson Road and Ladue Road (including St. Louis Country Club). Peter Albert LaDue was born in Kinderhook, New York, in 1821, a descendant of Pierre LaDoux, who arrived from France in the 1600s. He arrived in Saint Louis about 1848 and later became a prominent attorney, alderman, and banker and land speculator. Controversies In the early 1990s, the city tried to force a woman to take down a yard sign stating \\"Say No to the War in the Persian Gulf, Call Congress Now\\" as it violated a city law. The ACLU sued, arguing that the right to place the sign was protected by the 1st Amendment. The ensuing legal battle went to the United States Supreme Court which unanimously ruled, in City of Ladue v. Gilleo, that the right to place the sign was protected by the Constitution. In 1986, the City of Ladue won a case against E. Terrence Jones and Joan Kelly Horn, a couple who had lived together for four years and who each brought children from a previous relationship. Ladue officials had requested that they marry or leave their home. The Missouri Court of Appeals sided with the city, stating in City of Ladue v. Horn that \\"A man and woman living together, sharing pleasures and certain responsibilities, does not per se constitute a family in even the conceptual sense. [...] There is no doubt that there is a governmental interest in marriage and in preserving the integrity of the biological or legal family. There is no concomitant governmental interest in keeping together a group of unrelated persons, no matter how closely they simulate a family. Further, there is no state policy which commands that groups of people may live under the same roof in any section of a municipality they choose.\\" Under Chapter 213 of the Missouri Human Rights Act (¬ß213.040.1), passed after the Ladue v. Horn case, housing discrimination on the basis of familial status is now an unlawful practice. In 2010, the former chief of police, Larry White, sued the City of Ladue for wrongful termination. The suit was dismissed by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County in 2012 and the dismissal upheld by the Missouri Court of Appeals in 2013. Despite comprising only 0.88% of the local population, black drivers in Ladue comprised 575 (of 4107 total, or 14%) stops in 2014. The resulting \\"disparity index\\" indicates a black driver was 15.98 times more likely than the average driver to be stopped by the Ladue Police Department in 2014, but the police department contends the statistics are skewed by the local racial composition.

Located just outside the city limits, Maplewood was located at the end of one of St. Louis's streetcar lines and was also located near major railroads. It was built as a bedroom community. Advertising suggested that people should get away from the city (in an era of common and sooty commercial, industrial, and domestic coal burning) and enjoy the fresh air of less densely populated areas like Maplewood. Maplewood's historic residential areas were mostly built from 1900‚Äì1910 and a number of well-preserved homes remain. Several of these homes have remained in the same family for generations.

The population was 7,737 at the 2010 census. History Olivette was settled in the mid-19th century as a small farming community along an old Indian trail originally called the Bonhomme Road (now known as Old Bonhomme, which meets and essentially turns into Olive Boulevard). Olive Road is a ridge road and at one time served as a de facto boundary for housing segregation in outer St. Louis. Olivette was incorporated in 1930 by combining the communities of Central, Tower Hill, Olive, and Stratmann. It was once called Central due to its centralized location along the Central Plank Road (again, now called Olive Boulevard). In fact, Price Road and Olive Boulevard intersect at the exact midpoint between the Port of St. Louis on the Mississippi River and Howell's Landing on the Missouri River. Central became the best stop for wagons to restock on their journey between the two stops. Olivette is home to the first brick schoolhouse in St. Louis County at the corner of Price and Old Bonhomme. For the past 150 years, a schoolhouse has occupied this corner. Logos High School sits here now. Olivette is one of the communities in the county that still maintains its own municipal fire department as well as police department. Geography Olivette is located at (38.672951, -90.377328).

History The area south of the King's Road to St. Charles was first settled in the early 1820s, when travelers westward from St. Louis would stop overnight at what became known as \\"The Overland Park\\". Daniel Boone, noted frontiersman, constructed a single room cabin here, near the current location of Lake Sherwood and Wyland Elementary School. A historic marker on Wabaday Avenue shows the exact spot. In time, businesses were established and a one-room subscription school, the Buck School, was built in 1846. In 1867, the Ritenour School District was organized. In 1919, the town's name was shortened to \\"Overland\\", to avoid postal confusion with the city of Overland Park, Kansas. The town was incorporated as a fourth class city in 1939 with a mayoral-city council government. In the 1990s, the city voters approved a change to a third class city. In 2007, the city voted to move to a mayor-council-administrator form of government. Under this structure, the mayor serves as the chief elected official. The city council serves as the legislative body, and is empowered to pass ordinances and resolutions it deems necessary to the operation of the city. The city administrator is a full-time employee of the city, and executes the day-to-day tasks of operations. Notable locations The historic \\"Overland Park\\" wagon train stop is located near the intersection of Midland Boulevard and Lackland Road. A monument marks this site. An early Overland settler and prominent St. Louis businessman, Dennis Lackland, built the Lackland House in 1844 on the road later named for him. The nearby McElhinney Log House, built in the 1850s, is maintained by the Overland Historical Society. McElhinney log house at 9711 Lackland Rd. The Ritenour School, built in 1867 on Woodson Road, was remodeled and expanded over the years and is currently the Ritenour School District's administration building. Lake Sherwood, view from southeastern shore Lake Sherwood (originally Lake Laughlin or Loch Lin), which is near the original Overland Park, was developed as a private residence in 1877 and is now a gated community. The lake is spring-fed, and the dam spills into headwaters for the River des Peres. Construction of the earthen dam was completed in 1894. Its height is , capacity is , and normal storage is . It drains an area of . At normal levels, the lake has a surface area of . The lake is owned by the Lake Sherwood homeowners' association and is used for recreational purposes. The Gocke-Vance House, on Poe Avenue, was built in 1910 by Edward Gocke. This fireproof house was built from plans drawn by Frank Lloyd Wright. Gocke-Vance House, built in 1910 from plans drawn by Frank Lloyd Wright Overland has several large parks. The Garnett Estate, built in 1907 on Ashby Road, is now owned and maintained by the city as Wild Acres Park; it is a secluded area, offering walking paths and a small fishing lake. Mort Jacobs Park is a rolling acreage of tall trees and hiking paths. Norman Myers Park (formerly Taylor Field) is a large athletic field with a one-third-mile running track and adjacent picnic areas. It is home to Overland's annual Lion's Fair. Other smaller parks dot the city, providing family outing opportunities.

Overland was the location of the National Personnel Records Center, which houses discharged and retired service records of all branches of the United States armed forces. The city was also the location of the Army Human Resources Command (HRC), prior to the facility's closing as a result of the military's 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process.

The population was 3,310 at the 2010 census. History The area originally was farmland, but it did have an interesting history with several pockets of significant Greek and African-American residents. Because St. Vincent's mental hospital was located just north of St. Charles Rock Road, a streetcar line was constructed in the late 1800s from just south of Olive Street Road in University City north on the east side of Ferguson Avenue through what is now Pagedale to meet the electric interurban line to Saint Charles at the Rock Road. The south end of the line eventually joined with the Creve Coeur Lake streetcar line which ran on Vernon Avenue (but later was relocated a block further south to run behind a new subdivision). That transportation opened up the area to housing. South of Pagedale, at Page and Ferguson, was Hazel Hill, which eventually became the reason for the Lincoln School which became part of the Normandy School District. Though long forgotten as a name, the Hazel Hill community still exists and the Lincoln building is still standing. When Pagedale was incorporated, the northern end went beyond the Rock Road up Hoke Avenue, which later was renamed Ferguson though it didn't line up with Ferguson. In 1954 a new housing subdivision was built at Ferguson and North Market Street. That subdivision, named Engelholm Gardens, a long forgotten name also, still stands, looking exactly as it did in 1954.Wayne Brasler, Normandy area historian, whose family was one of those who bought the new houses at Engleholm Gardens In 2001, a new $1 million Pagedale City Hall and Police Facility was built.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Rock Hill is bounded by cities Ladue, Brentwood, Webster Groves, Glendale and Warson Woods. ;Streets Manchester Road is four lanes and runs east‚Äìwest across Rock Hill. North Rock Hill Road was connected to the South McKnight Road extension in June 1962. Voters passed a $3 million bond issue to repair roads in 2000. By 2005 the fund was nearly depleted with considerable work left to be done. Voters passed an proposition in 2011 to extend the street bond issue, allowing the city to raise an additional $3.5 million. In October 2019, the board of aldermen voted to lower the speed limit on most streets to 20 miles per hour.  History  James Collier Marshall settled what became Rock Hill around 1832. He and his brother John Marshall purchased 800 acres along Manchester Road where he and his brother built a log building that operated as a home and store. Fairfax House in 1910. In 1839 James built a two-story weatherboard home, naming it \\"Fairfax\\" after a family friend in Maryland, Albert Kirby Fairfax, Lord Fairfax of Cameron. A year later the property was divided between James and John Marshall when James married Elizabeth Kyle McCausland (she is related to The Robert Campbell Family of St Louis thru the Kyle's). Fairfax was completed the following year. James and Elizabeth had five children who lived to maturity. A son, Ernest, the only to marry and have children, raised two sons. James Marshall sought to build a church and requested the services of the Presbyterian Church of St. Louis, which sent Rev Artemus Bullard to assist Marshall in 1845. A Presbyterian congregation was established in Rock Hill in March 1845, and met in a log house on Marshall's property while the church was built on land contributed by Marshall for a church. Though there is no written proof, it is assumed by many that slaves built the church using stone quarried from the Marshall farm quarry. Rev. Bullard gave the church the name \\"Rock Hill Presbyterian Church,\\" presumably after two geographic features in the area, which became the namesake of the area. In 1866 fifteen members separated to found the Webster Groves Presbyterian Church Marshall served as first postmaster at Fairfax House c. 1845. Marshall died in February 1864. The post office was closed in 1863, only to reopen a year later until 1897, whereupon mail service was moved to Webster Groves. Mail service was re-established in February 1874.

Hellmich purchased 15 acres to develop an \\"Industrial Court.\\" In 1969 Rock Hill notified Missouri Pacific it would condemn its station. Rock Hill remained largely undeveloped until the 1920s when much of the area was parceled for the construction of houses. In 1940 a 27-acre subdivision was created south of Manchester road. In April 1929 Rock Hill was incorporated as a village. The village switched to a mayor‚Äìaldermanic form of government in 1941. In April 1947 the Village of Rock Hill voted to incorporate as a fourth class city.

After the city reopening the bid process Rock Hill agreed in April 2000 to allow Sansone to develop 16 acres, financed by up to $7 million in tax-increment financing. Sansone withdrew its proposal again in September 2000 citing city delays that meant surrounding development projects had progressed so much as to make the 16-acre proposal infeasible. The city re-bid the projects and received 40-acre plans from Regency Realty and THF Realty and an additional 25-acre plan from Regency. In April 2001 both developers retracted their bids amid a firestorm of resident opposition against the proposals. In 2001 RSI Kitchen & Bath purchased the three-acre former Stivers car dealership property on Manchester for construction of its main showroom. In December 2000 Quebecor World began talks with city officials to acquire the city hall for a potential expansion of the adjacent Sayers Printing Company. In August 2002 Quebecor World Sayers closed its 3.5-acre property. In January 2004 the Board of Aldermen selected Novus Companies to develop 36.9 acres at the southwest and northwest corners of Manchester and McKnight roads. In March 2005 the Board of Aldermen approved the $95 million mixed-use development, called Market at McKnight. The buy-out area targeted 126 properties on the north corner, and 48 properties, including 15 homes, on the south side. Demolition began in August 2006. In May 2007 Rock Hill sought a second request for proposals when over half of north-side property owners were unsatisfied with Novus' buy-out offers and Novus sought an additional $7 million in tax increment financing (TIF). In December 2007 the Board of Alderman replaced Novus with Miller Weingarten and Hutkin Properties on the northwest redevelopment site and increased the TIF from $18 million to $26.7 million. The south Market at McKnight opened in November 2007. By January 2010 the development area was 60 percent leased. In April 2014 Novus announced its second anchor for the development, 27,000-square-foot Lucky's Market. In June 2005 the Board of Aldermen approved Mills Properties' request to build an 84-unit apartment complex on 7.7 acres on McKnight Road. In 2006 Rock Hill joined the Webster Groves/Shrewsberry Area Chamber of Commerce. In December 2008 Target delayed its plans for a store on the northwest development by nine months, citing the global credit crisis. In March 2009 Target canceled its planned location. Miller Weingarten ended its involvement in May. The 27-acre north development area was reduced to 2.9 acres in October 2010. In 1986 The Book House was established on Manchester Road. In 2009 the three-story Victorian house received a Historic Buildings designation from the Rock Hill Historic Preservation Commission. In May 2013 Book House owner Michelle Barron received an eviction notice from property owner Rex Stahl who wanted to redevelop the 1.5-acre property, site of two other businesses. In October the Board of Alderman approved EZ Storage's proposal to build a 107,772-square- foot storage facility on the site. The Book House reopened in Maplewood in 2014.  Education  Since 1948 Rock Hill has been part of the Webster Groves School District. Three public schools are within the city's borders: * Hudson Elementary SchoolHudson Elementary School * Webster Groves Elementary Computer SchoolWebster Groves Elementary Computer School * Steger Sixth Grade CenterSteger Sixth Grade Center Rock Hill School District comprised Rock Hill, parts of Ladue, Warson Woods, Kirkwood, Brentwood and Webster Groves; and was one of the first districts formed in St. Louis County. Rock Hill #I on Manchester and Rock Hill Road was established in 1909. In 1911 enrollment was 270. In 1912 two more elementary schools were built. In 1920 Rock Hill #II passed on to Brentwood when the city split from Rock Hill School District to form its own school district. Rock Hill #I was expanded with a three-story addition in 1930, the same year Rock Hill #III was razed. In 1945 ten acres were purchased for construction of a junior high school, later also a senior high school, which is today Hudson Elementary School. It was designed by Ernest J. Friton. In July 1948, voters opted to merge the district with Webster Groves School District. The Webster Groves School Board accepted the merge in September. Enrollment in Rock Hill School District was 435 at the time. Rock Hill superintendent T. Dean Adams was named as principal of Rock Hill's two schools. Rock Hill #I was renamed after long-time Rock Hill school board president Ed Schall. The NAACP sued and won the right for students on the north side of Lithia Avenue to attend Schall after schools were legally integrated in 1956. In May 1958, Webster Groves School District voters passed a bond issue for the construction of a $1.6 million junior high school in Rock Hill and a second junior high school abutting Webster Groves Senior High School. Steger Junior High, named after Webster Groves Superintendent Leonard Steger, was built in 1960. Steger was converted to an elementary school amid budget cuts in 1978 as part of a district-wide reorganization plan. In 1983 the school district finalized plans to consolidate sixth grade teaching at Steger. Schall School was rebuilt in 1965, then transferred to Special School District of St. Louis County in 1975. Enrollment was 172. Hudson was closed in 1978 and reopened in 1984 after remodeling. Schall was made a Department of Motor Vehicles office circa 1982. ;Rock Hill Preschool From c. 1974 Rock Hill Preschool operated out of the Parks and Recreation building on North Rock Hill Road. In March 2007 the city eliminated the preschool program as a cost-saving measure. Mayor Morgan voted against the preschool the next month when a second aldermanic vote came down to a tie. Parks, recreation and historical landmarks  The recreation program was set in motion in 1971 by mayor Lincoln Wagner. In June 1972 mayor Jess Stroup created a citizen parks and recreation commission to build a city park. One of the recreation commission's first acts was to create a summer day camp program for children. By October 1974 the city signed a contract to begin construction of a half-acre park. Dedicated in June 1975, the two-acre park had two tennis courts, two handball courts, two shuffleboard courts and horseshoe pits. In 1976 the city hired Genie Zakrzewski to direct the parks and recreation program. By June 1982, the city had added four more parks: *Oakhaven Park ‚Äì Three-acre park on Gilbert & Oakhaven completed in 1977. Two lots for the park were purchased in 1974 and 1975. Built with four tennis courts, a picnic shelter, horseshoe pits and a playground. *Oak Trail Nature Park ‚Äì Four-acre park at the end of Oakhaven with 2000 feet of trails. Developed in 1979. *Stroup Field ‚Äì On Old Warson and McKinley. The land for this two-and-a-half-acre park was purchased around 1978. It initially included two softball fields and a soccer/football field. *Greenwood Park ‚Äì Located between Lithia and Eldridge. Sub-acre park that initially included a basketball court and playground. The five parks cost $325,000 to build, with three quarters of the amount coming from federal and state programs. After the Rock Hill Parks and Recreation building was demolished, the tennis courts at Rock Hill park remained until the park was closed and dismantled in 2017. Two additional parks have also been built:Rock Hill Parks Department * Hensley Park ‚Äì Next to Salem Hills * Whitfield Park ‚Äì Berry Road & Madison Avenue Over half of residents had visited a city park in that last year, according to a 2009 survey commissioned by the city. Seventy- six percent of respondents felt the parks needed improvements. Oakhaven Park was the most used, followed by Stroup Field. The Rock Hill Presbyterian Church was built by slaves in 1847 at what is now Manchester and McKnight roads. It was the oldest operating Presbyterian church west of the Mississippi River until 2010 when its congregation left. The United African Presbyterian Church congregation occupied the building until 2011 when the Giddings-Lovejoy Presbytery sold the property to a gas station. In July 2011 the Board of Aldermen approved construction under the condition that the gas station owners attempt to rehome the church. In April 2012 Cedar Lake Cellars began moving the church at its own expense to its winery in Foristell, Missouri. Three time capsules were buried on the church property between 1845 and 1958. The later two (from 1935 and 1958) were recovered and opened in May. The third, its location having never been recorded, was never found. Government Since 2003 the city administrator is no longer required to live in Rock Hill. Larry Hensley served as city administrator from 1983 to September 2002. George Liyeos served as city administrator from September 2005 until his resignation in May 2014. The Board of Aldermen appointed Jennifer Yackley as City Administrator in July. ;Mayors *1929 ‚Äì 1934, Mils T. Oliver *1934 ‚Äì 1935, Edw. Frauenfelder *1935 ‚Äì 1938, Mils T.

Ran unopposed in 2014. ;City center In 1940 voters passed a $11,000 bond issue to build a city hall and fire department headquarters. The project also received a federal grant. The city hall on Rock Hill Road was dedicated in December 1941. In 1958 the city purchased the Koehler property on Manchester Road for the construction of a new city hall. The city hall housing police, fire station and Rock Hill Library was dedicated in May 1965. By 1996 the city said city hall was overcrowded and planned to relocate to Stroup Field, on the southeast corner of McKinley Avenue and Old Warson Road. Later that year, however, voters defeated a parks and drainage sales tax intended to help finance the move. Rock Hill then proposed remodeling city hall. By September 1999 proposed remodeling costs grew from $1.15 million to nearly $1.68 million. City hall expansion plans were suspended in December 2000 when Quebecor World began talks with city officials to acquire the city hall property for a potential expansion of Sayers Printing Company. Talks soon fell apart and in April the city resumed planning for an expanded city center. In August 2002 Quebecor World Sayers closed its 3.5-acre property. Sayers' property was one of three options being considered for city hall's expansion in October 2002. In December Gerber selected the former Gerber site on McKnight Road for the $5.2 million project. In November 2003 the Board of Aldermen purchased the former Gerber property on McKnight Road for $1.75 million. The city planned to build a $13 million, 83,000 square-foot city center complete with an indoor pool, library, full gymnasium, and banquet facility that doubled as meeting space. In May 2004 Rock Hill Chief Financial Officer Don Cary said overspending put the city on track for bankruptcy by 2010. In June 2004 Mayor Robert Salamone abruptly announced his resignation effective in August, citing \\"individuals who seek to impede or even halt our efforts at improving our city.\\" In October 2004 the city scaled back its plans for the McKnight site to administrative offices and a police station. The city sold the site to Mills Properties for $1.950 million in February 2005. A state audit in September 2005 said the city lost some $700,000 on the property.Or possibly up to $2.7 million: the \\"eventual cost\\" including studies and various other costs. City Hall moved into temporary retail space on Manchester in August 2005, then anticipated to be a temporary move lasting less than two years. In September it sold its former city hall to Novice Companies for $3.67 million. Also that year Rock Hill purchased five homes on North Rock Hill Road for construction of a permanent city hall. However, in March 2006 the city suspended its plans when it determined it was well short of the funds necessary to complete the project. In 2008 Rock Hill sold the property to Arco National Construction Company for construction of the company's corporate headquarters. In August 2011 city hall moved to Thornton. In April 2016 voters approved a property tax rate increase to allow the city to issue $6.1 million in general obligation bonds. In March 2017 the Board of Aldermen approved planning for a proposed municipal center ‚Äî a 12,100-square-foot city hall and police and fire department ‚Äî on Rock Hill Road. In May the city awarded a $5.5 million construction contract to K&S; Associates. Ceremonial ground breaking took place in June, with completion planned for late summer or early fall 2018. ;Rock Hill Public Library The original library was opened in June 1944 on the second floor of the Fairfax House. The volunteer-run library was supported by donations and open two days a week. It was later moved to the first floor of Fairfax House. In 1947 the city voted to support the library with taxes after the library weathered a brief closure the previous year. In 1957 Rock Hill Public Library moved into the former Lion's Club building on Manchester Road. From 1963 to 1964 the library was temporarily relocated in the Rock Hill Presbyterian Church while the Manchester location was razed to construct a new city hall and library. The new library was dedicated in May 1965. Kelley Sallade served as director of Rock Hill Public Library from December 1984 to March 2014. During her tenure the library acquired its first computers for patrons. In 1996 the library joined seven other county libraries to form the Municipal Library Consortium. In July 2005 the library's 2,400-square-foot location at city hall was closed and later razed for the Market at McKnight development. In January 2006 the library reopened at a temporary 3,696-square foot space on Manchester Road. In 2012 the library moved to a permanent 4456-square foot space at 9811 Manchester Road. = Police and fire = In 2004 mayor Robert Salamone approached the city of Brentwood about a possible takeover of Rock Hill police and fire services. The proposal was unpopular with Rock Hill residents. In July the Board of Aldermen voted unanimously to keep police and fire services local. The Board of Aldermen also passed resolutions consolidating some police and fire positions under a safety administrator position. Police and fire moved to a residential property on Charleville Avenue when city hall on Manchester Road was razed in 2005. In June 2018 the Board of Aldermen voted to transfer administration of the city's uniformed employee pension plan to the Missouri Local Government Employees Retirement System. ;Rock Hill Police Department Roger Stephens was the village's first police officer, who was later served as Chief for 13 years. During Stephens' tenure the city purchased its first police motor car, a 1933 Ford V8. Marshall Whitecotton was appointed police chief c. 1944, then elected to eight additional two-year terms until his death in August 1966. Under Whitecotton, Brentwood cooperated with Rock Hill's motorized six-man department, which by then had two-way radios. Bradford Epperson served as police chief from 1966 until his death in April 1978. He was President of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association in 1975. In 1973 Rock Hill voters made police chief an appointive position, having defeated a similar effort in 1966. After Chief James Johnstone retired, a police committee recommended promoting acting police chief Mark Zimmer for the permanent position but the recommendation was rejected by aldermen. Northwoods police chief Donald McDonald was appointed Rock Hill police chief in June 1983. Under his leadership Rock Hill became known for its aggressive enforcement of speed limits. He retired in June 1997. A 2000 Missouri study on racial profiling at traffic stops indicated Rock Hill pulled over significantly fewer black drivers than the county. Over four months black drivers made up 10.6 percent of 1,499 police stops. Between 1983 and 2009 Officer Ronald Zeigler issued an estimated 150,000 tickets, mostly to speeding drivers. He was Missouri City Traffic Officer of the Year in 1985, Rock Hill Officer of the Year five times, and the 2000 Traffic Officer of the Millennium. Zeigler retired in October 2009. He \\"put the city on the regional map as a place where speeding motorists could expect to pay for their ignorance of speed limits,\\" according to the Webster-Kirkwood Times. In 2011 Ziegler returned part-time. In 2007 Rock Hill Police opened a substation inside a bank on Manchester Road. Paul Arnett became police chief circa 2006. Previously he had served with the department for nearly 30 years. The Webster-Kirkwood Times, which published Arnett's crime dispatches (one of which appeared on David Letterman) wrote that \\"writing a good crime report is hard. Almost as hard as doing police work. And Chief Arnett appears to have mastered both.\\" Arnett retired in March 2013. In April 2010 officer Matt Crosby was shot and paralyzed when he responded to a domestic disturbance call on Raritan Drive. The shooter received a life sentence with possibility for parole in September 2012. ;Rock Hill Fire Department In October 1940 Rock Hill residents voted in favor of a bond issue creating a city fire service after a long-standing contract with Maplewood fire services ended. The fire station and city hall building was dedicated in December 1941. John Kriska was fire chief circa 1990. He became safety administrator in 2004. In 2006 the fire department received a record 932 calls. Current fire chief Kevin Halloran became chief c. 2008. In 2008 the city received a $237,000 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a new fire truck. Fire house offices moved from the Charleville Firehouse to City Hall on Thornton Avenue while a fire engine and ambulance continued to operate out of the Charleville. CVS Pharmacy asked for $1.5 million TIF on the city's behalf to build a new firehouse to replace the old, which would be demolished to build CVS. In January 2013 the city TIF commission recommended against using TIF to finance the fire department's move. In April 2013 the Board of Alderman left the fire department out of the $1.2 million TIF, instead splitting the amount three ways between CVS, Webster Groves School District and the city. In August 2016 Rock Hill agreed to explore consolidating its fire command with Clayton, Maplewood, Brentwood and Richmond Heights, however in September 2017 Rock Hill left the agreement after studies suggested the joint command would cost the city more than double its fire department budget. August 21, 2018, was the grand opening of Rock Hill's new city hall, police and fire departments at 827 N. Rock Hill Road.  Civics groups  ;Rock Hill Improvement Association The Rock Hill Improvement Association was formed in 1938 to serve the \\"best interests\\" of the school district and city. In 1940 the association advocated for the creation of the fire department. In 1943 the association paid for the renovation of the second floor of the Fairfax House to house the library. The association met here weekly. Circa 1944 the Ladies Auxiliary of Rock Hill Improvement Association was established. ;Interested Citizens of Rock Hill Improvement Association The Interested Citizens association was formed by black Rock Hill residents in October 1963. The group litigated against commercial rezoning of neighborhoods. The association presented the city's flag design in 1965.

History Shrewsbury was officially platted in 1889. The land which became Shrewsbury originally belonged to Gregorie Sarpy and Charles Gratiot; by 1890, it was divided into farms and sold to families. The area now known as Shrewsbury was a farm owned by General John Murdoch. The Murdoch farm was called Shrewsbury Park, named after a town in England. In 1913, concerned resident Joseph Burge organized the Shrewsbury Improvement Association to improve Shrewsbury and develop its first sewer system. Shrewsbury was incorporated and became a village in 1913; shortly thereafter a sanitation system was established, reducing water-borne diseases prevalent at the time. In 1938, the United States government offered financial aid to the city of Shrewsbury, and land was acquired for the construction of a new city hall replacing the 1912 original. The new City Hall building was completed in October 1938. Shrewsbury's new fire engine house and state-of-the-art equipment were dedicated in 1947; it was during this period that the Shrewsbury Garden Club was formed to maintain the beautiful trees and flowers throughout the city. The early 1950s were marked by the expansion of the public bus routes to connect Shrewsbury to St. Louis. The 1960s and '70s were times of great community growth, noted by the construction of city parks, a municipal pool, and Interstate 44. The 1980s and '90s saw increased development of new homes, condominiums, apartments, shopping areas, and a new and improved City Center, which opened May 8, 1993, to coincide with Shrewsbury's 80th year of incorporation. With the opening of the City Center, the previous City Hall building was converted to house the police and fire departments, and is now called the Public Safety Building. Shrewsbury today  Shrewsbury welcome sign, 2018 Construction finished in 2006 on the Shrewsbury‚ÄìLansdowne Interstate 44 St. Louis MetroLink station on the eastern edge of the city, at Lansdowne Avenue and River Des Peres Boulevard.

Community Sycamore Hills was incorporated as a village on November 3, 1941. In October, 1920, Charles A. Lindbergh took several aerial photos of the area. The village is primarily a residential community, currently with no business establishments. Nearly all of the houses are of brick and masonry construction, 1 to 2 stories, and have three or more bedrooms. Most of the homes were built between 1925 and 1950. They range architecturally from American traditional bungalow to Tudor Revival style, with very little repetition in design. As of January 2011 there were two vacant residential building lots in the village. Until the early 1970s, Sycamore Hills included several retail businesses. Currently, the only non- residential entity in the village is Calvary United Church of Christ. Village business is conducted by an elected board of trustees. Police service is contracted through neighboring St. John Police Department. The trustees meet monthly, and meetings are open to all residents. Sycamore Hills is bounded on the south by Midland Boulevard (with the exception of the extreme southwest corner, which extends one block further south to Lackland Road). The northern boundary is Graceland Avenue (except for the extreme northwest, which is a short spur off Gothland Avenue extending past Graceland). The north-south streets are Gothland Avenue, Brown Road, Hartland Avenue, Northland Avenue, Ashland Avenue, Oakland Avenue and Walton Road. These cover one city block except for Brown Road, which covers two blocks of the village limits. Northland Avenue is a limited-access street, and Sycamore Court, at the southwest corner of the village, is a cul-de-sac. The southeast village limit is immediately adjacent to the site of the historic Overland Park, where the Overland Trail began.

City landscape Originally, it was primarily made up of large residential lots. The community first incorporated in 1950 as a village. The incorporation and establishment of a combination Public Safety Department providing three firefighters and one police officer on duty was to provide lower fire insurance rates for residents. The Village changed to city status in 1974 in an effort to increase property taxes. The maximum \\"Village\\" tax rate could no longer sustain the modest city government. In 1983 annexation of a large area to the west more than doubled the size of the city. This caused the city to maintain a police department and contract fire and EMS service to a neighboring fire district. The original country charm of larger lots with white fences and grazing horses is hard to find, however there are a few exceptions. There are several large tracts of land that remain undeveloped. The area offers a quiet, restful, green residential landscape, in contrast to the more intensely developed areas typical of St. Louis County. There are relatively few commercial development areas. The predominant commercial locations tend to be at the periphery of the city boundaries along the regional arterials, and/or at the intersections of the major roads. History Town and Country was incorporated in 1950 as a village , and re- incorporated as a fourth-class city 25 years later.

The city is named for its adjacency to Washington University. University City has much municipal open space, the largest parcels being Heman Park (which includes recreation and community centers and public pool facilities) and Ruth Park (a public golf course and nature trails).

The route contains mostly Chinese businesses, rather than residents.KPLR, October 20, 2010. Although efforts were made to designate part of the area as \\"Chinatown\\", surrounding community members objected to the proposals. Also, the Missouri Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over part of Olive Boulevard and does not permit decorative archways or gateways spanning the roadway, as can be seen in other Chinatowns. As a result, there is no officially designated Chinatown in the St. Louis area. = Delmar Loop = Among the more prominent businesses in the Delmar Loop is Blueberry Hil, a restaurant and concert venue owned by Joe Edwards and Linda Edwards at 6504 Delmar Boulevard. Opened in 1972, its concert venue, The Duck Room, is noted for its relationship with the musician Chuck Berry, who performed there over 200 times.

The population was 6,942 at the 2010 census. History Descendants of the Mississippian culture still had a settlement along the Meramec River in the mid-18th century, until the Native Americans were pushed out by colonial French and German immigrant farmers in the 1760s. The developing village over time was known as Nasby, Sulphur Springs, Quinette, Meramec, and finally Valley Park by circa 1890. It had one of the first post offices established in St. Louis County. It developed as a railroad hub for the Missouri Pacific and St. Louis-San Francisco rail lines. In 1894, the town became the site of the first lynching in St. Louis County. A black man named John Buckner was lynched when accused of raping a local black woman and a white teenager. He was taken from the authorities by several local residents and farmers and hanged from the main bridge in town overlooking the Meramec River. The lynchers were never prosecuted. Valley Park and Castlewood Park were developed as summer resorts. Castlewood Park is a short distance west on Big Bend. Castlewood Park became part of the Missouri State Park system. However, Valley Park began to boom with development. It had railroads, the Meramec River, and what even then were considered main roads. Railroads played a big role in the town in the late 19th century and early 20th century. At the time, the St. Louis-San Francisco (Frisco) and Missouri Pacific served Valley Park; now it is Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. At one time, the Meramec River had barge traffic. In 1917, the town became incorporated. As many as 70 trains passed through Valley Park on any given day. The town became a center for industry with the building of the glass factory and other industries. Grocery stores and restaurants opened up; churches went from being mission churches to being congregations. Valley Park had a Saddle and Paddle Club located at Marshall and what is now Highway 141. In the Great Flood of 1913, the main bridge was destroyed along with several factories causing extensive damage to the city's economy. St. Louis families would board the trains for summer vacations, weekends, or second family homes along the Meramec River. Clubhouses were built on the banks of the Meramec. Some of those clubhouses stood until the 1990s. The 1992 and 1993 floods destroyed them beyond repair. The remains were removed in order to allow for construction of the Meramec Valley River Basin Levee. The levee had a major flood test in March 2008; it saved Valley Park from a devastating flood. Most of the town also survived major flooding of the Meramec in 2015 and 2017, which forced closings of interstate and state roads in the area, and flooded other small towns. The intersection of Highway 141 and Interstate 44 was flooded and closed from December to January 2016. This area flooded again in 2017, cutting off wide areas of cross-country traffic. The Frisco Hotel is an historic building located at 24 Front Street which was adapted as the Frisco Train Store. Several parks are within the city limits, including Vance Trails, Leonard, and Brignole parks, and Meramec Landing for anglers and boaters. Simpson St. Louis County Park and Lake and Lone Elk County Park (which also has a wild bird sanctuary) are also within the city limits. Completion of the levee will include trails on top, overlooking the Meramec River for hiking and biking, as part of the Ozark Greenway Trails. In 2010, Valley Park annexed Peerless Park, a former city that disincorporated in 1998https://www.stltoday.com/suburban-journals/metro/valley-park-seeks-to- annex-former-peerless-park/article_b619a07c-ac63-5dbd-9240-d12cd0dac593.html Education Valley Park is served by Valley Park School District and is home to one high school, Valley Park High School. Valley Park has a public library, the Valley Park Community Library. Controversy In 2006, Valley Park was featured in local, state and national news media when the City's Board of Aldermen passed an ordinance almost identical to the ordinance passed by the city council of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which penalized landlords who rented to \\"illegal aliens\\", businesses who employed \\"illegal aliens\\", and others who aided and abetted \\"illegal immigration.\\" Several landlords, along with the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council, filed suit against the city. The lawsuit was supported by Bryan Cave, Washington University Law School, St. Louis University Legal Clinic, the ACLU, MALDEF, the Hispanic Ministry of the Catholic Church and several private attorneys, who won a temporary restraining order. Led by then-mayor Jeffrey Whitteaker, the Board of Aldermen amended the ordinance twice, and the coalition opposing the ordinances won restraining orders against both amended ordinances. The ordinances were invalidated following their repeal. A subsequent appeal by the city was dismissed as moot, in the Missouri Court of Appeals, as the subject ordinances had been repealed. Thereafter, following the city's passage and publication of an ordinance prohibiting the knowing employment of unlawful aliens, a subsequent suit was brought in state court, subsequently removed by the city to federal court. After the city abandoned its efforts to punish landlords who could not prove their tenants were lawfully present and narrowed the enforcement mechanism for the remainder of the ordinance, the district court upheld the remainder of the ordinance. The plaintiffs filed an appeal on procedural issues and asked for the district court decision to be vacated. The appeal was denied and the decision of the district court was affirmed. The city's immigration ordinances have never been enforced. The Missouri General Assembly, in the 2008 legislative session, enacted legislation, to take effect in August 2009, which included language similar to Valley Park's unlawful employment ordinance, to be enforced by the Missouri Attorney General. The state legislation had been under discussion and review for a significant time in both the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives. It remains unlawful, by Valley Park ordinance, to knowingly hire unlawful aliens within the city. Geography Valley Park is located at (38.555320, -90.488304). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Attractions The Museum of Transportation was founded in 1944 and was at one time an original mainline of the Pacific Railroad. It was one of the first railroad tunnels west of the Mississippi River. The tunnel and depot are now on the National Register of Historic Places. With over seventy locomotives that visitors can look at and climb aboard, the museum has the most complete collection of American rail power anywhere, and its collection of automobiles, buses, streetcars, aircraft, horse-drawn vehicles and river boat material reflects the ever-changing nature of transportation. Guided walking tours and rides on the miniature Abbott Railroad (in season) are all part of the fun. There is a concession stand and gift shop of transportation memorabilia. The World Bird Sanctuary is located on 305 acres of hardwood forest adjacent to Lone Elk Park. Visitors can see famous or lesser-known birds of prey and other wild birds. Throughout the years birds are on display, and at listed times there are bird shows. The sanctuary was founded in 1977 by ornithologist Walter C. Crawford, Jr. Crawford began his career at the St. Louis City Zoo. Crawford, working with Wild Kingdom star Marlin Perkins, recognized a need for an organization dedicated to birds of prey. Mr. Crawford continued to direct the organization he founded until his death. He also traveled nationwide to speak at conventions and banquets with his humorous and inspirational message of environmental conservation. Today, Dawn Griffard is the executive director of World Bird Sanctuary. Lone Elk Park also contains animals such as elk, deer, buffalo, and turkeys, which can be viewed on a drive through the park. Meramec Landing sits along the Meramec River. It is a small area to park and unload a boat or jet ski into the river, or for fishing. Simpson Park is located on the border of Valley Park next to Kirkwood. It has a large lake for boating and fishing, as well as a biking and hiking trail that goes all the way around the lake in a wooded area, and then stretches far outside the park down to the Meramec River. It also has a large playground and plenty of open fields to play soccer, baseball or even fly a kite. Buder Park is located on the other side of the Meramec River and is considered a St. Louis County/Valley Park park. This park offers fishing access to the river, and open fields for flying kites, or playing football, soccer, or baseball. However, it is best known for its model plane activities. People from all over St. Louis and the surrounding counties come to this park to fly their model planes or fly tight lines. It has two tight lining tracks and a full runway for model airplanes.

The population was 22,995 at the 2010 census. Webster Groves is one of the more affluent communities in Missouri, ranking 41st in per-capita income. In 2008, it was ranked #9 in Family Circle Magazine's list of the \\"10 Best Cities for Families in America\\".Webster Groves In Top 10 For \\"Best Town For Families\\", a July 18, 2008 article from Webster-Kirkwood Times The city is home to the main campus of Webster University. Geography Webster Groves is located at (38.587702, -90.354366). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Webster Groves is bounded to the east by Shrewsbury, on the north by Maplewood, Brentwood and Rock Hill, to the west by Glendale, Oakland, and Crestwood, and on the south by Affton and Marlborough. History Webster Groves is approximately west of the St. Louis city limits, and southwest of downtown St. Louis, in an area known to fur trappers and Missouri, Osage and Dakota indigenous people, until 1802, as the Dry Ridge. In the early 19th century, this region, once a part of the Louisiana Territory, was changing from Spanish to French ownership, and a system of land grants was inaugurated to promote immigration. During the early period of Spanish rule, officials gave land to settlers as a check against the English. As part of this program, in 1802, Gr√©goire Sarpy was granted by Charles de Hault Delassus, the last Spanish lieutenant governor of the Illinois Country. The land grant covered the major area now known as Webster Groves. Webster Groves' location on the Pacific Railroad line led to its development as a suburb. In the late 19th century, overcrowding, congestion, and unhealthy conditions in St. Louis prompted urban residents to leave the city for quieter, safer surroundings. In 1892 the developers of Webster Park, an early housing subdivision, promoted the new community as the \\"Queen of the Suburbs\\", offering residents superb housing options in a country-like atmosphere, as well as a swift commute to downtown St. Louis jobs. The first public school in the community was Douglass Elementary School, founded as a separate but equal school for African-American children in the post-Civil War black community in North Webster. In the 1920s, the school grew into Douglass High School, the only high school in St. Louis County for black students. The school operated until 1956, when the U.S. Supreme Court required desegregation. As a suburban municipality, Webster Groves has its origins as five separate communities along adjacent railroad lines. Webster, Old Orchard, Webster Park, Tuxedo Park, and Selma merged in 1896 to implement public services and develop a unified city government. Since then, Webster Groves' tree-lined streets and abundance of single family homes have continued to attract people to the area as a \\"great place to live, work and play\\", not solely for the wealthy commuter suburb that early developers envisioned but for families that cut across all socioeconomic lines. The geographic and economic diversity of Webster Groves is evident in its variety of neighborhoods. In the 1960s, Webster Groves was featured in 16 In Webster Groves, a televised documentary that writer Jonathan Franzen, a native of Webster Groves, described in his memoir The Discomfort Zone as an \\"early experiment in hour-long prime-time sociology\\". According to Franzen, it depicted Webster Groves High School, which he attended only a few years after the documentary's broadcast, as being \\"ruled by a tiny elite of 'soshies' who made life gray and marginal for the great majority of students who weren‚Äôt 'football captains,' 'cheerleaders' or 'dance queens'\\"; the school was depicted as having a \\"student body obsessed with grades, cars and money.\\" Franzen thought \\"the Webster Groves depicted in it bears minimal resemblance to the friendly, unpretentious town I knew when I was growing up.\\" Webster Groves was the setting for the 1974-5 NBC television series Lucas Tanner. In the wake of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, Webster Groves High School was again profiled, this time in Time, which described Webster Groves as a \\"pretty town of old elms and deep porches\\" and a \\"mix of $90,000 cottages and $750,000 homes, young marrieds and old-line families and transient middle managers assigned to a stint in the St. Louis office who are looking for a comfortable place to settle and keep their kids on the track toward prosperity.\\" The Webster Groves High School Statesmen maintain one of the oldest high school football rivalries west of the Mississippi River with the Pioneers of Kirkwood High School. The two teams typically play each other in the Missouri Turkey Day Game each Thanksgiving, if their playoff schedules permit it; they also have faced each other in the state playoff tournaments several times in recent years.

Genevieve ( ) is a city in Ste. Genevieve Township and is the county seat of Ste. Genevieve County, Missouri, United States. The population was 4,410 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1735 by French Canadian colonists and settlers from east of the river, it was the first organized European settlement west of the Mississippi River in present-day Missouri. History Founded around 1740 by Canadien settlers and migrants from settlements in the Illinois Country just east of the Mississippi River, Ste. Genevi√®ve is the oldest permanent European settlement in Missouri. It was named for Saint Genevieve (who lived in the 5th century AD), the patron saint of Paris, the capital of France. While most residents were of French-Canadian descent, many of the founding families had been in the Illinois Country for two or three generations. It is one of the oldest colonial settlements west of the Mississippi River.Carl J. Ekberg, Colonial Ste. Genevieve: An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier, Gerald, MO: The Patrice Press, 1985, pp. 15-20 This area was known as New France, Illinois Country, or the Upper Louisiana territory. Traditional accounts suggested a founding of 1735 or so, but the historian Carl Ekberg has documented a more likely founding about 1750. The population to the east of the river needed more land, as the soils in the older villages had become exhausted. Improved relations with hostile Native Americans, such as the Osage, made settlement possible.Ekberg (1985), Colonial Ste. Genevieve, p. 25 Prior to the French Canadian settlers, indigenous peoples known as the Mississippian culture and earlier cultures had been living in the region for more than a thousand years. At the time of settlement, however, no Indian tribe lived nearby on the west bank. Jacques-Nicolas Bellin's map of 1755, the first to show Ste. Genevieve in the Illinois Country, showed the Kaskaskia natives on the east side of the river, but no Indian village on the west side within 100 miles of Ste. Genevieve.Ekberg (1985), Colonial Ste. Genevieve, p. 87 Osage hunting and war parties did enter the area from the north and west. The region had been relatively abandoned by 1500, likely due to environmental exhaustion, after the peak of Mississippian-culture civilization at Cahokia, the center of the mounds culture. At the time of its founding, Ste. Genevieve was the last of a triad of French Canadian settlements in this area of the mid-Mississippi Valley region. About five miles northeast of Ste. Genevieve on the east side of the river was Fort de Chartres (in the Illinois Country); it stood as the official capital of the area. Kaskaskia, which became Illinois‚Äô first capital upon statehood, was located about five miles southeast. Prairie du Rocher and Cahokia, Illinois were also early local French colonial settlements on the east side of the river. Following defeat by the British in the French and Indian War, in 1762 with the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France secretly ceded the area of the west bank of the Mississippi River to Spain, which formed Louisiana (New Spain). The Spanish moved the capital of Upper Louisiana from Fort de Chartres fifty miles upriver to St. Louis. They ruled with a light hand and often through mostly French-speaking officials. Although under Spanish control for more than 40 years, Ste. Genevieve retained its French language, customs and character. In 1763, the French ceded the land east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris that ended Europe's Seven Years' War, also known on the North American front as the French and Indian War. French-speaking people from Canada and settlers east of the Mississippi went west to escape British rule; they also flocked to Ste. Genevieve after George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763. This transformed all of the captured French land between the Mississippi and the Appalachian Mountains, except Quebec, into an Indian reserve. The king required settlers to leave or get British permission to stay. These requirements were regularly violated by European-American settlers, who resented efforts to restrict their expansion. During the 1770s, Little Osage and Missouri tribes repeatedly raided Ste. Genevieve to steal settlers' horses. But the fur trade, marriage of French-Canadian men with Native American women, and other commercial dealings created many ties between Native Americans and the Canadiens. During the 1780s, some Shawnee and Lenape (Delaware) migrated to the west side of the Mississippi following American victory in its Revolutionary War. The tribes established villages south of Ste. Genevieve. The Peoria also moved near Ste. Genevieve in the 1780s but had a peaceful relationship with the village. It was not until the 1790s that the Big Osage pressed the settlement harder; they conducted repeated raids and killed some settlers. In addition, they attacked the Peoria and Shawnee.Ekberg (1985), Colonial Ste. Genevieve, pp. 87-104 While at one point Spanish administrators wanted to attack the Big Osage, there were not sufficient French settlers to recruit for a militia to do so. The Big Osage had 1250 men in their village, and lived in the prairie. In 1794 Francisco Luis H√©ctor de Carondelet, the Spanish governor at New Orleans, appointed brothers Pierre Chouteau and Auguste Chouteau of St. Louis to have exclusive trading privileges with the Big Osage. They built a fort and trading post on the Osage River in Big Osage territory. While the natives did not entirely cease their raids on Ste. Genevieve, commercial diplomacy and rewards of the fur trade eased some relations. =Le Vieux Village (Old Ste. Genevieve c. 1750)= Following the great flood of 1785, the town moved from its initial location on the floodplain of the Mississippi River, to its present location two miles north and about a half mile inland. It continued to prosper as a village devoted to agriculture, especially wheat, maize and tobacco production. Most of the families were yeomen farmers, although there was a wealthier level among the residents. The village raised sufficient grain to send many tons of flour annually for sale to Lower Louisiana and New Orleans. This was essential to the survival of the southern colonies, which could not grow sufficient grain in their climate. In 1807, Frederick Bates, the secretary of the Louisiana Territory after the United States made the Louisiana Purchase, noted Ste. Genevieve was \\"the most wealthy village in Louisiana\\" (meaning the full Territory).Ekberg (1985), Colonial Ste. Genevieve, p. 177 =Architecture= The oldest buildings of Ste. Genevieve, described as \\"French Creole colonial\\", were all built during Spanish rule of the late 18th century. The most distinctive buildings of this period were the \\"vertical wooden post\\" constructions where walls of buildings were built based on wood \\"posts\\" either dug into the ground (poteaux en terre) or set on a raised stone or brick foundation (poteaux sur solle). This was different from the log cabin style associated with the Anglo-American frontier settlements of the United States northeast, mid-Atlantic and Upper South, for which logs are stacked horizontally. The most distinctive of the vertical post houses are poteaux en terre (\\"posts-in-the-ground\\") where the walls made of upright wooden posts do not support the floor. The floor is supported by separate stone pillars. Partially set into dirt, the walls of such buildings were extremely vulnerable to flood damage, termites and rot. Three of the five surviving poteaux en terre houses in the nation are in Ste. Genevieve. The other two are located in Pascagoula, Mississippi and near Natchitoches, Louisiana. Most of the oldest buildings in the city are poteaux sur solle (\\"posts-on-a-sill\\"). One of the oldest structures is the Louis Bolduc House built in 1792, which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. The Louis Bolduc originally built a smaller house in 1770 at Ste. Genevieve's first riverfront location. Although much of the house was severely damaged by flooding, parts were dismantled and moved north as the community developed the new site in 1785. Bolduc incorporated these materials into his new and larger house, built in 1792‚Äì1793. The three large ground-floor rooms expressed Bolduc's wealth. Other structures of note are the 1806 La Maison de Guibourd Historic House, the 1818 Felix Vall√© House State Historic Site, the 1792 Beauvais-Amoureux House, the 1790s Bequette-Ribault House, and the 1808 Old Louisiana Academy, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Culture= For decades, Ste. Genevieve was chiefly an agricultural community. The habitants raised chiefly wheat and corn (maize), as well as tobacco. They produced more wheat than residents of St. Louis, and their grain products were critical to survival of the French community at New Orleans. The village followed traditional practices: most of the townspeople lived on lots in town. They farmed land held in a common large field. This land was assigned and cultivated in the French style, in long, narrow strips that extended back from the river to the hills (at the first location) so that each settler would have some waterfront. Only the exterior of the Grand Champ (Big Field) was fenced, but each owner of land was responsible for fencing his portion, to keep out livestock.Ekberg (1985), Colonial Ste. Genevieve, p. 130-132 The habitants used the same types of implements and plows as did farmers in 18th-century France. They used teams of oxen to pull the wheeled plows. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1804, Anglo-Americans as well as German immigrants migrated to the village. It became more oriented to trade and merchants, but villagers retained many of their French cultural ways. The Sisters of St. Joseph, a French teaching order, established a convent in the town, whose sisters taught in a Catholic school. The current Ste. Genevieve Catholic Church was built in 1876 and modeled after the Gothic style of those in France. It was the third Catholic church built by the villagers. Ste. Genevieve continues to celebrate its French cultural heritage with numerous annual events. Among them are La Guiann√©e, a celebration associated with Christmas; French Fest; Jour de F√™te;Jour de F√™te King's Ball and many others. =The \\"French Connection\\"= The Ste. Genevieve-Modoc Ferry across the Mississippi River to Illinois is nicknamed the \\"French Connection\\" because of its link to other French colonial sites in the area. It runs daily unless the river is flooding. Geography Ste. Genevieve is located along the west bank of the Mississippi River near the Illinois state line along Interstate 55, U.S. Route 61, and Missouri Route 32, approximately south-southeast of St. Louis and north-northwest of Memphis, Tennessee.

The town plat consisted of fifty lots, each 60-by-130 feet. The impetus for the town was the Quincy, Missouri & Pacific railway, which laid tracks close by in the early 1880s. A rail depot was built with donations from area farmers, and in 1881 C. B. Comstock built a store and warehouse. Around the same time a small frame building was moved from the nearby village of Kiddville by S.H. Davis who used it as a post office when he became Green City's first postmaster. Green City was officially incorporated on February 10, 1882. Green City, Missouri, is the site of Widmark Airport (FAA LID: MO83).

When originally established, it consisted of just seventeen blocks with 246 lots. Additions of three blocks and nine blocks were made in January and May 1882, respectively.History of Adair, Sullivan, Putnam, and Schuyler Counties, Missouri, Goodspeed Publishing Co., Chicago, 1888 It was sometime during that spring of 1882 that the town name was changed to Humphreys. The town experienced rapid early growth, being located on the Quincy, Missouri & Pacific Railroad, with the train depot being constructed in August 1881. James Stringer established the first store in June 1881, and by the end of the year the new town supported four hotels, two drug stores, two dry goods stores, a general merchandise, and a millinery. A harness shop joined the business list in 1884 and blacksmiths in 1886 and 1887.The Complete History of Sullivan County, Missouri, Vol. 1 1836-1900. By Gladys Crumpacker, History Publications Inc. 1977 Light industry of a sort came to Humphreys in 1882 with the establishment of the Humphreys Milling Company, a steam-powered flour mill located in a large three-story building. It was said to have produced up to twenty-five barrels of flour per day at peak capacity. The citizenry's need for news was met by the Humphreys Gazette, a weekly newspaper founded in late 1881 by Joseph S. Wright. The name was changed to the Humphreys Advance in 1884 but the venture ultimately proved unprofitable and publication ceased in August, 1887. = Education = Humphreys College & Business Institute as sketched in 1887. The children of Humphreys were educated in a typical one- room rural schoolhouse, located about three-fourths of a mile northwest of the community until 1885. At that time, the elementary and secondary education were combined with and housed in the building containing the Humphreys College and Business Institute. The College was established in 1884 on four acres of land donated by James M. Stringer. A large two-story brick structure was constructed between June and September 1884, with the first class admission beginning on September 29 of the aforementioned year. Humphreys College was co-education and offered two course tracks of study‚Äîpreparatory and collegiate, with a reported enrollment in 1887 of 157 students. No dormitories were constructed; however, ample housing was available in the town's hotels and private homes.Goodspeed's History of Adair, Sullivan, Putnam...

The smallest class was 1938 with only three graduates, while the largest was the Class of 1937 with thirteen diploma recipients. Due to economic conditions the junior and senior years were discontinued between 1932 and 1937, and students in those grades had to finish their education elsewhere, primarily Milan, which was readily accessible via rail.Graduating Classes of Sullivan County, Missouri: 1891-1993, Published by The Milan Standard newspaper, July 1993 The Pollock high school closed for good following the 1939 graduation and all secondary students incorporated into the Milan school district.

The population was 8,386 at the 2010 census, and 8,254 in the 2018 estimate. The local government has a council-manager model. Nevada is the home of Cottey College, a private women's college affiliated with the PEO Sisterhood based in Des Moines, Iowa. History When French explorers entered the region in the late 17th century, they encountered the indigenous Osage people, who controlled a vast area including parts of what are now several states. The Osage Village State Historic Site, formerly known as the Carrington Osage Village Site, is located on a hilltop above the Osage River valley. Archeological evidence shows an Osage band had nearly 200 lodges and an estimated population of 2000 to 3000 here; they occupied the area from about 1700-1775. They were the most powerful people in the region and were integral to the fur trade. After the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase, it gradually forced the Osage through the 19th century to cede their lands and remove to Indian Territory. This site has been designated as a National Historic Landmark for its significance to the Osage people and American history. Nevada was originally called \\"Hog Eye\\" by European-American settlers, and under that name was platted in 1855. The town's name was changed to Nevada by circuit and county clerk DeWitt C. Hunter, after Nevada City, California, where he had been a gold miner. From 1897‚àí1933, Nevada was home of the Weltmer Institute of Suggestive Therapeutics, founded by Sidney Abram Weltmer and Joseph H. Kelly. Weltmer bought a 17-room mansion, built in 1886 by Frank P. Anderson, a successful railroad builder. They wanted a facility large enough so that they could have patients stay for extended periods in a kind of boarding house. During the early 20th century, this healing institute attracted thousands of clients who believed in Weltmer's cures by mental healing. People paid $100 to stay for a 10-day course of treatment. They also paid for instructional classes. The Institute also conducted a large mail order business for classes and a kind of treatment by mail. It held lectures attracting several hundred people. The Institute attracted so many clients that the railroad added new trains to its schedule serving the town. In addition, the volume of mail associated with the Institute's business resulted in the post office being classified as first class, and the government building a new, larger post office to handle it. The Weltmer Institute became the center of associated wellness systems and practitioners in town, which increased in prosperity. It attracted psychotherapists, clairvoyants, and people promising various types of miracle cures for such illnesses as tuberculosis, which then had no cure. In the early 20th century, the town attracted many enthusiasts of what were known as the New Thought Movement. In 1905 the Weltmer Auditorium was the site of the Fifth Annual Convention of the New Thought Federation, held on September 26‚Äì29, 1905. Ernest Weltmer, eldest son of Sidney A. Weltmer, was Secretary of the Federation and helped open the convention. Among the several speakers from across the country was Grace Mann Brown, and entertainment was provided by singers including the Weltmer Quartette. Mrs. Brown served as President of the Federation the following year. In 1916, New Thought followers returned to Nevada for the second International Conference of the movement, and Sidney A. Weltmer was among the speakers. After Weltmer's death and the closure of the Institute in 1933, the mansion was sold for use as a funeral home. By late 2004, the building was slated for demolition in order to redevelop the site. Although some residents were interested in its history and the Weltmer Institute, the building was never nominated as a significant historic building or classified for preservation. The City Council approved it being scheduled to be demolished in late 2004 for other development. Significant historic properties in Nevada include the Infirmary Building, Missouri State Hospital Number 3, Vernon County Courthouse, and Vernon County Jail, Sheriff's House and Office, which are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Nat. Fran√ßaise) Jaufre Rudel (Jaufr√© in modern Occitan) was the Prince of Blaye (Princes de Blaia) and a troubadour of the early-mid 12th century, who probably died during the Second Crusade, in or after 1147. He is noted for developing the theme of \\"love from afar\\" (amor de lonh or amour de loin) in his songs. Very little is known about his life, but a reference to him in a contemporary song by Marcabru describes him as being oltra maracross the sea, probably on the Second Crusade in 1147. Probably he was the son of Girard, also castellan of Blaye, and who was titled \\"prince\\" in an 1106 charter. Girard's father was the first to carry the title, being called princeps Blaviensis as early as 1090.Gaston Paris (1912), M√©langes de litt√©rature fran√ßaise du moyen age (New York: Burt Franklin, ), pp. 498-503. During his father's lifetime the suzerainty of Blaye was disputed between the Counts of Poitou and the Counts of Angoul√™me. Shortly after the succession of William VIII of Poitou, who had inherited it from his father, Blaye was taken by Wulgrin II of Angoul√™me, who probably vested Jaufre with it. According to one hypothesis, based on flimsy evidence, Wulgrin was Jaufre's father. According to his legendary vida, or fictionalised biography, he was inspired to go on Crusade upon hearing from returning pilgrims of the beauty of Countess Hodierna of Tripoli, and that she was his amor de lonh, his far-off love. The legend claims that he fell sick on the journey and was brought ashore in Tripoli a dying man. Countess Hodierna is said to have come down from her castle on hearing the news, and Rudel died in her arms. This romantic but unlikely story seems to have been derived from the enigmatic nature of Rudel's verse and his presumed death on the Crusade. Seven of Rudel's poems have survived to the present day, four of them with music. His composition Lanquan li jorn is thought to be the model for the Minnesinger Walther von der Vogelweide's crusade song Allerest lebe ich mir werde (Pal√§stinalied). Rudel in legend and literature A Romantic portrayal of Jaufre singing to his love Nineteenth-century Romanticism found his legend irresistible. It was the subject of poems by Ludwig Uhland, Heinrich Heine, Robert Browning (Rudel to the Lady of Tripoli) and Giosu√© Carducci (Jaufr√© Rudel). Algernon Charles Swinburne returned several times to the story in his poetry, in The Triumph of Time, The Death of Rudel and the now-lost Rudel in Paradise (also titled The Golden House). In The Triumph of Time, he summarises the legend: > There lived a singer in France of old By the tideless dolorous midland sea. > In a land of sand and ruin and gold There shone one woman, and none but she. > And finding life for her love's sake fail, Being fain to see her, he bade > set sail, Touched land, and saw her as life grew cold, And praised God, > seeing; and so died he. > Died, praising God for his gift and grace: For she bowed down to him > weeping, and said \\"Live\\"; and her tears were shed on his face Or ever the > life in his face was shed. The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung > Once, and her close lips touched him and clung Once, and grew one with his > lips for a space; And so drew back, and the man was dead. Sir Nizamat Jung Bahadur, of Hyderabad, also wrote an epic poem on the subject, Rudel of Blaye, in 1926. The French dramatist Edmond Rostand took the legend of Rudel and Hodierna as the basis for his 1895 verse drama La Princesse Lointaine, but reassigned the female lead from Hodierna to her jilted daughter Melisende, played by Sarah Bernhardt. More recently, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho has written an opera about Rudel and Cl√©mence (the name used for Hodierna) called L'amour de loin, with a libretto by Amin Maalouf, which was given its world premiere at the Salzburg Festival in 2000 and its US premiere at the Santa Fe Opera in 2002.

The population was 4,134 at the 2010 census. The city was named for Union Pacific Railroad President Sidney Dillon. History Dillon was founded in the Beaverhead Valley as a railroad town in 1880 by Union Pacific Railroad President Sidney Dillon. The town's location was selected by the railroad because of its proximity to gold mines in the area. The first ore discovered in the Dillon area was silver. Gold was first discovered at Grasshopper Creek in 1862, precipitating a flood of immigration to the area. The last real gold rush in the area occurred near Argenta in 1920 and lasted for 30 years. Dillon served as a central location for transporting goods to nearby boomtowns such as Bannack, Argenta, Glen, and Virginia City. In 1881, Dillon became part of a contentious battle with Bannack to become the county seat of Beaverhead County. The first brick building in Dillon was built in 1882. In 1884, Dillon became an incorporated town and began building sidewalks and permanent dwellings for the residents. While many of the gold mining towns around Dillon died, Dillon was able to thrive due to the railroad and talc mining in the area. A cattle industry was established in 1865. The agriculturally rich Beaverhead Valley became an ideal location for sheep ranching, introduced in 1869. Dillon was once the largest exporter of sheep wool in Montana.

The population was 428 at the 2010 census. Source and derivation of name The two words of the name of \\"Lodge Grass\\" are not usually put together, in that order, to make a commonly used name, or meaningful phrase. This is because the name \\"Lodge Grass\\" came from a mistake of interpretation of the Crow Indian name for \\"Greasy Grass\\". Lodge Grass is named after Lodge Grass Creek, which flows through the town, but as explained in a video viewed in 2013 on YouTube by Joe Medicine Crow, Crow tribal historian, the correct Crow name for Lodge Grass Creek is Greasy Grass Creek. Crow tradition holds that when the Crows camped on the bottoms of the Lodge Grass Creek or the Little Bighorn River in the spring and summer, when the grass in the valley would be high and when the dew was heavy the bellies and legs of the horses would become wet and glisten as if covered with grease. In another traditional version of the same derivation of the name, when the Crows camped on the creek and walked through the thick grass in the morning when it held dew, their moccasins and leggings would get wet and they would look greasy. Thus the Crows called the valley areas of the Little Bighorn River and Lodge Grass Creek \\"the Greasy Grass\\". The Sioux also called the Little Horn River the Greasy Grass Creek. The Crow name for \\"greasy\\" and the Crow name for \\"lodge\\" sound very much alike. The Crow word for \\"greasy\\" is Tah-shay, and the Crow word for \\"lodge\\" is Ah-shay, and the words sound so much alike that an early interpreter mistakenly interpreted the Crow name for \\"Greasy Grass\\" as \\"Lodge Grass\\". The misinterpreted name stuck, and so the creek, and then the town became known as Lodge Grass. Geography Lodge Grass is located at (45.313419, -107.366733).

It is part of the Billings, Montana Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 79 at the 2010 census. Bearcreek uses the Mayor/Council form of government. The town of Bearcreek was named for Bear Creek, which runs through the middle of town. Bearcreek came into existence due to coal mines and grew rapidly following the building of a short line railroad connecting the Bearcreek mines to the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1906. Between 1906 and 1953, the mines at Bearcreek produced large volumes of coal, which was a higher grade than other regional sources, from the extensive underground coal mining deposits. The mines were located along the creek and also in the surrounding coulees. The development of the coal mines after 1906 drew miners to the area. They came from other parts of America, and from Serbia, Montenegro, Germany, Scotland and Italy. The recent immigrants built separate ethnic-based communities in the steep coulees that run down into Bearcreek, with names like Washoe, New Caledonia, Chickentown, Scotch Coulee, International, and Stringtown. At one time in the 1920s and 1930s the population of Bearcreek combined with the other surrounding small communities was close to 3,000 persons. Bear Creek and the surrounding communities had seven mercantiles, a bank, two hotels, two billiard halls, a brickyard, numerous saloons, and Bearcreek sported concrete sidewalks and their own water system. Allegedly, the town had no churches. The economy of Bear Creek was based on coal. The Smith Mine Disaster in 1943, followed by the decline in demand for coal in the late 1940s and 1950s caused the closure of the connecting railroad in 1953 and subsequently most of the coal mines, and the population declined steadily to less than 100 persons. Many buildings in Bearcreek and the surrounding communities were moved to other towns or demolished, and only a few structures remain. The town is home to the Bear Creek Saloon which hosts fundraising pig races throughout the year. In addition, Bearcreek plays host every autumn to Montana Falconer Symposium, the state's largest gathering of falcon trainers and birds of prey enthusiasts. When the legality of betting on pig races was challenged, a law was passed‚ÄîMontana Code Annotated 23-5-502(b)  stating that \\"Only a licensee of premises that are located in an incorporated city or town with a population of less than 100 or located outside the boundaries of an incorporated city or town and that are appropriately licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises under 23-5-119 may conduct a race between animals and conduct one or more sports pools on the race. The race may be conducted only if it is between pigs, gerbils, or hamsters and is conducted on the premises but outside of interior areas of the establishment where food and beverages are usually stored, prepared, or served.\\" Bearcreek is the only incorporated city or town in Montana with a population of less than 100. Geography Bearcreek is located at (45.159849, -109.156322). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History Bearcreek owes its existence to area coal mining that began in the 1890s to supply coal for the Northern Pacific Railway and the Anaconda Company. The Bearcreek Post Office was established on November 22, 1905 with Sarah Criger as the town's first postmaster. The town was platted and incorporated after the arrival of the Montana, Wyoming & Southern Railroad in 1906. =The Montana Wyoming and Southern Railroad= The Montana, Wyoming and Southern (or MW&S;) was an independent privately owned short rail spur built in 1906 from the main Northern Pacific Railroad (NP) line at Bridger, Montana through Belfry and on to the mines in and around Bearcreek. The tremendous amounts of coal extracted from the Bearcreek mines all traveled over this 21 mile long spur. The MW&S; was built by speculators hoping it could be immediately sold to the NP who used the high grade coal from the Bearcreek mines in their engines. However, since the MW&S;'s single outlet to the wider world was all through the NP terminus at Bridger, the Northern Pacific did not buy this short line but sought to control it through business interactions. The MW&S; was forced to operate on its own under constant financial pressure from the NP, and even though it shipped large volumes of high grade coal from Bearcreek it was often in financial and operational difficulties. The Bearcreek mine owners were in turn completely dependent on the MW&S; to move their shipments. The MW&S; existed as a vacillating and weak but critical link to the continued prosperity of the community of Bearcreek. =Attraction of American and Foreign Born Workers= After the MW&S; railroad was built, Bearcreek expanded rapidly as coal production increased. American and foreign- born workers moved there, drawn by the expanding coal mining activity and the promise of steady work. By 1917, the mines around Bearcreek were employing 1,200 men. As the miners came they settled in small communities built in the small steep coulees running down into Bear Creek. At its peak, Bearcreek and the surrounding communities of Washoe, New Caledonia, Chickentown, Scotch Coulee, International, and Stringtown, had a population of about 3,000 people, most of whom worked in the coal mines. From 1906 onward, Bearcreek attracted a large contingent of Serbian/Slavic immigrants from Serbia and Montenegro. The many Serb families brought their culture and their customs to Bearcreek. With its diverse ethnic composition, Bearcreek traditionally celebrated Christmas twice, on December 25 and January 6, the Serbian Orthodox Church holiday.Montana Place Names Companion Website. Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers. Montana Place Names from Alzada to Zortman. Montana Historical Society Press. =Smith Mine Disaster= On February 27, 1943, the Smith Mine #3 exploded in the worst coal mining accident in the history of Montana. Of the 77 men who had gone underground at the start of the shift, only 3 survived. The bodies were all recovered. Thirty had died instantly. Forty four of the miners survived the initial blast, but were trapped underground in isolated parts of the mine, dying from initial injuries or from suffocation from methane and carbon monoxide poisoning. Some left farewell notes to their families. The Smith Mine never reopened and this disaster dealt a severe blow to the community. =Events after the Smith Mine Disaster= In the late 1940s and early 1950s, there was a marked trend away from coal consumption in the American economy, due to utilization of natural gas or fuel oil for heating and the increasing use of diesel to power locomotives, all of which combined to caused the demand for coal to fall. Bearcreek's coal production went into a steady decline. After the abrupt closure of the Smith Mine, and as the demand for coal declined so did the financial health of the Montana, Wyoming and Southern, which had always been precarious. The railroad ceased to operate in 1953. When the railroad ceased to function so did most of mining activity in and around Bearcreek, since the railroad was the only efficient way for mines to ship their coal to market. Some mines struggled on, but the last mine closed in the 1970s. After the closure of the railroad followed by most of the mines the town's population rapidly dwindled, eventually declining to under 100 people. The rails and ties were removed from the railroad bed and over time the many empty miners houses that once filled the coulees along Bear Creek were sold and moved, or they simply sat vacant and deteriorated until they were torn down. Today, the many surrounding communities that made up Bearceek are almost completely gone, with only a few houses marking Washoe, currently the largest of them. In the last decades there is some growth of the tiny remaining community of Bearcreek thanks to its proximity to Red Lodge which has developed an economy to serve tourists who come to ski, or to use summer cabins, or to pass through to Yellowstone Park.Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers.

A rail line was constructed into town, and coal shipments began in June 1889. The boundaries of the Crow Reservation were redrawn October 15, 1892, opening the whole area to settlement. From then until the 1930s, coal mining defined the town.Christensen, Bonnie. Red Lodge and the Mythic West. Lawrence: U of Kansas P, 2000, xii. In the late 19th century, many new settlers came to Red Lodge, MT. The majority came from Italy, Scotland, Wales, England, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. By the mid-1880s, migrants were still outnumbered by large numbers of Native Americans. By 1892 the population reached 1,180. In 1896, Red Lodge had twenty saloons and, as the library records show, riotous and violent living was characteristic of the town. By 1906 the population had grown to 4,000 and by 1911 this had increased to 5,000. Red Lodge suffered in the Great Depression, which forced many mines to close. To offset this downturn, the manufacture of illegal bootleg liquor, labeled syrup, became an economic mainstay and was sold as far away as Chicago and San Francisco.

The downtown has been redeveloped since the mid-1980s for historic and cultural tourism, as the Red Lodge Commercial Historic District. The buildings in downtown Red Lodge fell into disrepair in large part because population had dropped from its 1915 peak of 6,000 people to about 2,000. As of 2006, an estimate suggests that the population of Red Lodge may increase from about 1,200 people in the winter to over 1,800 people during the summer tourist season, arriving via the Beartooth Highway. Government Red Lodge is the county seat of Carbon County and is an incorporated city, governed via the mayor/council system.

The mining towns of Barker, Galena Creek, and Hughesville soon sprang up in the area. Among the many small mining camps which were erected was Jericho, which soon went bust.Miller, p. 165. In July 1881, three prospectors from Barker‚ÄîJames LeRoy Neihart, John O'Brien, and Richard HarleyAarstad, et al., p. 191.‚Äîdiscovered silver near the present-day town of Neihart and established the Queen of the Mountains Mine.Weed, p. 402. When the news reached Barker, several parties of prospectors headed for the areaWeed, p. 403. and established a new mining camp on Belt Creek named Canyon City. Canyon City was later renamed Neihart after the aforementioned James LeRoy Neihart, who was also an uncle of poet John Neihardt. The mining district was never formally organized, but for many years was called the \\"Montana District\\". More than 40 mines operated in the area over the next 75 years. In 1882, the town was large enough for the United States Post Office Department to establish a post office there. A road to White Sulphur Springs was constructed shortly thereafter, although ore was packed out by mule to Barker and smelted there. When the Barker smelter closed in 1883, a new smelter was built close to Neihart at the Mountain Chief Mine in 1885.Fifer, p. 78. By this time, the town featured a blacksmith's shop, a boarding house, restaurants, two saloons, and stables. About 50 houses had been built in Neihart, although many residents still lived in tents. From 1882 to 1929, about $16 million in silver was taken out of the area around Neihart. The Galt and Broadwater mines were dug in 1883, and a year later the Ball and Mountain Chief mines were in operation.Weed, p. 403-404. The M and I, Rochester, and Silver Dyke mines also opened near Neihart. Despite the area's rich ore deposits, investment in mining in the Neihart region remained low due to ore extraction being regarded as expensive.Weed, p. 404. In 1887, these early mines largely shut down, as most of the richest and easily accessible veins of ore had been exhausted. By 1890, Neihart was almost deserted. On November 15, 1891, a spur of the Montana Central Railway reached Neihart, and a strong mining boom began. Now even low-grade ore could be easily and cheaply shipped to the huge smelter in Great Falls. The Panic of 1893 wiped out the area's mining economy, but the town continued to exist. This was largely because some mines, such as the Benton, Big Seven, and Florence, continued in operation. Neihart went through a series of booms and busts over the next half-century. Mining booms occurred during and after World War I, in 1929, and in 1935. The 1935 boom was built primarily around zinc mining, and Neihart continued to be a major source for zinc during World War II. In 1939, the town's population was 168. After World War II, the rail spur was abandoned and the track removed. Portions of Neihart have been abandoned, and ghost town ruins can be seen in the city's outer limits,Soderberg and Soderberg, p. 62. among them being Wu Tang's former laundry and drug store.

The population was 658 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Great Falls, Montana Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is named for Montana pioneer Robert Vaughn, whose homestead on the Vaughn Ranch encompassed part of the town. History While trying to make his fortune gold mining in Nelson Gulch near what is now Helena, Montana, Welsh American immigrant Robert Vaughn became convinced that Montana was excellent ranching and farming country. In the fall of 1869, he traveled into Chouteau County, Montana, which at the time covered nearly a sixth of the state. About upstream from where the Sun River joined the Missouri River, he decided to homestead. He returned to Helena and filed paperwork to claim the land, and learned he was the first individual to formally file for a homestead in Chouteau County.Vaughn, p. 64.Walters, p. xii. Although Vaughn started out farming, he quickly turned to ranching. He imported a large number of pure-bred cattle and horses, and his horses were some of the best in the state. Vaughn's young wife, Elizabeth, died of complications from childbirth on January 13, 1888.Vaughn, p. 72-73. Devastated by her death, Vaughn determined to sell his ranch and move into nearby Great Falls. Vaughn sold his ranch in 1890 to \\"Captain\\" Thomas Couch, a Cornish immigrant and expert miner who managed the Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company in Great Falls. In 1890, the North Western Coal and Navigation Company constructed the Great Falls & Canada Railway, a narrow gauge railway () which ran from Sweet Grass, Montana (at the Canada‚ÄìUS border) to a terminus adjacent to the Robert Vaughn Ranch.Poor, p. 242. Designed to carry coal to Lethbridge, Alberta, the railroad was dubbed the \\"Turkey Trail\\". The railroad led to settlement around the terminus, and in 1910 Couch platted a town there.

History At one time the site of a saloon that served Missouri River freighters, the community of Big Sandy is named for nearby Big Sandy Creek. The town began in 1887 with the arrival of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway (later the Great Northern Railway). By early 1900, Cornelius J. McNamara and Thomas A. Marlow, owners of the McNamara Cattle Company, had opened the town's first store. Homesteaders began arriving in Big Sandy in 1909, and an influx continued for a decade. Several stories explain the creek's name. The most colorful involves a muleskinner, ‚ÄúBig Sandy‚Äù Lane, who arrived one day near the present townsite and, to his dismay, discovered the creek at flood stage. He cursed the uncooperative weather, his bad luck, and the flooded creek crossing so fluently that the offending stream dried up immediately and he was able to cross.Montana Placenames: From Alzada to Zortman, p. 20. Montana Placenames Companion Website For decades Big Sandy's primary landmark was the town water tower, which was visible for many miles. The water tower was dismantled in 1993. As of 2019 some local and former residents have banded together to establish a particularly charismatic and recurring puddle on Main Street (which has been dubbed, simply, \\"Puddle\\") as a new and recognizable landmark of the municipality. Two of the higher profile natives of Big Sandy, Craig Edwards and Steve Sibra, are among those who actively promote \\"Puddle\\" as a body of water of consequence.Source: article,< page 1, Big Sandy Mountaineer, July 3, 2019 Notable people * Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam was born in nearby Havre and grew up in Big Sandy. * Jon Tester, Democratic U.S. Senator and organic farmer *Craig Edwards, photographer, absurdist and conceptual artist  Gallery  thumb thumb See also * Big Bud 747, world's largest farm tractor * List of cities and towns in Montana * Cornfield Bomber, an F-106 that landed in a field near Big Sandy.

Established in 1846, Fort Benton is the oldest settlement in Montana. The city's waterfront area, the most important aspect of its 19th- century growth, was designated the Fort Benton Historic District, a National Historic Landmark, in 1961. The population was 1,464 at the 2010 census. History Established in 1846 by Alexander Culbertson, who worked for Auguste Chouteau and Pierre Chouteau, Jr. of St. Louis, the original Fort was the last fur trading post on the Upper Missouri River,Chouteau County Courthouse, 2009Fort Benton Restoration Committee, 2019 the fort became an important economic center. For 30 years, the port attracted steamboats carrying goods, merchants, gold miners and settlers, coming from New Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis, Hannibal, Bismarck, Kansas City, etc. As the terminus for the 642-mile-long Mullan Road, completed by the United States Army in 1860, and at the head of navigation of the Missouri River, Fort Benton was part of the overland link between trade on the Missouri and the Columbia River, at Fort Walla Walla, Washington. Twenty thousand migrants used the road in the first year to travel to the Northwest. It became an important route for miners from both directions going into the interior of Idaho,\\"Mining and the Mullan Military Road\\", The Mullan Project, Eastern Washington State University, accessed 26 Oct 2009Fort Benton, Official City website, accessed 26 Oct 2009 and north to Canada. Steamboat travel to Fort Benton from St. Louis, Missouri helped broadly fuel the development of the American West between 1860 and 1890, when it was supplanted by railroad transport. The river was an important route for miners to the newly discovered gold fields of southern Montana at what became Bannack and Virginia City beginning in 1862, and Helena, beginning in 1865. With the decline of the fur trade, the American Fur Company sold the fort to the Northwest Fur Company in 1865, and the fort became a U.S. Army post from 1868 until the army units departed in 1881. Founder Alexander Culbertson formally named it Fort Benton on Christmas Day 1850, in honor of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. Beginning in the early 1860s, with the arrival of the first steamboats, a town began to grow up around the fort. Besides being one of the most important ports on the Missouri- Mississippi river system, Fort Benton was once the \\"World's Innermost Port\\" - the furthest point of navigable water on the Missouri River. It was served by numerous well-known \\"mountain boats\\" (designed for the Missouri River), including the Yellowstone and the Far West, and their famed captains, Joseph LaBarge and Grant Marsh, respectively.\\"Last of the Argonauts: The Life and Services of Capt. Grant Marsh,\\" Sioux City Journal, p. 10, January 16, 1916, Sioux City, Iowa.\\"Stirring Times of 80's Recalled in Article on Capt. Grant Marsh,\\" Bismarck Tribune, p. 4, July 11, 1914, Bismarck, North Dakota.Chittenden, 1903, Volume I, pp. 217-218 Fort Benton's importance in trade was superseded by the construction of transcontinental railroads in the late 19th century. In 1867, Fort Benton was the site where Union General Thomas Francis Meagher, then acting governor of Montana Territory, fell overboard from his steamboat and drowned in the river; his body was never recovered. On July 5, 1988 the Fort Benton area was struck by an F3 tornado that injured two people.http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Montana/Chouteau- County/Fort-Benton.html = Native American civil rights abuse = In 1869, Mountain Chief, then Chief of the Pikuni Blackfeet Indians, travelled to the town of Fort Benton to request the agent of his reservation to remove illegal whiskey traders from Blackfeet land. The chief was physically assaulted by a gang of white residents. In the same year, Mountain Chief's brother and a teenage boy were assassinated in Fort Benton, supposedly in retaliation for the death of a white cattle rancher near to the town. In both cases, officials neglected to file criminal charges on behalf of these three Blackfeet Indians. In 1870, a group of 10 Blackfeet Indians would be killed by Fort Benton soldiers and vigilantes for the alleged crime of cattle raiding. Geography The Missouri River as seen from near the Grand Union Hotel, Fort Benton, Montana Fort Benton is located at (47.819307, -110.669726). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The community sits in a narrow river valley on the west bank of the Missouri River and is in a geographic area known as the Golden Triangle (one of several dozen folk regions of Montana) due to the strength of the wheat industry of the region. For example, in 2007, Chouteau County was one of two counties in the United States with the highest wheat production. The long summer days (due to being at almost 48 degrees N latitude) and fertile soil of the area (due in part to ash deposits from the Elkhorn Volcanics to the south) leads to exceptionally \\"hard\\" wheat (high protein content) thriving in the area.

The Kootenai lived in the area for more than 14,000 years, inhabiting the mountainous terrain west of the Continental Divide, and traveled east of the divide for occasional buffalo hunts.https://www.whitefishchamber.org/history Though trappers, traders, and waves of westward immigrants passed through the area during the second half of the century, it wasn‚Äôt until 1883 that the first permanent settler John Morton built a cabin on the shore of Whitefish Lake, just west of the mouth of the Whitefish River. Morton was joined by the forefathers of the local logging industry‚Äîincluding the Baker and Hutchinson brothers‚Äîin the early 1890s. Logging crews ‚Äúboomed-up‚Äù their logs behind a dam built at the river mouth by the Boston & Montana Commercial Company, which, when opened, created a rush of water that helped float the logs down the river to Kalispell.https://www.whitefishchamber.org/history Whitefish DepotThe Great Northern Railway was built through what is now Whitefish in 1904, which sparked the development of the town. The area was originally known as Stumptown due to the abundant amount of timber that had to be cleared to build the town and railroad and because tree stumps were left in the streets throughout downtown. Early residents of the town worked for the railroad and nearby logging industries. In 2006, over 68,000 passengers embarked and disembarked through the historic Whitefish Depot, a stop on Amtrak's Empire Builder line, with some percentage of those headed to the ski resort on Big Mountain. Skiing has been part of the Whitefish area for more than 50 years. In 1937, the Whitefish Lake Ski Club obtained a special permit from the U.S. Forest Service enabling them to build cabins and trails in the Hell Roaring Creek region. Great Falls businessmen Ed Schenck and George Prentice recognized the area‚Äôs potential and after World War II, began efforts to develop a full-fledged ski resort on the mountain with local people donating labor, preparing the slopes, even giving up free time to help push through an all-weather mountain road. On December 14, 1947, Schenck, Prentice, and a thousand townsfolk stood on the slopes of the newly christened ski resort to watch the brand new T-Bar lift bring their community vision to life.https://explorewhitefish.com/entries/a-little-history-of-a-big- mountain/a9b38eb2-0dd9-4fac-9d6c-077f3ed75846 The Whitefish Mountain Resort is the legacy of that effort and today is one of the top-rated resorts for Skiing and for mountain biking in the United States.https://skiwhitefish.com/skimag- ranking/https://www.outsideonline.com/2168451/mountain-biking-whitefish- proving-ground The resort also includes alpine slides, cross-country ski courses, zip-lines and aerial obstacle courses, With active and retired military members receiving a 50% discount.https://skiwhitefish.comhttps://skiwhitefish.com/armed-forces/ Arts, culture and sports =A writer's haven= Whitefish has attracted writers for most of its history to include Dorothy M.

History Originally called Walrath for farmer A. J. Walrath, Amsterdam was established in 1911 by the Northern Pacific Railway on a branch line between Manhattan and Anceney. The railroad changed the name to Amsterdam because of the large number of Dutch settlers who had moved to the area in the 1890s to grow malting barley to supply the Manhattan Malting Company. Church Hill, or Churchill as it was later shortened by Gallatin County Road Department, is located a mile away and above Amsterdam to the east on a prominent hill. Churchill is the site of the Dutch community's church- the 1st Christian Reformed Church, today known as Manhattan Christian Reformed Church, and related parent-operated private P-12 school, Manhattan Christian School. The large church on the hill is the probable origin of the name.Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers. Montana Place Names from Alzada to Zortman . Montana Historical Society Press. Not to be outdone, The Milwaukee Road Railway designated the other side of \\"the hill\\" as Holland, and made a siding for agricultural goods on its railway about two miles to the east, designating it as the Holland Siding.

Bozeman, who established the Bozeman Trail and was a founder of the town in August 1864. The town became incorporated in April 1883 with a city council form of government, and in January 1922 transitioned to its current city manager/city commission form of government. Bozeman was elected an All-America City in 2001 by the National Civic League. Bozeman is home to Montana State University. The local newspaper is the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and the city is served by Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. History =Early history= For thousands of years indigenous people of the United States, including the Shoshone, Nez Perce, Blackfeet, Flathead, Crow Nation and Sioux traveled through the area, called the \\"Valley of the Flowers,\\" although the Gallatin Valley, in which Bozeman is located, was primarily within the territory of the Crow people. =Nineteenth century= John Bozeman William Clark visited the area in July 1806 as he traveled east from Three Forks along the Gallatin River. The party camped east of what is now Bozeman, at the mouth of Kelly Canyon. The journal entries from Clark's party briefly describe the future city's location. John Bozeman In 1863 John Bozeman, along with a partner named John Jacobs, opened the Bozeman Trail, a new northern trail off the Oregon Trail leading to the mining town of Virginia City through the Gallatin Valley and the future location of the city of Bozeman. John Bozeman, with Daniel Rouse and William Beall, platted the town in August 1864, stating \\"standing right in the gate of the mountains ready to swallow up all tenderfeet that would reach the territory from the east, with their golden fleeces to be taken care of.\\" Red Cloud's War closed the Bozeman Trail in 1868, but the town's fertile land still attracted permanent settlers. Nelson Story In 1866, Nelson Story, a successful Virginia City, Montana, gold miner originally from Ohio, entered the cattle business. Story braved the hostile Bozeman Trail to successfully drive some 1,000 head of longhorn cattle into Paradise Valley just east of Bozeman. Eluding the U.S. Army, who tried to turn Story back to protect the drive from hostile Indians, Story's cattle formed one of the earliest significant herds in Montana's cattle industry. Story established a sizable ranch in the Paradise Valley and holdings in the Gallatin Valley. He later donated land to the state for the establishment of Montana State University ‚Äì Bozeman. Fort Ellis Fort Ellis , el. was established in 1867 by Captain R. S. LaMotte and two companies of the 2nd Cavalry, after the murder of John Bozeman near the mouth of Mission Creek on Yellowstone River , and considerable political disturbance in the area led local settlers and miners to feel a need for added protection. The fort, named for Gettysburg casualty Colonel Augustus Van Horne Ellis, was decommissioned in 1886 and few remnants are left at the actual site, now occupied by the Fort Ellis Experimental Station of Montana State University. In addition to Fort Ellis, a short-lived fort, Fort Elizabeth Meagher (also simply known as Fort Meagher), was established in 1867 by volunteer militiamen. This fort was located eight miles (13 km) east of town on Rocky Creek., el. =Other= The first issue of the weekly Avant Courier newspaper, the precursor of today's Bozeman Chronicle, was published in Bozeman on September 13, 1871. Main Street in Bozeman, 1875 Bozeman's main cemetery, Sunset Hills Cemetery, was gifted to the city in 1872 when the English lawyer and philanthropist William Henry Blackmore purchased the land after his wife Mary Blackmore died of pneumonia in Bozeman in July 1872. The first library in Bozeman was formed by the Young Men's Library Association in a room above a drugstore in 1872. It later moved to the mayor's office and was taken over by the city in 1890. The first Grange meeting in Montana Territory was held in Bozeman in 1873. The Northern Pacific Railway reached Bozeman from the east in 1883. By 1900 Bozeman's population reached 3,500. In 1892 the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries established a fish hatchery on Bridger Creek at the entrance to Bridger Canyon. The fourth oldest fish hatchery in the United States, the facility ceased to be primarily a hatchery in 1966 and became the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Bozeman National Fish Hatchery, later a fish technology and fish health center. The Center receives approximately 5000 visitors a year observing biologists working on diet testing, feed manufacturing technology, fish diseases, brood stock development and improvement of water quality. Montana State University - Bozeman was established in 1893 as the state's land-grant college, then named the Agricultural College of the State of Montana. By the 1920s, the institution was known as Montana State College, and in 1965 it became Montana State University. =Twentieth century= Bozeman's first high school, the Gallatin Valley High School, was built on West Main Street in 1902. Later known as Willson School, named for notable Bozeman architect Fred Fielding Willson, son of Lester S. Willson, the building still stands today and functions as administrative offices for the Bozeman School District. In the early 20th century, over of the Gallatin Valley were planted in edible peas harvested for both canning and seed. By the 1920s, canneries in the Bozeman area were major producers of canned peas, and at one point Bozeman produced approximately 75% of all seed peas in the United States. The area was once known as the \\"Sweet Pea capital of the nation\\" referencing the prolific edible pea crop. To promote the area and celebrate its prosperity, local business owners began a \\"Sweet Pea Carnival\\" that included a parade and queen contest. The annual event lasted from 1906 to 1916. Promoters used the inedible but fragrant and colorful sweet pea flower as an emblem of the celebration. In 1977 the \\"Sweet Pea\\" concept was revived as an arts festival rather than a harvest celebration, growing into a three-day event that is one of the largest festivals in Montana. The first federal building and Post Office was built in 1915. Many years later, while empty, it was a film location, along with downtown Bozeman, in A River Runs Through It (1992) by Robert Redford, starring Brad Pitt. It is now used by HRDC, a community organization. The Bridger Bowl Ski Area operates as a 501(c)(4) organization by the Bridger Bowl Association, and is located on the northeast face of the Bridger Mountains, utilizing state and federal land. Bridger Bowl was Bozeman's first ski area and opened to the public in 1955. In 1973 news anchorman Chet Huntley created the Big Sky Ski Resort off Gallatin Canyon south of Bozeman. The resort has grown considerably since 1973 into a residential community and major winter tourist destination. In 1986 the site of the Idaho Pole Co. on Rouse Avenue, was designated a Superfund site and placed on the National Priorities List. Idaho Pole treated wood products with creosote and pentachlorophenol on the site between 1945 and 1997. The Museum of the Rockies was created in 1957 as the gift from Butte physician Caroline McGill and is a part of Montana State University and an affiliate institution of the Smithsonian. It is Montana's premier natural and cultural history museum and houses permanent exhibits on dinosaurs, geology and Montana history, as well as a planetarium and a living history farm. Paleontologist Jack Horner was the museum's first curator of paleontology and brought national notice to the museum for his fossil discoveries in the 1980s. Bozeman receives a steady influx of new residents and visitors in part due to its plentiful recreational activities such as fly fishing, hiking, whitewater kayaking, and mountain climbing. Additionally, Bozeman is a gateway community through which visitors pass on the way to Yellowstone National Park and its abundant wildlife and thermal features. The showcasing of spectacular scenery and the western way of life the area received from films set nearby, such as A River Runs Through It and The Horse Whisperer, have also served to draw people to the area. =Twenty-first century= Main Street in Bozeman, 2011 In the past forty years, Bozeman has grown from the sixth- to the fourth-largest city in Montana. The area attracts new residents due to quality of life, scenery, and nearby recreation. In August 2010, Bozeman was selected by Outside as the best place to live in the west for skiing. Growth in the Gallatin Valley prompted the Gallatin Airport Authority in 2009 to expand the Gallatin Field Airport with two new gates, an expanded passenger screening area, and a third baggage carousel. Gallatin Field was subsequently renamed Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. Bozeman has been one of Montana's fastest growing cities from 1990 into the new millennium. At the rate of three percent, Bozeman could surpass Great Falls as Montana's third largest city by 2025. Geography and climate Bozeman is located at an elevation of .

Bozeman and the surrounding area receives significantly higher rainfall than much of the central and eastern parts of the state, up to of precipitation annually vs. the common throughout much of Montana east of the Continental Divide. Combined with fertile soils, plant growth is relatively lush. This undoubtedly contributed to the early nickname \\"Valley of the Flowers\\" and the establishment of MSU as the state's agricultural college. Bozeman has cold, snowy winters and relatively warm summers, though due to elevation, temperature changes from day to night can be significant. The highest temperature ever recorded in Bozeman was on July 31, 1892. The lowest recorded temperature, , occurred on February 8, 1936.

Literary references include the Bozeman area and real-life Bozeman artists Bob and Gennie DeWeese as a key setting in Robert Pirsig's novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance; the narrator was a professor teaching English composition while developing his philosophical ideas, reflecting the author's own history; Pirsig taught at Montana State. John Steinbeck passed through Bozeman via the former U.S. Route 10 as well as venturing into Yellowstone National Park, and recounted his impressions of Montana in Travels with Charley. Bozeman has been referenced in the science fiction franchise Star Trek, most likely due to the influence of writer Brannon Braga, a native of Bozeman. Per the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Desert Crossing\\", the Bozeman area was the fictional site of Earth's first contact with an alien species (the Vulcans) on April 5, 2063, as recounted in the film Star Trek: First Contact, though the movie was not filmed in Montana. A starship named the USS Bozeman appears in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Cause and Effect\\"; it is mentioned in the episode \\"All Good Things...\\", the films Star Trek Generations and Star Trek: First Contact, and the First Contact prequel novel Ship of the Line by Diane Carey. Bozeman was featured in The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Bozeman Reaction\\", an episode where Sheldon Cooper briefly moves to Bozeman. It is also featured and mentioned in some episodes of CSI: NY, as the hometown of the character Lindsay Monroe. Bozeman was also featured in the 2017 Grey's Anatomy episode, \\"Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?\\". Doctors April Kepner and Jackson Avery travel to Bozeman to help a young patient in need of a throat transplant. Jackson opted to travel there instead of transporting the patient to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in Seattle because his estranged father owned a diner near to the Avery hospital where the girl was being treated. =National media coverage= On March 5, 2009, the city of Bozeman made national news when an early morning explosion destroyed three buildings in the historic downtown area. Several other buildings were damaged and one person was killed. The blast occurred at about 8:15 a.m. and prompted the evacuation of a two-block area. Investigators found the cause of the explosion to be a leak in a gas line that led to a business that was destroyed in the blast. The gas line was more than 70 years old. Business owners and local residents later filed major lawsuits against Northwestern Energy, the company in charge of the gas line. The suits claimed negligence for the gas leak that led to the blast. As of December 2010, most of the lawsuits against the energy company were settled. In June of the same year, Bozeman was once again in the national news when it was reported that the city government was requesting job applicants provide their user names and passwords to social networking sites. A passage from the city's application form said, \\"Please list any and all current personal or business Web sites, web pages or memberships on any Internet-based chat rooms, social clubs or forums, to include, but not limited to: Facebook, Google, Yahoo, YouTube.com, MySpace, etc.\\" After the initial news story aired, the Bozeman City Commissioner received e-mails and phone calls expressing indignation about the practice from across the nation. Bozeman residents were astonished and alarmed by the request. The local government believed the practice had been going on as part of a background search for about three years. In response to the negative backlash from the news media and local citizens, the city rescinded the policy on June 20, 2009, just two days after the news broke. Transportation Bozeman straddles east-west Interstate 90 and is approximately east of north-south Interstate 15 in Butte, Montana. U.S. Highway 191 connects Bozeman with Big Sky and West Yellowstone to the south. Bozeman is serviced by Montana Rail Link, a privately held, Class II railroad that connects Spokane, Washington with Huntley, Montana.

The system is funded by a variety of Federal, State, and local sources. The Gallatin Big Sky Transportation District has operated the Skyline bus service between Bozeman and Big Sky since December 2006. One of the three major regional airports serving southwest Montana is Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport located west of Bozeman on the outskirts of Belgrade, Montana.

The population was 1,869 at the 2010 census. The city of Three Forks is named so because it lies geographically near the point, in nearby Missouri Headwaters State Park, where the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers converge to form the Missouri River ‚Äî the longest single river in North America, as well as the major portion of the Missouri-Mississippi River System from the headwaters near Three Forks to its discharge into the Gulf of Mexico. Three Forks is part of the Bozeman, MT Micropolitan Statistical Area of approximately 100,000 people and located thirty miles west of Bozeman. History Sacajawea Park, a memorial to Sacajawea, in Three Forks The three rivers, west to east, were named by Meriwether Lewis in late July 1805 for President Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison, and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin which was in the times the genesis of a mild controversy and eventually spawned a modern-day geographical controversyin both cases regarding length comparisons between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Today the two confluences are incorporated inside Missouri Headwaters State Park, which is also a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The Lewis and Clark expedition visited the site on July 28, 1805. Meriwether Lewis in his journal entry wrote: :\\"Both Capt. C. and myself in opinion with to the impropriety of calling either of these [three] streams the Missouri and accordingly agreed to name them after the President of the United States and the Secretaries of the Treasury and state...\\"Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 28 July 1805. Retrieved 7 January 2020. One consequence of their decision to designate, map and name the Jeffersonthe largest as a separate tributary river, is that today the Mississippi river can arguably be called longer than the Missouri river because extensive re-channelization of the streambed for hydroelectric power projects has shortened the river while the Mississippi Delta has grown lengthening the rival river. Honored in Three Forks, the Indian woman Sacagawea is best known as the interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In 1800, she was captured by the Mennetaree tribe near the present site of Three Forks. She later returned to this area with Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery. A statue of Sacagawea now sits in a park off Main Street. The present-day city of Three Forks was founded September 17, 1908 by John Q. Adams, a Milwaukee Road land agent. The Milwaukee (Railroad) Land Co., platted the town and held a lot sale that day. Some buildings were moved to the present city from \\"Old Town Three Forks\\", a mile to the northeast. The city became a division point on the Milwaukee Road's Rocky Mountain Division and was an important hub for the railroad during the existence of the Milwaukee in Montana (1908-1980). Two banks for the town were chartered in 1909 and 1910; John Q. Adams financed construction of the latter one, the Three Valleys State Bank, whose building survives, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and serves as a local history museum. The town's early growth prospects foundered from the effects of economic depression, crop failures, and an earthquake that hit the town on June 27, 1925, damaging all of its brick buildings. With The town's population never reached the 10,000 level that some once hoped for, and dropped to about 1,000.

Havre is nicknamed the crown jewel of the Hi-Line. It is said to be named after the city of Le Havre in France.Kari Gorder, Havre History on the Web As of the 2010 census the population was 9,310, and in 2018 the estimated population was 9,715. History Havre was incorporated in north central Montana in 1893. It was founded primarily to serve as a major railroad service center for the Great Northern Railway (built by James J. Hill) with its location midway between Seattle and Minneapolis-St. Paul. A statue of Hill stands near the Havre Amtrak station to commemorate the key contributions his railroad has made to Havre's and Montana's history. Also next to the station on display is Great Northern S-2 Class #2584, a 4-8-4 \\"Northern\\" type steam locomotive that served the station while it was in passenger service. Originally named \\"Bullhook Bottoms\\", the town held a series of meetings to determine a new name. The original settlers were given the final decision, and due to a strong French influence, the town was renamed \\"Havre\\". Simon Pepin (1840‚Äì1914), the \\"Father of Havre\\", was born in Quebec and emigrated to Montana in 1863, where he became a contractor, furnishing supplies for the construction of Fort Custer, Fort Assinniboine, and Fort Maginnis. Pepin purchased ranch land near Fort Assinniboine. When James J. Hill built the Great Northern Railway across northern Montana, he built several locomotive shops on property Pepin owned at the site of Havre. Pepin became a major contributor to Havre's economic growth through his cattle, real estate, and banking enterprises. Havre is the eighth-largest city in Montana, and the largest city in the Montana section of the Hi-Line. With the nearest larger city, Great Falls, about to the south, Havre serves as a medical and business center for the Montana section of the Hi-Line. U.S. Highway 87 has its northern terminus at Havre. U.S. Highway 2, running east‚Äìwest, is the city's main street. The largest employers are Northern Montana Hospital, Montana State University‚ÄìNorthern, and the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (). Throughout much of the twentieth century, was the most prominent employer in the city, but the company scaled back its workforce in Havre in the 1990s. The Milk River (tributary of the Missouri River) runs through the town, and the Bears Paw Mountains can be seen to the south. Small grids of purple squares can be seen in some of the sidewalks downtown. These are skylights for an underground mall built in the city at least a hundred years ago. Throughout its history, this underground area has been host to a brothel, a Chinese laundromat, a saloon, a drugstore, at least three opium dens, and rooms used for smuggling alcohol during Prohibition. When fire destroyed Havre's business district in 1904, legitimate above-ground businesses joined the illicit businesses operating in the underground while the new brick buildings were built in the streets above. The underground area, now designated \\"Havre Beneath the Streets\\", currently operates as a tourist attraction. The Wahkpa Chu'gn buffalo jump, or bison kill, is located behind the Holiday Village Shopping Center near the northwest corner of Havre. Over 2,000 years old, it is one of the largest and best preserved buffalo jumps anywhere. In prehistoric times, Native Americans would drive bison over the edge of the cliff, killing or severely injuring the animals. Afterwards, the Native Americans skinned the animals and preserved the meat. The buffalo jump is now an archaeological site and a small tourist attraction. The buffalo jump is located at the southern edge of the Havre Badlands, a badlands formation that runs alongside the Milk River to the west of the city. Small fossils, including seashells and petrified wood, can be found in the limestone sediment in this area. Hill County Courthouse in downtown Havre southwest of Havre is Fort Assinniboine, which served as one of Montana's principal military posts from 1879 through the Prohibition era. The fort was one of many used by the United States to protect against potential attacks from Native Americans and to block incursions from Canada. At its peak, the fort housed and employed 489 soldiers in 104 buildings. Also near Havre is the Bear's Paw Battlefield site of the Battle of Bear Paw, where the Nez Perce were attacked and defeated by the U.S. Cavalry. Chief Joseph surrendered to the Cavalry and made a famous speech ending with the line, \\"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\\" Geography Havre is located in eastern Hill County at (48.5454, -109.6775).
