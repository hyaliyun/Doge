R^2 of .463. Differences from other results are partly due to the use of quarterly data. In economics, Okun's law is an empirically observed relationship between unemployment and losses in a country's production. It is named after Arthur Melvin Okun, who first proposed the relationship in 1962.Okun, Arthur M. \\"Potential GNP: Its Measurement and Significance,\\" American Statistical Association, Proceedings of the Business and Economics Statistics Section 1962. Reprinted with slight changes in Arthur M. Okun, The Political Economy of Prosperity (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1970) The \\"gap version\\" states that for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, a country's GDP will be roughly an additional 2% lower than its potential GDP. The \\"difference version\\"Knotek, 75 describes the relationship between quarterly changes in unemployment and quarterly changes in real GDP. The stability and usefulness of the law has been disputed.Knotek, 93 Imperfect relationship Okun's law may more accurately be called \\"Okun's rule of thumb\\" because it is an approximation based on empirical observation rather than a result derived from theory. Okun's law is approximate because factors other than employment, such as productivity, affect output. In Okun's original statement of his law, a 2% increase in output corresponds to a 1% decline in the rate of cyclical unemployment; a 0.5% increase in labor force participation; a 0.5% increase in hours worked per employee; and a 1% increase in output per hours worked (labor productivity).Okun, 1962 Okun's law states that a one-point increase in the cyclical unemployment rate is associated with two percentage points of negative growth in real GDP. The relationship varies depending on the country and time period under consideration. The relationship has been tested by regressing GDP or GNP growth on change in the unemployment rate. Martin Prachowny estimated about a 3% decrease in output for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate. However, he argued that the majority of this change in output is actually due to changes in factors other than unemployment, such as capacity utilization and hours worked. Holding these other factors constant reduces the association between unemployment and GDP to around 0.7% for every 1% change in the unemployment rate. The magnitude of the decrease seems to be declining over time in the United States. According to Andrew Abel and Ben Bernanke, estimates based on data from more recent years give about a 2% decrease in output for every 1% increase in unemployment. There are several reasons why GDP may increase or decrease more rapidly than unemployment decreases or increases: As unemployment increases, * a reduction in the multiplier effect created by the circulation of money from employees * unemployed persons may drop out of the labor force (stop seeking work), after which they are no longer counted in unemployment statistics * employed workers may work shorter hours * labor productivity may decrease, perhaps because employers retain more workers than they need One implication of Okun's law is that an increase in labor productivity or an increase in the size of the labor force can mean that real net output grows without net unemployment rates falling (the phenomenon of \\"jobless growth\\") Okun's Law is sometimes confused with Lucas wedge. Mathematical statements The gap version of Okun's law may be written (Abel & Bernanke 2005) as: :\\\\frac{\\\\overline{Y}-Y}{\\\\overline{Y}} = c(u-\\\\overline{u}), where * Y is actual output * \\\\overline{Y} is potential GDP * u is actual unemployment rate * \\\\overline{u} is the natural rate of unemployment * c is the factor relating changes in unemployment to changes in output In the United States since 1955 or so, the value of c has typically been around 2 or 3, as explained above. The gap version of Okun's law, as shown above, is difficult to use in practice because \\\\overline{Y} and \\\\overline{u} can only be estimated, not measured. A more commonly used form of Okun's law, known as the difference or growth rate form of Okun's law, relates changes in output to changes in unemployment: :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} = k - c \\\\Delta u\\\\,, where: * Y and c are as defined above * \\\\Delta Y is the change in actual output from one year to the next * \\\\Delta u is the change in actual unemployment from one year to the next * k is the average annual growth rate of full-employment output At the present time in the United States, k is about 3% and c is about 2, so the equation may be written :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} = 0.03 - 2 \\\\Delta u.\\\\, The graph at the top of this article illustrates the growth rate form of Okun's law, measured quarterly rather than annually. Derivation of the growth rate form We start with the first form of Okun's law: :\\\\frac{\\\\overline{Y}-Y}{\\\\overline{Y}} = 1-\\\\frac{Y}{\\\\overline{Y}} = c(u-\\\\overline{u}) :\\\\frac{Y}{\\\\overline{Y}}-1 = c(\\\\overline{u}-u). Taking annual differences on both sides, we obtain :\\\\Delta\\\\left(\\\\frac{Y}{\\\\overline{Y}}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{Y + \\\\Delta Y}{\\\\overline{Y}+ \\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}} - \\\\frac{Y}{\\\\overline{Y}} = c(\\\\Delta \\\\overline{u}-\\\\Delta u). Putting both numerators over a common denominator, we obtain :\\\\frac{\\\\overline{Y} \\\\Delta Y - Y \\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}}{\\\\overline{Y}(\\\\overline{Y} + \\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y})}= c(\\\\Delta \\\\overline{u}-\\\\Delta u). Multiplying the left hand side by \\\\frac{\\\\overline{Y} + \\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}}{Y}, which is approximately equal to 1, we obtain :\\\\frac{\\\\overline{Y} \\\\Delta Y - Y \\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}}{\\\\overline{Y}Y} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}}{\\\\overline{Y}} \\\\approx c(\\\\Delta \\\\overline{u}-\\\\Delta u) :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}}{\\\\overline{Y}} + c(\\\\Delta \\\\overline{u}-\\\\Delta u). We assume that \\\\Delta \\\\overline{u}, the change in the natural rate of unemployment, is approximately equal to 0. We also assume that \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\overline{Y}}{\\\\overline{Y}}, the growth rate of full-employment output, is approximately equal to its average value, k. So we finally obtain :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} \\\\approx k - c \\\\Delta u. Usefulness  Through comparisons between actual data and theoretical forecasting, Okun's law proves to be an invaluable tool in predicting trends between unemployment and real GDP. However, the accuracy of the data theoretically proved through Okun's law compared to real world numbers proves to be generally inaccurate. This is due to the variances in Okun's coefficient. Many, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, conclude that information proved by Okun's law to be acceptable to a certain degree. Also, some findings have concluded that Okun's law tends to have higher rates of accuracy for short-run predictions, rather than long-run predictions. Forecasters have concluded this to be true due to unforeseen market conditions that may affect Okun's coefficient. As such, Okun's law is generally acceptable by forecasters as a tool for short-run trend analysis between unemployment and real GDP, rather than being used for long run analysis as well as accurate numerical calculations. The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank determined through the use of empirical data from past recessions in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s that Okun‚Äôs law was a useful theory. All recessions showed two common main trends: a counterclockwise loop for both real-time and revised data. The recoveries of the 1990s and 2000s did have smaller and tighter loops.https://www.frbsf.org/economic- research/publications/economic-letter/2014/april/okun-law-deviation- unemployment-recession/ See also * Lucas wedge NotesReferences Abel, Andrew B. & Bernanke, Ben S.

The emergency brake applies considerably more braking force than the standard full-service brake. The engine driver or motorman will only use the emergency brake as a last resort, since it may cause damage; even with modern wheel slide protection, a train may develop wheel-flats, and the rails themselves can suffer profile damage. Possible consequences of operation Putting the engine driver's brake handle into the emergency position may also: * Shut off traction power * On an electric train, drop the pantograph if the power supply is overhead-wire traction current, or raise the pickup shoes where the supply is third rail traction current * Disable dynamic braking * Prevent the brakes from being released until the train has stopped * Connect the brake wires to ground, to prevent a \\"false-feed\\" voltage from releasing the brakes * Send an emergency radio signal, if the brake handle has been in the emergency position for over 30 seconds *Activate the sander *Activate the train horn until the selector is placed out of the emergency position Passenger-applied brakes Trains often have a facility in each car to enable passengers to apply the brakes in case of emergency. In many modern trains, the driver is able to prevent brake activation when a passenger operates the emergency alarmSoutheastern Traction Manual - Class 465/6: Passenger Communication Equipment \\\\- an audible warning is sounded, and the driver is then able to talk to the person who activated the alarm on the intercom and see them on an internal CCTV. The driver can press an override button and hold the brakes off whilst they choose a safe place to stop the train. Because of possible serious problems, severe fines and/or imprisonment penalties are in place to deter people from activating the brake without good reason. =Mechanism on locomotive-hauled stock with brake pipe= The alarm chain in a passenger coach is designed to create a break in the continuity of the brake pipes (whether vacuum or air brakes), immediately resulting in a loss of brake pressure (or vacuum) and thereby causing the train brakes to be applied. With vacuum brakes, a clappet valve is provided, which is released by the pulling of the alarm chain; with air brakes, there is a similar passenger emergency valve which can vent the brake pipe to the air. In most locomotives (in addition to a warning lamp or buzzer being sounded) the master controller undergoes auto-regression, with the notches falling to zero rapidly as the locomotive's motive power is switched off. The guard may also notice the loss of brake pressure (although they may not know it is due to the pulling of the alarm chain) and is expected to apply their brakes immediately as well. It is possible for a driver to override the alarm-chain pull; this is sometimes done where it is known that miscreants resort to pulling the emergency chain solely to get the train to stop at a point convenient for themselves. However, such an act by the driver (or guard) of deliberately ignoring an indication of alarm-chain pulling is a serious matter. In recent years locomotives have been fitted with emergency flashers on the roof of the cab, and these flashers are also activated when the brake pipe pressure is lost for any reason other than the driver's application of the brake valve. This alerts drivers of oncoming trains of the possibility of a derailed or parted rake which may foul other tracks (since brake pressure may have been lost for those reasons as well); at the locomotive, it is not possible to tell whether the loss of brake pressure is due to the pulling of the alarm chain. ACP (alarm chain pulling) also causes a small lever to be released near the emergency brake valve (usually mounted near one end of the coach), which does not retract to its normal position even when the chain is released. This allows the driver (or guard) to find out in which coach the ACP actually occurred. When the coach is isolated, the lever needs to be manually reset. Until this is done, the lamp and buzzer in the locomotive cab are continuously activated. A circuit breaker controls the lamp and alarm bell in the locomotive cab; in cases where defective equipment causes the lamp and bell to go off, the driver can disable them by placing the MCB (miniature circuit breaker) in the \\"Off\\" position. Despite the obvious safety hazards, sometimes this is resorted to by drivers when driving trains through sections where spurious ACP incidents are very common. Around the world=Germany= The Regelung B009 NB√ú Rev 3.1 defines a set of nested statemachines in the chapter ‚ÄúAnlage 1: Phasen einer Zugfahrt‚Äú, reflecting a very wide range of usecases, including platforms, tunnels, etc. and is applicable for subways, trams, metros(S-Bahn), as it implements appropriate actions for all usecases occurring in rail transportation. These statemachines represents the state of the art in Germany, it is highly recommended to be implemented or retrofitted to avoid the problems experienced at the S-Bahn Rhine-Neckar. In Germany, passenger vehicles ‚Äúmust have easily visible and reachable emergency brake handles‚Äù.¬ß 23 paragraph 3 sentence 1 EBO It is allowed that the emergency brake can be reset,¬ß 23 paragraph 3 sentence 2 EBO on S-Bahn vehicles (i.e. Classes 420, 423, 425, 480 or 481) it's allowed to only result in a display when used outside of platforms. The implementation of the S-Bahn's emergency brake however does currently not reflect the state of the art in Germany, it has failed in practical use at least in one instance 2015, as a driver lost consciousness completely, but still accidentally triggered the vigilance device. Unlike the System NB√ú2004, which is used in conventional trains, the brake was not activated, because it is only an indicator light and a sound, while the train is running on the track. Without ATP enabled or over-speed, the described incident may have been leading to fatalities and substantial damage, as the passengers noticed the unconscious driver, but could not stop the train by pulling the emergency-brake-handle. Using the NB√ú2004, as used in regional- and long-distance-trains, this would have been prevented, a \\"overwrite\\" response is needed, typically the \\"F√ú\\"(Filling) position of the automatic brake-lever, otherwise the trains brake-computer will perform an emergency-brake after 10 seconds. Equipment for this override (NB√ú) is necessary in tunnels above 1000 m. For regional trains, UIC 541-5 is not sufficient since 2011, long distance trains must at least be equipped with UIC 541-5.EBA-Tunnelrichtlinie chapter 3.2 (long and very long tunnels being defined in chapter 1.2) The sections where not to stop are marked with yellow bars on the kilometer signs. Regional trains, except MUs, are usually equipped with NB√ú 2004, which results in a display and a break a few seconds later if the train driver doesn't respond. For DB Regio, the rules for the staff are given in Ril 494. Long distance trains are mostly equipped with system DB, which uses the UIC 558 control wire, which results in conflicts with some door control systems and is therefore not used in regional trains. In MUs, usually a special implementation is used. For trams, emergency brakes are also necessary.¬ß 36 paragraph 9 sentence 1 BOStrab In tunnels and track sections without safety area, using them outside a station may stop the tram at the next platform instead of immediately.¬ß 36 paragraph 9 sentence 2 BOStrab =India= Emergency brake on a train in alt=Emergency brake with red handle Chain-pulling is the act of pulling a cord that activates the train's emergency brakes to stop a train, whether for a genuine emergency or (often) illegally for someone to get on or off the train on the Indian Railway network. Illegal chain-pulling is a serious problem on Indian railways; where miscreants do so to make unscheduled stops near their destination, which delays trains. Penalties for misuse of this facility include a fine of Rs. 1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year. In an effort to improve the service, former President of India Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam proposed an alternate method wherein a passenger in an emergency communicates with the guard and driver of the train. =United States= Bombardier commuter rail equipment, Sounder, Seattle, WA In the USA, an emergency stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running within the body of a railway car would have been what was known as the \\"communicating cord\\". This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the \\"engineer\\"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a \\"normal stop\\" or an \\"emergency application\\", at their discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make an emergency stop. Emergency brake valves are always located on the bulkheads, inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The emergency brake valve is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled \\"Emergency Only\\". Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled \\"signal\\". Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an emergency brake valve is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately (independent brake) from those of the cars, is evacuated, immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a \\"separation\\"). All available pressure from the Equalizing Reservoir will go into the Brake Pipe, thus running the length of the train, actuating the train brakes on each car. No action is required (or even possible) on the part of the engineer. The train will stop, no matter what they do. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the emergency valve has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The emergency brake valve continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations. A member of the train crew must walk the length of the train and inspect it for any damage. The consist will need to be inspected before it can return to normal revenue service. In the cabs of light-rail cars the emergency brake is often a large red button, which the train crew refers to as the \\"mushroom\\"; this also activates the magnetic track brakes. The mechanism of an emergency brake may differ, depending on railcar design. Emergency-braking a train (without track brakes) will give about 1.5 m/s2 (0.15 g) deceleration. The braking distance will be approximately at and at . High-speed trains are usually equipped with a magnetic track brake, which can give about 0.3 m/s2 extra, and give braking distances of about at and at . = United Kingdom = Emergency brakes were introduced in the United Kingdom by the Regulation of Railways Act 1868. Section 22 stated, \\"All trains traveling a distance of more than 20 miles without stopping are to be provided with a means of communication between the passengers and the servants of the company in charge of the train\\". At first, this means of communication was a cord running down the length of the train at roof level outside the carriages, connected to a bell on the locomotive. When the use of automatic brakes was made compulsory in the Regulation of Railways Act 1889, the equipment was modified so that it operated the brakes; however, the term \\"communication cord\\" has survived. Until the 1970s a \\"cord\\" (by that time a chain) was still used, which ran the length of the carriage and connected to a valve at one end which opened the brake pipe. The exposed section of chain was painted red, with the coiled section behind the wall painted black. The system was designed so that as the black length of chain was exposed, it would not retract so as to identify which particular chain in that carriage was pulled. A butterfly valve on the side of the carriage was used to reset the brake, and also made it easy for the train crew to see in which coach the cord had been pulled. Later designs used handles which were activated by pulling down; more recent types use buttons connected to a PassComm system. On modern trains with sliding doors the body-indicator light (BIL), usually used to show that doors on a carriage are open, will flash when the brake has been used. Pulling the alarm chain on a British train will pull a lever connected to the brake pipe flaps. Pulling the alarm activates a piston, causing the flaps to be opened and all the air pushed out the air tube, forcing the brakes on. In the driver's cab, a buzzer and a light will tell that the alarm has been activated. In the guard's van, this is seen from a valve which shows loss of pressure in the brake pipe. In the UK, there is a fine (of level 3 on the standard scale: up to ¬£1000 as of 2018) for pulling the alarm chain without reasonable cause.Railways Byelaws made in 2005, s.11(3)  Override  In most rolling stock built since the 1980s, passenger communication handles (or PassComms) have been installed, which activate an alarm in the driver's cab when used. If the train is not in a safe place (in a tunnel or on a bridge, for example) the driver has approximately three seconds to override the alarm by pressing a button before the brakes automatically apply. The driver may also speak to the person who pulled the handle via an intercom mounted alongside the handle. On modern trains this is particularly useful, since the PassComm must be much easier to use and more accessible due to accessibility regulations. However this also makes accidental activation easier. On some modern trains, the PassComm in a disabled-friendly toilet is mounted such that it is often confused with the door or flush control; this sometimes leads to accidental activation. As a result, on some models of train such as the Class 180, the alarm panels fitted in the toilets do not operate the train brake, and simply alert the train crew to the emergency.  London Underground  When London Underground began converting trains for one-person-operation during the 1970s and 1980s, the original emergency brake systems were replaced by an alarm and a passenger-communication system. On earlier systems the brakes were not applied automatically (being under the control of the driver), whereas later systems have an override as above. On older systems, marker boards showing an exclamation mark were provided on departure from each station at the point where the rear of the train would no longer be at the platform. Normally, if the alarm was activated before the board the driver would stop the train, and otherwise continue to the next station. These boards were replaced by a number of boards counting up the number of cars that are beyond the end of the platform; for example, on a line with six-car trains the boards show 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. When a train has stopped, they help the driver to see how much of the train is at the platform. With the help of passenger communication and available station staff, the driver can then decide whether to deal with the situation as it is, continue to the next station or possibly reverse back into the station (after consulting with line controllers and proper safety measures). During hot summer weather passengers are warned against using the emergency alarms if feeling unwell, since it can delay trains and increase the problem; they are instead instructed to leave the train at the next station and get some fresh air or a cold drink. = Russia = In Russian trains there is usually an emergency brake known as a \\"stop valve\\" (). In elektrichkas and other trains it is usually located near the doors, and sometimes in the middle of the coach as well. A stop valve usually has a distinctive red handle. Turning the handle down (anti-clockwise) by about 90 degrees causes pneumatic brakes to engage, due to pressure loss in the standard air-braking system. While primitive and not allowing any override such a system is effective, resembling usual train brake activation; it does not fail in emergency conditions. More complicated systems may not provide quick braking when needed, or during a communications failure. Emergency braking is somewhat risky; it is hard on passengers, and there is a risk of passenger injury if braking occurs at high speed. As a result, use of a stop valve without good reason is prohibited and may lead to fines. Depending on circumstances and consequences, authorities may even arrest a person for the incorrect use of a stop valve.  Subways  In subways, derailment is usually less dangerous (speeds are lower, trains cannot jackknife in tunnels and so on). It is dangerous to stop in a tunnel if a fire develops; an emergency exit could lead to electrocution by the third rail (typically energized with 825 volts DC). Instead drivers try to reach the next station, even in an emergency. As a result, there are no emergency brakes directly visible to passengers. However, there are hidden stop valves and simplified train controls, allowing each coach to act on its own in need. In an emergency, there are door-control handles (visible to passengers) which are intended to make the pneumatic train doors able to be opened by removing air pressure. Subway trains have mechanisms and alarms which prevent trains from moving if the doors are open, and alert the driver or engage the brakes if doors open while a train is moving. Penalties for misuse of emergency door- opening handles are similar to those for stop-valve misuse. =Japan= An EB reset switch in a JR West 221 series EMU In many Japanese passenger and freight trains, an EB reset switch is provided which is activated by sounding a buzzer and lighting up the EB reset switch when the driver does not operate the controls within 60 seconds of last operation (30 seconds on Aonami Line, 40 seconds on JR Kyushu lines). If the EB switch is not pressed (reset) within 5 seconds of being activated, it will trigger an emergency brake application so as to prevent accidents due to driver error or when the driver is incapacitated. Also, a red button and/or an emergency brake setting on the levers are provided in the driver's cab so the driver can manually activate the emergency brake; these can also be activated (like a dead man's handle) when the driver feels unwell or is incapacitated in trains without the EB reset switch. Near train doors, emergency brake cords are available so that passengers can bring the train to a halt in an emergency.  External signalling  In the US, the universally recognized signal to stop is a sweeping, horizontal hand motion, back-and-forth, at arm's length and perpendicular to the track (preferably in a downward direction, so as to distinguish it from a mere greeting). This can be done with an object (such as a light or flag) or an empty hand. In US railroad slang it is referred to as a \\"washout\\", or \\"washing out\\" signal, or a \\"signing down\\", and requires an immediate stop. If the driver's vision is limited, or they feel it necessary, they will make an emergency stop. Drivers are trained to interpret any urgent waving or signalling by a person near the track as a possible warning of danger, perhaps requiring an immediate stop, depending upon the particular circumstances present.

The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as \\"Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.\\" Herbert Spencer first used the phrase, after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in his Principles of Biology (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin's biological ones: \\"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.\\" ^ \\"Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, wrote: 'This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called \\"natural selection\\", or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.'\\" , citing HERBERT SPENCER, THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY 444 (Univ.

He first used the phrase ‚Äì after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species ‚Äì in his Principles of Biology of 1864Vol. 1, p. 444 in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological, evolutionary ones, writing, \\"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.\\" In July 1866 Alfred Russel Wallace wrote to Darwin about readers thinking that the phrase \\"natural selection\\" personified nature as \\"selecting\\", and said this misconception could be avoided \\"by adopting Spencer's term\\" Survival of the fittest. Darwin promptly replied that Wallace's letter was \\"as clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer's excellent expression of 'the survival of the fittest'. This however had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb\\". Had he received the letter two months earlier, he would have worked the phrase into the fourth edition of the Origin which was then being printed, and he would use it in his \\"next book on Domestic Animals etc.\\". Darwin wrote on page 6 of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication published in 1868, \\"This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term \\"natural selection\\" is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity\\". He defended his analogy as similar to language used in chemistry, and to astronomers depicting the \\"attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets\\", or the way in which \\"agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection\\". He had \\"often personified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws,‚Äîand by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.\\" In the first four editions of On the Origin of Species, Darwin had used the phrase \\"natural selection\\". In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869, Darwin implies again the synonym: \\"Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest\\". By \\"fittest\\" Darwin meant \\"better adapted for the immediate, local environment\\", not the common modern meaning of \\"in the best physical shape\\" (think of a puzzle piece, not an athlete). In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing \\"I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\\" In The Man Versus The State, Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation of how his theories would not be adopted by \\"societies of militant type\\". He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle.The principle of natural selection applied to groups of individual is known as Group selection. > \\"Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes > characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a > loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever\\". (snippet) Though Spencer's conception of organic evolution is commonly interpreted as a form of Lamarckism, Herbert Spencer is sometimes credited with inaugurating Social Darwinism. The phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\" has become widely used in popular literature as a catchphrase for any topic related or analogous to evolution and natural selection. It has thus been applied to principles of unrestrained competition, and it has been used extensively by both proponents and opponents of Social Darwinism. Evolutionary biologists criticise the manner in which the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in popular culture. The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term natural selection. The biological concept of fitness refers to reproductive success, as opposed to survival, and is not explicit in the specific ways in which organisms can be more \\"fit\\" (increase reproductive success) as having phenotypic characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).  Critiquing the phrase  While the phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\" is often used to mean \\"natural selection\\", it is avoided by modern biologists, because the phrase can be misleading. For example, survival is only one aspect of selection, and not always the most important. Another problem is that the word \\"fit\\" is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness. In the evolutionary meaning \\"fitness\\" is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants. Interpreted as expressing a biological theory The phrase can also be interpreted to express a theory or hypothesis: that \\"fit\\" as opposed to \\"unfit\\" individuals or species, in some sense of \\"fit\\", will survive some test. Nevertheless, when extended to individuals it is a conceptual mistake, the phrase is a reference to the transgenerational survival of the heritable attributes; particular individuals are quite irrelevant. This becomes more clear when referring to Viral quasispecies, in survival of the flattest, which makes it clear to survive makes no reference to the question of even being alive itself; rather the functional capacity of proteins to carry out work. Interpretations of the phrase as expressing a theory are in danger of being tautological, meaning roughly \\"those with a propensity to survive have a propensity to survive\\"; to have content the theory must use a concept of fitness that is independent of that of survival.\\"Stephen Jay Gould, Darwin's Untimely Burial\\", 1976; from Philosophy of Biology:An Anthology, Alex Rosenberg, Robert Arp ed., John Wiley & Sons, May 2009, pp. 99‚Äì102.von Sydow, M. (2014). ‚ÄòSurvival of the Fittest‚Äô in Darwinian Metaphysics ‚Äì Tautology or Testable Theory? (pp. 199‚Äì222) In E. Voigts, B. Schaff & M. Pietrzak-Franger (Eds.). Reflecting on Darwin. Farnham, London: Ashgate. Interpreted as a theory of species survival, the theory that the fittest species survive is undermined by evidence that while direct competition is observed between individuals, populations and species, there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups such as, for example, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Instead, these groups have evolved by expanding into empty ecological niches. In the punctuated equilibrium model of environmental and biological change, the factor determining survival is often not superiority over another in competition but ability to survive dramatic changes in environmental conditions, such as after a meteor impact energetic enough to greatly change the environment globally. The main land dwelling animals to survive the K-Pg impact 66 million years ago had the ability to live in tunnels, for example. In 2010 Sahney et al. argued that there is little evidence that intrinsic, biological factors such as competition have been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. Instead, they cited extrinsic, abiotic factors such as expansion as the driving factor on a large evolutionary scale. The rise of dominant groups such as amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds occurred by opportunistic expansion into empty ecological niches and the extinction of groups happened due to large shifts in the abiotic environment. Interpreted as expressing a moral theory=Social Darwinists= It has been claimed that \\"the survival of the fittest\\" theory in biology was interpreted by late 19th century capitalists as \\"an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition\\" and led to the advent of the theory of \\"social Darwinism\\" which was used to justify laissez-faire economics, war and racism. However, these ideas predate and commonly contradict Darwin's ideas, and indeed their proponents rarely invoked Darwin in support. The term \\"social Darwinism\\" referring to capitalist ideologies was introduced as a term of abuse by Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought published in 1944. =Anarchists= Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin viewed the concept of \\"survival of the fittest\\" as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that > In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in > societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle > for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense ‚Äì not as a > struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all > natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which > individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the > practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably > the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further > progress. Applying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self-assertion, and concluded that > In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest > beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of > our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of > man, mutual support not mutual struggle ‚Äì has had the leading part. In its > wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of > a still loftier evolution of our race. Tautology \\"Survival of the fittest\\" is sometimes claimed to be a tautology. The reasoning is that if one takes the term \\"fit\\" to mean \\"endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction\\" (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then \\"survival of the fittest\\" can simply be rewritten as \\"survival of those who are better equipped for surviving\\". Furthermore, the expression does become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of \\"fitness\\" in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power. However, the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\" (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of heritability. It is true that the phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\", in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by heritable characters (see the article on natural selection). If certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of \\"heritable\\") that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called \\"evolution by natural selection\\". On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, \\"survival of the fittest\\" or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that \\"survivors survive\\" or \\"reproducers reproduce\\"; rather, it states that \\"survivors survive, reproduce and therefore propagate any heritable characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success\\". This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the testable hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.) Momme von Sydow suggested further definitions of 'survival of the fittest' that may yield a testable meaning in biology and also in other areas where Darwinian processes have been influential. However, much care would be needed to disentangle tautological from testable aspects. Moreover, an \\"implicit shifting between a testable and an untestable interpretation can be an illicit tactic to immunize natural selection ... while conveying the impression that one is concerned with testable hypotheses\\".Cf. von Sydow, M. (2012). From Darwinian Metaphysics towards Understanding the Evolution of Evolutionary Mechanisms: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Gene-Darwinism and Universal Darwinism. Universit√§tsverlag G√∂ttingen. Skeptic Society founder and Skeptic magazine publisher Michael Shermer addresses the tautology problem in his 1997 book, Why People Believe Weird Things, in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are testable and falsifiable by virtue of their predictive power. Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population. Shermer hypothesizes that if hominid fossils were found in the same geological strata as trilobites, it would be evidence against natural selection.Shermer, Michael; Why People Believe Weird Things; 1997; Pages 143‚Äì144 See also           Red Queen hypothesis  NotesReferencesExternal links=Origins of the phrase= * AboutDarwin.com ‚Äî Darwin's Timeline * Pioneers of Psychology * Evolution Quotations compiled by GIGA =Tautology links= * Darwin's Untimely Burial by Stephen Jay Gould * Evolution and Philosophy: A Good Tautology is Hard to Find by John Wilkins, part of the talk.origins archive. * CA500: \\"Survival of the fittest is a tautology\\" from the talk.origins index to creationist claims by Mark Ridley. * Is \\"survival of the fittest\\" a tautology by Don Lindsay. * Darwin's Great Tautology by the Doubting Thomas =Morality link= * CA002: Survival of the fittest implies that \\"might makes right\\" * David Hume ‚Äî Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion * Evolution and philosophy ‚Äî Does evolution make might right? by John S.

Non-binary people assigned female at birth may also have these surgeries. Often used to refer to phalloplasty, metoidoplasty, or vaginectomy, sex reassignment surgery can also more broadly refer to many procedures an individual may have, such as male chest reconstruction, hysterectomy, or oophorectomy. Sex reassignment surgery is usually preceded by beginning hormone treatment with testosterone.  Male chest reconstruction  Also called \\"top surgery\\", male chest reconstruction is any of a variety of surgeries to remove breast tissue, and provide shaping of a male contoured chest. Surgeries for female-to-male transgender patients have similarities to both gynecomastia surgeries for cisgender men, breast reduction surgery for gigantomastia, and the separate mastectomies done for breast cancer. Moderate to large breasts usually require a double incision procedure, with grafting and reconstruction of the nipple-areola. This procedure makes it easier to contour the chest and place the nipples in a more natural position but results in more visible scarring. For smaller breasts, a peri-areolar, or keyhole procedure may be done where the breast tissue is removed through an incision made around the areola. This results in less visible scarring but may result in lower than average nipple placement, and a less natural contour. There is less denervation of the chest wall with a peri-areolar mastectomy, and less time is required for sensation to return. Loss of sensation to varying degrees is a risk with any chest reconstruction procedure.  Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy  Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is the removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes. A 'partial hysterectomy' is when the uterus is removed, but the cervix is left intact. If the cervix is also removed, it is called a 'total hysterectomy.' Some trans men desire to have a hysterectomy/BSO because of a discomfort with having them, or when menses fail to fully stop with testosterone replacement therapy. Hysterectomy/BSO is also done to decrease the risk of developing cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer, although it is unknown whether the risk of ovarian cancer is increased, decreased, or unchanged in the transgender male population. After hysterectomy/BSO, trans men should still see a gynecologist for a check-up at least every three years. This is particularly the case for trans men who: * retain their vagina (whether before or after further genital reconstruction,) * have a strong family history of cancers of the breast, ovary, or uterus (endometrium,) * have a personal history of gynecological cancer or significant dysplasia on a Pap smear. One important consideration is that any trans man who develops vaginal bleeding after successfully ceasing menses on testosterone must be evaluated by a gynecologist. This is equivalent to postmenopausal bleeding in a woman and may herald the development of gynecologic cancer.  Genital reassignment  Hip showing scar from skin graft used for phalloplasty. Also known as Genital reconstructive procedures (GRT) = Phalloplasty = Phalloplasty in female to male surgery Phalloplasty is the process of constructing a neopenis using a flap (graft) from the patient's arm, thigh, abdomen, or back. Compared to Metoidioplasty, Phalloplasty provides a larger penis with a more satisfying cosmetic appearance, however, it's more expensive, and many times the penis lacks the ability to achieve an erection. Therefore, many tend to use penile implants to improve erection and get more satisfying cosmetic results. Sexual sensation is usually preserved to the base of the penis, where the original clitoris was. = Metoidioplasty = Metoidioplasty with urethral extension Metoidioplasty is done after enlarging the clitoris using hormone replacement therapy, where a neopenis is constructed from the enlarged clitoris, with or without extending the urethra to allow urination while standing up. The labia majora are united to form a scrotum, where prosthetic testicles can be inserted. The new neophallus ranges in size from 4‚Äì10 cm (with an average of 5.7 cm) and has the approximate girth of a human adult thumb.Metoidioplasty as a Single Stage Sex Reassignment Surgery in Female Transsexuals: Belgrade Experience Djordjevic, Miroslav L. et al., Journal of Sexual Medicine, Volume 6, Issue 5, 1306 - 1313 Sexual sensation and erectile function are usually completely preserved. Specialized metoidioplasty penile implants may be an option in those who cannot achieve penetration during sex. = Penile Implants = Penile implants are usually used in phalloplasty surgery due to the inability of the neophallus to achieve proper erection. The penile implants are used in cisgender men to treat erectile dysfunction, and in transgender men during female-to-male sex reassignment surgery. Although the same penile implant has been used for both cisgender and transgender men, specialized penile implants for transgender men were recently developed by Zephyr Surgical Implants (Switzerland), in both inflatable and malleable models. During phalloplasty, the tissue flap used to build the neophallus is wrapped around the implant either in the same surgery, or in separate surgeries. Penile implants are less commonly used in mitoidioplasty.

Published by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), it was formed on 16 March 1983 as a result of a merger between Nanyang Siang Pau and Sin Chew Jit Poh, two of Singapore's oldest Chinese newspapers. The paper establishes itself as a serious broadsheet with extensive local news coverage while international news tend to be largely centered on the East Asia region, especially China. Zaobao has an extensive East Asian correspondent network spanning Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and Tokyo. It is SPH's flagship Chinese daily, the only Chinese-language morning daily in Singapore. As with all Chinese-language publications currently based in Singapore, it uses simplified Chinese characters. The newspaper is establishing a regional presence for itself, with subscriptions for its print edition from Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong as well as organisations such as the United Nations. Its regionalisation drive was given a shot in the arm especially when the online version of the paper Zaobao.com was launched in August 1995 under the name of \\"Lianhe Zaobao Online\\". Today it serves as a news portal drawing news not just from the Lianhe Zaobao, but also from other Chinese newspapers in the region, numbering as much as 100 sources in total. From 8 September 2016, the portal also presents news from two other Singapore Press Holdings Chinese-language newspapers, Lianhe Wanbao and Shin Min Daily News. Lianhe Zaobao is the only Chinese-language overseas newspaper which can be purchased in major cities of mainland China. Format The paper is published daily by SPH and usually hits newsstands and homes by 5 am local time. Zaobao is currently published in four segments.

Viognier () is a white wine grape variety. It is the only permitted grape for the French wine Condrieu in the Rh√¥ne Valley.J. Robinson \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 754 Oxford University Press 2006 Outside of the Rh√¥ne, Viognier can be found in regions of North and South America as well as Australia, New Zealand, the Cape Winelands in South Africa and Israel. In some wine regions, the variety is co-fermented with the red wine grape Syrah where it can contribute to the color and aroma of the wine.Wine & Spirits Education Trust \\"Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality\\" pgs 6-9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, Like Chardonnay, Viognier has the potential to produce full-bodied wines with a lush, soft character. In contrast to Chardonnay, the Viognier varietal has more natural aromatics that include notes of peach, pears, violets and minerality. However, these aromatic notes can be easily destroyed by too much exposure to oxygen, which makes barrel fermentation a winemaking technique that requires a high level of skill on the part of any winemaker working with this variety. The potential quality of Viognier is also highly dependent on viticultural practices and climate, with the grape requiring a long, warm growing season in order to fully ripen but not a climate that is so hot that the grape develops high levels of sugars and potential alcohol before its aromatic notes can develop. The grape is naturally a low-yielding variety, which can make it a less economically viable planting for some vineyards. History The origin of the Viognier grape is unknown; it is presumed to be an ancient grape, possibly originating in Dalmatia (present day Croatia) and then brought to Rh√¥ne by the Romans.Enjoying Viognier.com One legend states that the Roman emperor Probus brought the vine to the region in 281 AD; another has the grape packaged with Syrah on a cargo ship navigating the Rh√¥ne river, en route to Beaujolais when it was captured, near the site of present-day Condrieu, by a local group of outlaws known as culs de piaux.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 277 Harcourt Books 2001 The origin of the name Viognier is also obscure. The most common namesake is the French city of Vienne, which was a major Roman outpost. Another legend has it drawing its name from the Roman pronunciation of the via Gehennae, meaning the \\"Road of the Valley of Hell\\". Probably this is an allusion to the difficulty of growing the grape. Viognier was once fairly common. In 1965, the grape was almost extinct, and a source reported only eight acres in Northern Rh√¥ne producing just 1,900 liters of wine at that time. The popularity and price of the wine have risen, and the number of plantings has increased. Rh√¥ne now has over planted. In 2004, DNA profiling conducted at University of California, Davis showed the grape to be closely related to the Piedmont grape Freisa, and to be a genetic cousin of Nebbiolo. Viticulture Viognier leaf growing in Red Willow Vineyard in Washington State. Viognier can be a difficult grape to grow because it is prone to powdery mildew. It has low and unpredictable yields and should be picked only when fully ripe. When picked too early, the grape fails to develop the full extent of its aromas and tastes. When picked too late, the grape produces wine that is oily and lacks perfume. Winemakers in the Condrieu often pick the grapes with a level of sugar that will produce wine with alcohol in the 13% range.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 278 Harcourt Books 2001 When fully ripe the grapes have a deep yellow color and produce wine with a strong perfume and high in alcohol . The grape prefers warmer environments and a long growing season, but can grow in cooler areas as well. In France, the Mistral has a distinct effect on the Viognier vineyards in the Northern Rh√¥ne. The wind tempers the Mediterranean climate of the region, and cools the vines down after the severe heat of summer. Wine expert Remington Norman has identified two distinct strains of Viognier ‚Äî an \\"Old World\\" strain, most common in Condrieu, and a \\"New World\\" strain, which is found in the Languedoc and other areas. Although made from the same grape, the two strains produce distinctly different wines. The age of the vine also has an effect on the quality of the wine produced. Viognier vines start to hit their peak after 15‚Äì20 years. In the Rh√¥ne, there are vines at least 70 years old.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 279 Harcourt Books 2001 Regional production sparkling Viognier from Washington State Viognier has been planted much more extensively around the world since the early 1990s. Both California and Australia now have significant amounts of land devoted to the Viognier grape. There are also notable planting increases in areas of moderate climate such as Virginia's Monticello AVA region. The decline of Viognier in France from its historic peak has much to do with the disastrous predations of the phylloxera insects from North America in Europe in the mid- and late-19th century, followed by the abandonment of the vineyards due to the chaos of World War I. By 1965, only about of Viognier vines remained in France, and the variety was nearly extinct. Even as late as the mid-1980s, Viognier in France was endangered. In parallel to the growth of Viognier in the rest of the world, plantings in France have grown dramatically since then. The grape has been enjoying some success South Africa, New Zealand, Greece and Japan.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 281 Harcourt Books 2001 =France= A Viognier Vin de Pays d'Oc from Languedoc In France, Viognier is the single permitted grape variety in the Rh√¥ne appellations of Condrieu and Ch√¢teau Grillet, which are located on the west bank of the Rh√¥ne River, about 40 km south of Lyon. In the rest of the Rh√¥ne wine region whites, the grape is often blended with Roussanne, Marsanne, Grenache blanc, and Rolle. In the Northern Rh√¥ne, the grape is sometimes blended with Chardonnay. In the C√¥te-R√¥tie AOC, red wine blends can include up to 20% of Viognier though most growers add no more than 5%. Since Viognier ripens earlier than Syrah, the grape is normally harvested separately and added to the Syrah during fermentation. One of the benefits of adding Viognier is that the process of co-pigmentation stabilizes the coloring of the red wine.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 280 Harcourt Books 2001 Vignerons in the rest of France often look to plant Viognier in areas rich in granite soil that have a heat retaining quality that the grape seems to thrive in. Beaujolais winemaker Georges Duboeuf helped expand the reach of the grape with plantings in the Ard√®che region.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 276 Harcourt Books 2001 The majority of French Viogniers are now grown in the Languedoc and sold as Vin de Pays. =North America= A Viognier-based white \\"Rhone-style blend\\" from Washington State. Since the late 1980s, plantings of Viognier in the United States and Canada have increased dramatically. California's Central Coast is the leading producer with over of the grape planted. Californian Viogniers are noticeably higher in alcohol compared to other wines made from the grape. The Rhone Rangers of the mid 1980s helped spark the increased interest in Viognier in California.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 240 Workman Publishing 2001 It has received international attention growing in Virginia, and in 2011 was named Virginia's signature white grape. The grape can also be found in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Washington, Oregon, Michigan, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Missouri and Arizona, Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California as well as British Columbia and the Niagara and Lake Erie North Shore regions of Ontario. =South America= Both Argentina and Chile have significant plantings of the grape with some producers in Brazil and Uruguay also experimenting with the varietal. =Australia= In Australia, Yalumba is the country's largest producer of the grape making both a white wine varietal and making extensive use of the grape in its Shiraz blends. Yalumba grows the grape in the loam and clay soil of the Eden Valley. Other areas with Viognier plantings include Clare Valley, Rutherglen, Murray River, McLaren Vale, Geelong, Nagambie Lakes, Canberra, Mornington Peninsula, Barossa Valley, Adelaide Hills, Geographe, South Burnett, Yarra Valley (Pimpernel Vineyards) and Pyrenees =New Zealand= In New Zealand, small amounts of Viognier are grown on Waiheke Island and Wairarapa. In the Hawke's Bay Region, the grape is used as a single varietal as well as being blended with Syrah to produce a traditional Rh√¥ne style red wine. Wine A Viognier wine from California Viognier wines are well known for their floral aromas, and terpenes, which are also found in Muscat and Riesling wines. There are also many other powerful flower and fruit aromas which can be perceived in these wines depending on where they were grown, the weather conditions and how old the vines were. Although some of these wines, especially those from old vines and the late- harvest wines, are suitable for aging, most are intended to be consumed young. Viogniers more than three years old tend to lose many of the floral aromas that make this wine unique. Aging these wines will often yield a very crisp drinking wine which is almost completely flat in the nose. The color and the aroma of the wine suggest a sweet wine but Viognier wines are predominantly dry, although sweet late-harvest dessert wines have been made. It is a grape with low acidity; it is sometimes used to soften wines made predominantly with the red Syrah grape. In addition to its softening qualities the grape also adds a colour-stabilizing agent and enhanced perfume to the red wine. In the Rhone region, the grapes normally are not affected by the fungus Botrytis cinerea though botrytized Viognier is not unheard of. In winemaking, the grapes are often harvested early in the morning to produce the clearest juice possible. Some winemakers will allow contact with the skins. The skin of Viognier is high in phenols - compounds that can leave an astringent component to the wine if juice is left in contact with the skins for too long. Sometimes the wine is put through malolactic fermentation to give the wine more weight and to decrease acidity. In New World Viognier, the lees may be stirred in a process called batonnage in order to increase the smooth texture of the wine. The wine is then left on the lees till bottling in a manner similar to sparkling wine production. In the creation of the dessert style Viognier, the grapes are often picked in late October or early November in the Northern Hemisphere. A common harvest technique used in the Condrieu is known as √† l'assiette where a plate is held underneath a Viognier vine that is then shaken to allow the overripe grapes to drop onto the plate. Fermentation is then stopped early through the use of sulphur dioxide to allow the wine to retain a high level of residual sugar. The wine is then chilled and put through sterile filtration to ensure that the wine is stable and will not start fermenting again in the bottle. Depending on the winemaking style the grape can often hit its peak at one-two years of age, though some can stay at high levels of quality up to ten years. Typically Condrieu wines are the Viogniers most often meant to be drunk young while Californian and Australian wines can handle age a little bit better.O.

Before any surgery, patients usually undergo hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and, depending on the age at which HRT begins, facial hair removal. There are associated surgeries patients may elect to undergo, including vaginoplasty, facial feminization surgery, breast augmentation and various other procedures.  History  Lili Elbe was the first known recipient of male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, in Germany in 1930. She was the subject of four surgeries: one for orchiectomy, one to transplant an ovary, one for penectomy, and one for vaginoplasty and a uterus transplant. However, she died three months after her last operation. Christine Jorgensen was likely the most famous recipient of sex reassignment surgery, having her surgery done in Denmark in late 1952 and being outed right afterwards. She was a strong advocate for the rights of transgender people. Another famous person to undergo male-to-female sex reassignment surgery was Ren√©e Richards. She transitioned and had surgery in the mid-1970s, and successfully advocated to have transgender people recognized in U.S sports. The first male-to-female surgeries in the United States took place in 1966 at the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. The first physician to perform sex reassignment surgery in the United States was the late Elmer Belt, who did so until the late 1960s. In 1997, Sergeant Sylvia Durand became the first serving member of the Canadian Forces to transition from male to female, and became the first member of any military worldwide to transition openly while serving under the Flag. On Canada Day of 1998, the military changed her legal name to Sylvia and changed her sex designation on all of her personal file documents. In 1999, the military paid for her Sex Reassignment Surgery. Sylvia continued to serve and got promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer. When she retired in 2012, after more than 31 years of service, she was the assistant to the Canadian Forces Chief Communications Operator. In 2017, for the first time, the United States Defense Health Agency approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty U.S. military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who identifies as a woman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on November 14 at a private hospital, since U.S. military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise. Genital surgery When changing anatomical sex from male to female, the testicles are removed (castration), and the skin of foreskin and penis is usually inverted, as a flap preserving blood and nerve supplies (a technique pioneered by Sir Harold Gillies in 1951), to form a fully sensitive vagina (vaginoplasty). A clitoris fully supplied with nerve endings (innervated) can be formed from part of the glans of the penis. If the patient has been circumcised (removal of the foreskin), or if the surgeon's technique uses more skin in the formation of the labia minora, the pubic hair follicles are removed from some of the scrotal tissue, which is then incorporated by the surgeon within the vagina. Other scrotal tissue forms the labia majora. In extreme cases of shortage of skin, or when a vaginoplasty has failed, a vaginal lining can be created from skin grafts from the thighs or hips, or a section of colon may be grafted in (colovaginoplasty). Vaginal expander ZSI 200 NS ZSI 200 NS vaginal expander placed in the neovagina after vaginoplasty Surgeon's requirements, procedures, and recommendations vary enormously in the days before and after, and the months following these procedures. Since plastic surgery involves skin, it is never an exact procedure. Cosmetic refining to the outer vulva is sometimes required. Some surgeons prefer to do most of the crafting of the outer vulva as a second surgery, when other tissues, blood and nerve supplies have recovered from the first surgery. This relatively minor surgery, which is usually performed only under local anaesthetic, is called labiaplasty. The aesthetic, sensational, and functional results of vaginoplasty vary greatly. Surgeons vary considerably in their techniques and skills, patients' skin varies in elasticity and healing ability (which is affected by age, nutrition, physical activity and smoking), any previous surgery in the area can impact results, and surgery can be complicated by problems such as infections, blood loss, or nerve damage. Supporters of colovaginoplasty state that this method is better than use of skin grafts for the reason that colon is already mucosal, whereas skin is not. Lubrication is needed when having sex and occasional douching is advised so that bacteria do not start to grow and give off odors. Because of the risk of vaginal stenosis (the narrowing or loss of flexibility of the vagina), any current technique of vaginoplasty requires some long-term maintenance of volume by the patient using a vaginal expander, or vaginal dilation using graduated dilators to keep the vagina open. Penile-vaginal penetration with a sexual partner is not an adequate method of performing dilation. Daily dilation of the vagina for six months in order to prevent stenosis is recommended among health professionals. Over time, dilation is required less often, but it may be required indefinitely in some cases. Regular application of estrogen into the vagina, for which there are several standard products, may help, but this must be calculated into the total estrogen dose. Some surgeons have techniques to ensure continued depth, but extended periods without dilation will still often result in reduced diameter (vaginal stenosis) to some degree, which would require stretching again, either gradually, or, in extreme cases, under anaesthetic. With current procedures, trans women are unable to receive ovaries or uterus. This means that they are unable to bear children or menstruate, and that they will need to remain on hormone therapy after their surgery to maintain female hormonal status and features. Other related procedures=Facial feminization surgery= Occasionally these basic procedures are complemented further with feminizing cosmetic surgeries or procedures that modify bone or cartilage structures, typically in the jaw, brow, forehead, nose and cheek areas. These are known as facial feminization surgery or FFS. =Breast augmentation= Breast augmentation is the enlargement of the breasts. Some trans women choose to undergo this procedure if hormone therapy does not yield satisfactory results. Usually, typical growth for trans women is one to two cup sizes below closely related females such as the mother or sisters. Oestrogen is responsible for fat distribution to the breasts, hips and buttocks, while progesterone is responsible for developing the actual milk glands. Progesterone also rounds out the breast to an adult Tanner stage-5 shape and matures and darkens the areola. =Voice feminization surgery= Some MTF individuals may elect to have voice surgery, which alters an individual's vocal range or pitch. However, this procedure carries a risk of impairing a trans woman's voice forever. Since estrogen alone does not alter a person's vocal range or pitch, some people take the risk that comes along with voice feminization surgery. Other options, like voice feminization lessons, are available to people wishing to speak with less masculine mannerisms. =Tracheal shave= A tracheal shave procedure is also sometimes used to reduce the cartilage in the area of the throat and minimize the appearance of the Adam's apple in order to assimilate to female physical features. =Buttock augmentation= Some MTF individuals will choose to undergo buttock augmentation because anatomically, male hips and buttocks are generally smaller than those presented on a female. If, however, efficient hormone therapy is conducted before the patient is past puberty, the pelvis will broaden slightly, and even if the patient is past their teen years, a layer of subcutaneous fat will be distributed over the body, rounding contours. Trans women usually end up with a waist to hip ratio of around 0.8, and if estrogen is administered at a young enough age \\"before the bone plates close\\", some trans women may achieve a waist to hip ratio of 0.7 or lower. The pubescent pelvis will broaden under estrogen therapy even if the skeleton is anatomically masculine.

He was one of the most successful visual discoverers of novae and comets. Initially, his interest in astronomy involved observation of meteors and meteor showers, but in 1953 he decided to start searching for comets and in 1955 began searching for novae. His technique was to memorize the patterns of thousands of stars, so that he would visually recognize any intruder. In 1959 he discovered comet C/1959 Q1 (Alcock), the first comet discovered in Britain since 1894, and only five days later discovered another, C/1959 Q2 (Alcock). He discovered two more comets in 1963 (C/1963 F1 Alcock) and 1965. He later discovered his first nova, Nova Delphini 1967 (HR Delphini), which turned out to have an unusual light-curve. He discovered two more novae, LV Vul (in 1968) and V368 Sct (in 1970). He found his fifth and final comet in 1983: C/1983 H1 (IRAS-Araki-Alcock). In 1991 he found the nova V838 Her.

It is also home to the Semperoper Ballett. The building is located near the Elbe River in the historic centre of Dresden, Germany. The opera house was originally built by the architect Gottfried Semper in 1841. After a devastating fire in 1869, the opera house was rebuilt, partly again by Semper, and completed in 1878. The opera house has a long history of premieres, including major works by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. History Interior of the first opera house in 1841 The first opera house, around 1850 The first opera house at the location of today's Semperoper was built by the architect Gottfried Semper. It opened on 13 April 1841 with an opera by Carl Maria von Weber. The building style itself is debated among many, as it has features that appear in three styles: early Renaissance and Baroque, with Corinthian style pillars typical of Greek classical revival. Perhaps the most suitable label for this style would be eclecticism, where influences from many styles are used, a practice most common during this period.Fritz L√∂ffler: Das alte Dresden ‚Äì Geschichte seiner Bauten. 16th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 2006, . Nevertheless, the opera building, Semper's first, was regarded as one of the most beautiful European opera houses. Semperoper with the Theatre Square, 2011 Following a devastating fire in 1869, the citizens of Dresden immediately set about rebuilding their opera house. They demanded that Gottfried Semper do the reconstruction, even though he was then in exile because of his involvement in the May 1849 uprising in Dresden. The architect had his son, Manfred Semper, build the second opera house using his plans. Completed in 1878, it was built in Neo-Renaissance style. During the construction period, performances were held at the Gewerbehaussaal, which opened in 1870. The building is considered to be a prime example of \\"Dresden Baroque\\" architecture. It is situated on the Theatre Square in central Dresden on the bank of the Elbe River. On top of the portal there is a Panther quadriga with a statue of Dionysos. The interior was created by architects of the time, such as Johannes Schilling. Monuments on the portal depict artists, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Moli√®re and Euripides. The building also features work by Ernst Rietschel and Ernst Julius H√§hnel. In the pre-war years, the Semperoper premiered many of the works of Richard Strauss. Interior of the current opera house, 2013 In 1945, during the last months of World War II, the building was largely destroyed again, this time by the bombing of Dresden and subsequent firestorm, leaving only the exterior shell standing. Exactly 40 years later, on 13 February 1985, the opera's reconstruction was completed. It was rebuilt to be almost identical to its appearance before the war, but with the benefit of new stage machinery and an accompanying modern rear service building. The Semperoper reopened with the opera that was performed just before the building's destruction in 1945, Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz. When the Elbe flooded in 2002, the building suffered heavy water damage. With substantial help from around the world, it reopened in December of that year. Present-day administration and operations Today, the orchestra for most operas is the S√§chsische Staatskapelle Dresden. The Generalmusikdirektor (GMD) of the Semperoper is normally a different person from that of the Staatskapelle when it presents concerts. Exceptions have been Karl B√∂hm, Hans Vonk, and Fabio Luisi who have held both positions. Whilst the Semperoper does not have a GMD as of 2015, the current chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden is Christian Thielemann, as of the 2012/13 season. The current Intendant (General Manager) of the company is Wolfgang Rothe. Since the 2018/19 season, Omer Meir Wellber is the Principal Guest Conductor of the S√§chsische Staatsoper Dresden.

It was used both in land and naval warfare. When assembled, the shot resembled a cluster of grapes, hence the name. On firing, the balls spread out from the muzzle, giving an effect similar to a giant shotgun. Grapeshot was devastatingly effective against massed infantry at short range, and was used against massed infantry at middle range. Solid shot was used at longer range and canister at shorter. When used in naval warfare, grapeshot served a dual purpose. First, it continued its role as an anti-personnel projectile. However, the effect was diminished due to a large portion of the crew being below decks and the addition of hammock netting in iron brackets intended to slow or stop smaller shot. Second, the balls were cast large enough to cut rigging, destroy spars and blocks, and puncture multiple sails. Canister shot, also known as case shot fired a larger number of smaller projectiles loosely packaged in a tin or brass container, possibly guided by a wooden sabot. The later shrapnel shell contained similarly smaller projectiles, and used a timed bursting charge to expel those projectiles from the front of the container. Langrage is a type of improvised round that uses chain links, nails, shards of glass, rocks or other similar objects as the projectiles. Although langrage can be cheaply made, its ballistics are inferior to metal spheres.

His work includes the Marvels limited series, his own series titled Astro City, and a four-year run on The Avengers. Early life Busiek was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He grew up in various towns in the Boston area, including Lexington, where he befriended future comic book creator Scott McCloud. Busiek did not read comics as a youngster, as his parents disapproved of them. He began to read them regularly around the age of 14, when he picked up a copy of Daredevil #120 (April 1975). This was the first part of a continuity-heavy four-part story arc; Busiek was drawn to the copious history and cross- connections with other series. Throughout high school and college, he and McCloud practiced making comics. During this time, Busiek had many letters published in comic book letter columns, and originated the theory that the Phoenix was a separate being who had impersonated Jean Grey, and that therefore Grey had not died ‚Äî a premise which made its way from freelancer to freelancer, and which was eventually used in the comics. Busiek explains, \\"A couple of years later, after I‚Äôd broken in, I attended my first convention as a pro, in Ithaca, New York, and I stayed at Roger Stern's house. And we were talking about how much we liked the new X-Men, and he said, 'It's just a pity there's no way to bring Jean Grey back,' and I said, 'Sure there's a way, there's always a way.'\\" Career During the last semester of his senior year, Busiek submitted some sample scripts to editor Dick Giordano at DC Comics. None of them sold, but they did get him invitations to pitch other material to DC editors, which led to his first professional work, a back-up story in Green Lantern #162 (March 1983). After writing four fill-in issues of Power Man and Iron Fist, he was given the series as his first regular assignment. Busiek was a fan of the work his predecessor, Mary Jo Duffy, had done on Power Man and Iron Fist, and emulated her lighthearted, humorous approach, not knowing that the editorial staff disapproved of this approach and had taken Duffy off the series because of it. He was fired from the series for the same reasons as Duffy, after only six issues as its regular writer. In 1985, he wrote a Red Tornado limited series. In 1993, Busiek and artist Alex Ross produced the Marvels limited series which, as comics historian Matthew K. Manning notes, \\"reinvigorated painted comics as a genre, went on to become an acclaimed masterpiece, and spawned more than its own fair share of imitators.\\"Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 268 Busiek and Pat Olliffe crafted the Untold Tales of Spider-Man series beginning in September 1995.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 274: \\"Kurt Busiek and artist Pat Olliffe stepped in to fill the void for the kind of classic Spider- Man stories that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko had imagined as the character's inception.\\" He created the Thunderbolts, a group of super-villains disguised as super-heroes, with the final page of the first issue of the series revealing that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 283: \\"Busiek and company ignored the pleas from Marvel's marketing division who thought that sales would be affected by not revealing the comic's twist. They managed to conceal their comic's confidential ending until the release of the first issue, and indeed shocked their entire fan base with their dramatic reveal.\\" In February 1998, Busiek launched The Avengers vol. 3 with penciler George P√©rezManning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 289: \\"At the top of [Marvel's] short list of dream artists for the Heroes Return project was George P√©rez...But when asked to both write and draw the title, P√©rez declined the invitation, stating he would rather just pencil the book...He did, however, suggest a writer that he wanted to work with ‚Äì Kurt Busiek.\\" and Iron Man vol. 3 with artist Sean Chen.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 289: \\"Tony Stark returned in style...in this new ongoing series by writer Kurt Busiek and artist Sean Chen.\\" Busiek and Carlos Pacheco collaborated on the Avengers Forever limited series in 1998‚Äì1999.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 291: \\"Kurt Busiek and Carlos Pacheco teamed together to tell a time-spanning adventured in the twelve-issue limited series Avengers Forever.\\" This replaced the Avengers: World in Chains series which the two had previously planned to work on. Busiek continued as writer of The Avengers through 2002, collaborating with artists such as Alan Davis and Kieron Dwyer. His tenure culminated with the \\"Kang Dynasty\\" storyline. In 2003, Busiek re- teamed with P√©rez to create the JLA/Avengers limited series.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 311: \\"[JLA/Avengers] was an event that...proved to be one of the biggest and best of the DC and Marvel crossovers, incorporating many of the two companies' greatest heroes and villains.\\" Busiek has worked on a number of different titles in his career, including Arrowsmith, The Liberty Project, The Power Company, Shockrockets, Superman: Secret Identity, JLA, and the award-winning Kurt Busiek's Astro City. In the 1990s, work on some of Busiek's more challenging, less mainstream projects, most notably Astro City, was repeatedly delayed by health problems brought about by mercury poisoning. In 2004, Busiek began a new Conan series for Dark Horse Comics. In December 2005, he signed a two-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. During DC's Infinite Crisis event, he teamed with Geoff Johns on a \\"One Year Later\\" eight- part story arc titled \\"Up, Up and Away!\\" that encompassed both Superman titles. In addition, he began writing the DC title Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis from issues #40‚Äì49. Busiek became the sole writer of the Superman series with issue #654 (Sept. 2006) and Carlos Pacheco became the series' artist. Busiek and Pacheco developed an extended storyine featuring Arion coming into conflict with Superman. The plotline concluded in Superman Annual #13. Busiek wrote a 52-issue weekly DC miniseries titled Trinity, starring Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Each issue except for the first featured a 12-page main story by Busiek, with art by Mark Bagley,Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 333: \\"Writer Kurt Busiek and artist Mark Bagley (in his first project for DC) guided the travails of the three heroes as they struggled to find the secret of a cosmic force.\\" and a ten-page backup story co-written by Busiek and Fabian Nicieza, with art from various artists, including Tom Derenick, Mike Norton and Scott McDaniel. Busiek teamed with Alex Ross on Dynamite Entertainment's Kirby: Genesis, an eight-issue miniseries which debuted in 2011. The series, which was their first full collaboration since Marvels 17 years previous, featured a large group of Jack Kirby's creator-owned characters, the rights to which were acquired by Dynamite, such as Silver Star, Captain Victory, Galaxy Green, Tiger 21 and the Ninth Men. Ross co- plotted, handled designs, and oversaw the series overall with Busiek, who scripted the story.Biggers, Cliff. \\"Kirby Genesis: A Testament to the King's Talent\\"; Comic Shop News #1206; July 2010 In June 2013, Busiek relaunched his Astro City series as part of DC's Vertigo line. Busiek commented that \\"Astro City's always been aimed at a more sophisticated reader, which I think suits Vertigo. Plus our backlist sales are closer to a Vertigo pattern than DCU.\\" The ongoing Astro City series concluded as of issue #52 in 2018. Personal life Busiek is married to Ann Busiek. Both Kurt and Ann Busiek were rendered by Alex Ross as New Yorkers who react to the invasion of Silver Surfer and Galactus on page 17 of Marvels #3. Kurt is later used as the model for a wandering drunk on page 33 of the same issue.

The Spanish name is Lago de Managua or Lago Xolotl√°n. At 1,042 km¬≤, it is approximately long and wide. Similarly to the name of Lake Nicaragua, its name was coined by the Spanish conquerors from \\"Mangue\\" (their name for the M√°nkeme tribes) and agua (\\"water\\"). The city of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, lies on its southwestern shore. Floodings The level of Lake Managua raises significantly during the periods of heavy rain. The highest water level was recorded during the flooding of 1933. The lake rose 3 metres (10 ft) in five days during Hurricane Mitch in 1998, destroying the homes of many who lived on its edge. An even higher flooding occurred in September/October 2010. Since then, the city has prohibited residential use of the most flood-prone areas, those with the elevation below 42.76 meters above sea level. Pollution Lake Managua has been described by some authors as \\"the most contaminated lake in Central America.\\"Douglas Haynes, [The Lake at the Bottom of the Bottom]. VQR, Summer 2011 The lake has been severely polluted, mostly by decades of sewage being dumped into the lake.Hazel Plunkett. Nicaragua: A Guide to the People, Politics and Culture. Interlink Books, Dec 1, 2001. pg. 71 The city sewers have drained into the lake since 1927. It was only in 2009 that a modern wastewater treatment plant (built and operated by the British company Biwater) was opened in Managua, but even it treats only 40% of the city's wastewater. The lake today has no stable outlet, with only occasional floods to Lake Nicaragua through the Tipitapa River. Pollutants are thus concentrated.Thorson, Thomas B., \\"The Status of the Lake Nicaragua Shark: An Updated Appraisal\\" (1976). Investigations of the Ichthyofauna of Nicaraguan Lakes.Paper 41. Despite the pollution, some of the people of Managua still live along the lake's shores and eat the fish. In 2007 the \\"malec√≥n\\" area was dredged and the sediment hauled off on barges. A strong odor which permeated the area from the sediment disappeared. A stone rip-rap and concrete wharf was constructed and a sight seeing boat called \\"La Novia de Xolotl√°n\\" makes hour-long lake tours when there are sufficient tourists. Wildlife About 20 fish species still survive in Lake Managua. While joined to Lake Nicaragua, the bull sharks of that lake cannot migrate to Lake Managua due to a high waterfall on the Tipitapa River.

He was fathered out of wedlock by Panamanian military ruler Omar Torrijos. Mart√≠n Torrijos was educated in economics and political science in the United States. He then returned to Panama, becoming active in the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). He was the party's presidential candidate in the 1999 general election, losing to Arnulfista Party candidate Mireya Moscoso. In the 2004 presidential election, he ran again as the PRD candidate. This time, his primary rival was Solidarity Party candidate Guillermo Endara, whom Torrijos defeated 47% to 31%. Torrijos reformed social security and pensions during his term in office, as well as proposing and passing a $5 billion expansion of the Panama Canal. Torrijos was succeeded by supermarket magnate Ricardo Martinelli in 2009. He is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.  Early life and career  Mart√≠n Torrijos is the son of military ruler Omar Torrijos, who was Panama's social reformer and military strongman from 1968 until his death in a 1981 plane crash. The younger Torrijos is an illegitimate child primarily raised by his mother, but his father publicly acknowledged him when he became a teenager. Born in Chitr√©, Herrera, he graduated from St. John's Northwestern Military Academy located in Delafield, Wisconsin, in the United States and studied political science and economics at Texas A&M; University in College Station, Texas. During his time in the US, he also worked in Chicago, managing a McDonald's restaurant. During the presidency of Ernesto P√©rez Balladares (1994-1999), Torrijos served as deputy minister for the interior and justice. His most significant act as deputy minister was to sign into law the complete privatization of Panama's water utilities. When the new law proved unpopular, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) effected a reversion to the previous system. During his term in office the rate of armed robberies and assault increased. There were several reported cases where SUNTRACS, a workers union, was angered, causing several riots which involved rock flinging.  Presidential campaigns  After the failure of a constitutional referendum that would have allowed PRD incumbent Ernesto P√©rez Balladares to seek a second consecutive term, Torrijos was named to represent the PRD in the 1999 general election. Torrijos was selected in part to try to win back left- leaning voters after the privatizations and union restrictions instituted by P√©rez Balladares. His main opponent was Arnulfista Party candidate Mireya Moscoso, widow of former Panamanian president Arnulfo Arias, who had been deposed in the military coup that had brought Torrijos's father Omar to power. Moscoso ran on a populist platform, beginning many of her speeches with the Latin phrase \\"Vox populi, vox Dei\\" (\\"the voice of the people is the voice of God\\"), previously used by Arias to begin his own speeches. She pledged to support education, reduce poverty, and slow the pace of privatization. While Torrijos ran in large part on his father's memoryincluding using the campaign slogan \\"Omar lives\\"Moscoso evoked that of her dead husband, leading Panamanians to joke that the election was a race between \\"two corpses\\". Torrijos and the PRD were ultimately hampered by the corruption scandals of the previous administration, as well as a scandal in which La Prensa reported that two members of his campaign had been bribed by Mobil to sell a former US military base. Moscoso defeated Torrijos with 45% of the vote to 37%. Torrijos ran again in the 2004 presidential election on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades; Torrijos later made Blades the nation's tourism minister. Torrijos' primary rival was Guillermo Endara, who had served as president from 1990 to 1994. Endara ran as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, on a platform of reducing crime and government corruption. Endara and the other candidates also ran a series of negative ads highlighting the PRD's connections with former military ruler Manuel Noriega. Endara finished second in the race, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos' 47%. Shortly before leaving office, Moscoso sparked controversy by pardoning four menLuis Posada Carriles, Gaspar Jim√©nez, Pedro Remon and Guillermo Novo Sampolwho had been convicted of plotting to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro during a 2000 visit to Panama. Cuba broke off diplomatic relations with the country, and Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez recalled the nation's ambassador. Moscoso stated that the pardons had been motivated by her mistrust of Torrijos, saying, \\"I knew that if these men stayed here, they would be extradited to Cuba and Venezuela, and there they were surely going to kill them there.\\"  Presidency (2004-2009)  Mart√≠n Torrijos and George W. Bush in the Oval Office, February 16, 2007 In May 2005, the Torrijos government proposed increasing pension contributions and raising the retirement age to help pay off the nation's increasing foreign debt. The changes triggered several weeks of protests, strikes, and a student-led closure of the University of Panama, and the proposal to increase the retirement age was postponed. Following opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and union leaders, Torrijos also initially postponed plans to reform social security, though he successfully passed a reform measure later in his term. Torrijos's temporary unpopularity forced him also postpone plans for widening the Panama Canal until 2006. In April of that year, he presented a plan, calling it \\"probably the most important decision of this generation\\". The expansion was projected to double the canal's shipping capacity and allow it to handle oil tankers and cruise ships, at a projected cost of $5 billion. The plan was approved by public referendum on October 22 of that year with 78% of the vote. In November 2006, Torrijos sponsored the Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico's Independence in favor of Puerto Rico's independence and made an energetic call to the United States to recognise the independence of Puerto Rico.Puerto Rico State Electoral Commission: Official Results for the 1998 Political-Status Plebiscite His administration opposed Colombian president Alvaro Uribe's proposals to build a road through the undeveloped Dari√©n Gap connecting the countries, stating that it could damage ecotourism in the region. In 2007, Torrijos negotiated the Panama‚ÄìUnited States Trade Promotion Agreement with the administration of George W. Bush. Though ratified in Panama and apparently headed to ratification in the US, the agreement was derailed in September 2007 when fellow PRD member Pedro Miguel Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n was elected President of the National Assembly. Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n had been indicted by a US grand jury for the 1992 murder of US Army Sgt. Zak Hern√°ndez, and some members of the US Congress vowed to oppose the pact until Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n no longer held the post. Unwilling to publicly battle his party's nationalist wing, Torrijos privately asked Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n to resign, but avoided criticizing him in the press. The deal was finally ratified under Torrijos's successor, Ricardo Martinelli. Torrijos was again popular by the end of his term, but because Panama's constitution forbids consecutive second terms for the presidency, the PRD nominated Balbina Herrera as a candidate to succeed him in 2009. She lost to an independent candidate, Ricardo Martinelli, the owner of a supermarket chain.

History A home-use dome climber The first jungle gym was invented in 1920 and patented by lawyer Sebastian Hinton, in Chicago.Hinton's original patents for the \\"climbing structure\\" are filed July 22, 1920; filed October 1, 1920; filed October 1, 1920; and filed October 24, 1921. It was sold under the trademarked name Junglegym. The term \\"monkey bars\\" appears at least as far back as the 1930s, though Hinton's initial patent of 1920 appeals to the \\"monkey instinct\\" in claiming the benefits of climbing as exercise and play for children,In Hinton wrote on page 3, \\"Again and importantly, the monkey instinct strong in all human beings and perhaps more clearly displayed in children, makes climbing a sport to which children enthusiastically take, by a psychology about the same as that of a kitten at play with a ball, which of course is practice for hunting.\\" and his improvement patents later that year refer to monkeys shaking the bars of a cage, children swinging on a \\"monkey runway\\", and the game of \\"monkey tag\\".In Hinton wrote on page 3, \\"I have found, however, that children seem to like to climb through the structure to some particular point, and there swing head downward by the knees, calling back and forth to each other, a trick which can be explained of course only by the monkey instinct\\", and on page 4 he wrote, \\"I make considerable point of the great strength of the structure, as this is important. Thus most persons have seen a monkey in a zoo, seize the bars of his cage with hands and feet and throw his body violently back and forth, other monkeys following suit. Children in the structure I have erected do the same thing, apparently unconscious of any imitation of monkeys. It can be appreciated that with twenty-five or thirty heavy boys doing this, the strains on the structure are very great.\\" Hinton's father, mathematician Charles Hinton, had built a similar structure from bamboo when Sebastian Hinton was a child; his father's goal was to enable children to achieve an intuitive understanding of three-dimensional space through a game in which numbers for the x, y, and z axes were called out, and each child tried to be the first to grasp the indicated junction. Thus, the abstraction of Cartesian coordinates could be grasped as a name of a tangible point in space.J' is for Jungle Gym\\" from Winnetka, Illinois Historical Society Hinton's second prototype jungle gym is still standing at Crow Island School.

Although the U.S. military has long since abandoned the pattern, it is still in widespread use by militaries across the world as of the early 2010s. Appearance A man modelling an early version of the DBDU in 1976 DBDU trousers, featuring the chocolate-chip camouflage pattern The Desert Battle Dress Uniform was designed in 1976 and uses a camouflage pattern known as the Six-Color Desert Pattern or colloquially as Chocolate-Chip Camouflage and Cookie Dough Camouflage. The camouflage received its nickname because it resembles chocolate-chip cookie dough. It is made up of a base pattern of light tan overlaid with broad swathes of pale green and wide two-tone bands of brown. Clusters of black and white spots are scattered over, to mimic the appearance of pebbles and their shadows. History A drawing of U.S. Marines in the Persian Gulf War with the DBDU Although the chocolate-chip camouflage became well known during the Persian Gulf War, it was originally designed decades prior, in 1962. The U.S. Army, believing that it might one day become necessary to intervene in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflicts, developed a test pattern using the deserts of southwestern United States as a model. When the hostilities in the Middle East wound down, the test pattern was mothballed. The formation of the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) in 1979, with its remit to operate in the Middle East, and protect U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region, saw the need for desert camouflage clothing to emerge again. =U.S. Army= Desert Battle Dress Uniform wearing Lieutenant General Robert C. Kingston, commanding general, US Central Command, fires a German built 7.62 mm G3 Heckler and Koch rifle during BRIGHT STAR '82, an exercise involving troops from the US, Egypt, Sudan, Somalia and Oman With limited issuing dating back to the 1980 mission the rescue American hostages in Iran, the DBDU was unique, in that when it was officially issued in 1981, the 6-color desert pattern was only issued in limited numbers to division personnel like the U.S. 82nd Airborne or 101st Airborne who deployed to Egypt and the Sinai desert to participate in the \\"Bright Star\\" exercise in December 1980. The DBDU was the U.S. Army's first fully functional desert combat pattern from 1981 to 1992. =U.S. Marine Corps= Like the Army, the DBDU was seldom issued whenever Marines were deployed to participate in the \\"Bright Star\\" exercises, but became their standard arid combat uniform by 1985. The 6-color desert pattern was used by the U.S. Marine Corps from 1982 to 1995. =U.S. Air Force= First issued in 1982 for their participation and deployments to arid regions, the DBDU became the United States Air Forces primary desert uniform from 1982 to 1993. =U.S. Navy= Like its sister branches, The Navy began limited issue of the DBDU in the early 80s and became standard wide by 1985. It would remain the Navy's main desert combat uniform from the early 80s to the mid 90s. =U.S. Coast Guard= The Coast Guard was the last branch to see remaining issue of the DBDU in the mid to late 1980s. =Operational use= The six-color desert pattern entered service in 1981 at the same time as the woodland BDUs and would be worn in limited numbers by U.S. troops taking part in the biennial Bright Star exercises in Egypt during the 1980s, and by FORSCOM peacekeepers assigned to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Egyptian Sinai Desert, but was not issued in large numbers prior to the Persian Gulf War. However, there is evidence that the six-color desert pattern camouflage was in use before 1981 with photographs of American military personnel involved in Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980 using this camouflage pattern in the failed attempt to rescue U.S. embassy staff being held hostage in Iran. Feedback from these users indicated that the design contrasted too much with the terrain, preventing the camouflage from blending in effectively. Anecdotal evidence suggested that the dark areas of the pattern warmed up more than the paler parts under desert sunlight, and retained the heat longer. The six colors were also more expensive to manufacture than three or four colors, and the need for a camouflage that would be suitable for use in any desert resulted in a requirement for a new desert camouflage uniform. The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center began the search for a substitute. Samples of sand and earth from the Middle East were measured for optical and infrared reflectance, and seven trial patterns were created using these statistics. The patterns were evaluated in fourteen different desert locations and narrowed down to one favorite. The resulting \\"Desert Camouflage Pattern: Combat\\" was standardized in 1990, but was not ready before troops deployed to Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf War. Consequently, U.S. forces wore the six-color BDUs during the campaign. During that war, after initiatives by General Norman Schwarzkopf, the six-color Desert BDU was produced in 100% cotton poplin without reinforcement panels in order to improve comfort in hot desert conditions. A total of 500,000 improved cotton BDUs were ordered. However, cost concerns caused the cotton six-color Desert BDU to be discontinued shortly after the Persian Gulf War.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 212‚Äì213 =Replacement= An initial batch of desert BDUs in the new camouflage scheme was en route to the Middle East when hostilities ceased. The pattern, officially issued with the newer Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) in the early 1990s, consisted of a subtle blend of large pastel green and light tan shapes, with sparsely placed, narrow, reddish brown patches, leading the design to be unofficially nicknamed the ‚ÄúCoffee Stain‚Äù pattern. Both patterns were briefly used together during the transition period, most notably during Operation Restore Hope and Operation Gothic Serpent (some U.S. Army Rangers during the latter occasionally wore the newer three-color DCU's along with kevlar helmet covers retaining the old six-color pattern. The same dress was also worn by soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in 2001). During Operation Bright Star 1995, Third Army personnel wore the three-color uniform while troops from Fort Bragg (330th MCC) wore the six-color uniform for the 75-day exercise. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. military did not use the DBDU, and instead mostly used the DCU's tri-color pattern and to a lesser extent, the MARPAT camouflage pattern. Legacy Iraqi soldiers in 2006 wearing DBDUs David H. Petraeus meets with the Afghan Border Police Commander, General Abdul Khalil Bakhten, wearing the Saudi grey version As of the early 2010s, the chocolate-chip pattern is still in widespread use across the world, long after the United States abandoned it. A uniform similar to the Desert Battle Dress Uniform was issued to the Iraqi National Guard before it was dissolved in 2004 and to the Iraqi security forces. South Korean forces have used, in limited numbers since 1993, a variant with brown replacing the black in the original U.S. design; this South Korean design has also been tested in the United Arab Emirates. The Oman National Guard use a pattern mixing chocolate-chip with 'amoeba', while the National Guards of both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait use a grey variation on the chocolate-chip design. The Saudis also use a grey, black, and white 'urban' variation and the police wear a blue version of the same design; Palestinian police also use a blue chocolate-chip patterned uniform. The South African \\"Soldier 2000\\" pattern is similar to the U.S. design. A copy of the pattern, using tan, medium brown, bottle-green and greyish green, in addition to the black-on-white pebbles, is used in Kazakhstan.

Early life Thomson was born in Alstead, New Hampshire, the second-eldest of six children. His father, John Thomson, was a farmer and the family lived in a remote country area which Thomson described as a \\"wilderness\\". Both of his parents were Unitarians.New Guide to Health, 1835. p. 19 From a young age he became curious about the various plants which he saw growing in the countryside and their medicinal uses. Much of his early knowledge was acquired from a local widow woman, who had acquired a reputation as a healer because of her skill with herbal remedies. Thomson also used to sample the plants he found growing in the wild‚Äîin this way he discovered Lobelia, which became an important remedy in the system of medicine he later founded. Unaware of the medicinal properties of the plant, Thomson used to trick other boys into eating it, which caused them to vomit because of its emetic nature.Lloyd J.U. The Life and Medical Discoveries of Samuel Thomson, p. 10 ff. thumbnail At the age of sixteen he had hoped to study with a local \\"root\\" doctor (at that time there was no official licensing of the medical profession) but his parents did not think he had the education and could not spare him from his work. Thus, he became resigned to his life as a farm laborer. At the age of nineteen, while he was chopping wood, his ankle sustained a severe injury which, despite the ministration of a local doctor, refused to heal. His condition worsened and the family feared for his life. He decided to treat the wound himself with a comfrey root and turpentine plaster‚Äîafter some weeks he was able to make a recovery. At the age of 21, Samuel's father left for Vermont, placing Samuel in charge of the farm and leaving his mother and sister in his care. Soon after, his mother became ill with measles, and in spite of the efforts of several doctors, Samuel's mother died when the measles turned into \\"galloping consumption\\". When Samuel also became ill with measles, he cured himself using herbal remedies.Harvey. Toadstool Millionaires, Ch. 4 One year later, Thomson married Susanna Allen on July 7, 1790, in Keene, New Hampshire. After the birth of their first child, Susanna became very ill, and a parade of seven conventional doctors were unable to cure her. Samuel arranged for two \\"root doctors\\" to treat his wife, who returned to health the next day. Thomson and Susanna went on to have eight children. Development of the Thomsonian System During his wife's illness, Thomson consulted two herbalists, who treated his wife and taught Thomson some of their methods. Subsequently, Thomson used steam baths and herbs to cure one of his daughters and a son, and a few of his neighbors. In this way, Thomson developed his own method, the \\"Thomsonian System\\", and practiced in Surry, New Hampshire and the adjoining towns. During the first half of the 19th century his system had numerous followers, including some of his sons. It was based upon opening the paths of elimination so that toxins could be removed via physiological processes. This was not unique to Thomson: so-called \\"regular physicians\\" used calomel, a toxic mercury-based compound, to induce vomiting and purgation. Thomson's more moderate and less toxic means attracted large numbers of followers.Dr. Samuel Thompson's Botanic System - from The History of Warren County, Ohio (W. H. Beers & Co. of Chicago, 1882), p304 ff. Displeased with the conventional medicines and enthusiastic about the results he had had by means of his system, he proposed it as a natural alternative, stating: > Much of what is at this day called medicine, is deadly poison, and were > people to know what is offered them of this kind they would absolutely > refuse ever to receive it as a medicine. This I have long seen and known to > be true; and have laboured hard for many years to convince them of the evils > that attend such a mode of procedure with the sick; and have turned my > attention to those medicines that grow in our own country, which the God of > nature has prepared for the benefit of mankind.

Printed and > published for the use of the people. p. 14 Lobelia plant, found in a biographical book about Thomson's work A large red cayenne pepper Eventually, Thomson came to believe that the exposure to cold temperatures was an important cause of illness and that disease should be treated by restoring the body's natural heat. Thomson's methods for doing this included steam baths, the use of cayenne pepper, laxatives, and administration of the emetic Lobelia inflata (also known as \\"Indian tobacco\\" or \\"puke weed\\"). Thomson's book called New Guide to Health; or Botanic Family Physician (1822), suggested home-made preparations and contempt for conventional medicine which he regarded to be as very expensive: Moreover, his system of medicine appealed to the egalitarian anti-elitist sentiments of Jacksonian America in the 1830s, and families far from established towns came to rely on it. At that time, licensed doctors and many of their methods such as bloodletting came under intense scrutiny, so Thomson's innovative system was presented as an appealing alternative that allowed each individual (working classes included) to administer his or her own treatment using natural products. A favorable opinion of his system was given by the contemporary physician Daniel Drake, who perceived him as an American medical reformist: Another opinion by botanist William Hance was given before the Botanic Society in Columbus, Ohio, where Hance said of him: > The science of medicine is confessed by the best men who have ever honored > its splendid halls, or enlightened its mazy paths, to be in a very imperfect > state; then why should we reject or condemn, without a close examination, a > theory and practice merely because they are new or novel? There has been an > almost continued succession of new and novel things, since the creation; and > yet our knowledge as well as the improvement of our intellectual faculties > remain very imperfect. I do not pretend to say, that Dr. Thomson's Theory or > Practice of Medicine is in a state of perfection; but I do say and believe, > that they approach nearer to this state than any other with which I am > acquainted, or that I have reason to believe is known to, or practiced by, > the Medical Faculty of America or Europe.An address and lecture, delivered > before the Botanic Society in Columbus, Ohio (1830) Reception Marsh rosemary Despite Thomson's popularity, some licensed doctors came to resent his work, and he was criticized for his techniques. On the one hand, some people who received his training broke with him and went on to pursue advanced medical education, founding physiomedicalism, while on the other hand, some of his former apprentices like Miler Comings, acknowledged him as an early great mentor.Haller, John S. 1997. Kindly Medicine: Physio- medicalism in America, 1836‚Äì1911. Kent State University Press,. p. 46-47 His detractors like John Brown accused him of lack of anatomical and physiological knowledge, and they attributed Thomson's downfall to a reluctance to interact more with doctors. Legalities and legal charges Thomson's almanac for 1842 In 1809, Thomson was accused of killing a patient, Ezra Lovett, through the administration of excessive amounts of Lobelia. He was legally charged by Lovett's father, but Thomson was acquitted when one of his defense counsel demonstrated that one of the prosecution's exhibits, labeled \\"Lobelia\\", was actually the plant marsh rosemary (Limonium), by consuming some in court. Also, the judge found no basis to establish Thomson's fault or negligence.Bergner, Paul. \\"Lobelia: The controversial death of Ezra Lovett?\\". Medical Herbalism: Journal for the Clinical Practitioner Subsequent literature reviews have failed to demonstrate any deaths or symptoms more dangerous than emesis from even significantly larger doses than Thomson administered in the Ezra Lovett case;Bergner, Paul. \\"Lobelia toxicity: A Literature Review\\" (Medical Herbalism Journal, Vol. 10, Nos. 1‚Äì2). but, medical reviews about Thomson's trial were diverse at the time,Bergner, Paul. Lobelia: Legal considerations in the Samuel Thomson trial. Medical herbalism: Journal for the Clinical Practitioner sometimes very critical. Thomson, however, gave his own account of this case in two of his later books, where he wrote that first he had helped the young man get better, but after carelessness at home, he told the father to seek someone else, though the father refused: > I told the young man‚Äôs father, that it was very doubtful whether I could do > any thing that would help him, but that I would try and do all I could. I > found that the patient was so far gone that the medicine would have no > effect, and in two hours told him that I could not help his son, and advised > him to call some other advice; this was said in the presence of Elder > Williams, and Mr. Raymond. Mr. Lovett made answer that if I could not help > his son, he knew of none who could, and was very desirous for me to stay > with him all night, which I did, and stood by his bed the whole time.A > Narrative of the Life and Medical Discoveries of Samuel Thomson (1832), p. > 146New Guide to Health; Or, Botanic Family Physician (1833), p. 107Samuel > Thomson‚Äôs account of the illness and treatment of Ezra Lovett: Nonetheless, and despite Thomson's acquittal, many states passed \\"Black Laws\\", restricting the practice of unconventional medicine. Black laws were labeled as such by unconventional medical practitioners as a way of comparing them with laws restricting African Americans from practicing medicine and engaging in other activities. The laws were of small practical effect and were mostly repealed by the 1820s.\\"The Influence of Slave Healers\\" - Ch.2 of Bodies of Knowledge: The Influence of Slaves on the Antebellum Medical Community (Virginia Tech University thesis, 1997).Guild, Jane Purcell Guild, Black Laws of Virginia: A Summary of the Legislative Acts of Virginia Concerning Negroes from Earliest Times to the Present (Whittet & Shepperson, 1936); reprinted, (New York: Negro Universities Press, 1969) Thomson saw this as an attempt to destroy his personal career, as he had denounced some of the medical techniques of the time, in 1839, he wrote: > For more than twenty years the Faculty tried to destroy the Thomsonian > system by holding it up as a quackery. In Massachusetts, they began in 1808 > to get the Legislature to help them put me down, and in that State and many > others, laws have been passed since that time to prevent my collecting my > debts, and to make medical practice, without a college diploma, a crime.

Badger, as a Thomsonian physician > sailing under false colors, before Judge Thacher, in the Mu > https://archive.org/stream/reportoftrialofd00thom#page/50/mode/2up] (1839) In 1839, he was taken again to court, blamed for Paine D. Badger's use of his system. Thomson himself published a Report of the trial of Dr. Samuel Thomson, the founder of the Thomsonian practice, for an alleged libel in warning the public against the impositions of Paine D. Badger, as a Thomsonian physician sailing under false colors, before Judge Thacher (1839), where he expressed that he was worried about the use other people could do under his name. Partly because of this, he took great care to guard his patented cures, and used legal authority to prevent others from manufacturing and selling lobelia pills, for instance. He sold rights to use his system of medicine to any family for $20. Right-holders were able to purchase Thomson's herbs and formulas, which he distributed from a central warehouse, and a copy of Thomson's book. He had sold over 100,000 patents by 1840,Malstrom, Stan. Dr. Samuel Thomson (Herbalist, Vol 1, No. 7, 1976). but this consortium was broken by Alva Curtis, who created the \\"Independent Thomsonian Medical Society\\" to train practitioners. Illustrating another case, Thomson wrote: > Almost every newspaper from abroad brings the name of some person setting up > as a Thomsonian Doctor and passing as my agent, of whom I know nothing and > who knows nothing of my system or medicines from me. A man calling himself > Benjamin Thomson has just opened in Alexandria, District of Columbia, and > advertises in the National Intelligencer.

H.; John A. Brown, Providence, R. > I.; G. Larabee at Baltimore; Clark & Wilder at Randolph, Mass. Herbalist Michael Moore, gives a flavor criticism of the debate of the times, stating that Thomson's own perception of the controversies was \\"couched in seeming venal paranoia\\", and that: > Thomson's movement had affected a million or more Americans, started a > medical reformation that would not peak for another 50 years, and the > brightest medical minds of the time were split vehemently both against and > for Thomson's right to practice...bitterly divided between Federalists and > Republican politics...Populists and Elitists...rural and urban.

Messy and fascinating stuff.Classic works in > herbal medicine (webpage) Notably, the eclectic herbalist John Uri Lloyd, in his introduction to the edition of Life and medical discoveries of Samuel Thomson, states that Thomson was involved in William Morgan's Anti-masonic controversy in New York, and argues that he was thus persecuted in part for political reasons: > One can not now easily enter into the problems of that day concerning > medicine and the practice of medicine.

The original German 5-color pattern was designed for use in European temperate woodland terrain. A 3-color variation called Tropentarn (formerly W√ºstentarn) is intended for arid and desert conditions; the German Bundeswehr wore it in Afghanistan. The original German 5-color flecktarn has been adopted, copied and modified by many countries for their own camouflage patterns.  History  The German Army started experimenting with camouflage patterns before World War II, and some army units used Splittermuster (\\"splinter pattern\\") camouflage, first issued in 1931. Waffen-SS combat units used various patterns from 1935 onwards. Many SS camouflage patterns were designed by Prof. Johann Georg Otto Schick.  Modern patterns  German Flecktarn uniform in 2015 In 1976, the Bundeswehr in Germany developed a number of prototype camouflage patterns, to be trialled as replacements for the solid olive-grey \\"moleskin\\" combat uniform. At least four distinct camouflage patterns were tested during Bundeswehr Truppenversuch 76 (\\"Bundeswehr Troop Trial 76\\"). These were based on patterns in nature: one was called \\"Dots\\" or \\"Points\\"; another was called \\"Ragged Leaf\\" or \\"Saw Tooth Edge\\"; another was based on pine needles in winter. Designed by the German company Marquardt & Schulz, several patterns were developed and tested by the German military. The pattern named \\"Flecktarn B\\" was chosen as the final pattern for use. The word flecktarn is a composite formed from the German words Fleck (spot, blot, patch or pattern) and Tarnung (camouflage). The Bundeswehr kept its green combat dress throughout the 1980s, however, while trials were conducted. Flecktarn was only widely introduced in 1990 in a newly reunited Germany. In Germany, the Flecktarn camouflage pattern is used by all Bundeswehr service branches, the Heer (army), the Luftwaffe (air force), some Marine (navy) units and even the Sanit√§tsdienst (medical service). Its official name is 5 Farben-Tarndruck der Bundeswehr (5-color camouflage print of the Bundeswehr).TL 8305-0290: 5 Farben-Tarndruck der Bundeswehr (PDF; 242 kB) This temperate Flecktarn 5-color scheme consists of 15% light green, 20% light olive, 35% dark green, 20% brown and 10% black. The Dutch military tested the pattern and rejected it, allegedly because it was \\"too aggressive\\". Flecktarn was seen as controversial because of its resemblance to the Waffen- SS \\"peas\\" and \\"oak leaves\\" patterns, which also used dots in various colors. In 2016, there were tests being conducted by the Research Institute of materials and property of the Bundeswehr (Wehrwissenschaftliche Institut f√ºr Werk- und Betriebsstoffe ‚Äì WIWeB) on a new pattern called Multitarn as a potential replacement for Flecktarn.https://defence-blog.com/army/new- multitarn-patterns-for-the-bundeswehr.html Variants Flecktarn is the basis for the Bundeswehr's Tropentarn desert camouflage, the Danish military's T/78 and M/84 camouflage, including a desert variation of the Danish pattern. Several variations of the Flecktarn camouflage are also used by the Russian military, one is called Sever (\\"north\\"), sometimes also referred as Flectarn-D while another variant is called Tochka-4. Other country's variations include Japan's Type II Camouflage; Type 03 Plateau camouflage, used by the Chinese military in Tibet (and some Russian Special Forces); and an urban variation used by some police units in Poland. A Chinese-made commercially available variant with 3 of the 5 color screens reversed has been used by some units of the Kyrgyzstan military.https://i44.servimg.com/u/f44/17/04/56/80/kyrgyz10.jpg{ In 2013, the German company Mil-Tec introduced a new version of Flecktarn, called the Arid Flecktarn. It retains the 5-color pattern but with the colour scheme resembling that of MultiCam. It remains a commercial variant and is not in use by any world military.

Raised in a family allied to Paname√±ista Party founder Arnulfo Arias, Endara attended school in exile in the United States and Argentina following Arias's removal from power. Endara later received a law degree in Panama. He subsequently served as a member of Panama's National Assembly, and briefly as a government minister before heading into exile again following Arias' third overthrow. After Arias' death in 1988, Endara became a leading opponent of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama. Endara was sworn in as the new president on the first night of the invasion on a U.S. military base. During his presidency, Endara abolished the Panamanian military and replaced it with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto P√©rez Balladares on September 1, 1994. Endara ran for office again in 2004 and 2009, but lost to Democratic Revolutionary Party candidate Mart√≠n Torrijos and to independent candidate Ricardo Martinelli. He died of a heart attack on September 28, 2009, several months after his last campaign. Early life and career Endara was born in 1936 in Panama City, Panama. His father, Guillermo Endara Paniza, was an ally of Authentic Paname√±ista Party founder Arnulfo Arias, and the family went into exile after Arias was overthrown in a 1941 coup. Endara went to school in Argentina and to Black-Foxe Military Institute in Los Angeles in the United States, where he was described as being a \\"brilliant student\\". He later attended the University of Panama Law School, where he graduated first in his class, and New York University. He returned to Panama in 1963 to practice law, and specialized in labor law. He co-founded the firm of Solis, Endara, Delgado and Guevara, one of Panama's most successful law firms. He won his first public office in 1964, but declined to take it due to evidence of voter fraud in the election. Endara later served two terms in the National Assembly. In 1968, Endara served as minister of planning and economic policy during Arias's very brief third term as president. When Arias was overthrown again in October 1968, Endara went underground, was jailed briefly in 1971, and joined Arias in exile until 1977. Endara remained politically engaged and when Arias died in 1988, Endara became a leading opposition figure. Opposition to Noriega In the presidential election of 1989, Endara ran as the candidate of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition (ADOC), a coalition of parties opposed to military ruler Manuel Noriega. His rival was Carlos Duque, a candidate selected by Noriega. The US government contributed $10 million to Panamanian opposition campaigns, though it was unknown whether Endara received any of this money. To safeguard against planned vote-rigging by Noriega, ADOC organized a count of results from the country's election precincts before they were sent to the district centers. It showed Endara trouncing Duque by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. Noriega's cronies took phony tally sheets to the district centers, but by this time the opposition's count was already out. International observers led by former US President Jimmy Carter and a separate group of observers appointed by US President George H. W. Bush also agreed that Endara had won a decisive victory. Noriega had planned to declare Duque the winner regardless of the actual results, but Duque knew he'd been routed and refused to go along. Regardless, Noriega annulled the results before counting was complete due to \\"foreign interference.\\" The next day, Endara and his running mates, Ricardo Arias Calder√≥n and Guillermo Ford, led a contingent of a thousand supporters to protest the annulment of the elections and urge that the ADOC candidates be recognized as the winners. The protest was attacked by a detachment of Dignity Battalions, a paramilitary group supporting Noriega, and the three candidates were badly beaten. Endara was struck with an iron club, leaving a gash on his head. He was briefly hospitalized and received eight stitches. Images of the attacks on Endara and Ford were carried by media around the world, and were credited with building public support in the US for the invasion that would soon follow. Presidency (1989-1994) Bill Clinton with Presidents of Central American nations on the state floor of the White House. The US armed forces overthrew Noriega's government during the US invasion of Panama in December 1989. Endara had by this time taken refuge in the military bases under US control. American officials told Endara that if he did not accept the presidency, the only alternative would be an undisguised American occupation. Though Endara had opposed US military action during his campaign, he accepted the presidency, stating later that, \\"morally, patriotically, civically I had no other choice\\". He was certified the winner of the election and inaugurated at Fort Clayton, a United States military base, on December 20, 1989. Arias was inaugurated as first vice president, and Ford as second vice president. Unlike previous rulers Omar Torrijos and Noriega, Endara appointed only whites to ministerial positions, excluding Panama's large mestizo population and other ethnicities. Seen as a restorer of democracy, Endara was later noted for having defended freedom of speech and democratic institutions. He also oversaw a reform of the Panamanian Defense Forces, purging Noriega loyalists, asserting the primacy of the civilian government, and returning the group from military to a national police force. In October 1994, the National Assembly passed an amendment abolishing the military at Endara's urging, becoming the second Latin American country to do so. In early 1991, the ADOC coalition began to unravel as Endara, Arias, and Ford publicly criticized one another. On April 8, accusing Arias's Christian Democratic Party of not rallying to his support during an impeachment vote, Endara dismissed Arias from the cabinet. Arias resigned from the vice presidency on December 17, 1992, stating at a news conference that Endara's government \\"does not listen to the people, nor does it have the courage to make changes\\". Endara responded that Arias's resignation was \\"demagoguery\\" and \\"merely starting his 1994 political campaign ahead of time\\". Endara's term in office saw marked economic recovery from the nation's years of military rule. During his presidency, Panama had an average annual economic growth of 8%. However, unemployment also rose near 19%. In February 1990, the overweight Endara began a hunger strike in the Metropolitan Cathedral to call attention to the nation's poverty and to pressure US President George H. W. Bush to dispense previously pledged American aid. In the course of the strike, he lost more than thirty of his two hundred and sixty pounds. By May 1992, Endara's public approval rating had fallen from its initial 70% to only 10%. The Associated Press later described Endara's administration as being \\"tarnished by scandal\\". Among other financial scandals, Endara's wife Ana Mae Diaz was accused of reselling food that had been donated by Italy on the streets of Panama City. In 1992, Diaz won $125,000 in the national lottery and indicated that she intended to keep the money rather than donating it; the incident was also cited as an example of the Endara's administration's lack of concern for Panama's poor. Later career In 2004, Endara broke with the Arnulfista party over differences of opinion with the party's leader, Panamanian president Mireya Moscoso, and accused the party of corruption. He ran in the 2004 presidential election as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, on a platform of reducing crime and government corruption. His primary rival was Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Mart√≠n Torrijos, son of the former military dictator Omar Torrijos. Mart√≠n Torrijos ran on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades. Endara finished second, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos' 47%. He later founded his own political party, the Moral Vanguard of the Fatherland, and in 2009 was again a candidate for the Panamanian general elections. Ricardo Martinelli of the Democratic Change party won the election with 61% of the vote, while PRD candidate Balbina Herrera won 37%. Endara placed a distant third, with 2% of the vote. Just a few months later, on September 28, 2009, Endara died at the age 73 in his apartment in Panama City, of a heart attack while preparing dinner. He was given a state funeral on September 30 attended by President Martinelli as well as former presidents Perez Balladares, Moscoso, and Torrijos. Personal life Endara married his first wife Marcela, in 1961; the couple had one daughter, Marcelita, and three grandchildren, Javier, Marcela Victoria and Jacob. Marcela died of a heart attack in 1989 while Endara was hospitalized from the attack by the Dignity Brigades. He remarried on June 11, 1990, at the age of 54, to Ana Mae Diaz Chen, a 22-year-old law student of Chinese origin. Endara was reportedly so happy in the marriage that he would even leave cabinet meetings for \\"a quick cuddle\\". The marriage received widespread coverage and mockery in the Panamanian press, including a new nickname for Endara, El Gordo Feliz (\\"Happy Fatty\\").

Katimavik provides opportunities for young Canadians to participate in five to six-month periods of community service throughout the country via the acclaimed National Experience program. It was founded in 1977 by the late Senator Jacques H√©bert and Honourable Barney Danson, a former Minister of National Defence, as a way for young people to learn the value of civic engagement while getting introduced to the diversity of the country. In the National Experience, Katimavik Participants live in groups of 11 in two different regions of the country. Participants come from various cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, including from Indigenous and LGBTQ communities They volunteer full-time for not-for-profit organizations and engage in experiential learning to improve their second official language, learn about environmental stewardship and Canadian cultures, and develop healthy living habits and leadership skills. Since its inception, the program has seen over 36,000 participants, including over a hundred in the Summer 2018 and Winter 2019 sessions. Currently, Katimavik is led by John-Frederick Cameron, an experienced executive in the Canadian charitable sector, and a staunch youth empowerment and social justice advocate. Overview The Katimavik National Experience consists of groups of 11 youth, ages 17 to 25, who come from across Canada. They travel together to two different places in Canada for a period of five to six months. During the 2018-19 program year, Katimavik had 198 Participants spread across six communities: Nanaimo, BC; Calgary, AB; Winnipeg, MB; Sudbury, ON; Quebec City; QC; Moncton, NB. Each youth volunteers for at least 30 hours per week and completes a learning program that focuses on Canada's official languages, eco- stewardship, leadership, cultural diversity, and healthy living. Each year, over 500 community non-profit organizations are assisted by Katimavik Participants doing full-time work for them. Katimavik has had volunteer projects in all 10 Canadian provinces and three territories. Katimavik has signed partnerships with a number of post-secondary institutions in Canada, including Vancouver Island University, Capilano University, Quebec's public community colleges (CEGEP), Trent University, and George Brown College in order for Katimavik participants to receive post-secondary credit for their experiences. Katimavik has its national headquarters in Montr√©al, Quebec. History Katimavik was started by Pierre Trudeau's government and then Senator Jacques H√©bert as well as then Minister of National Defence Barney Danson. Legally, it was incorporated as OPCAN, a non-profit corporation created by letters patent dated January 26, 1977 pursuant to Part II of the Canada Corporations Act. Much of Katimavik's structure was taken from Canadian Cadet Organizations and the defunct Company of Young Canadians. In the 1980s Katimavik offered a military option, an opportunity to spend three months on an Army or Navy base learning fundamental skills such as first aid and map reading, as well as basic military skills, such as drills and rifle handling. The overall program grew quickly in its initial years to its peak in 1985-86, when it engaged over 5,000 Participants.[citation needed] The program was cancelled that year by Brian Mulroney's new government. The cancellation prompted founder Jacques H√©bert to undertake on a 21-day hunger strike in protest, to no avail. He subsequently worked with Quebec region director Claude Raiche to continue Katimavik as an outdoor recreation training centre at Notre-Dame-de-l'√éle-Perrot. It continued in this form until 1994 when Youth Service Canada helped Katimavik to form a pilot program involving six projects and 66 Participants. The next year, the Government of Canada's Department of Heritage provided the program with ongoing funding and the number of projects and youth tripled. The program then continued to grow; during the 2005-2006 program year there were 1,155 Participants in 105 communities across Canada. In 2008, Katimavik was granted consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which has allowed Katimavik to liaise with similar organizations in other countries and represent Canada internationally. In 2006, Katimavik was told by the government that its funding was under review and that it was to cease recruitment activities. A letter-writing campaign was organized by Katimavik and funding levels were maintained until October 2010 when the government announced three-year funding in the sum of $15 million per year, a reduction from its previous funding levels ($19.7 million). Current Leadership Katimavik is currently led by John-Frederick Cameron, an experienced executive in the non-profit and charitable sectors. Cameron was appointed to the position in November 2019. His objectives are to increase Katimavik‚Äôs visibility, broaden and improve the National Experience, and diversify the organization's programming and funding sources. Program Life Participants volunteer at least 30 hours a week and engage in workshops and activities with their fellow group members and Project Leader. Three groups in close communities form a \\"cluster\\" that may often meet up together for certain activities. Each cluster of four projects is monitored by a Project Coordinator. During the program, Participants can expect to abide by certain standards of behaviour which fall into four main categories: participation, health and safety, and respect. Participants are monitored by their Project Leader, who resides in-house and supports the project. Project leaders can issue verbal warnings, commitments to improve, final warnings, and expulsions if the behavioural standards are not followed. Katimavik provides opportunities to build Participants' skills during the course of the program through youth-led activities and workshops. Katimavik also implements a learning plan, which uses an AARR educational model (Anticipation, Action, Reflection, Recognition) and follows participants through each community. Participants receive four letters of appraisal (2 from the project leaders, and 2 from work supervisors), as well as a certificate of completion upon finishing the program. While Participants are in the program, they will spend a week of their time in each community living with a \\"host family\\". This is a family living in the community that has agreed to take on a participant (or two). This allows the participant to take some time off from group life, while living with members of the community, and learning what it's like to be a local. Each ~~Every~~ group, every three months, is given budgets of varying amounts for groceries, activities, and transportation. This money is spent in ways that correspond to program's learning objectives. The goal of the program's educational component is to build the capacities of participants in the following key areas: ‚óè Interact with others in a variety of situations ‚óè Adopt an open attitude towards the diversity of social and multicultural realities ‚óè Communicate in both official languages ‚óè Engage in diverse work experiences ‚óè Apply habits that favor a healthy lifestyle ‚óè Develop an integrated vision of environmental protection and sustainable development ‚óè Engage as a citizen ‚óè Prepare to integrate, as a citizen, into the job market, school or other life event Katimavik elimination, protests, and restoration attempts In the 2012 Canadian federal budget, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the program would be eliminated. The stated reason was the comparatively high per-person cost of the program when compared to other government youth initiatives. A Nationwide day of protest was held on July 21, 2012. Prominent politicians such as Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party, and NDP MP Charmaine Borg supported the rally. The Conservative party encountered protest from politicians and supporters of the program after the budget was announced. An Ontarian mother, Colleen Cleve attempted to lodge a Class-Action lawsuit on behalf of the 600 Canadian youths who were selected but retroactively denied, her own two children among them. She stated that the Federal government prematurely revoked and reneged on the contract with the youths, as government funding was not scheduled to expire until a year later in March 2013. NDP MP Charmaine Borg embarked on a cross-country tour to raise awareness and rally support in 2012. She has also introduced Bill 352 to restore $15M CAD Federal funding to the program. Liberal party leader Justin Trudeau also called for restoring funding to the program; his father. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, had established the program. The Katimavik online petition was one of many launched by the Liberal Party in 2012. Justin Trudeau claimed that the reasons the program was cancelled were ideological differences, comparing the $14M for the community-oriented Katimavik program with $207M for the military-oriented Cadet program. Katimavik activists embarked on a cross-country movement to relay packages to Stephen Harper, including a journal signed by supporters along the way, a Katimavik T-shirt, and signed petitions requesting reversal of the decision The relay was routed through 50 communities served by Katimavik. Olympic gold medalist kayaker Adam van Koeverden has said that he owes his own existence to an encounter between his parents, who worked as Katimavik team leaders upon university graduation and for five years later. Van Koeverden describes Canadian youths as suffering from a crisis of identity as they try to define their relevance in life, and that Katimavik would be ideal to help them discover themselves. In 2012, the University of Ottawa chapter of the Young Liberals of Canada devised a 'Pennies 4 Katimavik' penny drive inspired by the budget's announcement of the Canadian penny's obsolescence and of termination of government funding. The event was intended to raise $5K CAD and to inform the public of the merit of Katimavik and of the fate of its funding.Similar drives were conducted through the country and announced by the project's Facebook page. 2018 Relaunch In 2018, Katimavik was relaunched through the newly-created Canada Service Corps, a youth service initiative launched by the federal government aimed at engaging youth in community service across the country. Katimavik is one of 12 organizations under the Canada Service Corps banner. Beyond the Canada Service Corps, Katimavik also receives support from Employment and Social Development Canada.

From May 2009, he passed the presidency of Super 99 to Luis Enrique Martinelli.https://www.super99.com/sobre-nosotros.php (Spanish)  Politics  During the presidency of Ernesto P√©rez Balladares, Martinelli served as Director of Social security from 1994 to 1996. From September 1999 to January 2003, during the presidency of Mireya Moscoso, he served as chairman of the board of directors of the Panama Canal and as the Minister for Canal Affairs. Martinelli is the president of the Democratic Change party, which was founded in May 1998. He led the party and was the presidential candidate during the 2004 general election, when his party came in last; Martinelli received 5.3% of the vote and came in fourth place in the election. Martinelli was the leader of Democratic Change and presidential candidate in the 2009 general election. He ran on a pro-business platform, promising to cut political corruption and reduce violent crime and spent an estimated $35 million on promoting his campaign. By Election Day, Martinelli was the favorite to win the election, with opinion polls giving him a double-digit lead over the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD)‚ÄìPeople's Party coalition. He had the support of the Alliance for Change, a group of political parties that includes his own Democratic Change party, the Paname√±ista Party, the Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement, and the Patriotic Union Party. His main opponent was PRD candidate Balbina Herrera. Though initially the favorite, she was damaged in the election by her links to former military ruler Manuel Noriega and by the perception that she was a \\"Chavista\\", a supporter of leftist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Martinelli was also helped by strong support from the business community. On May 3, 2009, Martinelli won the national election by a landslide, with over 60% of the votes, compared to Herrera, who received about 36%. Former president Guillermo Endara finished a distant third. This was the second-largest majority in Panamanian history and the largest since 1989. Martinelli's victory was an exception to a trend of victories for left-leaning Latin American candidates. He was sworn in on July 1, 2009. Presidency (2009‚Äì2014) Martinelli served as president from 2009 through 2014, during which time the Panamanian economy grew robustly and steadily. As reported by The Economist, \\"Though it lies in Central America, the poorest and most violent region in the West, the country's 3.6m citizens are now richer than most Latin Americans.\\" As reported in the New York Times: \\"Panama is booming, with an average economic growth of 9 percent in the past five years, the highest in Latin America.\\" This prosperity widely benefited Panama, with unemployment declining from 6.6% to 4.1%. Income disparity also declined: according to The Economist, \\"the incomes of the poorest 10% are now 35 times lower than those of the richest 10%, rather than 60 times lower, according to the finance ministry.\\" Gross domestic product grew by nearly half, while GDP per capita, according to the World Bank, rose 11%, from $9,982 (2010) to $11,036 (2014). Martinelli introduced a number of measures designed to alleviate poverty, including a $100 monthly pension for the elderly, an increase in the minimum wage, and subsidies for students to meet the cost of uniforms and supplies. He also increased the minimum wage, making it the highest of Latin America. He also implemented measures to help Col√≥n, an impoverished city on the Gulf Coast. This included projects like a new highway connecting Panama and Col√≥n, the Canal expansion, construction of a new hospital and other public works intended to help reduce unemployment and poverty. The government also announced a $9 million project to rehabilitate Col√≥n's seaside park. =Pro-business policies, and raising taxes= Twice during his first year in office, Martinelli proposed and signed into law tax reforms to simplify filings, reduce rates, and improve collection. The number of income brackets was reduced from five to two, the corporate tax rate was cut to 25%, and delinquent collection was outsourced. The tax reform imposed and collected taxes on a large swath of Panama's elite, which had largely avoided significant taxation. The program was not without controversy. A spokesperson for Fitch Group stated that the tax reform \\"underpin[ned] the government's commitment to sustainable fiscal policies.\\" =Anti-Palestinian foreign policy= In 2012, Panama‚Äîalong with the U.S.‚Äîwas one of the few countries that voted against Palestine in a key U.N. vote. =Infrastructure investment= As of 2010, Martinelli's administration announced plans, ultimately fulfilled during his term, to invest $20 billion over the next four years on infrastructure designed to enhance Panama's role as a global logistics hub and increase foreign direct investment. The plan included greater investment in roads, hospitals, sewers, schools, and a Panama City metro. Fitch Group called the \\"ambitious public investment program\\" part of \\"Panama's highly favorable investment cycle.\\" The cornerstone of Martinelli's expansion program was the $5.3 billion expansion of the Panama Canal. He oversaw investment in ports, and the construction of a giant causeway around the old part of town, which also features a new Biomuseo (also known as the Biodiversity Museum: Panama Bridge of Life) designed by Frank Gehry. =Pro-business policies= Martinelli oversaw the final approval of the Panama‚ÄìUnited States Trade Promotion Agreement, which was signed more than two years before he took office but had not been finalized. Martinelli had designated the completion of this agreement as his top priority upon taking office. The agreement was ratified by the US Congress on October 13, 2011. He also oversaw the approval of a comprehensive Association treaty with other regional countries and the European Union. Through pro-business policies, Martinelli saw through the growth of Panama as an international transport and financial hub. According to The Economist, \\"Its canal is becoming the backbone of a transoceanic logistics network. Its airline, Copa, connects much of Latin America. Its offshore-banking sector sucks in Latin American money.\\" =Rule of Law= Martinelli also undertook efforts to increase the \\"Rule of Law\\" in Panama and to create greater transparency in its institutions. According to the New York Times, \\"American law enforcement officials give the country credit for improving its police forces and cooperation with international agencies.\\" Furthermore, they report that \\"In the past two years [Panama] has signed agreements with 12 countries, including the United States, to exchange tax and other information upon request, a tool to investigate financial criminals.\\" In addition, Martinelli upheld and reinforced drug trafficking laws throughout his presidency. In 2012 alone, the Panamanian government seized over 11 tons of cocaine, as reported by IHS. =Panama becomes \\"investment grade\\" = During Martinelli's term, Panama's sovereign debt rating was upgraded to \\"investment grade\\" by Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's. Fitch had upgraded Panama twice since Martinelli took office, and Standard & Poor's followed its upgrade with a revised \\"positive\\" outlook. The Fitch upgrade was described as \\"a victory for conservative President Ricardo Martinelli, who has pushed two tax reforms through Congress since taking office\\". Martinelli's policies contributed to credit upgrades but also robust increases in foreign direct investment. During his tenure, it rose from $1,259.3 billion (2009) to $4,651.3 billion (2013). According to the New York Times, direct investment in real estate was exemplified by \\"the tallest building in Latin America, a 70-story Trump hotel and condo tower,\\" further growth in financial services (\\"banking is booming\\") with \\"well-heeled foreign transplants\\" spending on local services and goods. =Reputation while in office = Martinelli experienced high popularity ratings during his term of office, at one time in excess of 90%, the highest in the Americas at the time. In 2014, when he was preparing to leave office, his approval rating was still high, at 65%. The party he heads, the Democratic Change party, has continued to see strong legislative support: with Martinelli at its leader it continues to hold the biggest bloc of 30 seats, versus 12 seats for Paname√±ista Party in the 71-seat National Assembly. Martinelli remains the leader of Panama's opposition party. Martinelli has also been criticized in the local and international media. In 2011, The Economist described the foreign investment as still hurt by \\"doubts about the rule of law\\", citing suspected corruption in the bidding for the metro contract and the flooding of a wealthy Panama City neighborhood with sewage due to a lack of enforcement of planning laws. Martinelli was also criticized during his presidency for authoritarian tactics. He sought to reduce the time period before the president could run for re-election though he withdrew when it proved unfeasible. He was accused of tampering with the Supreme Court. In August 2009, the US Ambassador to Panama, Barbara J. Stephenson, wrote to the US State Department that Martinelli had asked her for wiretaps on his political opponents, and she complained of his \\"bullying style\\" and \\"autocratic tendencies\\". A copy of the cable was released in December 2010 by WikiLeaks. After the leak, Martinelli's administration said that \\"help in tapping the telephones of politicians was never requested\\" and that Stephenson was \\"mistaken\\" in her interpretation. In December 2011, former military ruler Manuel Noriega was extradited from France to Panama by Martinelli's government. Critics charged that Martinelli had requested the extradition to turn public attention away from administration scandals, an accusation denied by the French and Panamanian governments.  Honours  On February 20, 2010, the University of Arkansas established the Ricardo A. Martinelli Berrocal Scholarship to provide financial aid to prospective University of Arkansas students from Panama. He was also presented with the Citation of Distinguished Alumnus award and was made an official ambassador of the State of Arkansas by Governor Mike Beebe. On June 16, 2013, received and acknowledgement from the FAO in Rome, Italy, for helping to reduce the child malnutrition in the Panamenian territory. It took place during the 38th Session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Conference. Martinelli was awarded besides other thirty seven countries. *80px Knight Grand Cross, Special Class of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George, Royal House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (July 28, 2012) *80px Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (July 29, 2013) Private life In 1978, Martinelli married Marta Linares, with whom he has three children: Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Linares, Luis Enrique Martinelli Linares, and Carolina Martinelli Linares. Ricardo and Luis Enrique are accused of having received at least 22 million dollars of the Brazilian company Odebrecht, involved in a vast scandal of corruption. The money had then been hidden on bank accounts in Switzerland. =Arrest= On June 12, 2017, Martinelli was arrested at Coral Gables in south Florida after a provisional arrest warrant issued by the U.S. Justice Department in response to a request from Panama and was set to appear on Federal Court.

Stanley Sadie. 20 vol. London, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., 1980. composer, music editor and publisher, and music theorist of the High Renaissance. Biography Claude Goudimel was born in Besan√ßon, modern-day France, which at that time was a French-speaking imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. Few details of his life are known until he is documented in Paris in 1549, where he was studying at the University of Paris; in that year he also published a book of chansons. In the early 1550s he worked with printer , and may have still been studying at the University of Paris until 1555; by 1555 he was also Du Chemin's partner in the publishing business. Goudimel moved to Metz in 1557, converting to Protestantism, and is known to have been associated with the Huguenot cause there; however he left Metz due to the increasing hostility of the city authorities to Protestants during the Wars of Religion. First he settled in his native town of Besan√ßon, and later moved to Lyon. It is supposed Goudimel was murdered in Lyon in August 1572, during the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, along with much of the Huguenot population of the city. His last letter to his close friend and poet Melissus showing Goudimel sick with fever on August 23, 1572, allowed M. Weckerlin to suppose that instead of dying in the massacre of Saint Barthelemy, the master could have died quite simply in his bed. However, there is no definitive evidence to support or contradict either theory of his passing. The death of Goudimel inspired among the versifiers of this time a respectable number of epitaphs, sonnets and other famous pieces in French, Latin and Greek. That by J. Posthius begins with these lines: 'Claudius, the sweet, was preferred above the song of the swans, and [was] the Orpheus of our time.' Music and influence Goudimel is most famous for his four-part settings of the psalms of the Genevan Psalter, in the French versions of Cl√©ment Marot. In one of his four complete editions he puts - unlike other settings at the time - the melody in the topmost voice, the method which has prevailed in hymnody to the present day. In addition he composed masses, motets, and a considerable body of secular chansons, almost all of which date from before his conversion to Protestantism (probably around 1560). In 1554, he became the editor of a large collection of masses, motets and Magnificat of several composers, a collection printed by Nicolas Duchemin, and in which Goudimel appeared as the author of seven Latin and Catholic works. In the year following, Goudimel, still at Duchemin's, brought out a book of pieces for four voices of his composition on the Odes of Horace. However, he felt some contrition about setting work of the pagan poet, and in 1557 he wrote: \\"To Monsieur de La Blocti√®re, Mr. Claude Belot, Angevin, advocate in the court of Parliament of Paris, C. Goudimel, his good friend, wishes good health. Sir, ... [I] present to you this third book of Music of mine on the divine verses of the divine and royal Prophet. Also in no way could I choose the man, who seems to me to favor this little work of better heart than you, who alone amiably forced me to change, even quit, the profane lyre of the profane poet Horace, to memorize in hand and boldly undertake to touch and wield the sacred harp of our great David.\\" Goudimel's stay in Metz lasted several years. It was there that he addressed, in 1564, the dedication of his first complete psalter to \\"Mgr Roger de Bellegarde, ordinary gentleman of the king's room,\\" and, in 1565, that of the second psalter to \\"Mgr d'Auzances, knight of the Order and lieutenant general of the king.\\" On March 18, 1565, he was named godfather of a child at the reformed church of this city. in 1566, he published his seventh book of psalms in the form of motets. It was, therefore, after his departure from Paris that the celebrities Adrien le Roy and Robert Ballard published his masses in 1558; and it was also during his time in Metz that Goudimel began to concentrate all of his artistic ability in the various musical interpretations of the French translation of the psalms by Cl√©ment Marot and Th√©odore de B√®ze. He worked on the continuation of his large collection of motet-shaped psalms, and wrote almost simultaneously two different versions of the complete psalter, each containing one hundred and fifty psalms. Goudimel's style tends to be homophonic, with an intriguing use of syncopated rhythm and melisma and staggered voice entries to bring out inner parts, especially in the chansons. His Psalm settings, however, are more polyphonic, characteristic of the moderate contrapuntal style exemplified by the chansons of Jacques Arcadelt, an approximate contemporary. The widespread claim that he taught Palestrina is now regarded as untenable. His Opera Omnia extends to 14 volumes, though several of his works are fragmentary, missing one or more voices.

He was the first to expound the Copernican system in English but discarded the notion of a fixed shell of immoveable stars to postulate infinitely many stars at varying distances.. He was also first to postulate the \\"dark night sky paradox\\".Al-Khalili, Jim, Everything and Nothing ‚Äì 1. Everything, BBC Four, 9:00PM Mon, 21 March 2011 Life Thomas Digges, born about 1546, was the son of Leonard Digges (c. 1515 ‚Äì c. 1559), the mathematician and surveyor, and Bridget Wilford, the daughter of Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Hartridge in Cranbrook, Kent, by his first wife, Elizabeth Culpeper, the daughter of Walter Culpeper, esquire. Digges had two brothers, James and Daniel, and three sisters, Mary, who married a man with the surname of Barber; Anne, who married William Digges; and Sarah, whose first husband was surnamed Martin, and whose second husband was John Weston.; . After the death of his father, Digges grew up under the guardianship of John Dee,. a typical Renaissance natural philosopher. In 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Digges, with John Chamber and Henry Savile, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by Dee. Digges served as a member of parliament for Wallingford and also had a military career as a Muster-Master General to the English forces from 1586 to 1594 during the war with the Spanish Netherlands. Digges died on 24 August 1595. His last will, in which he specifically excluded both his brother, James Digges, and William Digges, was proved on 1 September. Digges was buried in the chancel of the church of St Mary Aldermanbury, London.. Marriage and issue Digges married Anne St Leger (1555‚Äì1636), daughter of Sir Warham St Leger and his first wife, Ursula Neville (d. 1575), the fifth daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his third wife, Mary Stafford.. In his will he named two surviving sons, Sir Dudley Digges (1583‚Äì1639), politician and statesman, and Leonard Digges (1588‚Äì1635), poet, and two surviving daughters, Margaret and Ursula. After Digges' death, his widow, Anne, married Thomas Russell of Alderminster in Warwickshire, \\"whom in 1616 William Shakespeare named as an overseer of his will\\".. Work Digges attempted to determine the parallax of the 1572 supernova observed by Tycho Brahe, and concluded it had to be beyond the orbit of the Moon. This contradicted Aristotle's view of the universe, according to which no change could take place among the fixed stars. In 1576, he published a new edition of his father's perpetual almanac, A Prognostication everlasting. The text written by Leonard Digges for the third edition of 1556 was left unchanged, but Thomas added new material in several appendices. The most important of these was A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved. Contrary to the Ptolemaic cosmology of the original book by his father, the appendix featured a detailed discussion of the controversial and still poorly known Copernican heliocentric model of the Universe. This was the first publication of that model in English, and a milestone in the popularisation of science. An illustration of the Copernican universe from Thomas Digges' book For the most part, the appendix was a loose translation into English of chapters from Copernicus' book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Thomas Digges went further than Copernicus, however, by proposing that the universe is infinite, containing infinitely many stars, and may have been the first person to do so. According to Harrison:Harrison (1987), p. 35, 37. An illustration of the Copernican universe can be seen at right.

The seat of a swing may be suspended from chains or ropes. Once a swing is in motion, it continues to oscillate like a pendulum until external interference or drag brings it to a halt. Swing sets are very popular with children. On playgrounds, several swings are often suspended from the same metal or wooden frame, known as a swing set, allowing more than one child to play at a time. Such swings come in a variety of sizes and shapes. For infants and toddlers, swings with leg holes support the child in an upright position while a parent or sibling pushes the child to get a swinging motion. Some swing sets include play items other than swings, such as a rope ladder or sliding pole. For older children, swings are sometimes made of a flexible canvas seat, of a rubberized ventilated tire tread, of plastic, or of wood. A common backyard sight is a wooden plank suspended on both sides by ropes from a tree branch. Types of swings Tire swing Canopy swing Tire swings are a form of swing made from a whole tire. These are often simply a new or used tire hanging from a tree on a rope. On commercially-developed playground swing sets, oversized new tires are often reinforced with a circular metal bar to improve safety and are hung on chains from metal or wooden beams. They may hang vertically or hang flat, suspended from three or more points on one side. The flat version can hold three or more children. Pumping is achieved by using one or two of the three chains attached to the swing, and two (or more) children can pump in turn.Tire swings - Information Tire swings can also be used in spinners, where the occupants use their feet to propel the tire. Natural swings may be created by lianas (creeper plants) in a subtropical wild forest like Aokigahara forest near Mount Fuji. Rope swings are swings created by tying one end of a length of rope to a tree branch, bridge, or other elevated structure. A knot or loop is usually put on the other end to prevent fraying and help the swinger stay on. Rope swings are often situated so that those swinging on them can let go and land in water deep enough to cushion the fall and to be swum around in. The incorporation of a shortboard such as a skateboard in which the rider stands is called swing boarding. It is made safer by the use of an attached board and a harness for the rider. Baby swings are swings with a bucket shape with holes for the child's legs, or a half-bucket shape and a safety belt, that is intended to reduce the likelihood of a very young child from falling out. are swinging, conventionally painted wood, bench-like seats intended primarily for adults. The swing's suspension chains are permanently mounted to the porch ceiling; and the seat is typically large enough to seat about three people, with an armrest at each end. Porch swings are an alternative to using rocking chairs or gliders outdoors. Canopy swings are similar to porch swings, but they are hung on a separate frame and are usually portable. The name is derived from a canopy installed as a sunshade. Hammock swings are portable (removable) bed-swings made of a lightweight material such as canvas, netting (or as little as two ropes), typically suspended between two trees or attached to a hammock stand. Tandem swings are swings designed for use by two people at the same time, facing each other or back-to-back, and are almost always part of a swing set due to the frame required to support the weights of the riders. The bench is perpendicular to its frame‚Äôs center crossbar. Face-to-face tandem benches include a subframe with integrated handles and foot pegs. Back-to-back tandems are typically in the baby bucket design, but with two pairs of leg holes, one on each side of the bench. Tandem swings are typically suspended from their frame (as in kiiking) by steel bars, although ropes and chains may be used for those used only by smaller children. Face-to-face tandem swings were featured in the playground of the Columbia Gardens. History Woman sitting on a swing.

In the Han dynasty swinging continued to rise in popularity and was often performed at the Qingming Festival and the Duanwu Festival. By the time of the Song dynasty, swinging became involved in professional acrobatics, where performers would swing between boats over water. =Europe= The earliest known representations of swings come from artifacts found in Greece. A terracotta sculpture of a woman sitting on a swing was found at Hagia Triada dated to the Late New Palace period (1450-1300 BC). In the 1700s, French artists depicted scenes of nobility swinging recreationally. Charles Wicksteed is thought to be the inventor of the modern day swing. In 2013, a prototype of his was unearthed near Wicksteed Park in the United Kingdom dating back to the early 1920s. In 1993, the sport Kiiking was invented in Estonia. Players attempt to rotate 360 degrees around a spindle, on a long swing consisting of a seat hung with steel bars. =North America= In the early 1900s, the playground movement saw swings installed in public spaces for neighborhood children. By the middle of the century, the suburban playground became popular. Many Americans put personal swing sets on their property. Public concern for children's safety influenced a change in design after the 1970s. Tubular metal sets were replaced with smaller swings of woods and resins better suited for children. The United States Patent and Trademark Office was disparaged in 2002 for issuing a patentUS Patent 6368227 : \\"Method of Swinging on a Swing\\". Filed November 7, 2000; granted April 9, 2002; canceled July 1, 2003. to a five-year-old boy who claimed to have invented swinging sideways as a new form of entertainment. His father, a patent lawyer who wanted to show his son how the patent system worked, had told the boy that he could file a patent application on anything that he invented. The patent was rescinded upon re-examination. Dangers Swings cause some injuries.Tinsworth D, McDonald J. Special Study: Injuries and Deaths Associated with Children‚Äôs Playground Equipment. Washington (DC): U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission; 2001. The most common injury is due to a fall, either by unintentionally letting go of the ropes or chains or by deliberately jumping out of the swing. Less commonly, the person using the swing will bump into or kick another person who is walking or be playing too near the swing or, especially with improperly located home equipment, will bump into a fence, wall, or another fixed object. Swings are also associated with strangulation or hanging injuries, usually because the child was wearing a piece of clothing or other item became entangled in the swing. Swings are the most common cause of injury-related to playground equipment at private homes, but a much less common cause of injury in public or school playgrounds, where injuries from climbing equipment dominate. Injuries from swings primarily affect school-age children, but preschool-age children also have a significant risk on swing sets at home.  Gallery  File:Woman swing Louvre F60.jpgWoman on a swing.

Chemical burns follow standard burn classification and may cause extensive tissue damage. The main types of irritant and/or corrosive products are: acids, bases, oxidizers / reducing agents, solvents, and alkylants. Additionally, chemical burns can be caused by some types of cytotoxic chemical weapons, e.g., vesicants such as mustard gas and Lewisite, or urticants such as phosgene oxime. Chemical burns may: * need no source of heat, * occur immediately on contact, * not be immediately evident or noticeable, * be extremely painful, * diffuse into tissue and damage cellular structures under skin without immediately apparent damage to skin surface. Presentation The exact symptoms of a chemical burn depend on the chemical involved. Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin, burning sensations, trouble breathing, coughing blood and/or tissue necrosis. Common sources of chemical burns include sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), lime (CaO), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Effects depend on the substance; hydrogen peroxide removes a bleached layer of skin, while nitric acid causes a characteristic color change to yellow in the skin, and silver nitrate produces noticeable black stains. Chemical burns may occur through direct contact on body surfaces, including skin and eyes, via inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Lipophilic substances that diffuse efficiently in human tissue, e.g., hydrofluoric acid, sulfur mustard, and dimethyl sulfate, may not react immediately, but instead produce the burns and inflammation hours after the contact. Chemical fabrication, mining, medicine, and related professional fields are examples of occupations where chemical burns may occur. Hydrofluoric acid leaches into the bloodstream, reacts with calcium and magnesium, and the resulting salts can cause cardiac arrest after eating through skin. Prevention In Belgium, the Conseil Sup√©rieur de la Sant√© gives a scientific advisory report on public health policy, the Superior Health Council of Belgium provides an overview of products that are authorized in Belgium for consumer use and that contain caustic substances, as well as of the risks linked to exposure to these products. This report aims at suggesting protection measures for the consumers, and formulates recommendations that apply to the different stages of the chain, which begins with the formulation of the product, followed by its regulation / marketing / application and post- application and ends with its monitoring.

These are generally not recommended for filtering out organic matter such as algae, since these types of contaminants can be extruded into spaghetti-like strings through the filter if enough pressure drop occurs across the filter surface. Typical screen materials include stainless steel (mesh), polypropylene, nylon and polyester. Use Self- cleaning screen filters incorporate an automatic backwash cycle to overcome these limitations. Backwash cycles are far more frequent when compared to a media filter with similar capacity, and each backwash requires far less water to perform. Their ability to quickly remove contaminants from water before they leach their nutrients make such filters popular choices for recirculating aquaculture systems. They have also become popular in closed loop industrial systems such as cooling tower, heat exchanger, and other equipment protection applications. Similar devices with larger openings designed only to keep out large objects are called strainers. Stainless-steel strainers are used in industrial, municipal, and irrigation applications, and can be designed for very high flow rates. When paired with a controller and flush valve, a strainer can be fully automated. Suspended particles collect on the inside of the screen, and the flush valve opens to expel the buildup. This eliminates the need for manual cleaning of the strainer element.

It serves the upper Georgia coast and areas well inland, and adjacent areas of far southern South Carolina. The station's signal is simulcast by GPB-owned WWIO-FM 88.9 in Brunswick, Georgia. Together, the two stations serve the entire Georgia coastline. Their signals can be heard from Beaufort, South Carolina to Fernandina Beach, Florida. The station group is an affiliate of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting radio network. WSVH is one of two member stations of the GPB Radio network to have local announcers and underwriting during the day. WSVH produces four radio programs for the GPB network: Celtic program The Green Island Radio Show with Harry O'Donoghue, folk show Music Americana with Russell Wells, \\"Classical Tonight\\", also hosted by Russell Wells, and the overnight classical block Coastal Nocturne. The station began broadcasting on April 20, 1981, with the first song played on the station at 6 a.m. being Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man. The station was independently operated until 1988 when it joined the statewide public radio network, then named \\"Peach State Public Radio\\". In the early 1990s, the listening area was greatly improved with the addition of WWIO in extreme southeast Georgia; an overnight classical music format was also added. In 1997, the station moved its studio from downtown Savannah to the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography on Skidaway Island, just south of Savannah. In August 2011, the WSVH/WWIO studios moved again to space at the Armstrong Center of Armstrong State University. The station airs mostly classical music, jazz and news from National Public Radio. This programming is in contrast to SCETV-owned WJWJ-FM 89.9, a Beaufort, South Carolina-based NPR station that is primarily news and talk-formatted. When the PBS Descriptive Video Service is not running, viewers on DirecTV hear the programming and hourly station IDs of WSVH/WWIO when listening to the second audio program (\\"Spanish\\" selected with green button) of GPB on the standard-definition feed. This is regardless of the location in the state, as it is a single feed for all media markets statewide. HD Programming WSVH is licensed by the FCC to broadcast in the HD Radio (hybrid) format. trailer on the Skidaway Marine Science Campus, Skidaway Island, Georgia, USA, from which WSVH operated until 2011.

It is known in North America as fireweed, in some parts of Canada as great willowherb,ROM Field Guide to Wildflowers of Ontario, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto:McClelland and Stewart Ltd., 2004. in Britain and Ireland as rosebay willowherb, and traditionally known as Saint Anthony's Laurel amongst other variants. Paghat's Garden - Epilobium angustifoliumLe Chemin de Saint Guilhem - Flora It is also known by the synonyms Chamerion angustifolium and Epilobium angustifolium. It is native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, including large parts of the boreal forests. Etymology The specific epithet angustifolium ('narrowleaved') is constructed from the Latin words angustus meaning 'narrow' and folium meaning 'leaved' or 'leaf'. It shares this name with other species of plant including Vaccinium angustifolium. The common British name, from the passing resemblance of the flowers to (wild) roses and the leaves to those of bay, goes back in print to Gerard's Herball of 1597.Oxford English Dictionary The common name 'fireweed' derives from the species' abundance as a coloniser on burnt sites after forest fires. Description Fireweed flower close-up The reddish stems of this herbaceous perennial are usually simple, erect, smooth, 0.5‚Äì2.5 m (1¬Ω‚Äì8 feet) high with scattered alternate leaves. The leaves are spirally arranged, entire, narrowly lanceolate, and pinnately veined, the secondary leaf veins anastomosing, joining together to form a continuous marginal vein just inside the leaf margins. The inflorescence is a symmetrical terminal raceme that blooms progressively from bottom to top, producing a gracefully tapered shape. The flowers are 2 to 3 cm in diameter, slightly asymmetrical, with four magenta to pink petals and four narrower pink sepals behind. The protruding style has four stigmas. The floral formula is ‚ú∂/‚Üì K4 C4 A4+4 or 4+0 ƒû(4). The upright, reddish-brown linear seed capsule splits from the apex and curls open. It bears many minute brown seeds, about 300 to 400 per capsule and 80,000 per plant. The seeds have silky hairs to aid wind dispersal and are very easily spread by the wind, often becoming a weed and a dominant species on disturbed ground. Once established, the plants also spread extensively by underground roots, an individual plant eventually forming a large patch. This species has been placed in the genus Chamaenerion (sometimes given as Chamerion) rather than Epilobium based on several morphological distinctions: spiral (rather than opposite or whorled) leaf arrangement; absence (rather than presence) of a hypanthium; subequal stamens (rather than stamens in two unequal whorls); zygomorphic (rather than actinomorphic) stamens and stigma. Under this taxonomic arrangement, Chamaenerion and Epilobium are monophyletic sister genera. Two subspecies are recognized as valid: * Chamaenerion angustifolium subsp. angustifolium * Chamaenerion angustifolium subsp. circumvagum (Mosquin) Hoch Ecology Capsule & seed stage On granite White-tailed bumblebee on a flower C. angustifolium thrives in areas cleared by fire. It is here seen dominating the forest floor about one year after the 2019 Swan Lake Fire. Fireweed is often abundant in wet calcareous to slightly acidic soils in open fields, pastures, and particularly burned-over lands. It is a pioneer species that quickly colonizes open areas with little competition, such as the sites of forest fires and forest clearings. Plants grow and flower as long as there is open space and plenty of light. Fireweed reaches its average peak colonization after five years and then begins to be replaced as trees and brush grow larger. Seeds remain viable in the soil seed bank for many years. When a new fire or other disturbance occurs that opens up the ground to light again, the seeds germinate. Some areas with heavy seed counts in the soil can, after burning, be covered with pure dense stands of this species and when in flower the landscape is turned into fields of color. Fireweed is an effective colonizer; it may not be present until after a fire has moved through a landscape. Because of its very high dispersal capacity, \\"propagule pressure\\" from its regional presence will let it quickly colonize a disturbed area. Once seedlings are established, the plant quickly reproduces and covers the disturbed area via seeds and rhizomes. It is somewhat adapted to fire as well and so can prevent the reintroduction of fire to the landscape. Fireweed is well adapted to seed in severely burned areas as well, because the mineral soil that is exposed due to the removal of organic soil layers provides a good seedbed. In Britain the plant was considered a rare species in the 18th century,Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, and one confined to a few locations with damp, gravelly soils. It was misidentified as great hairy willowherb in contemporary floras. The plant's rise from local rarity to widespread abundance seems to have occurred at the same time as the expansion of the railway network and the associated soil disturbance. The plant became locally known as bombweed due to its rapid colonization of bomb craters in the second world war. Bears and elk are known to favor the plant as food. =Pollination= The flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects (the generalised pollination syndrome). Some species in the insect order lepidoptera frequently use the willowherb as their primary larval host-plant, examples including the elephant hawk moth (Deilephila elpenor), bedstraw hawk moth (Hyles gallii), and the white-lined sphinx moth (Hyles lineata).The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Land management Because of its rapid establishment on disturbed land, fireweed can be used for land management purposes. Events such as logging, fires and mass wasting can leave the land barren and without vegetation. This causes the land to be more susceptible to erosion because of the lack of root structure in the soil. Fireweed is a useful tool that can be utilized after prescribed fires and logging events because of its fire resistance and ability to recycle the nutrients left in the soil after a fire. It is also able to quickly establish a root system for reproduction and through this can prevent mass wasting and erosion events from occurring on burned or logged hillsides. Reestablishment of vegetation is crucial in the recovery time of disturbed lands. In many cases, fireweed establishes itself on these disturbed lands, but implementing the introduction of fireweed to a disturbed area as a management practice could prove useful in speeding up the recovery of disturbed lands. Disturbed and burned over lands are generally unpleasant to look at and pose a risk to habitats and nearby communities because of their susceptibility to mass wasting events. Fireweed can quickly establish itself across the landscape and prevent further damage, while providing a blanket of vegetation for recovering fauna to create new habitats in and for pollinators to foster the re-establishment of a diverse set of flora. Uses Leaves used as fermented tea The very young shoots and leaves can be cooked and eaten. Traditionally the young shoots are collected in the spring by Native American and Siberian people and mixed with other greens. As the plant matures, the leaves become tough and somewhat bitter. The southeast Native Americans use the stems in this stage. They are peeled and eaten raw. When properly prepared soon after picking they are a good source of vitamin C and pro-vitamin A. The Dena'ina add fireweed to their dogs' food. Fireweed is also a medicine of the Upper Inlet Dena'ina, who treat pus-filled boils or cuts by placing a piece of the raw stem on the afflicted area. This is said to draw the pus out of the cut or boil and prevents a cut with pus in it from healing over too quickly. The root can be roasted after scraping off the outside, but often tastes bitter. To mitigate this, the root is collected before the plant flowers and the brown thread in the middle removed. The stem centers can also be prepared by splitting the outer stalk, and eaten raw. In Russia, fireweed is made into a tea known as Ivan Chai. They use it as highly prized medicinal herb too. In the Yukon, the flowers from fireweed are made into jelly. Fireweed's natural variation in ploidy has prompted its use in scientific studies of polyploidy's possible effects on adaptive potential and species diversification. Because fireweed can colonize disturbed sites, even following an old oil spill, it is often used to reestablish vegetation. It is also grown as an ornamental plant. A white form, C. angustolium 'Album' is listed by the Royal Horticultural Society. Depictions in human culture The Flag of Yukon features fireweed. Fireweed is the floral emblem of Yukon. In The Fellowship of the Ring, J.R.R. Tolkien lists fireweed as one of the flowering plants returning to the site of a bonfire inside the Old Forest. As the first plant to colonise waste ground, fireweed is often mentioned in postwar British literature. The children's novel Fireweed is set during the Blitz and features two runaway teenagers who meet on bomb sites where fireweed is growing profusely. Another children's novel, A Reflection of Rachel features a protagonist attempting to restore an old garden that used \\"Rose Pink Willow Herb\\" as an ornamental plant and mentions its notoriety for growing on abandoned bomb sites. Cicely Mary Barker's 1948 book Flower Fairies of the Wayside included an illustration of 'The Rose-Bay Willow-Herb Fairy', with the accompanying verse \\"On the breeze my fluff is blown; So my airy seeds are sown. Where the earth is burnt and sad, I will come to make it glad. All forlorn and ruined places, All neglected empty spaces, I can cover‚Äîonly think!‚Äî With a mass of rosy pink.\\" Rosebay Willowherb was subsequently voted the county flower of London in 2002 following a poll by the wild plant conservation charity Plantlife.County Flowers page ReferencesExternal links *USDA Plants profile for Chamerion angustifolium (fireweed) *Calflora Database: Chamerion angustifolium (fireweed) *Jepson Manual eFlora treatment of Chamerion angustifolium Washington Flora Checklist *NCBI: Chamerion angustifolium Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L.

This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles, and low for light and fine particles. Hydrocyclones also find application in the separation of liquids of different densities. A different description: A hydrocyclone is a mechanical device designed to reduce or increase the concentration of a dispersed phase, solid, liquid or gas of different density, by means of centripetal forces or centrifugal forces within a vortex.The Hydrocyclone: Dr Derek Alan Colman, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Southampton, England The mixture is injected into the hydrocyclone in such a way as to create the vortex and, depending upon the relative densities of the two phases, the centrifugal acceleration will cause the dispersed phase to move away from or towards the central core of the vortex. A hydrocyclone will normally have a cylindrical section at the top where liquid is being fed tangentially, and a conical base. The angle, and hence length of the conical section, plays a role in determining operating characteristics.  Design  A hydrocyclone is a classifier that has two exits on the axis: one on the bottom (underflow or reject) and one at the top (overflow or accept). The underflow is generally the denser or coarser fraction, while the overflow is the lighter or finer fraction. It has no moving parts and its operation depends on two major parameters: * The characteristics of the feed stream. * The geometry of the cyclone. The characteristics of the feed stream include size distribution of solids in the feed stream, pulp density (percent solids in the slurry), pulp viscosity and the inlet pressure for solid/liquid separation. In liquid/liquid feed streams, for example in oily water, the main feed characteristics are based on oil droplet size and distribution, oil density, water density, oil concentration, viscosity and temperature. The geometry of the cyclone involves-inlet shape and area, cyclone dimensions (cone angle, length of cylindrical section and total length of the cyclone) and inlet, vortex and apex diameters. Internally, inertia is countered by the resistance of the liquid, with the effect that larger or denser particles are transported to the wall for eventual exit at the underflow side with a limited amount of liquid, while the finer, or less dense particles, remain in the liquid and exit at the overflow side through a tube extending slightly into the body of the cyclone at the center.Hydrocyclone behaviour Forward hydrocyclones remove particles that are denser than the surrounding fluid, while reverse hydrocyclones remove particles that are less dense than the surrounding fluid. In a reverse hydrocyclone the overflow is at the apex and the underflow at the base. There are also parallel-flow hydrocyclones where both the accept and reject are removed at the apex. Parallel-flow hydrocyclones remove particles that are lighter than the surrounding fluid.Separation principle Hydrocyclones can be made of metal (mostly steel), ceramic or plastic (such as polyurethane, polypropylene, or other types). Metal or ceramic hydrocyclones are used for situations requiring more strength, or durability in terms of heat or pressure. When there is an occurrence of much abrasion (such as occurs with sand particles) polyurethane performs better than metals or ceramics. Metal lined with polyurethane is used in cases of combined abrasion and high pressure. In a suspension of particles with the same density, a relatively sharp cut can be made. The size at which the particles separate is a function of cyclone diameter, exit dimensions, feed pressure and the relative characteristics of the particles and the liquid. Efficiency of separation is a function of the solids' concentration: the higher the concentration, the lower the efficiency of separation. There is also a significant difference in suspension density between the base exit (fines) and the apex exit, where there is little liquid flow. If the size range of the particles is limited, but there are differences in density between types of particles, the denser particles will exit preferentially at the apex. The device is therefore a means of selective concentration of, for example, minerals. This device is also related to the centrifuge; both of them are intended to separate heavies and lights in liquid by application of centrifugal force. Centrifuges generate the separation force by rotation of the entire equipment; hydrocyclones utilise centrifugal forces from the movement of the fluids to achieve separation. = Design equations = For a Bradley hydrocyclone, the dimensions of each part are always in the same proportions. The pressure drop should be between 20 psi and 60 psi. * Di is the inlet diameter * Do is the overflow diameter * Du is the underflow diameter * Dc is the chamber diameter * L is the height of the hydrocyclone * l is the height of the cylinder part of hydrocyclone * ‚Ñì is the height of the vortex tube of hydrocyclone * Le is the length of the outlet tube * Theta is the angle at the base of the hydrocyclone * Di/Dc = 1/90 * Do/Dc = 1/5 * Du/Dc = - * L/Dc = - * l/Dc = 1/2 * ‚Ñì/Dc = 1/3 * Theta = 9 degrees  Uses  A hydrocyclone is most often used to separate \\"heavies\\" from a liquid mixture originating at a centrifugal pump or some other continuous source of pressurized liquid, or two-phase (gas- liquid) systems. A hydrocyclone is most likely to be the right choice for processes where \\"lights\\" are the greater part of the mixture and where the \\"heavies\\" settle fairly easily. Generally, hydrocyclones are used in continuous flow systems so that the instantaneous liquid inflow to the hydrocyclone is equal to the total instantaneous outflow of \\"lights\\" plus \\"heavies\\". In cases where \\"heavies\\" are a very small part of the whole liquid, it is sometimes advantageous to accumulate them in the bottom of the hydrocyclone for batchwise removal. Applications include: * In the potato, cassava, wheat and corn starch industry for both concentration and washing of the crude starch milk. Hydrocyclone replace separators as a more price efficient separation technique. * In pulp and paper mills to remove sand, staples, plastic particles and other contaminants. * In the drilling industry to separate sand from the expensive clay that is used for lubrication during the drilling. * In oil industry to separate oil from water or vice versa. * In metal working to separate metal particles from cooling liquid. * In French fries and potato chips plants for in-line starch recovery from cutting water and from waste water. * In mineral processing, hydrocyclones are used extensively both to classify particles for recirculation in grinding circuits and to differentiate between the economic mineral and gangue. * To remove sand and silt particles from irrigation water for drip irrigation purposes.

Ledum latifolium, an earlier name for Rhododendron groenlandicum Labrador tea is a common name for the three closely related plant species and the name of an herbal tea made from the plants: All three species are primarily wetland plants in the heath family. The herbal tea has been a favorite beverage among Athabaskan, First Nations, and Inuit people. Description about the plant All three species used to make Labrador tea are low, slow-growing shrubs with evergreen leaves: * Rhododendron tomentosum (northern Labrador tea, previously Ledum palustre), * Rhododendron groenlandicum, (bog Labrador tea, previously Ledum groenlandicum or Ledum latifolium) and * Rhododendron neoglandulosum, (western Labrador tea, or trapper's tea, previously Ledum glandulosum or Ledum columbianum). The leaves are smooth on top with often wrinkled edges, and fuzzy white to red-brown underneath. R. tomentosum, R. groenlandicum, and R. neoglandulosum can be found in wetlands and peat bogs. Uses The Athabaskans and other indigenous peoples brew the leaves as a beverage. The Pomo, Kashaya, Tolowa and Yurok of Northern California boil the leaves of Western Labrador Tea similarly, to make a medicinal herbal tea, to help with coughs and colds.Native American Ethnobotany Database for Ledum glandulosum Botanical extracts from the leaves have been used to create natural skin care products by companies in Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. Others use Labrador tea to spice meat by boiling the leaves and branches in water and then soaking the meat in the decoction. During the eighteenth century, German brewers used R. tomentosum while brewing beer to make it more intoxicating, but it became forbidden because it led to increased aggression. Toxicology There is no sufficient data that demonstrates Labrador tea is safe to consume as toxicity varies across species and localities. Excessive consumption is not recommended due to diuresis, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. Large doses can lead to cramps, convulsions, paralysis, and, in rare cases, death. Toxicity occurs due to terpenoid ledol found in all Labrador tea species. R. groenlandicum has the lowest toxicity due to lower levels of ledol. Grayanotoxins are also present, but few lethal human cases of poisoning due to grayanotoxins in Labrador tea have been documented. However, lethal poisonings have been documented in livestock.

It is widespread across Canada and the northern United States, as well as in eastern Asia (Russia, China, Korea, Japan). Ribes triste grows in wet rocky woods, swamps, and cliffs. It grows to tall, with a lax, often creeping branches. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed with five lobes, in diameter. The flowers are in pendulous racemes, long. The axis of the raceme is glandular. Each raceme bears 6-13 small, purplish flowers that appear in June and July. The fruit is a bright red berry, without the hairs that some currants have. The fruit is edible but rather sour. Conservation status in the United States It is listed as endangered in Connecticut (Note: This list is newer than the one used by plants.usda.gov and is more up-to-date.) and Ohio, and as threatened in Pennsylvania. As a weed Ribes is listed a plant pest in Michigan and the planting of it in certain parts of the state is prohibited. Native American ethnobotany=As cuisine= Alaska Natives use the fruit as food, eating it raw, and making the berries into jam and jellies. Eskimos eat the berries and the Inupiat eat them raw or cooked, mix them with other berries which are used to make a traditional dessert. They also mix the berries with rosehips and highbush cranberries and boil them into a syrup. The Iroquois mash the fruit, make them into small cakes, and store them for future use. They later soak the fruit cakes in warm water and cooked them a sauce or mixed them with corn bread. They also sun dry or fire dry the raw or cooked fruit for future use and take the dried fruit with them as a hunting food. The Ojibwe eat the berries raw, and also preserve them by cooking them, spreading them on birch bark into little cakes, which are dried and stored for winter use. In the winter, they often eat the berries with cooked with sweet corn. They also use the berries to make jams and preserves. The Upper Tanana eat the berries as food. =Medicinal use= The Ojibwe take a decoction of the root and stalk for 'gravel', and take a compound decoction of the stalk for 'stoppage of periods', and use them leaves as a 'female remedy'. The Upper Tanana use a decoction of the stems, without the bark, as a wash for sore eyes.

Walthall, and Polly Moran. The film was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was based on the scenario \\"The Hypnotist\\", also written by Browning. The last copy of the film known to exist was destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire, along with hundreds of other rare early films.The Vampire in Folklore, History, Literature, Film and Television: A Comprehensive Bibliography p. 148 In 2002, Turner Classic Movies aired a reconstructed version, produced by Rick Schmidlin, who used the original script and film stills to recreate the film's original plot. Plot In a cultured and peaceful home on the outskirts of London, the head of the household, Sir Roger Balfour, is found dead from what is initially believed to be a self-inflicted bullet wound. Despite the insistence of Balfour's neighbor, Sir James Hamlin, that his close friend would never have taken his own life, Balfour's death is officially declared a suicide by \\"Professor\\" Edward C. Burke, a Scotland Yard inspector and amateur hypnotist. Five years later, new tenants move into the Balfour home, but are frightened away by a sinister-looking man with pointed teeth wearing a beaver hat, and a cadaverous-looking woman in a long gown. Their arrival prompts Hamlin to call Scotland Yard. Inspector Burke returns and stays at Hamlin's home, where he discovers that Hamlin and the others there (Balfour's daughter, Lucille; his butler, Williams; and Hamlin's nephew, Arthur Hibbs) had been the only other persons in the Balfour home when he died. Burke remains skeptical that Balfour's death was a murder until the body disappears from the tomb and Balfour is seen walking through the home. This and other eerie events lead Burke to reproduce the crime scene and use hypnosis to induce the culprit into re-enacting the murder, successfully identifying Balfour's killer. Cast * Lon Chaney as Professor (or Inspector) Edward C. Burke / The Man in the Beaver Hat * Marceline Day as Lucille Balfour * Claude King as Roger Balfour / The Stranger * Polly Moran as Miss Smithson, the New Maid * Conrad Nagel as Arthur Hibbs * Edna Tichenor as Luna, a Bat Girl * Henry B. Walthall as Sir James Hamlin * Percy Williams as Williams, Balfour's butler * Andy MacLennan as Bat Girl's Assistant Production notes Lon Chaney's makeup for the film included sharpened teeth and the hypnotic eye effect, achieved with special wire fittings which he wore like monocles. Based on surviving accounts, he purposefully gave the \\"vampire\\" character an absurd quality, because it was the film's Scotland Yard detective character, also played by Chaney, in a disguise. Surviving stills show this was the only time Chaney used his famous makeup case as an on-screen prop. The story was an original work by Tod Browning, with Waldemar Young, who had previously worked with Browning on The Unholy Three and The Unknown, as the scenario writer. Young was previously employed as a journalist in San Francisco, during which time he covered several famous murder investigations, a distinction which saw him lauded as knowing \\"mystery from actual experience.\\" In the film, Chaney in the role of Burke, adopts different disguises, but the film \\"even lets the audience into the secrets of his makeup, when, as the detective, he applies a disguise before the eyes of the audience.\\" To add an eerie authenticity to both Chaney's character and the atmosphere within the household used as the location of the movie, the purchasing agent ordered 100 bats to be used within the household as the storyline progresses. Lon Chaney, bat pose, in London After Midnight When London After Midnight premiered at the Miller Theater in Missouri, set musicians Sam Feinburg and Jack Feinburg had to prepare melodies to go with the film's supernatural elements. The musicians used Ase's Todd and Eritoken by Greig, Dramatic Andante by Rappe, the Fire Music from Wagner's The Valkyrie along with other unlisted aspects of Savino, Zimonek and Puccini. Reception The film grossed $1,004,000 at the box office domestically against a production budget of $151,666.14, becoming the most successful collaborative film between Chaney and Browning, and the tenth highest-grossing film of 1927. However, contemporary accounts by filmgoers and critics suggest it was not one of Chaney and Browning's strongest films. The storyline, called \\"somewhat incoherent\\" by The New York Times and \\"nonsensical\\" by Harrison's Reports, was a common point of criticism. Nonetheless, the commercial success of London After Midnight saw Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer renew Tod Browning's directorial contract. Lon Chaney as the \\"Man in the Beaver Hat\\" in London After Midnight A positive review ran in Film Daily, calling it \\"a story certain to disturb the nervous system of the more sensitive picture patrons. If they don't get the creeps from flashes of grimy bats swooping around, cobweb-bedecked mystery chambers and the grotesque inhabitants of the haunted house, then they've passed the third degree.\\" The Warren Tribune noted that Lon Chaney is \\"present in nearly every scene, in a dual role that tests his skill to no small degree.\\" The review highlighted that this subdues Chaney's prominence and allows the plot to be better communicated, but it also causes the film to \\"not rank among his best productions.\\" A review by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle noted: \\"It is pleasant to report also that there is none of the usual stupid comedy relief in London After Midnight to mar its sinister and creepy scheme. That ought to make it the outstanding mystery film of the year.\\" It however found fault in Tod Browning's direction because the film's atmosphere did not recapture \\"the intensely weird effect\\" found in The Cat and the Canary. Cinema lobby card Variety wrote that \\"Young, Browning and Chaney have made a good combination in the past but the story on which this production is based is not of the quality that results in broken house records, adding that, since Burke was \\"a detached character, mechanical and wooden\\", he failed to meaningfully connect with the audience. Lon Chaney showing a makeup case used in London After Midnight The New Yorker also wrote that the \\"directing, acting and settings are all well up to the idea,\\" but \\"it strives too hard to create effect. Mr. Browning can create pictorial terrors and Lon Chaney can get himself up in a completely repulsive manner, but both their efforts are wasted when the story makes no sense.\\" Remake Tod Browning remade the film as a sound film in 1935. This film, called Mark of the Vampire, starred Lionel Barrymore and Bela Lugosi in the roles Lon Chaney had performed in London After Midnight. Reconstruction In 2002, Turner Classic Movies commissioned restoration producer Rick Schmidlin to produce a 45-minute reconstruction of the film, using still photographs. The following year, the reconstructed version was released as a part of The Lon Chaney Collection DVD set released by the TCM Archives. A novelization of the film was written and published in 1928 by Marie Coolidge-Rask. In 1985, Philip J. Riley published a reconstruction of the film's plot. In 2016, Thomas Mann published the book, London After Midnight: A New Reconstruction Based on Contemporary Sources, upon the discovery of a previously-unknown 11,000-word Boy's Cinema magazine published in 1928. A second edition was published in 2018 upon the discovery of an alternative French novelization for the film. Theatrical poster In 2014, the only contemporary poster known to exist for the film was sold in Dallas, Texas, to an anonymous bidder for $478,000, making it the most valuable movie poster ever sold at public auction. This bidder was later revealed to be Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett. The poster is in his displayed collection at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.https://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/exhibitions/its-alive- classic-horror-and-sci-fi-art-from-the-kirk-hammett-0 (The 1932 film The Mummy held the previous record for a poster's sale at public auction, selling for more than $453,000 in 1997.) In popular culture Jennifer Kent has stated that images of Lon Chaney's character from London After Midnight inspired the look of the titular character in The Babadook.# In 2012, Episodes 5 and 6 of Whitechapel (TV series) featured a killer obsessed with London After Midnight who owned a surviving copy of the film.

The laughingthrushes are a large family of Old World passerine birds characterised by soft fluffy plumage. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in southeast Asia. Ashy-headed Laughing Thrush in Sinharaja Rain Forest Taxonomy The ashy-headed laughingthrush was formerly placed in the genus Garrulax but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus Argya. Description The ashy-headed laughingthrush is a rangy bird, 23 centimetre (9 in) in length with a long floppy tail. It is rufous brown above and deep buff below, with a grey head and white throat. Like other babblers, these are noisy birds, and the characteristic laughing calls are often the best indication that they are present, since they are often difficult to see in their preferred habitat. Distribution and habitat The ashy-headed laughingthrush is a resident breeding bird endemic to Sri Lanka. Its habitat is rainforest, and it is seldom seen away from deep jungle or dense bamboo thickets in the wet zone. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. Although its habitat is under threat, this laughingthrush occurs in all the forests of the wet zone, and is quite common at prime sites like Kitulgala and Sinharaja. It builds its nest in a bush, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is three or four eggs. Behaviour As with other babbler species, ashy-headed laughingthrushes frequently occur in groups of up to a dozen, and are also often found in the mixed feeding flocks typical of tropical Asian jungle. They feed mainly on insects, but also eat jungle berries. In culture In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as alu demalichcha (\\"ash-babbler\\") in Sinhala language. The ashy-headed laughingthrush appears in a 3 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp,.http://www.birdtheme.org/country/srilanka.html References * Birds of India by Grimmett, Inskipp and Inskipp, * A Field Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent by Kazmierczak (au) and van Perlo (il), ashy- headed laughingthrush Endemic birds of Sri Lanka ashy-headed laughingthrush ","title":"Ashy-headed laughingthrush"},{"id":"628125","text":"Africa * Egypt Monarch - Fuad I, King of Egypt (1917-1936)Egypt only became independent in 1922.

Like other members of the large Old World babbler family they are passerine birds characterised by soft fluffy plumage. Foraging in small groups that skulk inside bushes there are three subspecies within the Indian Subcontinent. The nominate hyperythra found in northern and eastern India is uniformly brown underneath while albogularis of the western Indian peninsula is white throated. The population in Sri Lanka, phillipsi, is also white throated but is paler underneath and has a larger bill. Description D. h. albogularis with whitish throat from western peninsular India D. h. phillipsi of Sri Lanka The tawny-bellied babbler is a small babbler at 13 cm including its long round-tipped tail. The outer tail feathers are about half the length of the central tail feather. It is dark brown above and orange-buff below, with a rufous grey crown. The feathers on the forehead are stiff and the tail has cross rays and is otherwise olive brown. The throat is white in adults of the populations of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan population however has a larger and heavier beak and paler underparts. The population in Mt. Abu is white throated and chestnut feathers on the crown (appearing capped, as opposed to the chestnut being only on the forehead) with pale shafts. It has been proposed as a subspecies abuensis but is more often included in albogularis. Another variant form first described from Khandala Ghats as navarroi is also usually included within the range of albogularis.  Taxonomy and systematics  The species was first described by James Franklin in 1831, placed in the genus Timalia. The genus Dumetia was established by Blyth in 1852 who saw differences between it and other genera. The genus characters were in the distribution of the stiff feathers on the forehead and the shape of the bill. Modern classifications based on DNA sequences note that the species is a sister of Rhopocichla and Timalia pileata. It is part of the subfamily Timaliinae. Distribution and habitat The babbler is found from north-central India to Sri Lanka. The populations in India are all intergrading and no disjunct distributions exist. Its natural habitat is scrub and tall grassland. In Sri Lanka it is found in the hills up to about 1500 m above sea level. Behaviour The babbler builds its nest in a low bush, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The nest is a ball of long woven leaves of bamboo or grasses. They breed from May to September mostly during the rains. The normal clutch is three or four eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs. In Sri Lanka they are thought to raise more than one brood. Like most babblers, it is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. A prenuptial moult takes places in January-February in the southern population. It feeds mainly on insects but also takes nectar from flowers of Bombax and Erythrina. They produce cheeping, twittering or harsh chattering notes while foraging in bushes. The name Pandi Jitta, literally \\"pig bird\\" in Telugu, refers to its habit of foraging under dense shrubbery in the manner of pigs. Banded bay cuckoos have been known to lay their eggs in the nests of tawny-bellied babblers. Unidentified haematozoa placed in the genus Leucocytozoon have been recorded from the blood of the species. A specimen that died in captivity was found to have microfilariae in addition to haematozoa.

The island is administered as the town of Yonaguni, Yaeyama Gun, Okinawa, and there are three settlements: Sonai, Kubura, and Higawa. History Early human migration from Taiwan to Yonaguni island has long been the subject of scholarly debate. In 2019, a team of Japanese and Taiwanese researchers succeeded in completing the two-day journey from Cape Wushibi in Taitung County to Yonaguni island along the Kuroshio current in a dugout canoe based on technology and materials from 30,000 years ago. Otherwise, the early history of Yonaguni remains vague. The first written record that ever mentions the island is a 1477 Korean document (Chosen Hy≈çry≈´min no Yaeyama kenbunroku), an account of several fishermen from the current Jeju Province who drifted there. A legendary female leader, San‚Äôai Isoba, is said to have been the ruler of Yonaguni at around the end of the fifteenth century. She is described as a female who possessed superhuman powers that allowed her to protect her people from foreign attacks multiple times, including when the island was attacked by Miyako, another Yaeyama island nearby. Rituals are still held once a year to worship this mythical figure. In the 15th century, the island was incorporated into the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom.Kerr, George H. (2000). Okinawa: the History of an Island People. (revised ed.) Boston: Tuttle Publishing. By 1879, the island was formally annexed by imperial Japan. Until the early 20th century, Yonaguni was part of the larger Yaeyama Magiri (village after 1907), which included the neighboring Yaeyama Islands. In 1948, it became an independent village. From 1945 to 1972, it was occupied by the United States and was then returned to Japan to form a part of Okinawa Prefecture. On 4 May 1998, a part of the island was destroyed by a submarine earthquake. NEC J/TPS-102 radar similar to that which will be operated by the mobile aircraft control & warning squadron As a result of increased tensions between Japan, China, and Taiwan over the disputed sovereignty of the Japanese-controlled uninhabited Senkaku/Diaoyu/Tiaoyutai Islands which are located roughly 80 nautical miles north-northeast of Yonaguni Island, Japan began construction in 2014 of a coastal monitoring/early warning station with radar and other sensors on Yonaguni to counter a perceived threat from Chinese forces.\\"Japan wary of China military threat.\\" Al Jazeera, 17 December 2010. The initial planned complement of 150 troops include personnel stationed at a physically separate garrison camp located on the outskirts of Yonaguni town. The station's radar became active on 28 March 2016. Separately, a joint (GSDF/ASDF) \\"mobile aircraft control & warning squadron\\" is planned to be formed and co-located at the station. Mythical and cultural references As the westernmost inhabited island of Japan, Yonaguni has also been constantly associated with the myth of the island of women (Ny≈çgo no Shima) since the Edo period. As suggested by the name, the island of women is an island where there are only women born and living to support each other. Being a trope frequently used in Edo literary works, it not only appears at the end of The Life of an Amorous Man (Â•ΩËâ≤‰∏Ä‰ª£Áî∑ K≈çshoku Ichidai Otoko, 1682), but also dominates the second part of the five- section Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon (Ê§øË™¨ÂºìÂºµÊúà Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki, 1807‚Äì1811). While the whole second part of the story is about the protagonist Tametomo's time spent on the island of women, which is the westernmost island of Japan according to the tale, the map provided at the beginning of the third section clearly marks the island as 'Yonaguni', assuming the association between the mythical women island and Yonaguni. During the Taisho period, the Yaeyama islands including Yonaguni gradually came to be explored by people traveling from Japan, as there were ships from Osaka to Yonaguni once a year that introduced outsiders to the islands, who brought their knowledge about Yonaguni back to Japan through many ways, such as writing. Out of all these early records about Yonaguni, one of the earliest and most influential writings was An expedition to the Southern Islands (Nant≈ç tanken) by Sasamori Gisuke. In Sasamori's research of Yonaguni, the island was notable due to its women: \\"Women on the island have white skin, and are attentive and thoughtful. It takes only a few pennies for someone who enjoys accompaniment of beautiful women to have one of them in attendance during his stay provide drinks and serve him all night.\\" The statement was confirmed by a later published collection of essays. A folk culture scholar, Motoyama Keisen, asserts that \\"Yonaguni is the island of women\\", and continues to quote and agree with Sasamori's account of Yonaguni women, saying that \\"Surely this was true in 1893, when the author went on his expedition there.\\" However, a counter- statement is found in a collection of some comical essays by a Taish≈ç novelist and script writer, Murakami Namiroku, in his Collection of Satire Essays (Hiniku Bunshu), and gives a more detailed view of the circumstances of Yonaguni women. One of the essays is titled \\"Yonaguni\\" and focuses on the same topic, claiming that \\"once a man steps on the island, no matter how strong he is, the man would be attacked by women coming from all directions, and hardly ever there could be men who could safely withdraw from there\\". Furthermore, he describes Yonaguni as an island where, although there are almost only women, for reproductive purposes, there are also a few men: as many as around one- tenth of the women. Curiously, there are only female newborns. Serving as reproductive tools for the women, men are rarely able to live long. Murakami expresses his worries as well at the end, as the women here are all naturally beautiful and potentially they would attract those driven by sexual desire to explore \\"the hidden paradise\\". Nevertheless, these introductory essays aiming to bring an exotic taste are less specific than a quite comprehensive travel log by Yanagita Kunio, who was inspired by Sasamori's work and finally did his own research, An Account of the South Sea (Kainan sh≈çki), published in 1925. A long essay from the collection is titled and devoted to \\"Yonaguni Women\\". He provides a detailed written record of their customs and daily life, and writes about how they are busy farming, cooking, and taking care of the kids, with two photographs attached, wearing clothes not so much different from the rest of Japan. Yonaguni islanders traditionally believed that their island had once been ruled by a goddess named Miruku, who brought fertility to the land. She was ousted by a god named Saku after a flower-growing contest for control over the island, in which Saku stole her flower while she slept. Miruku vanished, and the island's primeval prosperity sank into poverty once she left. The islanders thus held rituals in honor of the goddess in the hope that she might one day return. As late as the 1980s, the highlight of the Yonaguni harvest festival was a procession involving a person in a Miruku mask reenacting the goddess. A nearly identical myth is widespread in Korea. Geography Yonaguni from space, April 2014 Map including Yonaguni (labeled as YONAGUNI- SHIMA) from the International Map of the World (1954) The island has an area of , a population around 1,700, an annual mean air temperature of , and annual precipitation of . Yonaguni, more specifically Cape Irizaki at the western tip of the island, is the westernmost point of Japan. The island is situated in the middle of the Yonaguni Depression, a relatively deep gap in the Ryukyu arc, where the warm Kuroshio Current enters the East China Sea from the Pacific Ocean. According to Japanese anthropologist Yousuke Kaifu, the island of Yonaguni can be seen with the naked eye from Taroko Mountain in Taiwan under good weather conditions. Notable features Yonaguni is known in Japan for the hanazake, a 120-proof rice-based distilled beverage (awamori) produced only on the island. The island is also the only natural habitat of a distinctive horse breed, the Yonaguni horse. Yonaguni's densely forested areas provide a suitable habitat for the Ryukyu atlas moth (A. a. ryukyuensis). Yonaguni is a popular attraction for divers because of the large numbers of hammerhead sharks that gather in the surrounding waters during winter.

The institution was born as Escuela de Artes y Oficios (Spanish: School of Arts and Crafts) in 1849 by Ignacy Domeyko, under the government of Manuel Bulnes. It became Universidad T√©cnica del Estado (Spanish: Technical University of the State) in 1947, with various campuses throughout the country. In 1981, as a consequence of a reform on higher education under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, it became what is now known as Universidad de Santiago de Chile, with all activities centered in a single 340,000 m2 campus in the capital Santiago. History The University of Santiago of Chile (USACH) started as the School of Arts and Crafts in 1849. It was born in mid-20th century and it is the fifth oldest university in Chile. =Escuela de Artes y Oficios= EAO commemorative stamp The Escuela de Artes y Oficios (EAO)(Spanish School of Arts and Crafts) was founded on July 6, 1849 by Ignacy Domeyko, during the Manuel Bulnes Prieto rule, to improve scientific and technical development in the country. It started with four workshops: Mining, Mechanics, Casting and Carpentry. At the time, students ages ranged between 15 and 18 years old, thus making the EAO not a University, but a secondary education entity. Students were required to read and write and to know basic arithmetic operations. Besides being intensely trained in workshops, students studied algebra, descriptive geometry, trigonometry, technical drawing, industrial mechanics, physics and chemistry, besides Spanish, history and geography. This was a four-year education that later, in 1858, extended to five years. Graduates were called 'apprentices'. In 1886 the EAO moved to a bigger building, located at Quinta Normal, where it would stay up until now. In 1912 it started to educate 'industrial sub-engineers', later known as 'technicians'. By the time, the EAO was able to grant two education level degrees: Arts and Crafts degrees (secondary education level) and Technician degrees (tertiary education level), and by 1936 it granted Industrial Engineering degrees too. =Universidad T√©cnica del Estado= Later during the presidency of Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla through the DFL Decree No. 1831 of April 9, 1947, the School of Arts and Crafts was joined with the School of Mining in Copiap√≥ (1857), La Serena (1887) and Antofagasta (1918), with the Industrial Design Schools (1905) in Temuco (1916) and Valdivia (1934), with the Industrial Engineering Schools in Santiago (1940) and with the Technical Pedagogy Institute. Together these formed the Technical State University (Universidad T√©cnica del Estado, UTE), resulting in it becoming the best Chilean university in the area of applied engineering and industrial technician training. On February 8, 1952, the first statute that allowed the grouping to begin functioning as a university in legal, administrative and academic terms, was enacted. Its first president was Don Octavio Valenzuela Lazo (March 12, 1952 to March 12, 1953). In 1958, the Teknos, the university's troupe, was founded. Academic activity remained in the hands of the four Faculty Councils under the tuition of the University Council. During the 1960s, the DFL No. 2, 1971, allowed for the enacting of a second organizational statute, which allowed the University to be organized through offices, colleges, departments, and all academic structures that the board would deem appropriate. The university is famous for its planetarium. In 1968 due to the University Reform of 1967‚Äì1973, Enrique Kirberg Baltiansky assumed the rectory, the only university rector fully elected by faculty and students. In 1971, during the government of Salvador Allende, Revised Statutes of the Universidad T√©cnica del Estado were approved. During the 1973 coup, Kirberg was removed from his post and imprisoned by the military regime, the statute previously approved was declared void, and new guidelines were reformulated with appointments done entirely by the military regime. =Universidad de Santiago de Chile= In 1981, the military regime through the DFL Decree No. 23 of March 21, 1981, divided the headquarters of the State Technical University, giving rise to new universities and professional institutes. Steps were taken to form the headquarters into the University of Santiago de Chile. The other sites became separately named universities such as the University of Atacama, the University of Antofagasta, the University of Serena, the Professional Institute of Talca (later transformed into the University of Talca), the University of the B√≠o-B√≠o, the University of La Frontera, the Professional Institute of Osorno (subsequently transformed into the University of Los Lagos), the Professional Institute of Valdivia (later integrated in 1988 into the Southern University of Chile) and the Magellan Professional Institute (later transformed into the University of Magallanes). The University of Santiago de Chile, near the University of Atacama and the University of Magallanes are the only heirs of the traditional State Technical University, because at the time of the dissolution and the creation of the new universities in 1981, the headquarters (Santiago), Copiap√≥ and Punta Arenas, were not integrated with other university offices. The headquarters is located where the old School of Arts and Crafts used to be in the municipality of Estaci√≥n Central. One of its symbols is the planetarium built in the 1980s. Departments View of the School of Arts and Crafts, Patio de los H√©roes. The university houses over 18,000 undergraduate students in 66 different majors, in the following departments: *Engineering (Ingenier√≠a), *Bachelors Program in Arts and Sciences (Bachillerato), *Business Administration & Economics (Administraci√≥n y Econom√≠a), *Chemistry & Biology (Qu√≠mica y Biolog√≠a), *Medical Sciences (Ciencias M√©dicas), *Sciences (Ciencias), *Humanities (Humanidades), *School of Architecture (Escuela de Arquitectura), and *Technology Department (Facultad Tecnol√≥gica).  Independent Organizations = Feusach = The University of Santiago, Chile Students Federation (Federaci√≥n de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Santiago de Chile (Feusach) is an organization that represents and aims to protect all the students enrolled at University of Santiago in matters relating to the higher education system, i.e. decisions and actions of university, academic and political officials dealing with the public service of the higher education given by the University. It also works as a union bond between the huge number of students and authorities of the University in order to promote the mutual collaboration for the University management, and also seeks to promote the harmonious development of students at the large university campus thus generating and establishing an important space for politics and university management in the country. = Afusach = The association of servants of the University of Santiago, Chile is an association formed by servants representatives who work for the University. This association, as a union, acts to represent and protect the collective interests of workers before the action of the University officials, and in general before the State political decisions regarding human resources management and civil service. As an association it is ruled by the Administrative Statute and by extract, it is ruled by the Labour Code. = University of Santiago Planetarium = Planetario Chile is located at the University Campus; it is 13380 m2, made up of a building, square, gardens, water mirror and parking for 100 cars. Single in its kind in the country, it's one of the biggest 50 astronomical audiovisual centres in the world. The astronomical dome is 22 m diameter and the stars simulation equipment, a Carl Zeiss projector, model VI, and allows observing the southern and northern night sky.  Communication Media = University of Santiago, Chile Radio and Television (1959 to present) = In 1959, the Universidad T√©cnica del Estado radio was launched, local radio station with subsidiaries in towns where UTE was present. After the arrival of television and the cinema development in Chile during the 1960, UTE founded the Cinema and Television Department. During these years, this department develops a series of documentaries that showed the work of the institution in that time. In 1971, the UTE cinema department released its first production ‚ÄúEl Sueldo de Chile‚Äù (1971) directed by Fernando Balmaceda.\\"El sueldo de Chile\\". Primer film del Departamento de Cine de la UTE By then, the Universidad T√©cnica del Estado was planning to open a television signal in Channel 11, whose intentions were finally aborted after the coup d'√©tat in 1973. In 1979, 11 VHF dial of Santiago, Chile was transferred to the known as Universidad de Chile Television, today known as Chilevision. Due to the university reform in 1981, Universidad T√©cnica del Estado Radio and its subsidiaries in the country broke up and were replaced by Universidad de Santiago Radio, Universidad de Talca Radio, Universidad del Bio-Bio Radio, Universidad de Atacama Radio, Universidad de Antofagasta Radio, Universidad de La Serena Radio, Universidad de los Lagos Radio, Universidad de Magallanes Radio and Universidad de la Frontera Radio. Universidad de Santiago de Chile Radio assumed the legal continuity of the preceding. In 1998, students from the informatics career of the aforementioned university leaded by Jos√© Zorrilla, developed a project to transmit the radio via internet and a program transmission system on demand, whose technology would be known six years later as podcasting.Universidad de Santiago de Chile - Jose Zorrilla - Outstanding professionals interviewRadio UTE, la belle √©poque.

Founded in 1912, the university has an enrollment of more than 22,000 students. The university maintains The Herff College of Engineering, The Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), The Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, the former Lambuth University campus (now a branch campus of The University of Memphis), The Loewenberg College of Nursing, The School of Public Health, The College of Communication and Fine Arts, The FedEx Institute of Technology, The Advanced Distributed Learning Workforce Co-Lab, and The Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology. The University of Memphis is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". History Ned R. McWherter Library In 1909, the Tennessee Legislature enacted the General Education Bill. This bill stated that three colleges be established, one within each grand division of the state and one additional school for African-American students. After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for West Tennessee: Jackson and Memphis. Memphis was chosen, one of the main reasons being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for West Tennessee. This would allow professors and students to go home and visit their relatives. The other three schools established through the General Education Act evolved into East Tennessee State University (ETSU), Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), and Tennessee State University (TSU). Prior to the establishment of the West Tennessee Normal School pursuant to the General Education Bill, a number of higher education departments existed in Memphis under the banner of the University of Memphis. This earlier University of Memphis was formed in 1909 by adding to an already existing medical school's departments of pharmacy, dentistry, and law. On September 10, 1912, West Tennessee Normal School opened in Memphis; its first president was Seymour A. Mynders. By 1913 all departments of the earlier University of Memphis, except the law school, had been taken over by West Tennessee Normal School. After Mynders' death in 1913, John Willard Brister was chosen to take his place. After Brister's resignation in 1918, Andrew A. Kincannon became president. In 1924, Brister returned to his post as president of the school. The name changed in 1925 to West Tennessee State Teachers College. In 1931, the campus' first newspaper, The Tiger Rag, was established. In 1939, Richard C. Jones became president of WTSTC. In 1941, the name was changed to Memphis State College, when the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum. In 1943, Dr. Jennings B. Sanders succeeded Jones as president. Three years later, the first alumnus to become president, J. Millard (Jack) Smith, was appointed. In 1951 MSC awarded its first B.A. degrees. In 1957 the school received full University status and changed its name accordingly to Memphis State University. In 1959, five years after Brown v. Board of Education the university admitted its first black students. Racial segregation was the norm throughout the South at the time. The Memphis State Eight, as they were known, were admitted to Memphis State University. Their presence on campus was the focus not only of intense media scrutiny, but severe criticism from much of the local public. Ostensibly for the black students' safety and to maintain an air of calm on the campus, University administrators placed certain restrictions on where and when the black students could be on campus. They were to go only to their classes, not to any of the public places on campus, such as the cafeteria; and they were to leave the campus immediately after they had finished their last class. These limitations were lifted after the novelty of their presence on campus had subsided and the public's focus on their presence there had lessened, and as more and more black students were admitted to the university. Today, black students make up more than one-third of the campus student body and participate in all campus activities. Cecil C. Humphreys became president of MSU, succeeding Smith, in 1960. In 1966, the school began awarding doctoral degrees. Humphreys resigned as MSU president to become the first chancellor of the newly formed State University and Community College System, later renamed the Tennessee Board of Regents. John Richardson was appointed interim president. In 1973, Dr. Billy Mac Jones became president. Also that year, the Memphis State Tiger men's basketball team reached the finals of the NCAA tournament, only to fall at the hands of a UCLA team led by future NBA superstar and Hall of Famer Bill Walton in The NCAA Basketball Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1980, Thomas Carpenter became president of MSU; he was succeeded by V. Lane Rawlins in 1991. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University changed its name again, to the University of Memphis. V. Lane Rawlins served from 1991 to 2000; Dr. Ralph Faudree filled in as interim president for one year after V. Lane Rawlins' departure. In 2001, The U of M installed its first female president, Shirley Raines, who retired in the summer of 2013. After a yearlong search, Dr. M. David Rudd was confirmed as the 12th president on May 1, 2014. In the spring semester of 2020, the University joined thousands of other institutions and made a mid-semester shift to online classes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also introduced a credit/no credit grade option in lieu of the traditional grading scale for that semester. Campus The new Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, a former United States federal courthouse, opened in 2010. The University of Memphis campus is located approximately east of downtown in the University District neighborhood of east Memphis. It has an area of , although this figure does not include the law school in the former United States federal customshouse in downtown Memphis, which opened in January 2010. The historical core of campus encompasses approximately . Wilder Tower; the tallest building of the University's main campus Campus planners have significantly increased the amount of green space and the number of walkways over the past several years, while maintaining the original historic architecture of the campus. Surrounding the university's main campus are several historic neighborhoods to the north and east, as well as the University District neighborhood and the commercial Highland Strip to the west. Many University of Memphis college students also reside in housing south of the main campus. =Layout= The University of Memphis campus is set out in a rectilinear format, planned as a geometric design similar to the Jeffersonian style of the University of Virginia. Despite gradual expansion of the campus to the West and South, the campus is fairly compact and retains a park-like, tree-lined setting. The farthest distance on campus takes about twenty-five minutes to walk. According to the most recent master plan, the University of Memphis is projected to expand and redevelop additional areas one block west of the main campus' current western boundary of Patterson St., making Highland Avenue the \\"de facto\\" entrance to the university. =Main Campus= Students walking in front of Manning Hall The FedEx Institute of Technology is a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, robotics, and intelligent systems. The center of the main campus comprises buildings that made up the original campus. The first college buildings, including Scates Hall, Manning Hall, Mynders Hall, and Administration Building, were erected in the early 20th century. This section stretches from Patterson St. south to the end of the main campus at Walker Ave., with most buildings surrounding Alumni Mall and Student Plaza. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments, as well as those of the Physics and Astronomy departments of the College of Arts and Sciences, are located in the original areas of campus. The Administration Building at the University of Memphis Scates Hall, the 3rd oldest building on campus Flanking the original area of campus to the east are the areas of major research for The Life Sciences and Engineering departments, including J.M. Smith Hall, Life Sciences Building and Herff College of Engineering Complex, as well as the College of Education, residing in E.C. Ball Hall, and the Art Museum of the University of Memphis, located in the Communication and Fine Arts Building. The Ned R. McWherter Library, a state- of-the art library facility and one of the premier research libraries of the Mid-South United States, takes up the eastern part of the campus adjacent to Dunavant Plaza and Emeriti Grove. The northwestern area of the main campus includes The Fogelman College of Business and Economics, The Fogelman Executive Center (a major conference center for regional executives visiting The University of Memphis), and The FedEx Institute of Technology, a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, Nanotechnology, Robotics and Intelligent Systems. Originally, in the north end of the campus, Norriswood Ave. was the northern boundary and was an actual street that ran through the campus. The campus expanded into this area in the late 1960s & early 1970s. The western edge and southwest corner include Johnson Hall (comprising the Geography and Geology Departments), Patterson Hall (housing the English department), John S. Wilder Tower (formerly Brister Tower), Greek Row, and the bulk of The University of Memphis residence halls. As The University of Memphis presses ahead with its planned expansion, many more facilities, pedestrian access, and green space will also be created with the renovation and development of the currently residential block west of Patterson St. in the University District neighborhood. On January 29, 2013, Governor Bill Haslam announced a $44.6 million state budget pledge for the Community Health Building, which will be the new home of The Loewenberg College of Nursing and The School of Communication Sciences and Disorders. The University of Memphis was required to raise $15 million from private funds to match the state funds. In 2017, the University announced plans for a new Veterans Care Center on campus. Located in the Psychological Services Center on campus, the Veterans Care Center \\"will address the mental health needs of veterans, regardless of era, gender, discharge status or service connection.\\" In 2019, the University opened the Hunter Harrison Memorial Bridge, providing for the first time in school history a pedestrian crossing that connects the main campus and the campus areas south of the Norfolk-Southern railroad with uninterrupted access. This bridge connects to the new Southern Parking Garage, as well as the new $30 million Student Recreation & Fitness Center that began construction in October 2019, expanding the area of the campus south of the railroad tracks. The University also announced plans to begin building the new Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music on Central Ave. in Fall 2019, beginning a major northward expansion of campus across Central Ave. =Park Avenue Campus= Directly south of the main campus along the corner of Park Avenue and Getwell Road sits the Park Avenue Campus, formerly known as South Campus. The Park Avenue Campus was formerly the site of Kennedy Veterans Hospital from 1942 until 1967, when the U.S. Government donated the land and buildings to the University. Very few buildings from the Kennedy Hospital days remain on campus. The Park Avenue Campus is home not only to various intramural athletics programs and facilities, but also to various research facilities, classrooms and the Community Health Building, which houses the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, the Memphis Speech and Hearing Center, and the Loewenberg College of Nursing. The Defense Contract Audit Agency formerly operated its main training facility on the Park Avenue Campus from 1982 to the early 2010s. WKNO formerly operated its FM and television stations on the Park Avenue Campus as well. Future plans include a regulation indoor soccer stadium and track facility, capable of hosting large-scale NCAA Division I track-and-field meets. The graduate and family housing units are located at Park Avenue, from the main university campus. The complex has 150 housing units. Residents are zoned to Memphis City Schools. The zoned schools are Sherwood Elementary School, Colonial Middle School, and White Station High School. =Downtown Law School Campus= In 2006, plans were announced that the University of Memphis, School of Law would relocate to the former U.S. Post Office & Customs House in downtown Memphis. This facility pre-dates the existence of the University itself, having been constructed in multiple sections between 1885 and the early 1920s. In 2010, the law school was moved permanently from the main campus to the newly renovated downtown campus. The new University of Memphis, School of Law campus sits adjacent to downtown courts and the financial and administrative center of the city. It has been ranked multiple times among the top law school facilities in the U.S. =Lambuth Campus= In 2011, the University of Memphis began offering undergraduate and graduate programs on the former Lambuth University campus in Jackson, Tennessee, located approximately east of Memphis. Now known as the University of Memphis Lambuth Campus, the historic campus includes classroom buildings, dormitories, library, planetarium, and athletic facilities. Enrollment in the fall of 2011 stood at 246 students. Enrollment in the spring of 2018 was the first time enrollment surpassed 1,000 students, with a total of 1,038 students. The 2019‚Äì2020 term was the first term to begin with an enrollment of over 1,000 students for the campus, with an official enrollment of 1,070 students. =Environmentalism= The Edward J. Meeman Biological Station of the University of Memphis conducts research in ecology, environmental biology, and natural history. It is named for Edward J. Meeman, an editor of the former Memphis Press-Scimitar newspaper who later established a foundation to fund environmental studies. In 2007, President Shirley Raines signed the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), which requires that the university become carbon neutral. The Green Campus Initiative works to develop and implement a strategic plan to achieve the goals of the APUPCC. Successful events and projects include the May 2009 2nd Annual E-Recycling Day, resulting in 155 tons of electronic items collected, and the Tiger Initiative for Gardening in Urban Settings (TIGUrS), a fruit and vegetable gardening initiative across campus. In April 2008, the student-run Environmental Action Club ran a Green Power Campaign to promote a student referendum to add a \\"Green Fee\\" to tuition payments to fund clean, renewable energy and other campus sustainability projects. The referendum passed with a 69% student approval rate. The university is now purchasing renewable energy through the TVA's Green Power Switch program and offsetting 10% of current energy use. It is now the 2nd largest green power purchaser in the entire TVA distribution region. In February 2009, the TERRA (Technologically and Environmentally Responsive Residential Architecture) sustainable design demonstration house was completed. Designed by the Department of Architecture, the LEED Platinum TERRA house serves as a studio for which architecture and design students to design \\"green\\" housing within urban areas, as well as serve as a demonstration house open for tours and serving as an educational tool for the community. Memphis received a grade of \\"C\\" on the 2009 Campus Sustainability Report Card published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Only 34 schools earned a higher grade. Organization Student Activities Plaza The University of Memphis is associated with the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) system, consisting of 18 Board Members. However, as of May 2017, it is governed by an institutional Board of Trustees. Within this framework, the President of the University of Memphis is the day- to-day administrator of the university.

The editorially independent student newspaper of the university publishes 5,500 copies a day, four days a week, and employs a paid staff of more than 30, which includes an editorial team of six, more than 20 staff writers, photographers, copy editors, and other staff members during the Fall and Spring semesters. The publication is part of a tradition which began in 1931 as The Tiger Rag, a protest newspaper. Since that time, the newspaper has been continuously published by University of Memphis students. Even during World War II when paper and other resources were scarce, the newspaper published as a newsletter posted on bulletin boards around campus. The name of the newspaper was changed to The Helmsman in 1972, and became The Daily Helmsman in 1981, when the newspaper began publishing four days a week. The Helmsman has won many honors over the years for reporting, photography and design, including awards given by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, Columbia University and the Southeastern Journalism Conference. Helmsman alumni have gone on to jobs at many prestigious news organizations, such as The New York Times, Rolling Stone magazine, and Southern Living magazine, among others. In 2012, The Helmsman and then-Editor-in-Chief Chelsea Boozer were awarded the College Press Freedom Award for their efforts fighting \\"a retaliatory budget cut while enduring a campaign of harassment by campus police.\\" The award is given annually by the Student Press Law Center and the Associated Collegiate Press. Boozer also won a national Investigative Reporters and Editors award for coverage of how student activity fees are spent, including how the Student Government Association writes its senior officers free tuition, parking and stipends out of the money collected from the student body. = Religious Organizations = Numerous religious centers are located on the campus, including the Wesley Foundation (a United Methodist student center), the Baptist Collegiate Ministry, the University Catholic Center and Catholic Student Center, Ukirk (a PCUSA campus ministry) Barth House Episcopal Student Center, Reformed University Fellowship, the Soma Christian Student Center (a Church of Christ- supported center), and Memphis Hillel.

The band performs at Memphis Tigers football games as a marching band and at Tigers basketball games as a pep band. As one of the oldest institutions at the university, the Band partakes in many of the game day traditions. The MSS performs more than any other student ensemble on campus, and for approximately 350,000 fans each fall. The MSS is featured at nearly every campus-wide event, ranging from Freshman Convocation to the Homecoming Parade and Pep Rally. The band has been featured on the nationally syndicated \\"Mike & Mandy\\" Radio Show, and is a star attraction at the Bandmaster's Championship, a high school marching band contest administered by The University of Memphis Band Alumni Chapter. Members of the MSS represent all academic disciplines across campus, and historically has been open to all students via audition. =Mascot= For over 30 years, the sideline mascot for The University of Memphis has been a live Bengal tiger named TOM. During this time, the university has hosted three successive tigers, known respectively as TOM I, TOM II, and TOM III. The university also has a costumed tiger mascot known as Pouncer. TOM III, the current Tiger mascot, attends all Tiger football home games and other University events. TOM III travels in a climate-controlled trailer with a police escort. TOM III is housed and cared for by the Highland Hundred Tiger Guard, an alumni booster organization in a $300,000 facility. TOM II matured, eventually weighing more than . The University of Memphis is one of only two universities in America with a live tiger mascot (the other being LSU in Baton Rouge). After being diagnosed with mouth cancer, TOM II was euthanized on October 15, 2008, at the age of 17. The team of veterinarians who oversaw TOM II decided this was necessary to ensure he did not suffer due to his illness. The Highland Hundred football booster group found a replacement for the mascot in the tiger cub TOM III. The university currently has fifty tiger statues located on campus and another fifty located around the Memphis area. The Alumni Association placed the life-sized tigers around the city in honor of the University's Centennial in January 2012. =Nickname= When the University of Memphis first fielded a football team in the fall of 1912, no one had selected a nickname for the squad. Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors. After the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade. During this event, several university students shouted, \\"We fight like Tigers!\\" The nickname was born. As time passed, the nickname \\"Tigers\\" was increasingly used, particularly in campus publications, but did not catch on with the newspapers downtown. They continued to use \\"the Blue and Gray\\" when referring to the university. Under Coach Lester Barnard in 1922, Memphis's football team gave a ring of truth to that old student yell about Tigers. The team adopted a motto ‚Äì \\"Every Man a Tiger\\" ‚Äì and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points. The Tiger nickname continued with students and alumni, eventually being adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis in 1939. =Song= Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games is \\"Go! Tigers! Go!\\", the University of Memphis Tigers' fight song. The fight song was written by Tom Ferguson, former Director of Bands at Memphis State University during the 1960s. Special Programs and Institutes=Tennessee Governor's School for International Studies= The Governor's School for International Studies is an academic summer program for gifted junior and senior high school students in Tennessee. It is a selective program located at the University of Memphis in which students study two Political Science, a foreign language, and an elective of their choice from the International Studies curriculum. The students, upon finishing the four-week term, gain six hours of college credit which may be transferred to any Tennessee Board of Regents School. =Chucalissa Indian Village= UofM also operates the Chucalissa Indian Village, an American Indian heritage site and museum. Officially known as the T. O. Fuller State Park, the location includes a museum and important archeological sites. = The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change = Founded in 1996 by civil rights activist Benjamin L. Hooks, and faculty of the department of political science at the University of Memphis, the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis is dedicated to preserving the history of the civil rights movement and continuing the struggle for equality championed by its namesake. The Hooks Institute is housed within the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Memphis. The mission of the Hooks Institute is teaching, studying and promoting civil rights and social change. This mission is implemented through a variety of programs focused on scholarship of the civil rights movement, public policy research and scholarship, commemorations and grants focused on continuing scholarship of the civil rights movement, public events focused on civil rights and social change, media focused on the civil rights movement including documentary films and websites, and direct engagement programs to improve the conditions of marginalized communities.

It is also grown in the Italian isle of Sardinia, the south of France, Australia, and California's Monterey AVA and San Joaquin Valley. It is generally spicy, berry-flavored and soft on the palate and produces wine with a relatively high alcohol content, but it needs careful control of yields for best results. Characteristic flavor profiles on Grenache include red fruit flavors (raspberry and strawberry) with a subtle, white pepper spice note. Grenache wines are highly prone to oxidation, with even young examples having the potential to show browning (or \\"bricking\\") coloration that can be noticed around the rim when evaluating the wine at an angle in the glass. As Grenache ages the wines tend to take on more leather and tar flavors.Wine & Spirits Education Trust (2012). Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality. Second Revised Edition. London: Wine & Spirits Education Trust. . pp. 6‚Äì9. Wines made from Grenache tend to lack acid, tannin and color, and it is often blended with other varieties such as Syrah, Carignan, Tempranillo, and Cinsaut. In Spain, there are monovarietal wines made of Garnacha tinta (red Grenache), notably in the southern Aragon wine regions of Calatayud, Carinena and Campo de Borja, but it is also used in blends, as in some Rioja wines with tempranillo. Grenache is the dominant variety in most Southern Rh√¥ne wines, especially in Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, where it is typically over 80% of the blend. In Australia it is typically blended in \\"GSM\\" blends with Syrah (commonly known as Shiraz in that country) and Mourv√®dre with old vine examples in McLaren Vale. In Italy, the Sardinian D.O.C. wine Cannonau di Sardegna is by law 90% local Grenache (Cannonau). Grenache is also used to make ros√© wines in France and Spain, notably those of the Tavel district in the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne and those of the Navarra region. And the high sugar levels of Grenache have led to extensive use in fortified wines, including the red vins doux naturels of Roussillon such as Banyuls, and as the basis of most Australian fortified wine.J. Robinson, ed. (2006). The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition. Oxford University Press. . pp. 297‚Äì298, 333‚Äì334. History The early history of Grenache is closely linked to the lands under the Crown of Aragon. Grenache or Garnacha (as it is known in Spain) most likely originated in the region of Aragon in northern Spain, according to ampelographical evidence. Plantings probably spread from the original birthplace to Catalonia and other lands under the Crown of Aragon such as Sardinia and Roussillon in southern France. An early synonym for the vine was Tinto Aragon√©s (red of Aragon). The grape is known as Cannonau in Sardinia, where it is claimed that it originated there and spread to other Mediterranean lands under Aragon rule. Grenache, under its Spanish synonym Garnacha, was already well established on both sides of the Pyrenees when the Roussillon region was annexed by France. From there the vine made its way through the Languedoc and to the Southern Rhone region where it was well established by the 19th century. Despite its prevalence in nearby Navarra and Catalonia, Garnacha was not widely planted in the Rioja till the early 20th century as vineyards were replanted following the phylloxera epidemic. Grenache was one of the first varieties to be introduced to Australia in the 18th century and eventually became the country's most widely planted red wine grape variety until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid 1960s.Oz Clarke, Encyclopedia of Grapes, pp. 91‚Äì100, Harcourt Books 2001 Early Australian Grenache was a main component in the sweet fortified wines that was the lynchpin of the early Australian wine industry. In the 19th century, California wine growers prized the vine's ability to produce high yields and withstand heat and drought conditions. The grape was extensively planted throughout the hot San Joaquin Valley where it was mainly used as a blending component for pale, sweet jug wines. In the late 20th century, the Rhone Rangers movement brought attention to the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends modeled after the Grenache dominate wines of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. In the early 20th century, Grenache was one of the first Vitis vinifera grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley ros√© earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams treatise The Wines of America.P. Gregutt Washington Wines and Wineries: The Essential Guide, pp. 67‚Äì68, University of California Press 2007 Viticulture The strong wood canopy of Grenache allows it to thrive in a windy climate but also makes mechanical harvesting and pruning difficult. The Grenache vine is characterized by its strong wood canopy and upright growth. It has good wind tolerance (which is useful with the northerly Cierzo and Mistral winds that influence the regions of Aragon and the Rhone) and has shown itself to be very suited for the dry, warm windy climate around the Mediterranean. The vine buds early and requires a long growing season in order to fully ripen. Grenache is often one of the last grapes to be harvested, often ripening weeks after Cabernet Sauvignon. The long ripening process allows the sugars in the grape to reach high levels, making Grenache-based wines capable of substantial alcohol levels, often at least 15% ABV. While the vine is generally vigorous, it is susceptible to various grape diseases that can affect the yield and quality of the grape production such as coulure, bunch rot and downy mildew due to the vine's tight grape clusters. Marginal and wet climates can increase Grenache's propensity to develop these viticultural dangers. The vine's drought resistance is dependent on the type of rootstock it is planted on but on all types of rootstocks, Grenache seems to respond favorably to some degree of moisture stress. Grenache prefers hot, dry soils that are well drained but it is relatively adaptable to all vineyard soil types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape with the area's galets roul√©s, heat-retentive stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retains enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the dry wine region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce pale colored wines with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produce darker, more tannic wines such as those found in the Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines to those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wines labeled under the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment, and more labor- intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine's popularity. =Mutants and crosses= Over centuries, the Grenache vine has produced color mutation vines with berries of all range of colors. While Grenache noir or \\"red\\" Grenache is the most well known, Grenache blanc or \\"white\\" Grenache is a very important grape variety in France where it is the fourth most widely planted white variety after Ugni blanc, Chardonnay and Semillon. Like Grenache noir, it is a permitted variety in the blends of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. In Southern France and Sardinia, the mutants Grenache Rose and Grenache gris are also found making pale ros√© and lightly tinted white wines. \\"Hairy Grenache\\" (Garnacha Peluda as known in Spain, and Garnatxa Peluda in Catalan) is a Grenache variant evolved to grow fuzz on the underside of its leaves to protect the vine from transpiration in hot climates, \\"like the corresponding fuzz on rosemary or other mediterranean plants.\\"Robinson, Jancis. \\"Garnacha Peluda\\". Wine Grapes. New York: HarperCollins, 2012. P. 403. Print. Compared to its more widely planted cousin, it produces wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity that show spicy and savory notes more readily as they age. It was not widely replanted after phylloxera as it was not well-adapted to making the vins doux naturels (see Fortified wine) that were \\"all the rage\\" at the time. The vine known as Garnacha Tintorera is a synonym for the teinturier grape Alicante which is a crossing of Grenache and Petite Bouschet. In 1961, a cross between Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon produced the French wine grape Marselan.L. Alley \\"New French Wine Grape Arrives in US Market\\", The Wine Spectator, p. 17, September 30, 2007 Winemaking The thin skin and lack of coloring phenolic compounds makes Grenache a useful variety for the production of pale ros√© Grenache is often used as a blending component, adding body and sweet fruitiness to a wine. The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the grape's naturally low tannins and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and hot fermentation with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, astringent wine lacking the grape's characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, slow fermentation at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation but too much oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache. The high levels of sugars and lack of harsh tannins, makes Grenache well adapted to the production of fortified wines, such as the vin doux naturels (VDN) of the Roussillon region and the \\"port- style\\" wines of Australia. In these wines, the must ferments for three days before grape spirit is added to the must to halt the fermentation and the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The high alcoholic proof grape spirit brings the finished wine up to 15‚Äì16% alcohol. These wines can be made in a rancio style by being left outside in glass demi-johns (or carboys) or wooden barrels where the wine bakes in the sun for several years until it develops a maderized character and flavors of sour raisins, nuts and cheese. These fortified VDNs and port-style wines have longevity and can be drinkable well into their third decade. Wine regions Grenache is one of the most widely planted red wine grape varieties in the world with France and Spain being its largest principal wine regions. In the late 20th century, total acreage of Grenache in Spain has been on the decline with the vineyards being uprooted in lieu of the more fashionable Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Between the late 1980s and 2004, Spanish plantings dropped from to allowing France with its to assume the mantle as the world's largest source of Grenache. As of 2000, Grenache was the third most widely planted red wine grape variety in France, behind Merlot and Carignan. From French nurseries, Grenache has become the fourth most widely propagated vine with more than 23 million cuttings sold since 1998 according to French ampelographer Pierre Galet. =France= While most French Grenaches are blends there are varietal examples produced. In France, Grenache is most widely associated with the wines of the Rhone and southern France. Its history in the Rhone can be traced to the influence of Burgundian wine merchants in the 17-18th centuries who were seeking a blending variety to add body and alcohol content to their light body wines. Grenache, with its propensity for high alcohol and high yields, fit those desire nicely and was widely planted in the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas and Vacqueyras regions. Today Grenache is most widely planted in the Languedoc-Roussillon region where it is widely blended with Carignan, Cinsaut, Syrah and Mourv√®dre. The vine also has sizable plantings in the Dr√¥me department. The vine's strong, hard wood and affinity for bush vine training allows it to thrive in the Mistral influenced southern Rhone regions of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas. In Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache noir is the most common variety of the 13 permitted varieties, although some producers in recent years have been using a higher proportion of Mourv√®dre. Grenache produces a sweet juice that can have almost a jam-like consistency when very ripe. Syrah is typically blended to provide color and spice, while Mourv√®dre can add elegance and structure to the wine.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 250 Workman Publishing 2001 The grape's thin skin and pale coloring makes its well suited for the production of full bodied, fruit ros√© wines. Grenache is the principal grape behind the ros√©s of Tavel and Lirac and its plays an important role in the Provence region as well. In the Roussillon region, Grenache noir and its gris and blanc mutations are used in the production of the fortified vin doux naturels of Banyuls and Maury. The characteristic of French Grenache-based wines depends largely on the selection of its blending partners and can range from the spicy richness associated with Ch√¢teauneuf-du- Pape to the chewy fruitiness associated with basic C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages. Other regions with sizable plantings of Grenache include the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) regions of Minervois, Fitou and Corbi√®res. =Spain= In Spain, Grenache is known as Garnacha (Garnatxa in Catalan) and given the likely history of the grape this is most likely the grape's original name (although the RAE gives Italian vernaccia as the etymologyEntry in DRAE). There are several clonal varieties of Garnacha with the thin-skinned, dark colored Garnacha Tinta (sometimes spelled Tinto) being the most common. Another variety, known as Garnacha Peluda or \\"Hairy Grenache\\" due to the soft hairy texture on the underside of the vine's leaves is also found in Spain, mostly in Borja and Cari√±ena (Arag√≥n). Compared to its more widely planted cousin, it produces wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity that show spicy and savory notes more readily as they age. Widely planted in northeastern and central Spain, Garnacha was long considered a \\"workhorse\\" grape of low quality suitable for blending. In the late 20th century, the success of the Garnacha-based wines from Priorat in Catalonia (as well as the emerging international attention given to the New World Rhone Rangers) sparked a re-evaluation of this \\"workhorse\\" variety. Today it is the third most widely planted red grape variety in Spain (behind Tempranillo and Bobal) with more than and is seen in both varietal wines and blends. Garnacha plays a major role in the denominaci√≥n de origen protegida (DOP) wines in Aragon, Catalonia, and Navarra and the denominaci√≥n de origen calificada (DOC/DOQ) wines of Rioja and Priorat, plus the mountainous areas just southwest of Madrid: M√©ntrida and Cebreros. Other Spanish wine regions with sizable Garnacha plantings include Costers del Segre, Empord√†, La Mancha, Madrid, Pened√®s, Somontano, Tarragona and Terra Alta. Aragon Aragon, believed to be the probable origin of the grape, concentrates the largest surface of Grenache (or Garnacha as it is called locally) in Spain, with planted. Garnacha is the dominant variety in the region and is typically used to produce single variety wines. Even though in the mid-20th century Garnacha was considered a \\"workhorse\\" variety for large volume wines, in the last 20 years a new generation of winemakers have taken a new approach, by controlling yields, taking advantage of the old vines (from 30 to more than 100 years), and applying modern techniques in combination with old traditions to increase concentration. The DOP of Calatayud (91% of its production is Grenache) holds the highest altitude Garnacha vineyards and is the only DOP to legally define \\"old vines\\" (35 years minimum). In the Campo de Borja DOP, 30+-years-old Garnacha bush trained vines and manual harvest are common; the grapes are typically slightly raisined, jammy fruit that generates alcohol of 14-14.5%. The Cari√±ena DOP has the largest surface of Garnacha vineyards in the region with , many of them old vines. Although many of Somontano DOP wines are now produced with international grape varieties, some of the oldest high altitude vineyards are still traditional Garnacha. Rioja In Rioja the grape is planted mostly in the warmer Rioja Baja region located in the eastern expanse of the wine region. Usually blended with Tempranillo, Garnacha provides juicy fruitiness and added body. In recent years, modern Rioja producers have been increasing the amount of Garnacha used in the blend in order to produce earlier maturing and more approachable Riojas in their youth. Garnacha is also used in the pale colored rosados of Rioja. The vine has a long history in the Navarra region where it has been the dominant red grape variety with nearly 54% of the region's vineyard planted with Garnacha. Navarra Compared to neighboring Rioja, the Garnacha-based blends of Navarra are lighter and fruitier, meant for earlier consumption. The steep terraced hillside vineyards of Priorat are planted to nearly 40% Garnacha. Priorat Ampelographers believe Garnacha has had a presence in the Priorat region of Catalonia for several hundred years (possibly nearly 800 years) but since the 1990s the region's old Garnacha have garnered much attention. A wave of ambitious young winemakers rediscovered the low-yield, bush-vine trained Garnacha planted throughout the llicorella (brown schist) based soils of Priorat. This unique combination of extremely old vines (the average age in most vineyards is between 35‚Äì60 years) planted on steep terraces and soil produces very low yields (around 5-6 hectoliters per hectare) which makes Priorat a dense, rich concentrated and dark colored wine with noticeable tannins. The traditional Priorat wine would be almost black in color and require years of aging before it would be approachable to drink. Nearly 40% of all the vineyard land in the Priorat region is planted to Garnacha, and most of the rest is Carignan but the acreage of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot increased before 2000 as modernist producers sought to blend those varieties to add complexity. Some of these new modern style Priorats tend to show softer, blackberry fruit in their youth and over time develop notes of figs and tar. =Italy= In Italy, Grenache is most commonly found as Cannonau in Sardinia where it is one of the principal grapes in the island's deeply colored, full bodied red wines that routinely maintain alcohol levels around 15%. The Sardinian D.O.C. wine Cannonau di Sardegna is by law at least 90% local Grenache (Cannonau). Grenache is also grown in other Italian regions, under names as Alicante, Tocai rosso, Granaccia, Vernaccia Nera. =Other Old World regions= Grenache is also found in Sicily, Umbria (in Trasimeno lake area), Marche (called Bord√≤) and Calabria. Grenache has been grown in Israel since the 19th century and was once an important grape in the Algerian wine industry. Today there are still some producers in Morocco producing Grenache ros√©s. Sizable plantings of Grenache are also found in Cyprus and scattered among the Greek islands. =Australia= Grenache was one of many grape varieties introduced to Australia by James Busby. A clone from Perpignan arrived in Australia with James Busby in his 1832 collection. More significant was the introduction into South Australia of new cuttings from the South of France, by Dr Christopher Rawson Penfold in 1844. Plantings in South Australia boomed, particularly in McLaren Vale, the Barossa Valley and Clare Valley. Until the mid 20th century, Grenache was Australia's most widely planted red wine grape variety with significant plantings in the vast Riverland region where it was vital component in the fortified \\"port-style\\" wines of the early Australian industry. As Australian winemakers started to focus more of premium still wines, Grenache gradually fell out of favor being supplanted by Shiraz and later Cabernet Sauvignon in Australian vineyards. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw a revival of interest in Grenache with old vine plantings in South Australia being used to produce varietal Grenache as well as a \\"GSM\\"-Grenache, Syrah and Mouvedre-blends becoming popular. Varietal Grenache from the McLaren Vale is characterized by luscious richness and spicy notes while Barossa Valley Grenache is characterized by jammy, intense fruitiness. =United States= A \\"Rhone-style\\" Grenache based blend from Washington State In the early California wine industry, Grenache's high yields and alcohol level made it an ideal blending component for jug wine production. Early plantings centered in the hot central San Joaquin Valley, where the grape benefitted from its tolerance to heat and drought. It was first used to produce sweet, pale colored \\"white Grenache\\" wines similar in quality and substance to White Zinfandel. The late 20th century saw a revival of interest in the variety spearheaded by the Rhone Rangers movement. These producers imported new cuttings from the Rhone valley for planting in the cooler Central Coast region for use in the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends. Some historic old vine plantings of Grenache in Mendocino County has also garnered interest in recent years. In the early 20th century, Grenache was one of the first Vitis vinifera grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley ros√© earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams's treatise The Wines of America. Despite its long history, Grenache has been a minor grape variety in Washington but has seen an increase in plantings in recent years due to the \\"Rhone Ranger\\" movement in the state. Older plantings in the Horse Heaven Hills and Columbia Gorge American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) have also begun to attract interest. = South Africa = Grenache Noir came to the Cape in the 19th century but was only confirmed as such in the early 1900s by a Stellenbosch University professor. While there isn't a lot of Grenache Noir planted in South Africa at only 305 hectares in 2014, many of the 100+ Grenache based blends are proving to be very fashionable with winemakers due to South Africa's warm climate, dry land and granitic soils. =Other New World wine regions= Despite being one of the world's most widely planted red grape varieties, Grenache's colonization of the New World has been limited apart from strongholds in Australia and California. The rising popularity and success of the Rhone Ranger's movement has brought greater attention to the variety and more plantings of Grenache are popping up every year in places like Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and South Africa. Wines Grenache grapes A vin doux naturel made from Grenache Though Grenache is most often encountered in blended wines (such as the Rhone wines or GSM blends), varietal examples of Grenache do exist. As a blending component, Grenache is valued for the added body and fruitiness that it brings without added tannins. As a varietal, the grape's naturally low concentration of phenolics contribute to its pale color and lack of extract but viticultural practices and low yields can increase the concentrations of phenolic compounds. Grenache-based wines tend to be made for early consumption with its propensity for oxidation make it a poor candidate for long-term aging. However, producers (such as some examples from Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and Priorat) who use low yields grown on poor soils can produce dense, concentrated wines that can benefit from cellaring. The fortified vin doux naturels of France and Australian \\"port-style\\" wines are protected from Grenache's propensity for oxidation by the fortification process and can usually be drinkable for two or three decades. The characteristic notes of Grenache are berry fruit such as raspberries and strawberries. When yields are kept in check, Grenache-based wines can develop complex and intense notes of blackcurrants, black cherries, black olives, coffee, gingerbread, honey, leather, black pepper, tar, spices, and roasted nuts.

Though it is the grape of most of central Italy from Romagna down to Lazio (the most widespread grape in Tuscany),:it:Sangiovese Campania and Sicily, outside Italy it is most famous as the only component of Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino and the main component of the blends Chianti, Carmignano, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and Morellino di Scansano, although it can also be used to make varietal wines such as Sangiovese di Romagna and the modern \\"Super Tuscan\\" wines like Tignanello. Sangiovese was already well known by the 16th century. Recent DNA profiling by Jos√© Vouillamoz of the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all‚ÄôAdige suggests that Sangiovese's ancestors are Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. The former is well known as an ancient variety in Tuscany, the latter is an almost-extinct relic from Calabria, the toe of Italy. At least fourteen Sangiovese clones exist, of which Brunello is one of the best regarded. An attempt to classify the clones into Sangiovese grosso (including Brunello) and Sangiovese piccolo families has gained little evidential support. Young Sangiovese has fresh fruity flavours of strawberry and a little spiciness, but it readily takes on oaky, even tarry, flavours when aged in barrels.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz, Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours, pgs 942-946, Allen Lane 2012 While not as aromatic as other red wine varieties such as Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah, Sangiovese often has a flavour profile of sour red cherries with earthy aromas and tea leaf notes. Wines made from Sangiovese usually have medium-plus tannins and high acidity.Wine & Spirits Education Trust, Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality, pgs 6-9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, History The translation of Sangiovese's name sanguis Jovis, \\"the blood of Jove\\", led to theories that the grape's origins dated from Roman times. Early theories on the origin of Sangiovese dated the grape to the time of Roman winemaking. It was even postulated that the grape was first cultivated in Tuscany by the Etruscans from wild Vitis vinifera vines. The literal translation of the grape's name, the \\"blood of Jove\\", refers to the Roman god Jupiter. According to legend, the name was coined by monks from the commune of Santarcangelo di Romagna in what is now the province of Rimini in the Emilia-Romagna region of east-central Italy. The first documented mention of Sangiovese was in the 1590 writings of Giovanvettorio Soderini (also known under the pen name of Ciriegiulo). Identifying the grape as \\"Sangiogheto\\" Soderini notes that in Tuscany the grape makes very good wine but if the winemaker is not careful, it risks turning into vinegar. While there is no conclusive proof that Sangiogheto is Sangiovese, most wine historians generally consider this to be the first historical mention of the grape. Regardless, it would not be until the 18th century that Sangiovese would gain widespread attention throughout Tuscany, being with Malvasia and Trebbiano the most widely planted grapes in the region. In 1738, Cosimo Trinci described wines made from Sangiovese as excellent when blended with other varieties but hard and acidic when made as a wine by itself. In 1883, the Italian writer Giovanni Cosimo Villifranchi echoed a similar description about the quality of Sangiovese being dependent on the grapes with which it was blended. The winemaker and politician, Bettino Ricasoli formulated one of the early recipes for Chianti when he blended his Sangiovese with a sizable amount of Canaiolo. In the wines of Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Sangiovese would experience a period of popularity in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1970s, Tuscan winemakers began a period of innovation by introducing modern oak treatments and blending the grape with non-Italian varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon in the creation of wines that were given the collective marketing sobriquet \\"Super Tuscans\\". =Parentage= Sangiovese leaf from Red Willow Vineyard in Washington State. In 2004, DNA profiling done by researchers at San Michele All'Adige revealed the grape to be the product of a crossing between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. While Ciliegiolo has a long history tied to the Tuscan region, Calabrese Montenuovo (which is not related to the grape commonly known as Calabrese, or Nero d'Avola) has its origins in southern Italy, where it probably originated in the Calabria region before moving its way up to Campania. This essentially means that the genetic heritage of Sangiovese is half Tuscan and half southern Italian. Where the crossing between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo occurred is not known, with some believing the cross happened in Tuscany while other ampelographers suggesting it may have happened in southern Italy. Evidence for this latter theory is the proliferation of seedless mutations of Sangiovese, known under various synonyms, throughout various regions of southern Italy including Campania, Corinto nero which is grown on the island of Lipari just north of Sicily and Tuccanese from the Apulia region in the heel of the Italian boot. In Campania, among the many seedless mutations of Sangiovese still growing in the region are Nerello from the commune of Savelli, Nerello Campotu from the commune of Motta San Giovanni, Puttanella from Mandatoriccio and Vigna del Conte. Relationship with Ciliegiolo While the parentage of Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo for Sangiovese was established based on 50 genetic markers and is generally accepted by ampelographers, some wine texts publish contradictory information that Ciliegiolo is an offspring (rather than parent) of Sangiovese. This belief is based on a 2007 study of 38 genetic markers stating that suggested that Ciliegiolo was the product of Sangiovese crossing with an obscure Portuguese wine grape, Muscat Rouge de Mad√®re, that was once grown on the island of Madeira as well as the Douro and Lisboa wine regions of Portugal. In addition to support of fewer genetic markers, this alternative theory is disputed by geneticists such as Jos√© Vouillamoz and Masters of Wine like Jancis Robinson because Muscat Rouge de Mad√®re has no history of ever being cultivated in Italy (where it could have crossed with Sangiovese). Furthermore, while many grapes with lineage involving members of the Muscat family of grapes tend to have pronounced \\"grapey\\" flavours characteristic of Muscat grapes, Ciliegiolo exhibits none of those flavour profiles which makes it unlikely to be an offspring of Muscat Rouge de Mad√®re. =Clones and offspring= Early ampelographical research into Sangiovese begun in 1906 with the work of Girolamo Molon. Molon discovered that the Italian grape known as \\"Sangiovese\\" was actually several \\"varieties\\" of clones which he broadly classified as Sangiovese Grosso and Sangiovese Piccolo. The Sangiovese Grosso family included the clones growing in the Brunello region as well as the clones known as Prugnolo Gentile and Sangiovese di Lamole that was grown in the Greve in Chianti region. The Sangiovese Grosso, according to Molon, produced the highest quality wine, while the varieties in the Sangiovese Piccolo family, which included the majority of clones, produced wine of a lesser degree of quality. In the late 20th century, research by the Italian government and Chianti Classico Consorizo discovered that some of the best producing clones, from a wine quality perspective, came from the Emilia-Romagna region where they are today being propagated under the names R24 and T19. Another Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Sangiovese on the one hand and ten other Italian grape varieties on the other hand: Foglia Tonda, Frappato, Gaglioppo, Mantonicone, Morellino del Casentino, Morellino del Valdarno, Nerello Mascalese, Tuccanese di Turi, Susumaniello, and Vernaccia Nera del Valdarno. It is possible, and even likely, that Sangiovese is one of the parents of each of these grape varieties.‚ÄòSangiovese‚Äô and ‚ÄòGarganega‚Äô are two key varieties of the Italian grapevine assortment evolution, M. Crespan, A. Cal√≤, S. Giannetto, A. Sparacio, P. Storchi and A. Costacurta, Vitis 47 (2), 97‚Äì104 (2008) Since these grape varieties are spread over different parts of Italy (Apulia, Calabria, Sicily and Tuscany), this confirmed by genetic methods that Sangiovese is a key variety in the pedigree of red Italian grape varieties. DNA analysis in 2001 also suggests a strong genetic relationship between Sangiovese and Aleatico, a grape variety predominantly growing in Apulia, though the exact nature of this relationship has yet to be determined. Viticulture Sangiovese grapes in the Montalcino region of Tuscany. Sangiovese vineyards in the Val d'Orcia, Monte Amiata in the background. Sangiovese has shown itself to be adaptable to many different types of vineyard soils but seems to thrive in soils with a high concentration of limestone, having the potential to produce elegant wines with forceful aromas. In the Chianti Classico region, Sangiovese thrives on the highly friable shale-clay soil known as galestro. In the Montalcino region, there is a high proportion of limestone-based alberese soils alternating with deposits of galestro. The lesser zones of the generic Chianti appellation are predominantly clay, which often produce as high quality of wine as alberese and galestro do. The grape requires a long growing season, as it buds early and is slow to ripen. The grape requires sufficient warmth to ripen fully, but too much warmth and its flavours can become diluted.Oz Clarke, Encyclopedia of Grapes, pg 209-216, Harcourt Books 2001 Harvests in Italy have traditionally begun after September 29, with modern harvest often taking place in mid-late October. A longer growing season gives the grapes time to develop richness and potential body. However, in cool vintages this can result in the grapes having high levels of acidity and harsh, unripened tannins. In regions (like some areas of Tuscany) that are prone to rainfall in October, there is a risk for rot due to the Sangiovese grape's thin skin. In other areas, such as the dry conditions of the Columbia Valley AVA of Washington State, the grape has good resistance to drought conditions and often requires little irrigation. For the best quality, yields need to be kept in check as the vine is notably vigorous and prone to overproduction. In Chianti, most quality conscious producers limit their yields to 3 pounds (1.5 kg) of fruit per vine. Wine made from high-yielding vines tend to produce wines with light color, high acidity, and less alcohol, which are likely to oxidize (\\"brown\\") prematurely due to a lower concentration of tannins and anthocyanins (anti-oxidants). Fully developed grapes are typically 19 mm long x 17 mm wide, with an average weight of 3 grams. Soils with low fertility are ideal and help control some of the vigor of the vine. Planting vines in high densities in order to curb vigor may have the adverse effect of increasing foliage and limiting the amount of direct sunlight that can reach the ripening grapes. Advances in understanding the quality and characteristics of the different clones of Sangiovese has led to the identification and propagation of superior clones. While high-yielding clones have been favored in the past, more attention is being paid to matching the clone to the vineyard site and controlling the vine's vigor. Winemaking To add color and fruit to the wine, some winemakers will blend their Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon (pictured). The high acidity and light body characteristics of the Sangiovese grape can present a problem for winemaking. The grape also lacks some of the color-creating phenolic compounds known as acylated anthocyanins. Modern winemakers have devised many techniques trying to find ways to add body and texture to Sangiovese  ranging from using grapes that come from extremely low yielding vines, to adjusting the temperature and length of fermentation and employing extensive oak treatment. One historical technique is the blending of other grape varieties with Sangiovese, in order to complement its attractive qualities and fill in the gaps of some of its weaker points. The Sangiovese-based wines of Chianti have a long tradition of liberally employed blending partners‚Äîsuch as Canaiolo, Ciliegiolo, Mammolo, Colorino and even the white wine grapes like Trebbiano and Malvasia. Since the late 20th century, Bordeaux grapes, most notably Cabernet Sauvignon, have been a favored blending partner though in many Italian DOC/DOCG regions there is often a maximum limit on the amount of other varietals that can be blended with Sangiovese; in Chianti the limit for Cabernet is 15%. Other techniques used to improve the quality of Sangiovese include extending the maceration period from 7‚Äì12 days to 3‚Äì4 weeks to give the must more time to leach vital phenols out of the grape skins. Transferring the wine during fermentation into new oak barrels for malolactic fermentation gives greater polymerization of the tannins and contributes to a softer, rounder mouthfeel. Additionally, Sangiovese has shown itself to be a \\"sponge\\" for soaking up sweet vanilla and other oak compounds from the barrel. For aging the wine, some modern producers will utilize new French oak barrels but there is a tradition of using large, used oak botti barrels that hold five to six hectoliters of wine. Some traditional producers still use the old chestnut barrels in their cellars.  Wine regions  Sangiovese wine. A glass of Chianti made primarily from Sangiovese. While Sangiovese plantings are found worldwide, the grape's homeland is central Italy. From there the grape was taken to North and South America by Italian immigrants. It first achieved some popularity in Argentina where in the Mendoza region it produced wines that had few similarities to its Tuscan counterparts. In California the grape found a sudden surge of popularity in the late 1980s with the \\"Cal-Ital\\" movement of winemakers seeking red wine alternatives to the standard French varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot noir. While there was over of Sangiovese planted in Italy in 1990, plantings of the grape began to decline. However, at the turn of the 21st century, Italy was still the leading source for Sangiovese, with planted in 2000, primarily in the Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna, Sicily, Abruzzo and Marche regions. Argentina was next with , followed by Romania with , the Corsica region in France with , California with and Australia with . =Italy= In Italy, Sangiovese is the most widely planted red grape variety. It is an officially recommended variety in 53 provinces and an authorized planting in an additional 13. It accounts for approximately 10% of all vineyard plantings in Italy with more than planted to one of the many clonal variation of the grape. Throughout Italy it is known under a variety of names including Brunello, Morellino, Nielluccio and Prugnolo Gentile. It is the main grape used in the popular red wines of Tuscany, where it is the solitary grape of Brunello di Montalcino and the primary component of the wines of Chianti, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and many \\"Super Tuscans\\". Outside Tuscany, it is found throughout central Italy where it places an important role in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wines of Montefalco Sagrantino secco and Torgiano Rosso Riserva in Umbria, Conero in Marche and the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines of Lazio and Rosso Piceno in Marche. Significant Sangiovese plantings can also be found outside central Italy in Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Valpolicella and as far south as Campania and Sicily. The intense fruit and deep color of Cabernet was shown to be well suited for blending with Sangiovese but banned in many Italian DOCs. In the 1970s, the rise of \\"Super Tuscans\\"-wines that eschew DOC regulation in favor of the lower classification of vino da tavola-increased the demand for more flexibility in the DOC laws. While the first DOC to be permitted to blend Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese was approved for Carmignano in 1975, most of Tuscany's premier wine regions were not permitted to blend Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese till the late 20th century. Tuscany A glass of Brunello di Montalcino. From the early to mid-20th century, the quality of Chianti was in low regard. DOC regulation that stipulate the relatively bland Trebbiano and Malvasia grapes needed to account for at least 10% of the finished blend, with consequent higher acidity and diluted flavours. Some wineries trucked in full bodied and jammy red wines from Sicily and Apulia to add color and alcohol to the blend‚Äîan illegal practice that did little to improve the quality of Chianti. From the 1970s through the 1980s, a revolution of sorts spread through Tuscany as the quality of the Sangiovese grape was rediscovered. Winemakers became more ambitious and willing to step outside DOC regulations to make 100% varietal Sangiovese or a \\"Super Tuscan\\" blend with Bordeaux varietals like Cabernet and Merlot. Today there is a broad range of style of Chianti reflecting the Sangiovese influence and winemaker's touch. Traditional Sangiovese emphasize herbal and bitter cherry notes, while more modern, Bordeaux-influenced wines have more plum and mulberry fruit with vanilla oak and spice. Stylistic and terroir based differences also emerge among the various sub-zones of the Chianti region. The ideal vineyard locations are found on south and southwest-facing slopes at altitudes between . In general, Sangiovese has a more difficult time fully ripening in the Chianti region than it does in the Montalcino and Maremma regions to the south. This is due to cooler nighttime temperatures and high propensity for rainfall in September and October that can affect harvest time. In the mid-19th century, a local farmer named Clemente Santi isolated certain plantings of Sangiovese vines in order to produce a 100% varietal wine that could be aged for a considerable period of time.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy, Italian Wines for Dummies, pg 159-161 Hungry Minds 2001 In 1888, his grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi‚Äîa veteran soldier who fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Risorgimento‚Äîreleased the first \\"modern version\\" of Brunello di Montalcino, which was aged for over a decade in large wood barrels. By the mid-20th century, this 100% varietal Sangiovese was eagerly being sought out by critics and wine drinkers alike.H. Johnson, Vintage: The Story of Wine, pg 423, Simon and Schuster 1989 The Montalcino region seems to have ideal conditions for ripening Sangiovese with the potential for full ripeness achievable even on north-facing slopes. These slopes tend to produce lighter and more elegant wines that then those made from vineyards on south and southwest facing slopes. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the Maremma region located in the southwest corner of Tuscany has seen vast expansion and a surge of investment from outside the region. The area is reliably warm with a shorter growing season. Sangiovese grown in the Maremma is capable of developing broad character but does have the potential of developing too much alcohol and not enough aroma compounds. Outside Tuscany Sangiovese can be made in a variety of styles, including the dessert wine Vin Santo. Sangiovese is considered the \\"workhorse\\" grape of central Italy, producing everything from everyday drinking to premium wines in a variety of styles-from red still wines, to rosato to sweet passito, semi- sparkling frizzante and the dessert wine Vin Santo. In northern Italy, the grape is a minor variety with it having difficulties ripening north of Emilia- Romagna. In the south, it is mainly used as a blending partner with the region's local grapes such as Primitivo, Montepulciano and Nero d'Avola. In the Romagna region of Emilia-Romagna, the same grape is called Sangiovese di Romagna and is widely planted in all the Romagna region east of Bologna. Like its neighboring Tuscan brother, Sangiovese di Romagna has shown itself to spring off a variety of clones that can produce a wide range of quality‚Äîfrom very poor to very fine. Viticulturists have worked with Romagna vines to produce new clonal varieties of high quality (most notably the clones R24 & T19). Sangiovese di Romagna adapts to different soil types, producing richer, more full bodied and tannic wines in the central provinces of Forl√¨ and Ravenna and lighter, fruitier wines in the western and eastern extremes of the regions near the border with Bologna and Marche. The grape seems to produce the highest quality wine in the sandstone and clay rich hills south of the Via Emilia near the Apennines which is covered by much of the Sangiovese di Romagna DOC zone. The higher summer time temperatures of this area gives more opportunity for Sangiovese to sufficiently ripen. The Sangiovese di Romagna DOC zone includes over of Sangiovese that produces on average 3.4 million U.S. gallons (130,000 hl) of wine a year. =Other Old World wine regions= In France, while some producers in the Languedoc are now experimenting with the variety, Sangiovese has a long history on the island of Corsica where it is known as Nielluccio. The grape was likely brought to the island sometime between 14th and 18th century when it was ruled by the Republic of Genoa. Here it is often blended with Sciaccarello and is a permitted grape in several Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC)s, most notable in Patrimonio, where it is used for both red and ros√© wine production. In 2008, there were of Sangiovese/Nielluccio on Corsica. In Greece, producers in the northeastern wine region of Drama in East Macedonia and Thrace are experimenting with oak- aged \\"Super Tuscan\\" style blends of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. Additional plantings of Sangiovese can be found in Israel, Malta, Turkey and Switzerland. =United States and Canada= Sangiovese grapes ripening during the period of veraison in Amador County, California. Italian immigrants brought Sangiovese to California in the late 19th century, possibly at the Seghesio Family's \\"Chianti Station,\\" near Geyserville. But it was never considered very important until the success of the Super Tuscans in the 1980s spurred new interest in the grape. In 1991, there were nearly planted with Sangiovese. By 2003, that number rose to nearly with plantings across the state, most notably in Napa Valley, Sonoma county, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and the Sierra Foothills. However, in recent years plantings of the variety have declined to by 2010. Early results in the late 20th century, were not very promising for California winemakers. Poor site and clonal selection had the grape planted in vineyards that gave it too much exposure to the sun, producing wines that had little in common with the wines of Tuscany. The Antinori family, which once owned Atlas Peak Vineyards located in the Atlas Peak AVA in the foothills of Napa Valley found that the greater intensity of sunlight in California may have been one possible factor for the poorer quality. Today the style of these Californian Sangiovese tend to be more fruit-driven than their Tuscan counterparts with some floral notes. Recent years have focused on improving vineyard site and clonal selection as well as giving the vines time to age and develop in quality. A California Sangiovese from Amador County in the Sierra Foothills. In Washington State, one of the first commercial plantings of Sangiovese was at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA. Today, winemakers are seeking out locations that can highlight the varietal character of Sangiovese. These young plantings in areas such as Walla Walla, Naches Heights AVA and Yakima Valley have so far produced wines with a spicy and tart cherry flavours, anise, red currants, and tobacco leaf notes.P. Gregutt, Washington Wines and Wineries: The Essential Guide, pg 74, University of California Press 2007 Like in California, plantings of Sangiovese in Washington have declined in recent years to in 2011. Other areas in the United States with sizable plantings of Sangiovese include the Rogue Valley and Umpqua AVA in Oregon, the Monticello in Virginia, the Sonoita AVA with 45 acres planted in Arizona, and Texas Hill Country in Texas.Appellation America \\"Sangiovese\\" Accessed: January 4th, 2009 In Canada, there are less than of Sangiovese planted, mostly in Ontario where some producers in Niagara- on-the-Lake are experimenting with ice wine versions of the grape. A small amount of the grape can also be found in British Columbia. =Other New World regions= A \\"Super Tuscan-style\\" Sangiovese blend from Washington State. Italian immigrants introduced the Sangiovese vine to Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th century. Early site and clonal selection was less than ideal and, like California and Australia, recent endeavors have focused on finding the best clones to use and the right vineyard locations. The grape is not widely planted in Argentina and the focus is mostly on the export market. In 2008 there were of Sangiovese planted, most of it in the Mendoza wine region with other isolated plantings in La Rioja and San Juan. Across the Andes range, Chilean winemakers have been experimenting with plantings with in 2008. Brazil reported of Sangiovese in 2007. The growing Mexican wine industry has also recently begun planting the vine. Sangiovese is becoming increasingly popular as a red wine grape in Australia, having been introduced by the CSIRO in the late 1960s.State Library of South Australia For many years, this single clone (H6V9) imported from the University of California-Davis, was the only available clone for Australian winemakers. The first large scale commercial planting of the grape was in the 1980s when Penfolds expanded their Kalimna vineyard in the Barossa Valley. As the availability of clones expanded (currently 10 available commercially as of 2011), so did plantings of Sangiovese with in 2008. As in California, Australian winemakers have begun seeking out the best vineyard location for the grape and being more selective in which clones are planted. Some regions that have shown promise for the grape include the Karridale and Margaret River areas of Western Australia; Langhorne Creek , Strathalbyn and Port Lincoln in South Australia; Canberra and Young in New South Wales; Stanthorpe in Queensland and the western edge of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. In New Zealand, the first varietal version of Sangiovese was released in 1998 and today there are of the grape planted, mostly on the North Island around Auckland. A small amount of Sangiovese is grown in South Africa with reported in 2008, mostly in the Stellenbosch and Darling regions. About 10 wineries make Sangiovese  Wines  A Rosso di Montalcino made from 100% Sangiovese in the Brunello di Montalcino region. Wines made from Sangiovese tend to exhibit the grape's naturally high acidity as well as moderate to high tannin content and light color. Blending can have a pronounced effect on enhancing or tempering the wine's quality. The dominant nature of Cabernet can sometimes have a disproportionate influence on the wine, even overwhelming Sangiovese character with black cherry, black currant, mulberry and plum fruit. Even percentages as low as 4 to 5% of Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm the Sangiovese if the fruit quality is not high. As the wine ages, some of these Cabernet dominant flavours can soften and reveal more Sangiovese character.E. Goldstein, Perfect Pairings, pg 176-180, University of California Press 2006 Different regions will impart varietal character on the wine with Tuscan Sangiovese having a distinctive bitter-sweet component of cherry, violets and tea. In their youth, Tuscan Sangiovese can have tomato-savoriness to it that enhances its herbal component. Californian examples tend to have more bright, red fruit flavours with some Zinfandel-like spice or darker fruits depending on the proportion of Cabernet blended in. Argentine examples showing a hybrid between the Tuscan and California Sangiovese with juicy red fruit wines that end on a bitter cherry note. Sangiovese based wines have the potential to age but the vast majority of Sangiovese wines are intended to be consumed relatively early in their lives. The wines with the longest aging potential are the Super Tuscans and Brunello di Montalcino wines that can age for upwards of 20 years in ideal vintages. These premium examples may need 5 to 10 years to develop before they drink well. The potentially lighter Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Carmignano and Rosso di Montalcino tend to open earlier (around 5 years of age) but have a shorter life span of 8 to 10 years. The aging potential of Chianti is highly variable, depending on the producer, vintage and sub-zone of the Chianti region it is produced in. Basic Chianti is meant to be consumed within 3 to 4 years after vintage while top examples of Chianti Classico Riserva can last for upwards of 15 years. New World Sangiovese has so far, shown a relatively short window of drinkability with most examples best consumed with 3 to 4 years after harvest with some basic examples of Argentine Sangiovese having the potential to only improve for a year after bottling. With food Sangiovese's high acidity and moderate alcohol makes it a very food-friendly wine when it comes to food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and pur√©ed bean soup. Synonyms Over the years, Sangiovese has been known under a variety of synonyms, many of which have come to be associated with a particular clone of the grape variety. Among the synonyms recognized for the grape are: Brunelletto (in the Grosseto region of Tuscany), Brunello, Brunello di Montalcino, Cacchiano (in Tuscany), Calabrese (in Tuscany), Cardisco, Chiantino (in Tuscany), Cordisio, Corinto nero (on the island of Lipari in Sicily), Dolcetto Precoce, Guarnacciola (in the Benevento region of Campania), Ingannacane, Lambrusco Mendoza (in Tuscany), Maglioppa, Montepulciano, Morellino, Morellone, Negrello (in Calabria), Negretta, Nerello (in Sicily), Nerello Campotu (in Calabria), Nerino, Niella (in Corsica), Nielluccia, Nielluccio (in Corsica), Pigniuolo Rosso, Pignolo, Plant Romain, Primaticcio, Prugnolo, Prugnolo Dolce (in Tuscany), Prugnolo di Montepulciano, Prugnolo Gentile, Prugnolo Gentile di Montepulciano, Puttanella (in Calabria), Riminese, Rosso di Montalcino, San Gioveto, San Zoveto (in Tuscany), Sancivetro, Sangineto, Sangiogheto (in Tuscany), Sangiovese dal Cannello Lungo, Sangiovese di Lamole, Sangiovese di Romagna, Sangiovese Dolce, Sangiovese Gentile, Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese Nostrano, Sangiovese Piccolo, Sangiovese Toscano, Sangioveto (in Tuscany), Sangioveto dell'Elba, Sangioveto Dolce, Sangioveto Grosso, Sangioveto Montanino, Sanvincetro, Sanzoveto, Tabernello, Tignolo, Tipsa, Toustain (in Algeria), Tuccanese (in Apulia), Uva Abruzzi, Uva Tosca, Uvetta, Uva brunella, Uva Canina, Vigna del Conte (in Calabria) and Vigna Maggio (in Tuscany).

He is known for his virtuosic arrangements of sacred music for the piano. Biography Dino was born in New York City and attended Glad Tidings Tabernacle. He began playing his grandmother's piano at the age of three. The first song he had learned was \\"At the Cross.\\" He was enrolled in piano lessons at age five. Dino received his professional training at The King's College as well as the Juilliard School of Music. For many years he served as pianist for the evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman. Dino has traveled extensively and produced well over 50 recordings on his own as well as mainstream labels. He has worked with various other evangelists. Dino has hosted two television shows, the \\"Dino and Debby Show\\" in the 1970s with his first wife Deborah Keener and \\"The Dino Show\\" which formerly aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Dino has described his style as combining the classical and the sacred. His technique has been described as fluid and brilliant and he has been termed the \\"Christian Liberace\\" because of his flair, costumes, pianos and jewelry. Many of his works are religious-based or contemporary arrangements of classical works. Dino also performs in his own show in Branson, Missouri. Among his accomplishments is production of what is known as the \\"Peace Series\\", a collection of CDs featuring more subdued piano arrangements against a backdrop of nature sounds. Dino performed at Carnegie Hall on December 15, 2005. He has participated in an auction benefiting Music Cares, a charitable organization that helps struggling musicians and entertainers. Dino received a participation Grammy Award in 1999 for his work on the soundtrack of the movie The Apostle. Personal life In 1974, Dino married his first wife, Deborah Keener, and together they have a daughter, Christina (who is now a singer- songwriter and producer, and goes by the stage name Sugar Dame). After touring as Dino & Debby, the two divorced in 1981. In 1986, Dino married his second and current wife, Cheryl, who is the sister of Gospel music singer, Gary McSpadden, formerly of The Imperials and the Gaither Vocal Band. Cheryl has a daughter from a previous marriage. In 2007 Dino and his wife Cheryl opened a bakery in Branson, MO called Dino's Cake & Coffee Co. (Formally Dino's 24 Karrot Cake Company) Dino remarked that baking was his passion second only to performing his music. They are a major supplier to the Neiman Marcus stores and caf√©s. In 2011 Dino and his wife Cheryl lost their home during a flood in the Branson, Missouri area. Dino lost all of his possessions such as his grand show pianos as well as all of his costumes, industry memorabilia and awards. The Kartsonakis' then started helping the community by doing fundraising concerts to help other victims rebuild their lives and homes.

It resembles the French portable anti-tank launcher 89 mm LRAC F1. It consists of the launcher, a CN-6 sighting piece, rocket and carrying case for the rocket. The M79 shoots unguided projectiles in direct sight and is effective against armoured fighting vehicles and fortifications. Operation The CN-6 aim-sight The M79 Osa is operated by a two-man team, an operator and a loader. The loader inserts the rocket container through the rear of the launcher. The operator then takes aim at the target through the CN-6 sight. The CN-6 sight has 3.5x magnification and a 10 degree field of view. It also features anti-laser filters to protect the operator from blinding battlefield lasers. When the trigger is pressed, the rocket motor is fired electronically. The rocket leaves the launcher at a speed of approximately 250 meters per second. It is accurate enough to be used against armoured vehicles at a range of 350 meters, and can engage larger stationary targets up to 600 meters away. On impact a piezoelectric impact fuse in the rocket triggers the shaped charge warhead, which can penetrate up to 400 millimeters of armour. The fuse is sensitive enough to trigger the warhead at impact angles up to 70 degrees from the vertical. After firing, the spent rocket container is removed from the launcher, and a fresh tube is attached. Operational history The M79 Osa was designed and manufactured by Sloboda ƒåaƒçak in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It has continued production in Serbia, North Macedonia, and in Croatia as the RL90 M95. A large number of M79 OSA rocket launchers have been supplied to rebels in Syria which have been proven effective in deterring the Syrian Army's armor. Many have mistaken the M79 supplied to the rebels in Syria for the Russian RPG-29 rocket launcher, which is also seeing use.\\"Weapons from former Yugoslavia Spread Through Syria's War New York Times 7 May 2013.

They were discovered by Yoichiro Nambu in particle physics within the context of the BCS superconductivity mechanism, and subsequently elucidated by Jeffrey Goldstone, and systematically generalized in the context of quantum field theory. In condensed matter physics such bosons are quasiparticles and are known as Anderson-Bogoliubov modes. These spinless bosons correspond to the spontaneously broken internal symmetry generators, and are characterized by the quantum numbers of these. They transform nonlinearly (shift) under the action of these generators, and can thus be excited out of the asymmetric vacuum by these generators. Thus, they can be thought of as the excitations of the field in the broken symmetry directions in group space‚Äîand are massless if the spontaneously broken symmetry is not also broken explicitly. If, instead, the symmetry is not exact, i.e. if it is explicitly broken as well as spontaneously broken, then the Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons are not massless, though they typically remain relatively light; they are then called pseudo-Goldstone bosons or pseudo-Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons (abbreviated PNGBs). Goldstone's theorem Goldstone's theorem examines a generic continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken; i.e., its currents are conserved, but the ground state is not invariant under the action of the corresponding charges. Then, necessarily, new massless (or light, if the symmetry is not exact) scalar particles appear in the spectrum of possible excitations. There is one scalar particle‚Äîcalled a Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson‚Äîfor each generator of the symmetry that is broken, i.e., that does not preserve the ground state. The Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone mode is a long-wavelength fluctuation of the corresponding order parameter. By virtue of their special properties in coupling to the vacuum of the respective symmetry-broken theory, vanishing momentum (\\"soft\\") Goldstone bosons involved in field-theoretic amplitudes make such amplitudes vanish (\\"Adler zeros\\"). Examples=Natural= *In fluids, the phonon is longitudinal and it is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken Galilean symmetry. In solids, the situation is more complicated; the Goldstone bosons are the longitudinal and transverse phonons and they happen to be the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken Galilean, translational, and rotational symmetry with no simple one-to-one correspondence between the Goldstone modes and the broken symmetries. *In magnets, the original rotational symmetry (present in the absence of an external magnetic field) is spontaneously broken such that the magnetization points into a specific direction. The Goldstone bosons then are the magnons, i.e., spin waves in which the local magnetization direction oscillates. *The pions are the pseudo- Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral- flavor symmetries of QCD effected by quark condensation due to the strong interaction. These symmetries are further explicitly broken by the masses of the quarks, so that the pions are not massless, but their mass is significantly smaller than typical hadron masses. *The longitudinal polarization components of the W and Z bosons correspond to the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken part of the electroweak symmetry SU(2)‚äóU(1), which, however, are not observable.In theories with gauge symmetry, the Goldstone bosons are absent. Their degrees of freedom are absorbed (\\"eaten\\", gauged out) by gauge bosons, through the Higgs mechanism. The latter become massive and their new, longitudinal polarization is provided by the would-be Goldstone boson, in an elaborate rearrangement of degrees of freedom . Because this symmetry is gauged, the three would-be Goldstone bosons are absorbed by the three gauge bosons corresponding to the three broken generators; this gives these three gauge bosons a mass, and the associated necessary third polarization degree of freedom. This is described in the Standard Model through the Higgs mechanism. An analogous phenomenon occurs in superconductivity, which served as the original source of inspiration for Nambu, namely, the photon develops a dynamical mass (expressed as magnetic flux exclusion from a superconductor), cf. the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory. =Theory= Consider a complex scalar field , with the constraint that , a constant. One way to impose a constraint of this sort is by including a potential interaction term in its Lagrangian density, :\\\\lambda(\\\\phi^*\\\\phi - v^2)^2 ~, and taking the limit as . This is called the \\"Abelian nonlinear œÉ-model\\". It corresponds to the Goldstone sombrero potential where the tip and the sides shoot to infinity, preserving the location of the minimum at its base. The constraint, and the action, below, are invariant under a U(1) phase transformation, . The field can be redefined to give a real scalar field (i.e., a spin-zero particle) without any constraint by :\\\\phi = v e^{i\\\\theta} where is the Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson (actually is), and the U(1) symmetry transformation effects a shift on , namely : \\\\delta \\\\theta = \\\\epsilon ~, but does not preserve the ground state (i.e. the above infinitesimal transformation does not annihilate it‚Äîthe hallmark of invariance), as evident in the charge of the current below. Thus, the vacuum is degenerate and noninvariant under the action of the spontaneously broken symmetry. The corresponding Lagrangian density is given by :{\\\\mathcal L}=-\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\phi^*)\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi +m^2 \\\\phi^* \\\\phi = -\\\\frac{1}{2}(-iv e^{-i\\\\theta} \\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\theta)(iv e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\theta) + m^2 v^2 , and thus :: =-\\\\frac{v^2}{2}(\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\theta)(\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\theta) + m^2 v^2~. Note that the constant term in the Lagrangian density has no physical significance, and the other term in it is simply the kinetic term for a massless scalar. The symmetry-induced conserved U(1) current is : J_\\\\mu = -v^2 \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\theta ~. The charge, Q, resulting from this current shifts and the ground state to a new, degenerate, ground state. Thus, a vacuum with will shift to a different vacuum with . The current connects the original vacuum with the Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson state, . In general, in a theory with several scalar fields, , the Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone mode is massless, and parameterises the curve of possible (degenerate) vacuum states. Its hallmark under the broken symmetry transformation is nonvanishing vacuum expectation , an order parameter, for vanishing , at some ground state 0„Äâ chosen at the minimum of the potential, . Symmetry dictates that all variations of the potential with respect to the fields in all symmetry directions vanish. The vacuum value of the first order variation in any direction vanishes as just seen; while the vacuum value of the second order variation must also vanish, as follows. Vanishing vacuum values of field symmetry transformation increments add no new information. By contrast, however, nonvanishing vacuum expectations of transformation increments, , specify the relevant (Goldstone) null eigenvectors of the mass matrix, and hence the corresponding zero-mass eigenvalues.  Goldstone's argument  The principle behind Goldstone's argument is that the ground state is not unique. Normally, by current conservation, the charge operator for any symmetry current is time-independent, :{d\\\\over dt} Q = {d\\\\over dt} \\\\int_x J^0(x) =0. Acting with the charge operator on the vacuum either annihilates the vacuum, if that is symmetric; else, if not, as is the case in spontaneous symmetry breaking, it produces a zero-frequency state out of it, through its shift transformation feature illustrated above. Actually, here, the charge itself is ill-defined, cf. the Fabri‚ÄìPicasso argument below. But its better behaved commutators with fields, that is, the nonvanishing transformation shifts , are, nevertheless, time-invariant, :\\\\frac{d \\\\langle \\\\delta \\\\phi_g \\\\rangle }{dt} = 0, thus generating a in its Fourier transform. Scholarpedia proof (This ensures that, inserting a complete set of intermediate states in a nonvanishing current commutator can lead to vanishing time-evolution only when one or more of these states is massless.) Thus, if the vacuum is not invariant under the symmetry, action of the charge operator produces a state which is different from the vacuum chosen, but which has zero frequency. This is a long-wavelength oscillation of a field which is nearly stationary: there are physical states with zero frequency, , so that the theory cannot have a mass gap. This argument is further clarified by taking the limit carefully. If an approximate charge operator acting in a huge but finite region is applied to the vacuum, :{d\\\\over dt} Q_A = {d\\\\over dt} \\\\int_x e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2A^2}} J^0(x) = -\\\\int_x e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2A^2}} abla \\\\cdot J = \\\\int_x abla \\\\left (e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2A^2}} \\\\right ) \\\\cdot J, a state with approximately vanishing time derivative is produced, :\\\\left \\\\ {d\\\\over dt} Q_A 0\\\\rangle \\\\right \\\\ \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\left \\\\ Q_A0\\\\rangle\\\\right \\\\. Assuming a nonvanishing mass gap , the frequency of any state like the above, which is orthogonal to the vacuum, is at least , : \\\\left \\\\ \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\theta\\\\rangle \\\\right \\\\ = \\\\ H \\\\theta\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\ge m_0 \\\\\\\\theta\\\\rangle \\\\. Letting become large leads to a contradiction. Consequently 0 = 0\\\\. However this argument fails when the symmetry is gauged, because then the symmetry generator is only performing a gauge transformation. A gauge transformed state is the same exact state, so that acting with a symmetry generator does not get one out of the vacuum.See Higgs mechanism. :Fabri‚ÄìPicasso Theorem. does not properly exist in the Hilbert space, unless . The argumentFabri, E and Picasso, L E (1966), \\"Quantum Field Theory and Approximate Symmetries\\", Phys. Rev. Lett. 16 (1966) 408 requires both the vacuum and the charge to be translationally invariant, , . Consider the correlation function of the charge with itself, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\langle 0 QQ 0\\\\rangle &= \\\\int d^3x \\\\langle0j_0(x) Q0\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int d^3x \\\\left \\\\langle 0 \\\\left e^{iPx} j_0(0) e^{-iPx} Q \\\\right 0 \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int d^3x \\\\left \\\\langle 0 \\\\left  e^{iPx} j_0(0) e^{-iPx} Q e^{iPx} e^{-iPx} \\\\right  0 \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int d^3x \\\\left \\\\langle 0 \\\\left  j_0(0) Q \\\\right 0 \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} so the integrand in the right hand side does not depend on the position. Thus, its value is proportional to the total space volume, \\\\Q0\\\\rangle \\\\^2 = \\\\infty  unless the symmetry is unbroken, . Consequently, does not properly exist in the Hilbert space.  Infraparticles  There is an arguable loophole in the theorem. If one reads the theorem carefully, it only states that there exist non-vacuum states with arbitrarily small energies. Take for example a chiral N = 1 super QCD model with a nonzero squark VEV which is conformal in the IR. The chiral symmetry is a global symmetry which is (partially) spontaneously broken. Some of the \\"Goldstone bosons\\" associated with this spontaneous symmetry breaking are charged under the unbroken gauge group and hence, these composite bosons have a continuous mass spectrum with arbitrarily small masses but yet there is no Goldstone boson with exactly zero mass. In other words, the Goldstone bosons are infraparticles.  Nonrelativistic theories  A version of Goldstone's theorem also applies to nonrelativistic theories (and also relativistic theories with spontaneously broken spacetime symmetries, such as Lorentz symmetry or conformal symmetry, rotational, or translational invariance). It essentially states that, for each spontaneously broken symmetry, there corresponds some quasiparticle with no energy gapthe nonrelativistic version of the mass gap. (Note that the energy here is really and not .) However, two different spontaneously broken generators may now give rise to the same Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson. For example, in a superfluid, both the U(1) particle number symmetry and Galilean symmetry are spontaneously broken. However, the phonon is the Goldstone boson for both. In general, the phonon is effectively the Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson for spontaneously broken Galilean/Lorentz symmetry. However, in contrast to the case of internal symmetry breaking, when spacetime symmetries are broken, the order parameter need not be a scalar field, but may be a tensor field, and the corresponding independent massless modes may now be fewer than the number of spontaneously broken generators, because the Goldstone modes may now be linearly dependent among themselves: e.g., the Goldstone modes for some generators might be expressed as gradients of Goldstone modes for other broken generators.  Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone fermions  Spontaneously broken global fermionic symmetries, which occur in some supersymmetric models, lead to Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone fermions, or goldstinos. These have spin ¬Ω, instead of 0, and carry all quantum numbers of the respective supersymmetry generators broken spontaneously. Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking smashes up (\\"reduces\\") supermultiplet structures into the characteristic nonlinear realizations of broken supersymmetry, so that goldstinos are superpartners of all particles in the theory, of any spin, and the only superpartners, at that. That is, to say, two non-goldstino particles are connected to only goldstinos through supersymmetry transformations, and not to each other, even if they were so connected before the breaking of supersymmetry. As a result, the masses and spin multiplicities of such particles are then arbitrary.

The U(1)B‚ÄìL symmetry is assumed to be global so that the majoron is not \\"eaten up\\" by the gauge boson and spontaneously broken. Majorons were originally formulated in four dimensions by Y. Chikashige, R. N. Mohapatra and R. D. Peccei to understand neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism and are being searched for in the neutrino-less double beta decay process. There are theoretical extensions of this idea into supersymmetric theories and theories involving extra compactified dimensions. By propagating through the extra spatial dimensions the detectable number of majoron creation events vary accordingly. Mathematically, majorons may be modeled by allowing them to propagate through a material while all other Standard Model forces are fixed to an orbifold point.

Jacks initially worked at the West End YMCA in Toronto but in 1948 was asked to become director of parks and recreation for the city of North Bay, Ontario. He was instrumental in developing the first Northern Ontario Playground Hockey Association (NOPHA) which encouraged youth to play hockey on outdoor rinks. Jacks's most well known achievement was his invention of the sport of ringette. Ringette was created to both address and remedy two ongoing problems: the observation and criticism regarding the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA)'s tendency to place most of its time, resources, and focus on running sports programs aimed at the male population to the exclusion of the female population, and the association's continual lack of success in gaining and maintaining participation in the two winter based team sports available to girls at that time: broomball and girls ice hockey.

He was the first to discover that distant galaxies are redshifted, thus providing the first empirical basis for the expansion of the universe.Physics ArXiv preprintPhysics ArXiv preprint He was also the first to relate these redshifts to velocity. Biography Slipher was born in Mulberry, Indiana, and completed his doctorate at Indiana University in 1909. He spent his entire career at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, where he was promoted to assistant director in 1915, acting director in 1916, and finally director from 1926 until his retirement in 1952. His brother Earl C. Slipher was also an astronomer and a director at the Lowell Observatory. Slipher used spectroscopy to investigate the rotation periods of planets and the composition of planetary atmospheres. In 1912, he was the first to observe the shift of spectral lines of galaxies, making him the discoverer of galactic redshifts.Slipher first reports on the making the first Doppler measurement on September 17, 1912 in The radial velocity of the Andromeda Nebula in the inaugural volume of the Lowell Observatory Bulletin, pp.2.56-2.57. In his report Slipher writes: \\"The magnitude of this velocity, which is the greatest hitherto observed, raises the question whether the velocity-like displacement might not be due to some other cause, but I believe we have at present no other interpretation for it.\\" Three years later, Slipher wrote a review in the journal Popular Astronomy, Vol. 23, p. 21-24 Spectrographic Observations of Nebulae, in which he states, \\"The early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of - 300 km(/s) showed the means then available, capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well.\\" Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebula spread across the entire celestial sphere, all but three having observable \\"positive\\" (that is recessional) velocities. In 1914, Slipher also made the first discovery of the rotation of spiral galaxies. He discovered the sodium layer in 1929. He was responsible for hiring Clyde Tombaugh and supervised the work that led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930. Edwin Hubble is often incorrectly credited with discovering the redshift of galaxies;This had actually been observed by Vesto Slipher in the 1910s, but the discovery went unnoticed. Ref: Slipher (1917): Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., 56, 403. these measurements and their significance were understood before 1917 by James Edward Keeler (Lick & Allegheny), Vesto Melvin Slipher (Lowell), and William Wallace Campbell (Lick) at other observatories. Combining his own measurements of galaxy distances with Vesto Slipher's measurements of the redshifts associated with the galaxies, Hubble and Milton Humason discovered a rough proportionality of the objects' distances with their redshifts. This redshift- distance correlation, today termed Hubble‚ÄìLema√Ætre's law (formerly named as Hubble's law, the IAU Decision of October 2018 recommends the use of a new name) , was formulated by Hubble and Humason in 1929 and became the basis for the modern model of the expanding universe. Slipher died in Flagstaff, Arizona and is buried there in Citizens Cemetery.

The facility was built in 1991 and was originally owned and operated jointly by the city of Memphis and Shelby County; Shelby County sold its share to Memphis in April 2009.McMillin, Zack. Once filled to the rafters, Pyramid sits empty as its future is debated. Memphis Commercial Appeal, Sunday, May 10, 2009. Its structure plays on the city's namesake in Egypt, known for its ancient pyramids. It is (about 32 stories) tall and has base sides of ; it is by some measures the tenth-tallest pyramid in the world. The Memphis Pyramid has not been regularly used as a sports or entertainment venue since 2004. In 2015, the Pyramid re-opened as a Bass Pro Shops \\"megastore\\", which includes shopping, a hotel, restaurants, a bowling alley, and an archery range, with an outdoor observation deck adjacent to its apex. Construction The \\"Great American Pyramid\\" was conceived originally by Mark C. Hartz, a Memphis artist in about 1954. The project originally included three pyramids located on the south bluffs of Memphis overlooking the Mississippi River. The largest of the three would have been scaled at two-thirds the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza near Memphis, Egypt; the flanking structures would have been scaled at two-thirds the size of the main pyramid. The project languished for three decades until Mark's younger son, Memphian Jon Brent Hartz, resurrected the concept. Mark C. Hartz, who was well known for his architectural renderings, rendered a new bronze glass-glazed pyramid. After years of negotiations, the younger Hartz's concept was adopted by entrepreneur John Tigrett as a symbol for the city of Memphis. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 15, 1989, and the building was opened on November 9, 1991. The construction of the building was managed by Sidney Shlenker, part owner of the Denver Nuggets and several entertainment companies, who Tigrett had brought to Memphis to develop tourist attractions in the building. Originally, there were plans for a shortwave radio station broadcasting Memphis music, an observation deck with an inclinator along the side of the building, a Hard Rock Cafe, a music museum, and a theme park on Mud Island along with other things. However, the plans were scrapped because of a fallout between Tigrett and Shlenker and the latter's financial difficulties. Various former uses and events The Pyramid was the home court for the University of Memphis men's basketball program, and later for the National Basketball Association's Memphis Grizzlies. However, both teams left The Pyramid in November 2004 to move into the newly built FedExForum. It was also home to the Memphis Pharaohs of the AFL. The arena hosted the 1993 Great Midwest Conference Men's and Women's basketball tournaments, the 1994 and 1997 Southeastern Conference men's basketball tournament, the 1996 and 2000 Conference USA men's basketball tournament, and the 2003 Conference USA women's basketball tournament. It also held the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament in 1995, 1997, and 2001. The Grateful Dead played 2 shows on April 1&2 1995. Singer Mary J. Blige performed at the arena in September 1997 during her Share My World Tour. The Pyramid was the site in 1999 of the WWF St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House pay-per-view; also in 1999 the rock bands the Rolling Stones and Phish played sold-out concerts. It also hosted the boxing mega-fight between Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson in 2002, which Lewis won by a knockout in the eighth round. From 2002 to 2006, the annual Church of God in Christ international holy convocations were held here. In 2002, the arena hosted a concert, commemorating the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death. Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band performed what is reputed to be the last concert ever in the Pyramid, on February 3, 2007. Filmmaker Craig Brewer used the building as a sound stage for his film Black Snake Moan in late 2005. Troubles and closure The vacant Pyramid pictured in 2010. On the Pyramid's opening night, the arena floor flooded because of inadequate drainage pumps, forcing stage hands to sandbag the entire perimeter to preserve the electrical that runs under the stage. In 2001, the city of Memphis looked to lure either the Grizzlies or the Charlotte Hornets to town. While the Pyramid was functional and profitable, it would have required retrofitting in order to be a viable long-term venue for an NBA franchise. A retrofit would also have required taking the arena offline for a year. As a result, the $250 million FedExForum was built as a condition of the Grizzlies move from Vancouver and opened in 2004. The city of Memphis did spend $7 million on renovations such as improved dressing rooms and new television camera platforms for the Grizzlies' three-year stay in the arena. While hosting the Grizzlies, the arena lost $200,000 in 2002. The City of Memphis's contract with the Grizzlies forbade the use of The Pyramid without the team's approval, and as a result, it went dark. The Memphis city council voted to keep the arena open in 2004. A committee headed by Memphis businessman Scott Ledbetter studied possible uses of the arena in 2005, and considered such uses as converting the arena into a casino, an aquarium, a shopping mall, or an indoor theme park. In November 2006, Congressman-Elect Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) suggested that he would attempt to open a \\"Mid-American branch\\" of the Smithsonian Institution in the building. However, these plans were never realized. In the end, the Ledbetter committee on the building's future recommended that it be used for \\"destination retail\\" which would create more jobs and new tax revenues. Bass Pro Shops and redevelopment Interior of the Pyramid on Bass Pro Shops' opening day In October 2005, media speculation began to focus on an aquarium or a Bass Pro Shops superstore as the most likely long-term tenants of the arena. In 2008, the city and Bass Pro Shops reached a \\"tentative\\" agreement, short on details, but based on an intent to develop the then-abandoned structure. On June 30, 2010, after 5 years of negotiating, Bass Pro Shops and the City of Memphis signed an agreement for a 55-year lease for a Bass Pro Shops megastore. In addition, the redevelopment plans include revitalizing the Pinch District, which is the neighborhood east of the Pyramid. The city invested $30 million and hired O.T. Marshall Architects to help with the seismic retrofitting of the structure which was funded by sales tax revenue in the surrounding area. O.T. Marshall and Insight Design Architects was later hired by Bass Pro Shops for its renovations and construction, leading to its opening April 29, 2015. Construction was completed by W.G. Yates & Sons Construction Company. In addition to the retail store itself, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid is home to an archery range, shooting range, and laser arcade. The building also includes an Uncle Buck's Fishbowl and Grill with a bowling alley and a saltwater aquarium. The tallest freestanding elevator in America takes visitors to The Lookout at the Pyramid at the apex of the building, where they can take in the view on an indoor and outdoor observation deck or dine and drink at the \\"Sky High Catfish Cabin\\", a restaurant, bar, and aquarium at the top of the building. At the base of the Pyramid is a 100-room hotel known as the Big Cypress Lodge. Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid contains 600,000 gallons of water features and the largest collection of waterfowl and hunting-related equipment in the world. One million people visited Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid between the grand opening in April 2015 and July 8, 2015. Due in part to this large success, Bass Pro Shops is considering adding a zip-line and a second hotel to the Pyramid.

In 1927 he discovered that nebulium was not really a chemical element but instead doubly ionized oxygen. Life and work Bowen was born in Seneca Falls, New York in 1898 to Philinda Sprague and James Bowen. Due to frequent moves of his family he was home schooled until the death of his father in 1908. From that point on he attended the Houghton College where his mother worked as teacher. After graduation from high school in 1915 Bowen stayed at the junior college of Houghton College and later joined Oberlin College from which he graduated in 1919. During the time at Oberlin College Bowen did some research on the properties of steel together with the scientist Robert Hadfield. The results were published in 1921. Bowen started studying physics at the University of Chicago in fall 1919. Already in 1921 Bowen took a position in the research group of Robert Andrews Millikan. He was assigned to do ultraviolet spectroscopy of chemical elements. Millikan was persuaded by George Ellery Hale to move to the California Institute of Technology in 1921 and Bowen moved with him. The contact with Hale enabled Bowen also to work at the Mount Wilson Observatory and the Palomar Observatory. Bowen gave lectures on general physics at Caltech and did research on cosmic rays and followed his studies on UV spectroscopy. He also did calculations on spectra for the light elements of the periodic table. With that data and the inspiration from a chapter on gaseous nebula and the emission of radiation at low density in the book Astronomy by Henry Norris Russell, Raymond Smith Dugan and John Quincy Stewart he achieved his best known discovery. The green emission lines of the Cat's Eye Nebula at 4959 and 5007 √Öngstr√∂m were discovered by William Huggins in 1864. Because no known element was showing these emission lines in the experiment it was concluded in the late 1890s that a new element was responsible for that lines, it was called nebulium. Bowen was able to calculate the forbidden transitions of doubly ionized oxygen to be exactly where the lines had been found. The low probability for collisions in the nebula made it impossible for the oxygen to get from the excited stated to the ground state and so the forbidden transitions were the main path for the relaxation. Bowen published his findings in 1927 and concluded that nebulium was not really a chemical element. Bowen was the first director of the Palomar Observatory, serving from 1948 to 1964. Before his retirement in 1964 and even afterwards Bowen was involved in the improvement of the optical design of several large optical instruments, for example the 100 inch Irenee duPont at the Las Campanas Observatory. He is also known in the context of meteorology for the introduction of the Bowen ratio, which quantifies the ratio of sensible to latent heat over an evaporating surface.

The album's first single was \\"What Would You Say\\", featuring John Popper of Blues Traveler on harmonica. Two other singles from the album followed, \\"Ants Marching\\" and \\"Satellite\\". By March 16, 2000, the album had sold six million copies, and was certified 6√ó platinum by the RIAA. Recording The acoustic guitar tracks on the album were played by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. During the recording sessions, Matthews and Reynolds would sit face-to-face with a piece of glass between them, playing the same guitar part. This was done twice for each song, resulting in four acoustic guitar tracks (two from Matthews, two from Reynolds) all playing the same part on each song. Producer Steve Lillywhite frequently turned the volume down on Matthews' parts and turned the volume up on Reynolds' parts, resulting in Reynolds' guitar playing being more prominent on the final album. Reynolds then overdubbed additional acoustic and electric guitar parts.Rodgers, Jeffrey Pepper (1999). \\"Band in a Box\\", Acoustic Guitar, String Letter Publishing, 1999. Matthews has stated during performances that the harmonica solo performed by John Popper on \\"What Would You Say\\" was done in only five to ten minutes, while Matthews was in the bathroom. One of Dave Matthews Band's most popular live songs, \\"Granny\\", was recorded in the studio sessions for this album and was originally intended to be the first single before being cut from the album. \\"#34\\" is the only instrumental track on the album although it was played live with lyrics on nine occasions in 1993, prior to the band taking it to the studio. The band originally recorded the song with lyrics, but they were removed from the final album cut. On some pressings of the album there are 22 blank tracks between \\"Pay for What You Get\\" and \\"#34\\", so that the latter appears as track number 34. Other pressings simply have the 12th track pre-pended by a period of silence. The album's title comes from a lyric of the song \\"Ants Marching\\": \\"He remembers being small / playing under the table and dreaming\\". The album was dedicated \\"In memory of Anne\\" for Matthews' older sister Anne, who was killed by her husband in 1994 in a murder‚Äìsuicide. Included in the jewel case packet is a picture of Dave Matthews and one of Anne's children. Track listingSongs cut from the album Songs that were recorded during the sessions, but weren't included on the final cut: *\\"Granny\\" ‚Äì Matthews wanted this to be the band's first single, but the song never made it to any of the studio albums; nonetheless, the song remains a strong fan favorite and is played to this day, also appearing on 19 live releases by the band. A studio version of this track is included on the 2014 reissue of the album. *\\"Say Goodbye\\" ‚Äì More than likely not recorded during a full-band session. The song was later released on the next album, Crash. *\\"Let You Down\\" ‚Äì Was probably the only original song written in the studio, although it may have not even made a demo. The song was also later released on the next album, Crash. *\\"Get in Line\\" ‚Äì the song was played regularly during the 1994 support tour for the album, but later was abandoned by the band completely. *\\"Kind Intentions\\" (also known as #32) ‚Äì the song first appeared as a demo recording, made by the band in 1991‚Äì1993, but never appeared as a studio version or a full song during the known live performances.

He is also the first South Korean footballer to score in the history of the UEFA Champions League, during his time at Anderlecht.  Club career = Career in Belgium = In July 2000, Seol joined a Belgian club Royal Antwerp, and became the first South Korean footballer who scored double digits in a European league during a season since Cha Bum-kun. After a successful season with Royal Antwerp, he moved to Anderlecht. He scored a hat- trick in the space of 12 minutes in the 2001 Belgian Super Cup, and he scored the first South Korea goal of the qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. He also won the 2003‚Äì04 First Division with Anderlecht. = Wolverhampton Wanderers = In August 2004, Seol moved to England, joining Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Wolverhampton coach at the time, Glenn Hoddle, preferred Seol as one of his first-choice forwards, using him in various roles including striker, attacking midfielder and winger of both sides. Disappointed with the failure of Wolves to win promotion from the Championship, Seol sought a move to the Premier League following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, despite having two years of his contract left. He was reported as saying \\"At this stage, I'm frustrated not to be in the Premiership. I think there will be some good news after the World Cup.\\" =Reading= Seol eventually joined newly promoted Premier League club Reading on 12 July 2006 for a reported transfer fee of ¬£1.5 million. On 16 September 2006, he scored his first Premiership goal as Reading won 2‚Äì1 at Sheffield United. On 1 October 2006, he scored his second goal for Reading against West Ham United, proving to be only goal of the match. He was voted by Reading fans as the official Player of the Month for August 2006 by showing great performances early in the season, and was ranked 11th in the player rankings of the Premier League after the seventh round. His third goal for Reading, his first at home, came on 18 November 2006 in the 2‚Äì0 win against Charlton Athletic. He scored his fourth goal against Blackburn Rovers, the last game of the season. =Fulham= Seol left Reading for Fulham on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract, with Liam Rosenior going the other way. Reading boss Steve Coppell admitted that strained relations between him and Seol led to the move. He did not score his first goal for Fulham during his first season. On 16 August 2008, he scored his first goal against Hull City, but Fulham lost 2‚Äì1. On 14 January 2009, he had signed an initial 6-month loan move to Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia with a view to moving permanently. However, he stated that he desired to stay at Fulham to win his place in the squad, and he went on to score his second goal for the club against FK Vetra in the Europa League. On 15 January 2010, It was announced that his contract with Fulham had been cancelled by mutual consent. =Return to South Korea and retirement= After playing for Pohang Steelers, Ulsan Hyundai, and Incheon United in the K League, Seol announced his retirement on 2 March 2015 in order to become interim manager of Sungkyunkwan University. A retirement ceremony took place in a friendly match of South Korea and Jamaica on 13 October 2015. International career Seol played in his first World Cup in front of his home crowd, South Korea being co-hosts with Japan for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He was a key member of the squad during the tournament, memorably scoring the equalizer against Italy in the round of 16. He was nominated for the 2002 Ballon d'Or in that year. Managerial career On 26 December 2019, Seol was appointed as manager of Gyeongnam FC. Media Seol was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \\"Secret Tournament\\" commercial (branded \\"Scopion KO\\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Lu√≠s Figo, and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \\"referee\\".

It is located in the Bow Valley within Alberta's Rocky Mountains. The town shares a border with Kananaskis Country to the west and south and the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8 to the north and east. With a population of 12,288 in 2011, Canmore is the ninth-largest town in Alberta. History Canmore was officially named in 1884 by Canadian Pacific Railway director Donald A. Smith (later 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal). It was named after Malcolm III of Scotland who was also nicknamed Canmore. Canmore is Gaelic for \\"Big Head\\"Burton, vol. 1, p. 350, states: \\"Malcolm the son of Duncan is known as Malcolm III., but still better perhaps by his characteristic name of Canmore, said to come from the Celtic 'Cenn M√≥r', meaning 'great head'\\". In 1886, Queen Victoria granted a coal mining charter to the town, and the No. 1 mine was opened in 1887. By the 1890s, a North-West Mounted Police barrack had been instated on Main Street, but it was vacated in 1927. The building was restored in 1989 and it is under the care of the Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre. The coal mining industry in Canmore boomed well into the 20th century. In 1965, with a population of 2,000, Canmore was incorporated as a town. By the 1970s the market for coal was diminished, and in 1979 Canmore Mines Ltd. ceased operations. As a result of safety and reclamation policies instigated by the province of Alberta, all but a few mining structures were demolished in the following year; only the lamp house and a few mine entrances remain today. Canmore's economic future seemed dismal until the announcement in the early 1980s that Calgary would be hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics, and that Canmore would play host to the Nordic events. This resulted in an increase in tourism, and Canmore began to develop into the recreational tourist destination it is today. The Canmore Hotel sits on the main street as it has for over 100 years. The building is now going through a restoration renovation. The hotel celebrated its 120th anniversary in October 2010.  Geography  Concerns over Canmore's urban growth adjacent to provincial and national parkland has led to many efforts to place a limit on future development. The town is expected to reach its maximum \\"build out\\" following the completion of the SilverTip and Three Sisters Mountain Village developments sometime around 2015‚Äì2020.http://www.tsmv.ca Three Sisters Mountain Village Ha Ling Peak Bisected by the Trans-Canada Highway, located on the Canadian Pacific Railway and run through by the Bow River, Canmore is ideally situated on a number of major transportation routes, which has influenced its tourism-based economy and historical mining industry. Much of the Canmore area has been designated a wildlife corridor. This corridor allows animals such as bears, cougars, wolves, and elk to move between habitat patches, where they can find food, escape predators, breed, give birth, and establish territories. Despite its modest population and environmentally friendly image, Canmore is highly sprawled and segmented (due to wildlife corridors, highways, the railway, and the Bow River) and takes over one and a half hours to traverse by foot. The pedestrian-friendly town centre surrounds 8th Street, or \\"Main Street\\" (as it is known colloquially), which was originally a residential road with some of the oldest architecture in the town; now, however, it is lined with small shops, restaurants, and galleries. Much of the recent development is taking place in Three Sisters Mountain Village, SilverTip Resort, and around the town centre. A series of hiking, mountain biking, equestrian, and paved trails traverse the Canmore area. Major trail systems are located on the Benchlands of Mount Lady Macdonald, at the Canmore Nordic Centre, and along the north slope of Mount Lawrence Grassi. Many of these trails, and others around the community, are located within Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park and Kananaskis Country. Some of these, including the Montaine Traverse Trail and the Highline Trail, have been improved by the Town of Canmore, the Government of Alberta, the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8, and various stakeholders (Bow Valley Mountain Bike Alliance, the B.V. Riding Association, and local hiking groups) in order to balance recreational opportunities with environmental sustainability. Much of the upgrading has been accomplished by volunteers organized by the Trail Care Program of The Friends of Kananaskis Country. Mountains located adjacent to and visible from the townsite are: *Mount Rundle (); *Mount Lawrence Grassi (2,685 m / 8,809 ft); Ha Ling Peak (); *Three Sisters (2,936 m, 2,769 m, 2,694 m or 9,633 ft, 9,084 ft, 8,839 ft) *Grotto Mountain (2,706 m / 8,878 ft); *Mount Lady Macdonald (2,606 m / 8,550 ft). = Climate = Canmore's climate is relatively mild compared to some other regions of Alberta. It does not have an Environment Canada weather observation station, but the nearby town of Banff has an average high of in January, with relatively low humidity. Summers are short with daytime temperatures ranging from .  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Canmore recorded a population of 13,992 living in 5,738 of its 7,963 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 12,288. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. The population of the Town of Canmore according to its 2014 municipal census is 13,077, a change from its 2011 municipal census population of 12,317. At its current population, Canmore is one of the largest towns in the province and is eligible for city status.

Mountain bikers will enjoy the extensive trail network in the Canmore area and can checkhttp://tpr.alberta.ca/parks/kananaskis/trailreport.aspx for updated trail reports. The local Alberta Junior Hockey League team is the Canmore Eagles. In 2001, Canmore resident and Eagles goalie \\"Double Blocker\\" Dan Blackburn, was drafted into the National Hockey League to play for the New York Rangers. The local Bantam hockey team is the Canmore Eagles. The hockey movie Mystery, Alaska (1999) was filmed in Canmore. Canmore is the official home to the Canadian National Cross Country Skiing and Biathlon teams. This, combined with the Canmore Nordic Centre has resulted in the town becoming a magnet for aspiring athletes in both sports. Full and part-time athletes can be seen training around town and in the local area all year around. On February 22, 2006, Canmore local Chandra Crawford won the gold medal in the women's cross- country 1.1-kilometre sprint at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Beckie Scott, gold medalist in the women's cross country skiing pursuit race in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah also makes her home in Canmore. The Canmore Nordic Centre is a destination for many large sporting events. During the summer season, mountain bike races (including the World 24 Hour championships in 2009 and the Canadian National Championships in 2010) are held there. During the winter season, the facility sees several cross country ski races, ranging from local events to FIS World Cup (2005, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2016). Canmore United is the highly popular and successful local soccer team, participating in the summer Bow Valley Soccer League, as well as tournaments in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Canmore Youth Skate Park was built in the summer of 2009.  Media  The primary newspapers for the town are the Rocky Mountain Outlook and the Banff Crag & Canyon which recently took over the Canmore Leader. The only radio station operating out of Canmore is CHMN-FM, an adult contemporary station run by Rogers Media. Former Much Music VJ, Bradford How was employed by the Rogers owned, Mountain FM (broadcast at 106.5 FM) before he won the MuchMusic VJ Search competition in 2000.  Housing  Many of the new developments, fractional projects, and vacation suites were built with sustainable development in mind, and in 2006 the Three Sisters Mountain Village development was the recipient of an international award for being the best sustainable development in North America. Unfortunately, new owners of the 'future land assets' of this project defaulted on their financial commitments following the world economic crisis, putting the future development lands into receivership in the spring of 2009, but this does not affect current developments that are ongoing within the project and long term development will eventually continue under new ownership. In early 2010, several projects are beginning to show signs of life, and real estate pricing has begun to recover. As of June 2014 Canmore has the lowest vacancy rate in Canada for rental properties according to a CMHC Spring report. This in turn is having an effect on the housing market and pushing prices up. Along with the uptick in the oil industry and second home buyers coming back into the market from Calgary, the housing market is showing signs of not only recovering but becoming very strong as inventory levels are at a 6-year low. Within the town, there are also some buildings using geothermal energy, and the town's new Municipal Services Building is the first building in Alberta to achieve LEED Silver certification status. However, due to the local landscape being very complex, not everyone can install solar or wind energy devices on their property. Bylaws are also very strict and \\"aesthetic alterations\\" are not widely accepted. Canmore is a very difficult place to find affordable housing, and pet owners or families may have difficulty arranging accommodation. To alleviate the housing crunch, Canmore has pursued several affordable housing projects. In 2000, the Town of Canmore established the Canmore Community Housing Corporation (CCHC) to provide housing solutions for a healthy and balanced community. CCHC administers a Perpetually Affordable Housing (PAH) Program consisting of 41 ownership and 60 rental housing units at below-market purchase prices and rental rates. Mountain Haven Co-operative Homes Ltd. administers its own PAH development that provides 44 equity and non-equity (lease to own) units. Infrastructure Health care is provided at the Canmore General Hospital. Transit is provided by Roam transit.

It is located on the banks of the rivers Sieg and Agger, 10 kilometres from the former seat of West German government Bonn and 26 kilometres from Cologne. The population of the city was 39,192 in the 2013 census.  Geography  Siegburg is located approximately 8 kilometres east of the river Rhine, at the confluence where the Agger joins the Sieg, in the southeast corner of the Cologne Lowland. Neighbouring towns include Troisdorf, Lohmar, Sankt Augustin and Hennef. The nearby cities of Cologne and Bonn are easily accessible through good transport links. The highest point of the urban area is 220m above sea level (NHN) in the Brascho√ü area and the lowest point is just under 54m above sea level at the mouth of the Agger. History St. Servatius and the Haus zum Winter (1220 AD) Archbishop-Elector Anno II of Cologne founded a Benedictine monastery in 1064, known as Michaelsberg Abbey, on top of the hill also called the Michaelsberg. A settlement that arose from that was first mentioned as a city in 1182. Siegburg reached the height of its prosperity in the 15th and 16th century. It is famous for its pottery, especially for the Siegburg pitchers (Siegburger Kr√ºge). Siegburg has been the county seat of the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis since 1816. Siegburg's synagogue was destroyed on Kristallnacht, signaling the demise of its Jewish community. Transport Siegburg/Bonn station is a railway station on the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway and the Sieg Railway.

In the United States, it aired over two nights. In some countries it was shown in cinemas, with additional footage including nudity, language and more violence. The movie is based on the murders committed by the Charles Manson Family. The best-known victim was actress Sharon Tate. The title was taken from the Beatles' song of the same name. According to the theory put forward by the prosecution, Manson used the term for an anticipated race war, and \\"healter skelter\\" [sic] was scrawled in blood on the refrigerator door at the home of victims Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. It recounts the murders Manson committed, the investigation, and the 1970-71 trial, in which prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi attempted to draw connections between the Manson family and his violent convictions. The 1976 film, directed by Tom Gries, stars Steve Railsback as Manson and George DiCenzo as Bugliosi. Writer JP Miller received a 1977 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best TV Feature or Mini-series Teleplay. In 2004, the book was adapted for a second made-for-TV movie, written and directed by John Gray and featuring Jeremy Davies as Manson. Plot William Garretson is arrested following the discovery of the bodies of Sharon Tate and her guests at her home but is released three days later for lack of evidence. The police are unwilling to connect the Tate killings to the Hinman murder and LaBianca killings, despite the similarities of the crime scenes including writing in blood on the walls, and instead pursue a drug-related angle for the Tate killings. The police raid Spahn Ranch in an attempt to break up an auto theft ring and arrest Manson and his gang. 9-year-old \\"Steven Quint\\" (based on 10-year-old Steven Weiss) discovers a gun and his father turns it over to the police, where it is ignored. The Manson Family is released from prison and later two girls fleeing from Death Valley, \\"Stephanie Mark\\" (based on Stephanie Schram) and Kitty Lutesinger, tell police that the Manson Family has moved to Barker Ranch and that Susan Atkins was involved in the Hinman murder. Susan is arrested and reveals to her fellow inmate Ronnie Howard that she also killed Sharon Tate and was involved in eleven other killings. Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi interviews Danny DeCarlo, who gives a tour of Spahn Ranch and says that Manson had a .22 caliber Buntline revolver matching that used in the murders. Ronnie Howard calls the homicide division and tells them what Susan confessed to her. Bugliosi requests bail to be set high for Manson's trial for burning municipal earthmoving equipment in order to give him time to get evidence for the grand jury for the murders. Bugliosi interviews the Manson Girls and obtains arrest warrants for participants in the killings. Linda Kasabian turns herself in on the warrant while the fingerprints of Tex Watson and Patricia Krenwinkel are matched to those found at the Tate residence. During the grand jury proceedings, Susan gives all of the details of the Tate and LaBianca killings. As a result, Susan, Leslie Van Houten, Tex, Patricia, Linda, and Manson are all brought up on charges. Reporters for ABC News attempting to retrace the events crime as reported in the newspaper find where the bloody clothes from the murders have been discarded. Steven's father calls to ask about the .22 revolver, but the police tell him that they don't have time for him and hang up on him. He tells the story to the news in order to embarrass the investigators. Bugliosi uses ballistics testing to link the gun to the one used on Sebring. Manson chooses to represent himself at trial and Bugliosi tricks Manson into requesting more time, thus also giving himself more time to put a stronger case together. Bugliosi interviews former Manson Family member Paul Watkins, who explains Manson's views that the Beatles are sending him messages to spark a race war dubbed \\"Helter Skelter\\". During the trial, testimony is heard from Linda Kasabian regarding the Tate and LaBianca murders despite repeated objections from the counsel for the defense. At one point Manson leaps at the judge but is subdued. He demands to give testimony, much of which works to his disadvantage. Due to their continuous disruptions, the defendants are ordered out of the courtroom during the closing arguments. Ultimately all of the defendants are sentenced to death but California later eliminates the death penalty in 1972, making the convicts eligible to apply for parole in the future.

It won the 1983 Philip K. Dick Award and 1984 Science Fiction Chronicle Award.  Plot summary  In 1801 the British have risen to power in Egypt and suppress the worship of the old Egyptian gods. A cabal of magicians plan to drive the British out of Egypt by bringing the gods forward in time from an age when they were still powerful and unleashing them on London, thereby destroying the British Empire. In 1802, a failed attempt by the magicians to summon Anubis opens magical gates in a predictable pattern across time and space. In 1983, ailing millionaire J. Cochran Darrow has discovered the gates and found that they make time travel possible. Darrow organizes a trip to the past for fellow millionaires to attend a lecture by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1810. He hires Professor Brendan Doyle to attend and give expert commentary. One of the magicians, Doctor Romany, happens to spy the time travelers and kidnaps Doyle before he can return. Doyle manages to escape torture and flees back to London, now trapped in the 19th century. Doyle joins a beggars' guild and meets a beggar named Jacky. He plans to meet and befriend William Ashbless, a wealthy poet that Doyle has studied profusely, in order to gain a benefactor. Doctor Romany scours the city for Doyle with his legion of murderous beggars, led by the clown-magician Horrabin. At the same time, Doyle discovers that Darrow has remained in the 19th century to search for Dog-Face Joe, a body-swapping werewolf, in hopes of bribing Joe into granting him a healthy new body. Doyle himself becomes targeted by Joe, receiving the poisoned body of Darrow's former bodyguard, but manages to cure himself of the poison. In his new body, Doyle realizes that he himself is the historical Ashbless. He copies down Ashbless's poetry from memory and deduces his own future from his study of Ashbless's life. Using this knowledge, he continues to thwart the magicians' plans. After Romany discovers a gate to 1684, Doyle follows him through and stops his attempt to change the past. Meanwhile, Darrow successfully contacts Dog-Face Joe and organizes a deal in which Joe will provide Darrow with healthy bodies and allow him to live forever. Doyle eventually returns to 1810, but is kidnapped and taken to Muhammad Ali's Egypt, where the magicians' Master tempts him with resurrecting his dead wife if he will tell them the secrets of the time-gates. Doyle resists and kills the Master. Meanwhile, Jacky discovers Darrow's secret and kills him along with Dog-Face Joe. Doyle returns to London, where the last magician, Romanelli, kidnaps him, Jacky, and Coleridge. In a drugged stupor, Coleridge frees Horrabin's twisted menagerie of monsters, allowing him and Jacky to escape. Romanelli escapes with Doyle to the underworld, but is eaten by Apep while Doyle is rejuvenated on board the sunboat of the god Ra. Doyle meets back up with Jacky and discovers that not only is Jacky secretly a woman, she is his future wife. Decades later, after living out Ashbless's entire life and becoming a widower, Doyle goes out to meet his historic date with death. Doyle discovers that his intended murderer is a duplicate of himself that the Master had made in Egypt decades before. Doyle kills the duplicate, thereby supplying the corpse for his death, and boats away into an unknown future. Major characters *Brendan Doyle: An English professor at Cal State Fullerton, Doyle is still haunted by the motorcycle accident that killed his wife Rebecca.

He leads a clan of gypsies and wears clogs to avoid contact with the ground. After a magical ritual misfires, his mind snaps and he becomes Dog-Face Joe.

Allusions/references to real people and events  As in Powers's later novel, The Stress of Her Regard, The Anubis Gates features a number of the Romantic Poets as characters. In addition to Coleridge, there is Byron (alongside the fictional 19th-century poet William Ashbless created by Powers and James Blaylock). Other real people characterized in the novel are the famous publisher John Murray and Dr. Romanelli, the physician who treated Byron for a fever while he traveled in Greece. The novel intertwines a number of real events into the story such as the massacre of the Mamluk beys by Muhammad Ali in 1811 and the failed rebellion by James, Duke of Monmouth against James II in the 1680s. Powers was apparently heavily influenced in style, descriptions and character types by Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, and also by the works of Charles Dickens to a lesser degree. The ship, Blaylock, that Doyle claims he came to England on is named after Powers's friend James P. Blaylock. A minor factual glitch has characters in the story using gold sovereigns (¬£1 gold coins) in 1810, six years before the coin was authorized by the Coinage Act 1816, and seven years before being struck for circulation. The gold coin in use before the sovereign of 20 shillings was the guinea of 21 shillings. Regency/detective novelist Georgette Heyer used the change that came in with the \\"New Coinage\\" as a plot twist in her 1954 novel The Toll- Gate. Reception The Anubis Gates was chosen for Gollancz's Fantasy Masterworks (appearing as #47). Cheryl Morgan lists the novel among \\"12 Classic Steampunk Books.\\" Chris Henderson reviews the book favorably in the December 1983 issue of Dragon Magazine. He calls it \\"one of the best books to appear on the shelves this year\\". Noting it is \\"one of those rare books‚Äîa solid mainstream fantasy novel\\", Henderson recommends it. Dave Langford reviewed The Anubis Gates for White Dwarf #80, and stated that \\"Profound it isn't but The Anubis Gates offer triffic entertainment and much stealable scenario background for Call of Cockburn or whatever that game is called.\\" Algis Budrys declared that Powers \\"supplies the one thing the reader has to have‚Äîand never more needfully than in a time-travel story. He supplies room for the reader to participate; to delve into each clearly delineated wonder, to turn it over in his or her own mind with full confidence that the author has honestly drawn the lineaments of the whole scene being presented. He invites the reader to interplay.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, April 1984, p. 32 A 2006 review at SFReviews.net gives the novel 4.5 out of 5 stars and says, \\"Tim Powers' masterpiece remains, over 20 years after its first publication, one of modern fantasy's most dazzling acts of the imagination. There have been other novels in the genre about time travel, but none with The Anubis Gates' unique slant on the material, nor its bottomless well of inventiveness. It's literally in a class by itself, a model for others to follow... Powers draws from everywhere: speculative quantum physics, ancient Egyptian mythology, Romany lore, history and classical literature. Then he mixes it all together with the carefree exuberance of a kid with his first chemistry set. The result, of course, blows up the room‚Äîbut in the best possible way.\\" A guardian.co.uk reviewer called it \\"a torrential adventure which ranged from 19th-century poets to the gods of ancient Egypt... a thrilling, riproaring, wonderfully inventive adventure.\\" Reviewer Steven Wu rated it 8 out of 10, saying that the book \\"falls just short of being a truly great science-fiction novel.\\" He wrote, \\"The main virtue of the book is its unique and imaginative setting, a 19th-century London filled with deformed clowns, organized beggar societies, insane homunculi, and magic,\\" but found the plot \\"difficult to understand... especially in the completely baffling climactic sequence.\\" Reviewer Jonathan McCalmont praised the book's tone: \\"Despite a cast of grotesque supporting characters and more pulpy fantastical elements than you can shake a vorpal sword at, Powers manages to keep the tone of The Anubis Gates darkly atmospheric... The more colourful aspects of the book are anchored in the real and serve only to make the setting more engaging and bizarre... Powers' Regency London never seems camp or farcical, it simply seems utterly alien and forbidding, even to a Londoner such as myself. Every page of this book drips with delicious weirdness. Despite being over 20 years old, it feels as fresh and as powerful as any contemporary fantasy novel you're likely to find. It is Powers' talent for the strange that keeps you turning the pages‚Äîwhich is fortunate as the plotting is far from simple.\\" Reviewer Shaun Farrell wrote, \\"With exotic characters and settings, including England of the late 1600s and sunny Egypt, The Anubis Gates is a time travel story that stacks up with the best of them and is sure to [stand] the test of time. It is pure imagination and fun, full of character driven action and humor. A novel that transcends genre limitations, this book will please lovers of all fiction alike.\\" Recognition *Philip K.

Sometimes the name of the city is written as Kobrin which is a transliteration from Russian.  History  In prehistoric times it was inhabited by the ancient Baltic Yotvingian tribe. At various times, the city had belonged to Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian Empire, the Second Polish Republic, the Byelorussian SSR and the Republic of Belarus. = Middle Ages and early modern era = Historic coat of arms of Kobryn In the 10th century the area became part of the emerging Polish state under first ruler Mieszko I of Poland. Later on, the area was part of the Kievan Rus' and the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. Kobryn was first mentioned in 1287. In the early 14th century the town formed part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after the Union of Krewo (1385) in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union. It became the capital of a feudal principality within the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian realm, existing from 1387 to 1518.

In the European guild system, only masters and journeymen were allowed to be members of the guild. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from apprentice to journeyman before he could be elected to become a master craftsman. He would then have to produce a sum of money and a masterpiece before he could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, he was not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of his life.  Today's master craftsman in different countries = Germany = Master craftsman certificate - Handwerkskammer Dresden - 16.7.1958 A master discusses a vacuum compressor with his apprentice boy and several other craftsmen In Germany, the master craftsman (Meister) is the highest professional qualification in crafts and is a state-approved grade. The certification is called Meisterbrief. The qualification includes theoretical and practical training in the craft as well as business and legal training. Additionally, it implies the qualification to train apprentices. These qualifications prepare the Meister for running their own business or alternatively for higher positions at a company. The status of master craftsmen is regulated in the German Gesetz zur Ordnung des Handwerks (Crafts and Trades Regulation Code). Guilds have been abolished in Germany, but the ranks of apprentice (Lehrling), journeyman (Geselle) and master craftsman have been retained even through modern times. For security-relevant crafts, e.g., electricians and chimney sweeps, any business in the trade has to be run by a master craftsman or has to employ at least one Meister. Journeymen and master craftsmen are by law automatically members of their regional chamber of crafts (Handwerkskammer), which is a self-governing public body. The chamber organizes vocational training and oversees the examination of the journeymen and masters. To become a master craftsman, it is usually required to have completed vocational training in the craft in which the examination should be taken, which finishes with a final examination called Gesellenpr√ºfung (journeyman's examination). If these requirements are fulfilled, the candidate can take courses for the Meisterpr√ºfung (master craftman's examination). The duration of the courses takes 4 to 6 years depending on the craft. The examination includes theoretical, practical and oral parts and takes 5 to 7 days (depending on the craft). In some crafts, the creation of a masterpiece is also part of the examination. The German Meister qualifies the holder to study for a bachelor's degree at university, whether the Meister holds a regular university entrance qualification or not.Hochschulzugang f√ºr beruflich qualifizierte Bewerber ohne schulische Hochschulzugangsberechtigung. ANKOM. 3 March 2009. According to the German Qualifications Framework, the Meisterbrief is at the same level as a bachelor's degree, even though it is not an academic degree and thus not directly comparable. = United Kingdom = This tradition originates in Medieval Europe. The earliest guilds were \\"frith\\" or \\"peace\\" guilds - groups bonded together for mutual protection following the breakdown of the kins, which were groups related by blood ties. Merchant guilds ‚Äì associations of international trades ‚Äì were powerful in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but lost their ascendancy with the rise of the craft guilds ‚Äì associations of master craftsmen, journeymen, apprentices and the various trades connected with a particular craft. The College of Arms in London awarded a coat of arms of The Guild of Master Craftsmen in 1992, after four years of assessment. Designed by heraldic expert Peter Greenhill to reflect the many categories of guild membership, it features: three escutcheons (shields) to represent artists, painters and stainers; a pair of compasses opened in chevron for building, construction and carpenters; a dovetail (separating the top third of the shield from the rest) to represent cabinetmaking, woodworking and joinery; and a gavel and chisel for masons and stoneworkers. The southern keep of Lewes Castle, which overlooks the guild‚Äôs headquarters, is featured above the helmet as the crest. = United States = While for the most part guilds as such do not exist, many trades continue the apprentice-journeyman-master model: carpenters, electricians, pipefitters and plumbers are notable examples.

The following year, as part of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla, Armada deployed to the Far East, performing a variety of duties while based there, and the following year, Armada, with the rest of the 19th Flotilla, returned home to the UK, visiting a variety of ports on the way, mainly on 'fly-the-flag' visits. Upon reaching the UK, Armada was placed in Reserve. In 1949, Armada joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, deploying to the Mediterranean as part of that flotilla. In 1950, Armada, while still based in the Mediterranean, was involved in a collision. Armada remained in the sunny climes of the Mediterranean until returning home to the UK with the rest of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla.

Its name comes from , the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.Dunedin: Edinburgh of the south , The Scotsman, 18 April 2012 The urban area of Dunedin lies on the central-eastern coast of Otago, surrounding the head of Otago Harbour, and the harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano. The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills, onto the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula, and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean. Dunedin was the largest New Zealand city by territorial land area until superseded by Auckland with the formation of the Auckland Council in November 2010. Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by MƒÅori prior to the arrival of Europeans. The province and region of Otago takes its name from the village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour, which became a whaling station in the 1830s. In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland. Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city. Dunedin became wealthy during the Central Otago Gold Rush, beginning in the 1860s. In the mid-1860s, and between 1878 and 1881, it was New Zealand's largest urban area. The city population at 5 March 2013 was 120,246. While Hamilton, Tauranga and Lower Hutt have eclipsed the city in size of population since the 1980s to make it only the seventh-largest urban area in New Zealand, Dunedin is still considered one of the four main cities of New Zealand for historic, cultural and geographic reasons. Dunedin has a diverse economy, which includes manufacturing, publishing and technology-based industries as well as education, research and tourism. The city's most important activity centres around tertiary education‚ÄîDunedin is home to the University of Otago, New Zealand's oldest university (established 1869), and the Otago Polytechnic. Students account for a large proportion of the population; 21.6 per cent of the city's population was aged between 15 and 24 at the 2006 census, compared to the New Zealand average of 14.2 per cent. In 2014 Dunedin was designated as a UNESCO City of Literature.  History = MƒÅori settlements = Archaeological evidence shows the first human (MƒÅori) occupation of New Zealand occurred between 1250‚Äì1300 AD, with population concentrated along the southeast coast. A camp site at Kaikai Beach, near Long Beach to the north of the present-day city of Dunedin, has been dated from about that time. There are numerous archaic (moa-hunter) sites in what is now Dunedin, several of them large and permanently occupied, particularly in the 14th century. The population contracted but expanded again with the evolution of the Classic MƒÅori culture which saw the building of several pƒÅ, fortified settlements, notably Pukekura at (Taiaroa Head), about 1650. There was a settlement in what is now central Dunedin (≈åtepoti), occupied as late as about 1785 but abandoned by 1826.Turton, Hanson \\"Introductory\\" in There were also Maori settlements at Whareakeake (Murdering Beach), P≈´rƒÅkaunui, Mapoutahi (Goat Island Peninsula) and Huriawa (Karitane Peninsula) to the north, and at Taieri Mouth and Otokia (Henley) to the south, all inside the present boundaries of Dunedin. MƒÅori tradition tells first of a people called Kahui Tipua living in the area, then Te Rapuwai, semi-legendary but considered to be historical. The next arrivals were Waitaha, followed by KƒÅti MƒÅmoe late in the 16th century and then Kai Tahu (NgƒÅi Tahu in modern standard MƒÅori) who arrived in the mid-17th century. European accounts have often represented these successive influxes as \\"invasions\\", but modern scholarship has cast doubt on that view. They were probably migrations - like those of the Europeans - which incidentally resulted in bloodshed. The sealer John Boultbee recorded in the late 1820s that the 'Kaika Otargo' (settlements around and near Otago Harbour) were the oldest and largest in the south. = European settlement = Lieutenant James Cook stood off what is now the coast of Dunedin between 25 February 1770 and 5 March 1770, naming Cape Saunders (on the Otago Peninsula) and Saddle Hill. He reported penguins and seals in the vicinity, which led sealers to visit from the beginning of the 19th century. The early years of sealing saw a feud between sealers and local MƒÅori from 1810 to 1823, the \\"Sealers' War\\" sparked by an incident on Otago Harbour, but William Tucker became the first European to settle in the area in 1815. Permanent European occupation dates from 1831, when the Weller brothers founded their whaling station at Otago, modern Otakou, on the Otago Harbour. Epidemics badly reduced the MƒÅori population. By the late 1830s the Harbour had become an international whaling port. Wright & Richards started a whaling station at Karitane in 1837 and Johnny Jones established a farming settlement and a mission station, the South Island's first, at Waikouaiti in 1840. The settlements at Karitane and Waikouaiti have endured making modern Dunedin one of the longest European settled territories in New Zealand. Statue of Queen Victoria, at Queens Gardens. Dunedin was settled by Europeans during the Victorian era. In 1844, the Deborah, captained by Thomas Wing and carrying (among others) his wife Lucy and a representative of the New Zealand Company, Frederick Tuckett, sailed south to determine the location of a planned Free Church settlement. After inspecting several areas around the eastern coast of the south island, Tuckett selected the site which would become known as Dunedin. (Tuckett turned down the site which would become Christchurch, as he felt the ground around the Avon river was swampy.) William Cargill on Princes Street The Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland, through a company called the Otago Association, founded Dunedin at the head of Otago Harbour in 1848 as the principal town of its special settlement. The name Dunedin comes from D√πn √àideann, the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. Charles Kettle the city's surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, \\"Romantic\\" design. There resulted both grand and quirky streets as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, served as the secular leader of the new colony. The Reverend Thomas Burns, a nephew of the poet Robert Burns, provided spiritual guidance. By the end of the 1850s, around 12,000 Scots had emigrated to Dunedin, many from the industrial lowlands. = Gold rush era = In 1852, Dunedin became the capital of the Otago Province, the whole of New Zealand from the Waitaki south. In 1861 the discovery of gold at Gabriel's Gully, to the south-west, led to a rapid influx of people and saw Dunedin become New Zealand's first city by growth of population in 1865. The new arrivals included many Irish, but also Italians, Lebanese, French, Germans, Jews and Chinese. The Dunedin Southern Cemetery was established in 1858, the Dunedin Northern Cemetery in 1872. The London-owned Bank of Otago opened its doors in Dunedin in 1863, opened 12 branches throughout its region then in 1873 merged with the new National Bank of New Zealand also based in London and also operated from Dunedin but, true to its name, it rapidly expanded throughout New Zealand.Notice. Otago Daily Times 21 June 1873 Page 2 Dunedin remained the principal local source of the nation's development capital until the Second World War. Dunedin railway station, built in 1906, is famed for its \\"gingerbread\\" architecture. Dunedin and the region industrialised and consolidated and the Main South Line connected the city with Christchurch in 1878 and Invercargill in 1879. Otago Boys' High School was founded in 1863. The Otago Museum opened in 1868. The University of Otago, the oldest university in New Zealand, in 1869. Otago Girls' High School was established in 1871. Between 1881 and 1957, Dunedin was home to cable trams, being both one of the first and last such systems in the world. Early in the 1880s the inauguration of the frozen meat industry, with the first shipment leaving from Port Chalmers in 1882, saw the beginning of a later great national industry. After ten years of gold rushes the economy slowed but Julius Vogel's immigration and development scheme brought thousands more especially to Dunedin and Otago before recession set in again in the 1880s. In these first and second times of prosperity many institutions and businesses were established, New Zealand's first daily newspaper, art school, medical school and public art gallery the Dunedin Public Art Gallery among them. There was also a remarkable architectural flowering producing many substantial and ornamental buildings. R. A. Lawson's First Church of Otago and Knox Church are notable examples, as are buildings by Maxwell Bury and F. W. Petre. The other visual arts also flourished under the leadership of W. M. Hodgkins. The city's landscape and burgeoning townscape were vividly portrayed by George O'Brien (1821‚Äì1888). From the mid-1890s the economy revived. Institutions such as the Otago Settlers Museum (now renamed as Toitu Otago Settlers Museum) and the Hocken Collections‚Äîthe first of their kind in New Zealand‚Äîwere founded. More notable buildings such as the Railway Station and Olveston were erected. New energy in the visual arts represented by G. P. Nerli culminated in the career of Frances Hodgkins. = Early modern era = Historic panorama of the Botanical Gardens, By 1900, Dunedin was no longer the country's biggest city. Influence and activity moved north to the other centres (\\"the drift north\\"), a trend which continued for much of the following century. Despite this, the university continued to expand, and a student quarter became established. At the same time people started to notice Dunedin's mellowing, the ageing of its grand old buildings, with writers like E. H. McCormick pointing out its atmospheric charm. In the 1930s and early 1940s a new generation of artists such as M. T. (Toss) Woollaston, Doris Lusk, Anne Hamblett, Colin McCahon and Patrick Hayman once again represented the best of the country's talent. The Second World War saw the dispersal of these painters, but not before McCahon had met a very youthful poet, James K. Baxter, in a central city studio. Dunedin Cenotaph, erected in 1927 Numerous large companies had been established in Dunedin, many of which became national leaders. Late among them was Fletcher Construction, founded by Sir James Fletcher in the early 20th century. Kempthorne Prosser, established in 1879 in Stafford Street, was the largest fertiliser and drug manufacturer in the country for over 100 years. G. Methven, a metalworking and tap manufacturer based in South Dunedin, was also a leading firm, as was H. E. Shacklock, an iron founder and appliance manufacturer later taken over by the Auckland concern Fisher and Paykel. The Mosgiel Woollens was another Victorian Dunedin foundation. Hallensteins was the colloquial name of a menswear manufacturer and national retail chain while the DIC and Arthur Barnett were department stores, the former a nationwide concern. Coulls, Somerville Wilkie‚Äîlater part of the Whitcoulls group‚Äîhad its origins in Dunedin in the 19th century. There were also the National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand, Wright Stephensons Limited, the Union Steamship Company and the National Insurance Company and the Standard Insurance Company among many others, which survived into the 20th century. = Post-war developments = Dunedin Botanic Gardens in winter After the Second World War prosperity and population growth revived, although Dunedin trailed as the fourth 'main centre'. A generation reacting against Victorianism started demolishing its buildings and many were lost, notably William Mason's Stock exchange in 1969. (Dunedin Stock Exchange building) Although the university continued to expand, the city's population contracted, notably from 1976 to 1981. This was, however, a culturally vibrant time with the university's new privately endowed arts fellowships bringing such luminaries as James K Baxter, Ralph Hotere, Janet Frame and Hone Tuwhare to the city. Princes Street in April 1982 During the 1980s Dunedin's popular music scene blossomed, with many acts, such as The Chills, The Clean, The Verlaines and Straitjacket Fits, gaining national and international recognition. The term \\"The Dunedin sound\\" was coined to describe the 1960s-influenced, guitar-led music which flourished at the time. Bands and musicians are still playing and recording in many styles. By 1990, population decline had steadied and slow growth has occurred since and Dunedin re-invented itself as a 'heritage city' with its main streets refurbished in Victorian style.Dunedin City council page R. A. Lawson's Municipal Chambers (Dunedin Town Hall) in the Octagon were handsomely restored. The city was also recognised as a centre of excellence in tertiary education and research. The university's and polytechnic's growth accelerated. Dunedin has continued to refurbish itself, embarking on redevelopments of the art gallery, railway station and the Toit≈´ Otago Settlers Museum. Dunedin has flourishing niche industries including engineering, software engineering, bio-technology and fashion. Port Chalmers on the Otago Harbour provides Dunedin with deep-water facilities. It is served by the Port Chalmers Branch, a branch line railway which diverges from the Main South Line and runs from Christchurch by way of Dunedin to Invercargill. Dunedin is also home to MTF, the nationwide vehicle finance company. The cityscape glitters with gems of Victorian and Edwardian architecture‚Äîthe legacy of the city's gold-rush affluence. Many, including First Church, Otago Boys' High School and Larnach Castle were designed by one of New Zealand's most eminent architects R. A. Lawson. Other prominent buildings include Olveston and the Dunedin Railway Station. Other unusual or memorable buildings or constructions are Baldwin Street, claimed to be the world's steepest residential street; the Captain Cook tavern; Cadbury Chocolate Factory (Cadbury World); and the local Speight's brewery. Botanic Gardens in Spring Dunedin is also a centre for ecotourism. The world's only mainland royal albatross colony and several penguin and seal colonies lie within the city boundaries on the Otago Peninsula. To the north of the city, above Waitati, is the 307 ha Orokonui Ecosanctuary, a ‚Äòmainland island‚Äô, where rare species of wildlife ‚Äì birds, lizards and plants ‚Äì have been reintroduced and now thrive in the predator-free environment. To the south, on the western side of Lake Waihola, are the Sinclair Wetlands. The thriving tertiary student population has led to a vibrant youth culture (students are referred to as 'Scarfies' by people who are not students), consisting of the previously mentioned music scene, and more recently a burgeoning boutique fashion industry.Thread fashion magazine article A strong visual arts community also exists in Dunedin, notably in Port Chalmers and the other settlements which dot the coast of the Otago Harbour, and also in communities such as Waitati. Sport is catered for in Dunedin by the floodlit rugby and cricket venues of Forsyth Barr Stadium and University Oval, Dunedin, respectively, the new Caledonian Ground football and athletics stadium near the University at Logan Park, the large Edgar Centre indoor sports centre, the Dunedin Ice Stadium, and numerous golf courses and parks. There are also the Forbury Park horseracing circuit in the south of the city and several others within a few kilometres. St Clair Beach is a well-known surfing venue, and the harbour basin is popular with windsurfers and kitesurfers. Dunedin has four public swimming pools: Moana Pool, Port Chalmers Pool, Mosgiel and St Clair Salt Water Pool.  Geography  Taiaroa Head with lighthouse. Dunedin City has a land area of , slightly larger than the American state of Rhode Island or the English county of Cambridgeshire, and a little smaller than Cornwall. It was the largest city in land area in New Zealand until the formation of the Auckland Council on 1 November 2010. The Dunedin City Council boundaries since 1989 have extended to Middlemarch in the west, Waikouaiti in the north, the Pacific Ocean in the east and south-east, and the Waipori/Taieri River and the township of Henley in the south-west. Dunedin is situated at the head of Otago Harbour, a narrow inlet extending south-westward for some 15 miles. The harbour is a recent creation formed by the flooding of two river valleys. From the time of its foundation in 1848, the city has spread slowly over the low-lying flats and nearby hills and across the isthmus to the slopes of the Otago Peninsula. =Inner city= Princes Street was developed during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the gold rush, and consequently is one of New Zealand's most historic streets The central region of Dunedin is known as the Octagon. It was once a gully, filled in the mid nineteenth century to create the present plaza. The initial settlement of the city took place to the south on the other side of Bell Hill, a large outcrop which had to be reduced to provide easy access between the two parts of the settlement. The central city stretches away from this point in a largely northeast-southwest direction, with the main streets of George Street and Princes Street meeting at The Octagon. Here they are joined by Stuart Street, which runs orthogonally to them, from the Dunedin Railway Station in the southeast, and steeply up to the suburb of Roslyn in the northwest. Many of the city's notable old buildings are located in the southern part of this area and on the inner ring of lower hills which surround the central city (most of these hills, such as Maori Hill, Pine Hill, and Maryhill, rise to some above the plain). The head of the harbour includes a large area of reclaimed land (\\"The Southern Endowment\\"), much of which is used for light industry and warehousing. A large area of flat land, simply known colloquially as \\"The Flat\\" lies to the south and southwest of the city centre, and includes several larger and older suburbs, notably South Dunedin and St Kilda. These are protected from the Pacific Ocean by a long line of dunes which run east- west along the city's southern coastline and separate residential areas from Ocean Beach, which is traditionally divided into St. Clair Beach at the western end and St Kilda Beach to the east. Mornington Baldwin Street in North East Valley is the world's steepest residential street Dunedin is home to Baldwin Street, which, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is the steepest street in the world. Its gradient is 1 in 2.9. The long-since- abandoned Maryhill Cablecar route had a similar gradient close to its Mornington depot. Beyond the inner range of hills lie Dunedin's outer suburbs, notably to the northwest, beyond Roslyn. This direction contains Taieri Road and Three Mile Hill, which between them formed the original road route to the Taieri Plains. The modern State Highway 1 follows a different route, passing through Caversham in the west and out past Saddle Hill. Lying between Saddle Hill and Caversham are the outer suburbs of Green Island and Abbotsford. Between Green Island and Roslyn lies the steep-sided valley of the Kaikorai Stream, which is today a residential and light industrial area. Suburban settlements‚Äîmostly regarded as separate townships‚Äîalso lie along both edges of the Otago Harbour. Notable among these are Portobello and Macandrew Bay, on the Otago Peninsula coast, and Port Chalmers on the opposite side of the harbour. Port Chalmers provides Dunedin's main deep-water port, including the city's container port. The Dunedin skyline is dominated by a ring of (traditionally seven) hills which form the remnants of a volcanic crater. Notable among them are Mount Cargill (), Flagstaff (), Saddle Hill (), Signal Hill (), and Harbour Cone (). =Hinterland= Dunedin (grey area to lower left) sits close to the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula, at the end of Otago Harbour Dunedin's hinterland encompasses a variety of different landforms. To the southwest lie the Taieri Plains, the broad, fertile lowland floodplains of the Taieri River and its major tributary the Waipori. These are moderately heavily settled, and contain the towns of Mosgiel, and Allanton. They are separated from the coast by a range of low hills rising to some . Inland from the Taieri Plain is rough hill country. Close to the plain, much of this is forested, notably around Berwick and Lake Mahinerangi, and also around the Silverpeaks Range which lies northwest of the Dunedin urban area. Beyond this, the land becomes drier and opens out into grass and tussock-covered land. A high, broad valley, the Strath-Taieri lies in Dunedin's far northwest, containing the town of Middlemarch, one of the area's few concentrations of population. To the north of the city's urban area is undulating hill country containing several small, mainly coastal, settlements, including Waitati, Warrington, Seacliff, and Waikouaiti. State Highway 1 winds steeply through a series of hills here, notably The Kilmog. These hills can be considered a coastal extension of the Silverpeaks Range. To the east, Dunedin City includes the entirety of the Otago Peninsula, a long finger of land that formed the southeastern rim of the Dunedin Volcano. The peninsula is lightly settled, almost entirely along the harbour coast, and much of it is maintained as a natural habitat by the Otago Peninsula Trust. The peninsula contains several fine beaches, and is home to a considerable number of rare species, such as yellow-eyed and little penguins, seals, and shags. Most importantly, it contains the world's only mainland breeding colony of royal albatross, at Taiaroa Head on the peninsula's northeastern point. = List of suburbs = St Clair ;Inner suburbs (clockwise from the city centre, starting at due north) Woodhaugh; Glenleith; Leith Valley; Dalmore; Liberton; Pine Hill; Normanby; Mt Mera; North East Valley; Opoho; Dunedin North; Ravensbourne; Highcliff; Shiel Hill; Challis; Waverley; Vauxhall; Ocean Grove (Tomahawk); Tainui; Andersons Bay; Musselburgh; South Dunedin; St Kilda; St Clair; Corstorphine; Kew; Forbury; Caversham; Concord; Maryhill; Kenmure; Mornington; Kaikorai Valley; City Rise; Belleknowes; Roslyn; Kaikorai; Wakari; Maori Hill. ;Outer suburbs (clockwise from the city centre, starting at due north) Burkes; Saint Leonards; Deborah Bay; Careys Bay; Port Chalmers; Sawyers Bay; Roseneath; Broad Bay; Company Bay; Macandrew Bay; Portobello; Burnside; Green Island; Waldronville; Brighton; Westwood; Saddle Hill; Sunnyvale; Fairfield; Mosgiel; Abbotsford; Bradford; Brockville; Halfway Bush; Helensburgh.

Since local council reorganisation in the late 1980s, these are suburbs, but are not commonly regarded as such. = Climate = The climate of Dunedin in general is temperate; however, the city is recognised as having a large number of microclimates and the weather conditions often vary between suburbs mostly due to the city's topographical layout. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Dunedin features an oceanic climate. The city's climate is also influenced by its proximity to the ocean. This leads to mild summers and coolish winters. Winter is not particularly frosty with around 49 frosts per year, lower than most other South Island locations, but sunny. Snowfall is not particularly common but significant snowfall is uncommon (perhaps every two or three years), except in the inland hill suburbs such as Halfway Bush and Wakari, which tend to receive a few days of snowfall each year. Spring can feature \\"four seasons in a day\\" weather, but from November to April it is generally settled and mild. Temperatures during summer can reach . Due to its maritime influence, Dunedin's mild summers and mild winters both stand out considering its latitude. Dunedin has relatively low rainfall in comparison to many of New Zealand's cities, with usually only between 600 and recorded per year. Despite this fact it is sometimes misguidedly regarded as a damp city, probably due to its rainfall occurring in drizzle or light rain (heavy rain is relatively rare). Dunedin is one of the cloudiest major centres in the country, recording approximately 1,850 hours of bright sunshine per annum. Prevailing wind in the city is mainly a sometimes cool southwesterly and during late spring will alternate with northeasterlies. Warmer, dry northwest winds are also characteristic Foehn winds from the northwest. The circle of hills surrounding the inner city shelters the inner city from much of the prevailing weather, while hills just to the west of the city can often push inclement weather around to the west of the city. Inland, beyond the heart of the city and into inland Otago the climate is sub- continental: winters are quite cold and dry, summers warm and dry. Thick freezing ground fogs are common in winter in the upper reaches of the Taieri River's course around Middlemarch, and in summer the temperature occasionally reaches . Demographics The city has a population of Compared to New Zealand as a whole, Dunedin's demographics tend to show traits of the New Zealand education sector, largely caused by the city's high tertiary student population. These traits include a higher female population compared to males, a lower-than-average median age, a high proportion of people under 25 years, a higher proportion of people of European and Asian ethnicity and a lower proportion of MƒÅori and Pacific Island ethnicities, higher unemployment, lower median income, and a higher proportion of those with school and post-school qualifications. Dunedin City had a population of 126,255 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 6,006 people (5.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 7,572 people (6.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 48,336 households. There were 60,762 males and 65,490 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.93 males per female. Of the total population, 19,914 people (15.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 33,549 (26.6%) were 15 to 29, 52,509 (41.6%) were 30 to 64, and 20,289 (16.1%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 86.6% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.3% MƒÅori, 3.2% Pacific peoples, 7.8% Asian, and 2.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 19.7, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 56.0% had no religion, 32.5% were Christian, and 5.2% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 26,910 (25.3%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 16,749 (15.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $25,500. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 45,888 (43.2%) people were employed full-time, 17,940 (16.9%) were part-time, and 4,596 (4.3%) were unemployed. Culture First Church of Otago Phone booths in Central Dunedin =Literature= In December 2014 Dunedin was designated as a UNESCO Creative City of Literature. Mayor of Dunedin Dave Cull said at the time \\"This announcement puts our city on the world map as a first-class literary city. We keep honourable company; other cities bestowed with City of Literature status include Edinburgh, Dublin, Iowa City, Melbourne, Reykjav√≠k, Norwich and Krak√≥w.\\" Dunedin's application was driven by a steering committee and an advisory board of writers, librarians and academics from a range of Dunedin institutions. The bid highlighted the quality of the city's considerable literary heritage, its diverse combination of literary events, businesses, institutions and organisations, plus its thriving community of writers, playwrights and lyricists. UNESCO established the Creative Cities Network to develop international co-operation among cities and encourage them to drive joint development partnerships in line with UNESCO's global priorities of 'culture and development' and 'sustainable development'. Each city in the network reflects one of UNESCO's seven Creative City themes: folk art, gastronomy, literature, design, film or music. Dunedin is New Zealand's first city to be appointed to the Creative City network. =Music=Choirs Dunedin is home to many choirs. These include the following: * The 140-member City of Dunedin Choir is Dunedin's leading performer of large-scale choral works. * The Southern Consort of Voices is a smaller choir regularly performing Choral Works. * The Royal Dunedin Male Choir, conducted by Richard Madden, performs two concerts a year * The Dunedin RSA Choir regularly performs concerts and has played an important and valued role in Dunedin City's commemorative celebrations of significant historical events. ANZAC, of course, is one such occasion, and the ANZAC Revue held on the evening of every ANZAC Day, occupies a special place of honour in the choir's calendar. * The all-female Dunedin Harmony Chorus are an important part of the Dunedin culture. * The Southern Children's Choir, based in Marama Hall in the university, is Dunedin's main children's choir. Most schools in Dunedin have choirs, many having more than one. * The Southern Youth Choir is a concert-based youth choir. * The University of Otago is home to three official choirs: the two chapel choirs (Knox and Selwyn), and the travelling Cantores choir. * Several Dunedin Churches and Cathedrals hold choirs. Among these are St. Joseph's Catholic Cathedral, home to two choirs: the Cathedral Choir and the Gabrieli Singers; Knox Church's large mixed gender choir for adults and children, the Knox Church Choir; All Saints' Church, Dunedin, has choral scholars from Selwyn College, Otago, St. John's Church, Roslyn's small mixed-gender parish choir; and St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral's mixed-gender adult choir. * The Dunedin Red Cross Choir (of New Zealand Red Cross), conducted by Eleanor Moyle, is one of only three Red Cross choirs globally. Established in 1942, this choir performs regularly in Dunedin at various Rest Homes and holds an annual concert at the Kings and Queens Performing Arts Centre. Instrumental classical and jazz ensembles The Dunedin Symphony Orchestra is a semi-professional orchestra based in Dunedin. Other instrumental ensembles include the Rare Byrds early music ensemble, the Collegiate Orchestra, and the Dunedin Youth Orchestra. Many schools also hold school orchestras and bands. There are also three brass bands in Dunedin: St. Kilda Brass, Kaikorai Brass, and Mosgiel Brass. The Otago Symphonic Band and City of Dunedin Pipe Band are also important Dunedin musical ensembles. Popular music Dunedin lends its name to the Dunedin sound, a form of indie rock music which was created in the city in the 1980s. Some Dunedin bands recorded on the Flying Nun Records label, based in Christchurch. Among the bands with Dunedin connections were The Chills, The Clean, The Verlaines, The Bats, Sneaky Feelings, The Dead C and Straitjacket Fits, all of which had significant followings throughout New Zealand and on the college radio circuit in the United States and Europe. Dunedin has been home to bands since the end of the Dunedin sound era. Six60, Nadia Reid and Julian Temple Band are Dunedin artists. =Sport=Major teams * Highlanders ‚Äì Super Rugby rugby union team who are the Super Rugby champions of 2015 (represents Otago, Southland and North Otago Rugby Unions) * Otago Rugby Football Union ‚Äì Mitre 10 Cup rugby union team * Otago Volts and Otago Sparks ‚Äì men's and women's cricket teams * Southern Steel ‚Äì ANZ Championship netball team (represents Otago & Southland Netball ‚Äì Based in Invercargill) * Southern United ‚Äì association football team in the New Zealand Football Championship * Otago Nuggets ‚Äì National Basketball League team * Dunedin Thunder ‚Äì New Zealand Ice Hockey League team Grounds and stadiums Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin North * Caledonian Ground * Carisbrook (now defunct) * Dunedin Ice Stadium * The Edgar Centre * Forbury Park Raceway * Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza * Logan Park * Moana Pool * Tonga Park * University Oval ‚Äì Notable for being the southernmost venue on the planet that hosts Test Cricket. =Theatre= Fortune Theatre laid claim to being the world's southernmost professional theatre company Dunedin till 2018 hosted the world's southernmost professional theatre company: The Fortune Theatre, as well as having a large theatre venue, the Regent Theatre in the Octagon. Smaller theatres in Dunedin include the Globe Theatre, the Mayfair Theatre, the New Athenaeum Theatre, and the Playhouse Theatre. =Visual arts= Dunedin has a substantial public art gallery, the Dunedin Public Art Gallery, in the Octagon. The city contains numerous other galleries, including over a dozen dealer galleries, many of which are found south of the Octagon along Princes Street, Moray Place and Dowling Street. There are also several more experimental art spaces, notably the Blue Oyster in Dowling Street. Many notable artists have strong links with Dunedin, among them Ralph Hotere, Frances Hodgkins, Grahame Sydney, and Jeffrey Harris. =Marae= Dunedin has three marae (meeting grounds) for NgƒÅi Tahu, each with its own wharenui (meeting house). Arai te Uru marae in Wakari includes the Arai te Uru wharenui. ≈åtƒÅkou Marae in Otakou includes the Tamatea wharenui. Huirapa / Puketeraki marae in KaritƒÅne includes the Huirapa wharenui. =Honors= Asteroid 101461 Dunedin discovered by British astronomer Ian P. Griffin in 1998, was named in honor of the city. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 (). Government The Dunedin Town Hall =Local= Aaron Hawkins, Mayor of Dunedin The Dunedin City Council (DCC) governs the Dunedin City territorial authority. It is made up of an elected mayor (currently Aaron Hawkins since 12 October 2019) and fourteen additional councillors elected across three wards, one of whom gets chosen as deputy mayor. Coat of arms and flag The city's coat of arms, which were granted in 1947 by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, are emblazoned as: Argent above a Fess Dancette Vert, a Castle Triple-Towered sable on a Rock issuing from the Fess, Masoned Argent, with Windows, Vanes and Portcullis Gules. In the base a Three-Masted Lymphad with Sail Furled Azure, Flagged of Scotland, a Ram's Head Affrontee Horned Or between Two Garbs of the last. The supporters are blazoned as: On the Dexter a Scotsman Habited with Philabeg and Plaid of the Clan Cameron, supporting in His Exterior Hand a Cromach; on the Sinister a Maori Chief attired in Korowai, Two Huia Feathers in his hair, an Aurei and a Hei Matau and in His Exterior hand a Taiaha. All Proper. The castle is taken from the arms of Edinburgh, while the green fess and garb/animals signify regional agriculture and crops. At the base, the lymphad, or ship, alludes to the arrival of Scottish immigrants to the Otago region. The supporters represent the original MƒÅori owners of the land and its Scottish purchasers. All of the elements of the arms are crowned with a mural crown, emblematic of local government. Their motto is: Maiorum Institutis Utendo, or in English, By following in the steps of our forefathers. The flag of the city of Dunedin is a banner of arms in white and green and featuring the castle, lymphad, ram's head and wheat sheafs as on the coat of arms. =National= Dunedin is covered by two general electorates: Dunedin North and Dunedin South, and one MƒÅori electorate: Te Tai Tonga. The city in general is a stronghold of the New Zealand Labour Party, having won the Dunedin-based electorate seats continuously since the 1978 election. As of the 2017 general election, both general electorates are held by the party, with David Clark representing Dunedin North and Clare Curran representing Dunedin South. Te Tai Tonga (which covers the entire South Island and part of Wellington in the North Island) is currently also held by the Labour Party and represented by Rino Tirikatene. In addition to electorate MPs, Michael Woodhouse of the National Party is a Dunedin-based list MP.  Media  The major daily newspaper is the Otago Daily Times, which is also the country's oldest daily newspaper and part of the Allied Press group. Weekly and bi-weekly community newspapers include The Star, Taieri Herald, the fortnightly street press POINT, and student magazines Critic (University of Otago) and Gyro (Otago Polytechnic). The city is served by all major national radio and television stations. The city's main terrestrial television and FM radio transmitter sits atop Mount Cargill, north of the city, while the city's main AM transmitter is located at Highcliff, east of the city centre on the Otago Peninsula. Local radio stations include Radio Dunedin, community station Otago Access Radio (formerly Hills AM, then Toroa Radio), and the university radio station, Radio One. The city has one local television station, Dunedin Television, part of Allied Press. The city is home to several prominent media-related production companies, notably Natural History New Zealand and Taylormade Media. Dunedin was the location of one of the four television broadcasting installations established in the sixties by the NZBC, operating under the name DNTV2. The city was once home to the head offices of Radio Otago‚Äînow called RadioWorks (part of Mediaworks) and based in Auckland. It was also formerly the home to several now-defunct newspapers, prominent among which were the Otago Witness and the Evening Star.  Education  The University of Otago, considered one of the world's most beautiful university campuses Otago Boys' High School = Secondary = Dunedin is home to 12 secondary schools: eight state and four state- integrated. The oldest secondary school is state-run Otago Boys' High School, founded in 1863. Its sister school, Otago Girls' High School (1871) is the oldest state girls' secondary school in New Zealand, even though it preceded the state education system by six years. Other state schools include Bayfield High School, Kaikorai Valley College and Logan Park High School. King's High School and Queen's High School are single-sex schools based in St Clair, and Taieri College in Mosgiel. The four state-integrated schools are Columba College, a Presbyterian girls' school; St. Hilda's Collegiate School, an Anglican girls' school; John McGlashan College, a Presbyterian boys' school; and Kavanagh College, a Catholic coeducational school. = Tertiary = * University of Otago  Dunedin College of Education * Otago Polytechnic Infrastructure and services= Public health and hospitals = Publicly funded primary health and hospital services are provided by the Southern District Health Board (Southern DHB). Dunedin Public Hospital is the main public hospital in Dunedin. Other hospitals include: * Mercy Hospital - a private non-profit hospital opened in 1936 and relocated to Maori Hill in 1969 * Wakari Hospital The Dunedin Public Hospital and the Wakari Hospital, which are closely related, are operated by Southern DHB. Ambulance services are provided by St John New Zealand. = Utilities = Aurora Energy owns and operates the electricity distribution network servicing the city and the Taieri plains, while OtagoNet Joint Venture owns and operates the electricity distribution network in the rural areas north and west of the city. Electricity is primarily supplied from Transpower's national grid at two substations: Halfway Bush and South Dunedin, with part to the OtagoNet network also supplied from Transpower's Naseby substation in central Otago.  Transport =Road= The Dunedin urban area is served by two state highways, with an additional two state highways and one tourist route serving other parts of the district. The main state highway in Dunedin is State Highway 1, which runs in a north to south-west direction through the middle of the city, connecting Dunedin with Invercargill to the south and Timaru and Christchurch to the north. Between The Oval and Mosgiel, State Highway 1 follows the eleven-kilometre Dunedin Southern Motorway. State Highway 88 connects central Dunedin to the city's port facilities at Port Chalmers. Other State Highways in the city are: State Highway 86 connecting SH 1 at Allanton with Dunedin International Airport, State Highway 87 connecting SH 1 at Kinmont with SH 85 at Kyeburn via Middlemarch, serving the Dunedin city hinterland. Dunedin is the northeastern terminus of the Southern Scenic Route, a tourist highway connecting Dunedin to Te Anau via The Catlins, Invercargill and Fiordland. Designline-built buses, operated by Citibus (now Go Bus) on Dunedin urban routes =Bus= Buses in Dunedin are organised by the Otago Regional Council. A total of 64 buses operate on 17 weekday routes and 13 weeknight/weekend/holiday routes across the city. Buses are run by two operators, Ritchies Transport with three routes and Go Bus Transport with the remainder. Dunedin City Council-owned operator Citibus was a major player until 2011 when Passenger Transport (New Zealand) purchased Citibus from Dunedin City Holdings, and both companies were subsequently bought by Go Bus. =Rail= Dunedin Railway Station, located east of the Octagon, is the city's main railway station. Once the nation's busiest, decline in rail over the years saw the withdrawal of most services. Suburban services ceased in 1982, and the last regular commercial passenger train to serve Dunedin, The Southerner, was cancelled in February 2002. The Taieri Gorge Railway currently operates tourist-oriented services from the station, the most prominent of which is the Taieri Gorge Limited, a popular and famous train operated daily along the former Otago Central Railway through the scenic Taieri Gorge. Taieri Gorge Railway also operates to Palmerston once weekly. The station is also sometimes visited by excursions organised by other heritage railway societies, and by trains chartered by cruise ships docking at Port Chalmers. =Air= Dunedin International Airport ‚Äì an Air New Zealand 737 lands on the runway while an Air New Zealand A320 waits on the taxiway Dunedin International Airport is located southwest of the city, on the Taieri Plains at Momona. The airport operates a single terminal and runway, and is the third-busiest airport in the South Island, after Christchurch and Queenstown. It is primarily used for domestic flights, with regular flights to and from Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and charter flights to and from Queenstown, Wanaka, and Invercargill, but it also has international flights arriving from and departing to Brisbane year round. In recent years, a decline in international passengers can be attributed to fewer international flights operating direct to the airport. =Sea= A ferry operates between Port Chalmers and Portobello it started in 2018 and is the first since the early 20th century. Occasional calls have been made to revive them, and a non-profit organisation, Otago Ferries Inc., has been set up to examine the logistics of restoring one of the original ferries and again using it for this route. In 1866, plans were made for a bridge across the Otago Harbour between Port Chalmers and Portobello, but this grand scheme for an 1140-metre structure never eventuated. Plans were also mooted during the 1870s for a canal between the Pacific coast at Tomahawk and Andersons Bay, close to the head of the harbour. This scheme also never came to fruition.

The Tsirelson space is reflexive. It was introduced by B. S. Tsirelson in 1974. The same year, Figiel and Johnson published a related article () where they used the notation T for the dual of Tsirelson's example. Today, the letter T is the standard notationsee for example , p. 8; , p. 95; The Handbook of the Geometry of Banach Spaces, vol. 1, p. 276; vol. 2, p. 1060, 1649. for the dual of the original example, while the original Tsirelson example is denoted by T*. In T* or in T, no subspace is isomorphic, as Banach space, to an ‚Ñì p space, 1 ‚â§ p < ‚àû, or to c0. All classical Banach spaces known to , spaces of continuous functions, of differentiable functions or of integrable functions, and all the Banach spaces used in functional analysis for the next forty years, contain some ‚Ñì p or c0. Also, new attempts in the early '70ssee , . to promote a geometric theory of Banach spaces led to ask The question is formulated explicitly in , , on last page. , p. 95, say that this question was \\"a long standing open problem going back to Banach's book\\" (), but the question does not appear in Banach's book. However, Banach compares the linear dimension of ‚Ñì p to that of other classical spaces, a somewhat similar question. whether or not every infinite-dimensional Banach space has a subspace isomorphic to some ‚Ñì p or to c0. The radically new Tsirelson construction is at the root of several further developments in Banach space theory: the arbitrarily distortable space of Schlumprecht (), on which depend Gowers' solution to Banach's hyperplane problemThe question is whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space is isomorphic to its hyperplanes. The negative solution is in Gowers, \\"A solution to Banach's hyperplane problem\\". Bull. London Math. Soc. 26 (1994), 523-530. and the Odell-Schlumprecht solution to the distortion problem. Also, several results of Argyros et al.for example, S. Argyros and V. Felouzis, \\"Interpolating Hereditarily Indecomposable Banach spaces\\", Journal Amer. Math. Soc., 13 (2000), 243‚Äì294; S. Argyros and A. Tolias, \\"Methods in the theory of hereditarily indecomposable Banach spaces\\", Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 170 (2004), no. 806. are based on ordinal refinements of the Tsirelson construction, culminating with the solution by Argyros-Haydon of the scalar plus compact problem.S. Argyros and R. Haydon constructed a Banach space on which every bounded operator is a compact perturbation of a scalar multiple of the identity, in \\"A hereditarily indecomposable L‚àû-space that solves the scalar- plus-compact problem\\", Acta Mathematica (2011) 206: 1-54.  Tsirelson's construction  On the vector space ‚Ñì‚àû of bounded scalar sequences , let Pn denote the linear operator which sets to zero all coordinates xj of x for which j ‚â§ n. A finite sequence \\\\\\\\{x_n\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^N of vectors in ‚Ñì‚àû is called block-disjoint if there are natural numbers \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{a_n, b_n\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^N so that a_1 \\\\leq b_1 < a_2 \\\\leq b_2 < \\\\cdots \\\\leq b_N, and so that (x_n)_i=0 when i or i>b_n, for each n from 1 to N. The unit ball B‚àû of ‚Ñì‚àû is compact and metrizable for the topology of pointwise convergence (the product topology). The crucial step in the Tsirelson construction is to let K be the smallest pointwise closed subset of B‚àû satisfying the following two properties:conditions b, c, d here are conditions (3), (2) and (4) respectively in , and a is a modified form of condition (1) from the same article. :a. For every integer j in N, the unit vector ej and all multiples \\\\lambda e_j, for Œª ‚â§ 1, belong to K. :b. For any integer N ‚â• 1, if \\\\textstyle (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_N) is a block-disjoint sequence in K, then \\\\textstyle{{1\\\\over2}P_N(x_1 + \\\\cdots + x_N)} belongs to K. This set K satisfies the following stability property: :c. Together with every element x of K, the set K contains all vectors y in ‚Ñì‚àû such that y ‚â§ x (for the pointwise comparison). It is then shown that K is actually a subset of c0, the Banach subspace of ‚Ñì‚àû consisting of scalar sequences tending to zero at infinity. This is done by proving that :d: for every element x in K, there exists an integer n such that 2 Pn(x) belongs to K, and iterating this fact. Since K is pointwise compact and contained in c0, it is weakly compact in c0. Let V be the closed convex hull of K in c0. It is also a weakly compact set in c0. It is shown that V satisfies b, c and d. The Tsirelson space T* is the Banach space whose unit ball is V. The unit vector basis is an unconditional basis for T* and T* is reflexive. Therefore, T* does not contain an isomorphic copy of c0. The other ‚Ñì p spaces, 1 ‚â§ p < ‚àû, are ruled out by condition b.  Properties  The Tsirelson space is reflexive () and finitely universal, which means that for some constant , the space contains -isomorphic copies of every finite-dimensional normed space, namely, for every finite-dimensional normed space , there exists a subspace of the Tsirelson space with multiplicative Banach-Mazur distance to less than . Actually, every finitely universal Banach space contains almost-isometric copies of every finite- dimensional normed space,this is because for every , and Œµ, there exists such that every -isomorph of ‚Ñì‚àû contains a -isomorph of ‚Ñì‚àûn, by James' blocking technique (see Lemma 2.2 in Robert C. James \\"Uniformly Non-Square Banach Spaces\\", Annals of Mathematics, Vol. 80, 1964, pp. 542-550), and because every finite-dimensional normed space -embeds in ‚Ñì‚àû when is large enough. meaning that can be replaced by for every . Also, every infinite-dimensional subspace of is finitely universal. On the other hand, every infinite-dimensional subspace in the dual of contains almost isometric copies of \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\ell^1_n}, the -dimensional ‚Ñì1-space, for all . The Tsirelson space is distortable, but it is not known whether it is arbitrarily distortable. The space is a minimal Banach space.see , p. 54. This means that every infinite-dimensional Banach subspace of contains a further subspace isomorphic to . Prior to the construction of , the only known examples of minimal spaces were ‚Ñì p and 0. The dual space is not minimal.see , p. 56. The space is polynomially reflexive.  Derived spaces  The symmetric Tsirelson space S(T) is polynomially reflexive and it has the approximation property. As with T, it is reflexive and no ‚Ñì p space can be embedded into it. Since it is symmetric, it can be defined even on an uncountable supporting set, giving an example of non-separable polynomially reflexive Banach space.

From his office in the Palace of Justice in Palermo, Sicily, he spent most of his professional life trying to overthrow the power of the Sicilian Mafia. After a long and distinguished career, culminating in the Maxi Trial in 1986‚Äì1987, on 19 July 1992, Borsellino was killed by a car bomb in Via D'Amelio, near his mother's house in Palermo. Borsellino's life parallels that of his close friend Giovanni Falcone. They both spent their early years in the same neighbourhood in Palermo. Though many of their childhood friends grew up in the Mafia background, both men fought on the other side of the war against crime in Sicily as prosecuting magistrates.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, pp. 22-27 They were both killed in 1992, a few months apart. In recognition of their tireless effort and sacrifice during the anti-mafia trials, they were both awarded the Italian \\"Medaglia d'oro al valore civile\\" (Gold medal for civil valour). They were also named as heroes of the last 60 years in the 13 November 2006 issue of Time Magazine. Early life Borsellino was born in a middle-class Palermo neighbourhood, Kalsa, a neighborhood of central Palermo which suffered extensive destruction by aerial attacks during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. His father was a pharmacist and his mother ran a pharmacy in the Via della Vetriera, next to the house where Paolo was born. As boys Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone ‚Äì later a magistrate, who was born in the same neighbourhood ‚Äì played soccer together on the Piazza Magione. The Mafia was present in the area but quiescent. Both had classmates who ended up as mafiosi.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, pp. 22-27Giovanni Falcone, Paolo Borsellino and the Procura of Palermo , Peter Schneider & Jane Schneider, May 2002, essay is based on excerpts from Chapter Six of Jane Schneider and Peter Schneider, Reversible Destiny: Mafia, Antimafia, and the Struggle for Palermo , Berkeley: University of California PressObituary: Paolo Borsellino , The Independent, July 21, 1992 The house where he was born was declared unsafe and the family was forced to move out in 1956. The pharmacy remained, while the neighbourhood around it crumbled. Borsellino and Falcone met again at Palermo University. While Borsellino tended towards the right and became a member of the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale (FUAN), a right-wing university organization affiliated with the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, Falcone drifted away from his parents' middle-class conservative Catholicism towards communism. However, neither joined a political party, and although the ideologies of those political movements were diametrically opposed, they shared a history of opposing the Mafia. Their different political leanings did not thwart their friendship. Both decided to join the magistrature. Borsellino obtained a degree in law at the University of Palermo, with honours, in 1962. After his father's death, he passed the judiciary exam in 1963. During those years, he worked in many cities in Sicily (Enna in 1965, Mazara del Vallo in 1967, Monreale in 1969). After he married in 1968, he transferred to his native Palermo in 1975 together with Rocco Chinnici, where he got involved in investigation into Sicilian Mafia. First Mafia investigations Neither Borsellino nor Falcone had intended to get involved in the struggle against the Mafia. They were assigned cases involving the Mafia that continued to expand and became disturbed by what they discovered. They saw colleagues murdered fighting the Mafia and it became increasingly impossible to turn back.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 51 One of his accomplishments was the arrest of six Mafia members in 1980, including Leoluca Bagarella, the brother- in-law of Mafia boss Salvatore Riina. His close co-investigator, Carabinieri captain Emanuele Basile, was murdered by the Mafia the same year. Borsellino was assigned to investigate the murder and became a special target when he signed the arrest warrant for Francesco Madonia on a charge of ordering the murder of Basile.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, pp. 47-51Follain, Vendetta, p. 144 He was assigned police protection.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 78 Antimafia Pool Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. The picture of both assassinated judges became an iconic symbol of the struggle against Cosa Nostra. It is often used on posters and articles commemorating the fight against the Mafia. Sheets exposed in solidarity with Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. They read: \\"You did not kill them: their ideas walk on our legs\\". During those years, working together with magistrates Falcone and Chinnici, Borsellino continued his research about the Mafia and its links to political and economical powers in Sicily and Italy. He became part of Palermo's Antimafia Pool, created by Chinnici. The Antimafia pool was a group of investigating magistrates who closely worked together sharing information to diffuse responsibility and to prevent one person from becoming the sole institutional memory and solitary target. The group consisted of Falcone, Borsellino, Giuseppe Di Lello and Leonardo Guarnotta. In 1983, Rocco Chinnici was killed by a bomb in his car. His place in the Antimafia Pool was taken by Antonino Caponnetto. The group pooled together several investigations into the Mafia, which would result in the Maxi Trial against the Mafia starting in February 1986 and which lasted until December 1987. A total of 475 mafiosi were indicted for a multitude of crimes relating to Mafia activities. Most were convicted and, to the surprise of many, the convictions were upheld several years later in January 1992, after the final stage of appeal. The importance of the trial was that the existence of Cosa Nostra was finally judicially confirmed. In 1986, Borsellino became head of the Public Prosecution Office of Marsala, continuing his personal campaign against the Mafia bosses, in the most populated city of the province of Trapani. His links with Falcone, who remained in Palermo, allowed him to cover the entirity of Western Sicily for investigations. In 1987, after Caponnetto resigned due to illness, Borsellino was protagonist of a great protest about the unsuccessful nomination of his friend Falcone as head of the Antimafia Pool. Last months On 23 May 1992, Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards were killed by a bomb planted under the highway outside of Palermo. Giovanni Brusca later claimed that 'boss of bosses' Salvatore Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone, there were indirect negotiations with the government. Former interior minister Nicola Mancino later said this was not true.Folain, Vendetta, p. 150 In July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial on charges of withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia and the killings of Falcone and Borsellino.Italy: Ex-interior minister implicated in mafia negotiations , AND Kronos International, 25 July 2012 Some prosecutors have theorized that Borsellino was killed because he had found out about the negotiations.Follain, Vendetta, p. 187 Borsellino failed to get himself appointed to the investigation into Falcone's murder. At a public meeting on 25 June 1992, he said that he had certain information which might explain why Falcone was killed. Borsellino unofficially asked Carabinieri Colonel Mario Mori to resume a previous investigation by Falcone into Mafia control of public works contracts. However, Mori, unbeknownst to Borsellino, was involved in secret meetings with Vito Ciancimino, who was close to Riina's lieutenant Bernardo Provenzano. Mori was later investigated on suspicion of posing a danger to the state after it was alleged he prevented the arrest of Provenzano and had taken a list of Riina's demands that Ciancimino had passed on. He maintained he had spoken to Ciancimino to further investigation of the Mafia, that Ciancimino had disclosed little beyond implicitly admitting he knew Mafia members, and that key meetings were after Borsellino's death.Follain, Vendetta, p. 44 & pp. 187-8 In 2014 Italy‚Äôs president, Giorgio Napolitano, testified in a trial in which 10 defendants including the former interior minister, Nicola Mancino, were accused of negotiating with the Mafia. On 17 July 1992 Borsellino went to Rome where he was told by Gaspare Mutolo, a Mafia member turned informer, of two allegedly corrupt officials: Bruno Contrada, former head of Palermo Flying Squad, now working for the secret service (SISDE), and anti-Mafia prosecutor Domenico Signorino. Borsellino considered Signorino a friend and was deeply troubled by the allegation. He was further disconcerted when the meeting was interrupted by a call from the Minister of the Interior, Nicola Mancino, requesting his immediate presence. Borsellino attended to discover that Contrada was there, and knew about the supposedly secret meeting with the informer.Folain, Vendetta, pp. 144-145 Death On 19 July 1992, Borsellino was killed by a car bomb in Via D'Amelio, near his mother's house in Palermo, less than two months after the death of his good friend Falcone. The bomb attack also claimed the lives of five police officers: Agostino Catalano, Walter Cosina, Emanuela Loi (the first Italian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty), Vincenzo Li Muli and Claudio Traina.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 372 In his last video interview, given on 21 May 1992 to Jean Pierre Moscardo and Fabrizio Calvi, Borsellino spoke about the possible link between Cosa Nostra's mafiosi and rich Italian businessmen such as future Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. L'ultima intervista a Paolo Borsellino The interview received little coverage on Italian television ; as of 2007, it has been aired on only one occasion, and that by a satellite channel RaiNews 24 in 2000, in an abridged version which is a mere 30 minutes long (it is 50 minutes long in its original form). =Investigation= Palermo police accused Vincenzo Scarantino, a petty offender, of carrying out the bombing while acting on the orders of Salvatore Riina. Riina, head of the Corleonesi Mafia Family and effective leader of Cosa Nostra at the time, served a life sentence in prison for sanctioning the murders of Borsellino and Falcone, along with Bernardo Provenzano, Pippo Cal√≤, Salvatore Biondino, Pietro Aglieri, Michelangelo La Barbera, Raffaele and Domenico Ganci, Francesco Madonia, Giuseppe Montalto, Giuseppe and Filippo Graviano, Carlo Greco, Francesco Tagliavia, amongst others. Via D‚ÄôAmelio, 19 luglio 1992 , Polizia e Democrazia, July‚ÄìAugust 2002 Despite Scarantino confessing, one prosecutor resigned because of her strong reservations about the veracity of his statements, which his family said he had been coerced into making. Police were also accused of giving him details of the crime to learn so he could provide those details in official statements to corroborate his testimony. Forty seven people were convicted on Scarantino's word nonetheless. The lead investigator who supposedly solved the case was made head of Rome CID soon afterward, but is now suspected of having fabricated the evidence to get promotion. He was also involved with the Italian secret service.Follain 198-200 Case re-opened As with many high- profile cases in Italy, the case was reopened. The prosecutor in Caltanissetta reopened investigations after Gaspare Spatuzza, a Mafia killer who became a state witness (pentito) in 2008, admitted he stole the Fiat 126 used for the car bomb in the Via D‚ÄôAmelio attack. His admission contradicted the declarations of Vincenzo Scarantino, who had confessed earlier to stealing the car and whose testimony was the main evidence in previous trials. When confronted with Spatuzza‚Äôs statement, Scarantino admitted that he had repeated what some investigating officers had forced him to tell the magistrates.Police Officers Investigated for Misdirecting Inquiries into Borsellino Killings , Corriere della Sera, July 29, 2009 Spatuzza's declaration led to the re- opening of the trial on Borsellino‚Äôs murder, which had been concluded in 2003. Si riapre il caso Borsellino , La Stampa, July 14, 2009 Spatuzza claims that his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, told him in 1994 that future Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political- electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi‚Äôs party Forza Italia, in exchange for certain guarantees ‚Äì such as to stop the 1993 Mafia bomb terror campaign, to force state institutions to moderate their crackdown against the Mafia after the murders of Antimafia magistrates Falcone and Borsellino. Berlusconi had entered politics and won his first term as Prime Minister in 1994. Berlusconi‚Äôs right-hand man Marcello Dell'Utri was the intermediary, according to Spatuzza. Dell'Utri has dismissed Spatuzza's allegations as \\"nonsense\\".Lawyer rejects turncoat's claims linking Berlusconi to mafia , Adnkronos International, October 23, 2009Mafia witness 'boasted of links to Silvio Berlusconi' , BBC News, December 4, 2009Silvio Berlusconi linked with Mafia bombing campaign , The Daily Telegraph, December 4, 2009 Spatuzza‚Äôs assertions back up previous statements of the pentito Antonino Giuffr√®, who said that the Graviano brothers were the intermediaries between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi. Cosa Nostra decided to back Berlusconi's Forza Italia party from its foundation in 1993, in exchange for help in resolving the Mafia's judicial problems. The Mafia turned to Forza Italia when its traditional contacts in the discredited Christian Democrat party proved unable to protect its members from the rigours of the law.Berlusconi implicated in deal with godfathers, The Guardian, December 5, 2002 \\"The statements given by Spatuzza about prime minister Berlusconi are baseless and can be in no way verified,\\" according to Berlusconi‚Äôs lawyer and MP for the People of Freedom party (Il Popolo della Libert√†, PdL), Niccol√≤ Ghedini. The alleged negotiations between Dell‚ÄôUtri and the Mafia followed an earlier attempt with Vito Ciancimino, the local political link for the Corleonesi clan, who supposedly had contacted government officials after the killing of Falcone to negotiate a stop to the killing spree. Borsellino apparently had been informed of the machinations.The mysteries of Italy , by Marco Travaglio, on Beppe Grillo‚Äôs blog, August 2010 Two former colleagues of Borsellino have told investigators about a meeting with Borsellino in Palermo shortly before his death during which he broke down in tears saying, \\"A friend has betrayed me, a friend has betrayed me.\\" \\"My brother‚Äôs death was a State murder,\\" Paolo‚Äôs brother Salvatore Borsellino claims. \\"My brother knew about the negotiations between the Mafia and the state, and this is why he was killed.\\"A Mafia Boss Breaks Silence on an Assassination , Time, August 3, 2009 Legacy Memorial tree dedicated to Borsellino, in Palermo Borsellino today is considered as one of the most important magistrates killed by the Sicilian Mafia and he is remembered as one of the main symbols of the battle of the State against the Mafia. Many schools and public buildings were named after him, including Palermo International Airport (subsequently renamed Falcone-Borsellino Airport) - a memorial by local sculptor Tommaso Geraci is there - and the Velodromo Paolo Borsellino multi-use stadium in Palermo. In recognition of their efforts in the anti-Mafia trials, he and Giovanni Falcone were named as heroes of the last 60 years in the 13 November 2006 issue of Time.

She was a pioneer in the field of childhood developmental disorders who advanced understanding of autism worldwide, introduced the term Asperger syndrome in 1976 and was involved in founding the National Autistic Society (NAS) in the UK. Early life She was born Lorna Gladys Tolchard to Bernard and Gladys Tolchard in Gillingham, Kent and, following education at Chatham Grammar School for Girls, commenced medical training at University College Hospital in 1949. After qualifying as a psychiatrist, her first post was at the Institute of Psychiatry, Maudsley Hospital, London (now part of King's College London). Academic career Wing trained as a medical doctor, specialising in psychiatry. Her focus changed to childhood developmental disorders in 1959. At that time autism was thought to affect around 5 in 10,000 children, but its prevalence in the 2010s was considered to be around 1 in 100 following the awareness raised by Wing and her followers. Her research, particularly with her collaborator Judith Gould, now underpins thinking in the field of autism. They initiated the Camberwell Case Register to record all patients using psychiatric services in this region of London. The data accumulated by this innovative approach gave Wing the basis for her influential insight that autism formed a spectrum, rather than clearly differentiated disorders. They also set up the Centre for Social and Communication Disorders, the first integrated diagnostic and advice service for these conditions in the UK. Wing was the author of many books and academic papers, including Asperger Syndrome: a Clinical Account, a February 1981 academic paper that popularised the research of Hans Asperger. Although groundbreaking and influential, Wing herself cautioned in her 1981 paper that \\"It must be pointed out that the people described by the present author all had problems of adjustment or superimposed psychiatric illnesses severe enough to necessitate referral to a psychiatric clinic ... (and) the series described here is probably biased towards those with more severe handicaps.\\" She joined with other parents of autistic children to found the organisation now known as the National Autistic Society in the United Kingdom in 1962. She was a consultant to NAS Lorna Wing Centre for Autism until she died. She was also President of Autism Sussex. Personal life Wing met her future husband (John Wing, 22 October 1923 ‚Äì 18 April 2010) while they were dissecting the same body as medical students. They married in 1951. She became involved in researching developmental disorders, particularly autistic spectrum disorders following their realisation that their daughter Susie (1956‚Äì2005) was autistic.Giulia Rhodes \\"Autism: a mother's labour of love\\", The Guardian, 24 May 2011 She died on 6 June 2014 in Kent.

At age , Forlani is currently the oldest living former Italian Prime Minister. Early life and career Arnaldo Forlani was born in Pesaro, Marche, from a middle-class family. In 1948, after the degree in law at the University of Urbino, Forlani began his political career, holding the position of provincial secretary of Christian Democracy for Pesaro; he was later elected in the municipal and provincial councils. In 1954 he became a member of the central committee of Christian Democracy. In the 1958 general election Forlani was elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time, representing the constituency of Ancona. In 1959, Forlani became one of the most prominent member of the DC faction led by Amintore Fanfani. In 1962 he was appointed vice-secretary of the party; he held this office until 1969, under three different secretaries, Aldo Moro, Mariano Rumor and Flaminio Piccoli. Christian Democratic secretary Arnaldo Forlani in 1972. In December 1968 he was appointed Minister of Public Shares in the government led by Mariano Rumor; in August 1969 he became Minister for the Relations with the United Nations, in the Rumor's second cabinet. In November 1969 Forlani was elected Secretary of the Christian Democracy with 157 votes in favor and 13 blank votes; after few days Ciriaco De Mita became his vice-secretary. During his secretariat, Forlani tried to avoid the disintegration of the center-left political alliance, undermined by the inability to react effectively to the economic and social difficulties of the period. He also tried to strength the Organic Centre-left coalition with the Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Republican Party. In November 1969, the Parliament approved the divorce law with a different majority from the one which supported the government; in fact the law was harshly opposed by the Christian Democrats, but also by the Italian Social Movement and the Monarchists. Prime Minister Rumor resigned in February 1970, but tried to rebuild a centre-left government in March 1970. Despite the political success for the first regional elections of June 1970, the third Rumor government did not survive the political and social tensions that shocked the country, especially after the general strike of July 1970.Autunno caldo e \\"anni di piombo\\": il sindacato milanese dinanzi alla crisi economica e istituzionale After Rumor's resignation, Emilio Colombo was appointed new Prime Minister at the head of a centre-left coalition. In the 1971 presidential election, Forlani proposed Amintore Fanfani as DC candidate as President of the Republic, but his allies strongly opposed this decision and Fanfani was not elected. Forlani's second candidate was Aldo Moro, but also this nomination was rejected by the Parliament. At the end, the DC proposed Giovanni Leone, former Prime Minister and long-time President of the Chamber of Deputies, who was elected with the support of the neo-fascist Social Movement. After few months the republicans withdrew their support to Colombo's government and the new appointed Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti did not reach to gain the confidence vote from the Parliament; snap elections were called for May 1972.I Governo Andreotti =1972 general election and DC Congress= In the general election, which took place on 7 May 1972, the DC, led by Forlani, remained stable with around 38% of the votes, as it happened to the Communist Party which obtained the same 27% of 1968.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1048 The Socialist Party continued in its decline, reducing to less than 10%. The most important growth was that of the post-fascist Italian Social Movement, which nearly doubled its votes from 4.5 to c. 9%, after that its leader Giorgio Almirante launched the formula of the \\"National Right\\", proposing his party as the sole group of the Italian right side. Incumbent Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, supported by secretary Forlani, tried to continue his centrist strategy, but his attempt only lasted a year. Former Premier Mariano Rumor so returned at the head of the government with his traditional centre-left alliance between Christian Democrats, Socialist, Democratic Socialist and Republicans. At the same time, during the 1973 National Congress, Forlani, who now opposed an alliance with the PSI, was not confirmed Secretary of the party, and his former mentor, Amintore Fanfani, became DC secretary once again. Member of the government In March 1973 Prime Minister Rumor was abandoned by the Republicans. He continued with a new squad, but he couldn't withstand the shocks deriving by the divorce referendum of 1974, when Christian Democrats, along with the neo- fascist MSI, intensely campaigned for a yes vote to abolish the law and make divorce illegal again, but their proposal was rejected by almost 60% of votes. =Minister of Defence= Forlani with Ciriaco De Mita and Benigno Zaccagnini in 1970 After the referendum, former Premier Aldo Moro persuaded the Socialists to accept a minority government composed only by the Christian Democrats and the Republicans. Forlani was appointed Minister of Defence by Moro. However, new problem arose from the regional elections of 1975, which marked a great success of the left, which consequently called for new national elections. In March 1976 Forlani run to the secretariat of the party, opposing Benigno Zaccagnini, incumbent secretary and member of the DC left-wing, who supported Moro's policy of accommodation with the Communists of Enrico Berlinguer, known as Historic Compromise. Forlani was supported by Andreotti, Fanfani, Flaminio Piccoli and Antonio Bisaglia, but he lost the congressional election and Zaccagnini remained Christian Democratic secretary. =Minister of Foreign Affairs= When the Republicans left Moro's cabinet in 1976, no possibilities of a new government remained, and an early vote was called. After the election, which saw a great success of the Communist Party, Andreotti became the new Prime Minister and Forlani was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs.III Governo Andreotti The reasons of this important nomination were, firstly, the necessity to recover a climate of unity in the party after the congressional divisions and, secondly, the opportunity, in a world still marked by the Cold War, to allocate foreign policy to a clearly anti-communist personality, as Forlani was, able to calm the European and American partners.La Civilit√† Cattolica During his ministry, Forlani strongly supported the European integration process, and the adhesion of Portugal to the European Economic Community.Biografia di Arnaldo Forlani Prime Minister of Italy An official portrait of Forlani during his premiership. In 1980 Forlani was among the main sponsor of Flaminio Piccoli in the party congress. Piccoli was elected Secretary at the head of a centre-right majority. Due to his fundamental role in Piccoli's election, Forlani was appointed Prime Minister of Italy, leading a centre to centre-left coalition with PSI, PSDI and PRI.Arnaldo Forlani ‚Äì Enciclopedia Treccani Forlani was considered an unflamboyant politician who attempted to stay out of the factionalism in his party, and was seen as the man who could re-unite DC. As Prime Minister he had to deal with corruption scandals within his party and a renewed bout of left- wing terrorism. =1980 Irpinia earthquake= During his premiership, Forlani had to face also the Irpinia earthquake, a strong shock, that was centered on the village of Conza in Campania, and left at least 2,483 people dead, at least 7,700 injured, and left 250,000 homeless. Forlani's government spent 59 trillion lire on reconstruction, while other nations sent contributions. West Germany contributed 32 million United States dollars (USD) and the United States US$70 million. However, in the early nineties a major corruption scandal emerged. Of the billions of lire that were predestined for aid to the victims and rebuilding, the largest part disappeared from the earthquake reconstruction funds in the 1980s. Of the $40 billion spent on earthquake reconstruction, an estimated $20 billion went to create an entirely new social class of millionaires in the region, $6.4 billion went to the Camorra, whereas another $4 billion went to politicians in bribes. Only the remaining $9.6 billion a quarter of the total amount, was actually spent on people's needs. Moreover, the Mafia entered the construction industry after the quake. =P2 scandal and resignation= During his presidency, the list of who belonged to the secret lodge P2 was published. The P2 was a Masonic lodge founded in 1945 that, by the time its Masonic charter was withdrawn in 1976, had transformed into a clandestine, pseudo-Masonic, ultraright organization operating in contravention of Article 18 of the Constitution of Italy that banned secret associations. In its latter period, during which the lodge was headed by Licio Gelli, P2 was implicated in numerous Italian crimes and mysteries, including the collapse of the Vatican-affiliated Banco Ambrosiano, the murders of journalist Mino Pecorelli and banker Roberto Calvi, and corruption cases within the nationwide bribe scandal Tangentopoli. P2 came to light through the investigations into the collapse of Michele Sindona's financial empire. P2 was sometimes referred to as a \\"state within a state\\"BBC On This Day: 26 May 1981 or a \\"shadow government\\".Jones, The Dark Heart of Italy, p. 187 The lodge had among its members prominent journalists, members of parliament, industrialists, and military leaders‚Äîincluding Silvio Berlusconi, who later became Prime Minister of Italy; the Savoy pretender to the Italian throne Victor Emmanuel; and the heads of all three Italian intelligence services (at the time SISDE, SISMI and CESIS). When searching Licio Gelli's villa in 1982, the police found a document called the \\"Plan for Democratic Rebirth\\", which called for a consolidation of the media, suppression of trade unions, and the rewriting of the Italian Constitution.Jones, The Dark Heart of Italy, p. 186 However, the lateness with which they were published gained Forlani heavy criticism, in particular from the Communist Party. He was therefore compelled to resign from the position, staying away from spotlight of politics for a certain period. With his resignation and the appointment of Republican leader Giovanni Spadolini, the unbroken line since 1945 of Christian Democratic Prime Ministers came to an end.Giovanni Spadolini ‚Äì Enciclopedia Treccani After the premiership Arnaldo Forlani with Giulio Andreotti. After his premiership Forlani remained an important politician. In 1981, at a Socialist Congress, Forlani and Socialist leader Bettino Craxi signed an agreement with the \\"blessing\\" of Giulio Andreotti. As the agreement was signed in a trailer, it was called the \\"pact of the camper.\\" The pact was also called \\"CAF\\" for the initials of the signers, Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani. With this agreement, the DC party recognized the equal dignity of the so-called \\"secular parties\\" of the majority (the Socialists, Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans) and also guaranteed an alternation of government. With the birth of the so-called Pentapartito, the possibility of the growth of the majority toward the Communist Party was finally dismissed. The Christian Democrats remained the leaders of the coalition, and managed several times to prevent representatives of the secular parties from becoming Prime Minister. In 1982, Forlani tried again to become DC Secretary, but he was defeated by his former deputy secretary Ciriaco De Mita, who was now supported also by Fanfani. After the loss, Forlani exited from Fanfani's faction and founded \\"Popular Action\\", along with Franco Maria Malfatti, Luciano Radi and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. However he succeeded in remaining the leader of the moderate faction of the Christian Democracy, continuing to be one of the most prominent politician in Italian politics. In 1983 the Socialist leader Bettino Craxi was appointed Prime Minister by President Sandro Pertini and Forlani became his Deputy Prime Minister.\\"Bravo Forlani\\", dicono PCI e PRI Second term as secretary In the 18th DC National Congress Forlani was elected secretary for a second time, with 85% of votes; while former secretary Ciriaco De Mita became Prime Minister. De Mita maintained the head of the government, despite the constant difficulties of relations with Bettino Craxi. The difficulties increased with the \\"Palermo case\\" when DC governed the city with Leoluca Orlando, allying with the Communists instead of the Socialists. Finally, Craxi withdrew the PSI's support to the government and De Mita was forced to resign on 19 May 1989. Forlani then managed the long-running government crisis that lasted until July, when Andreotti became Prime Minister leading a Pentapartito coalition. The CAF alliance remained the pivot of Italian politics for the rest of the legislature until the 1992 election. =1992 election and presidential ambitions= Arnaldo Forlani in 1992. On 17 February 1992, judge Antonio Di Pietro had Mario Chiesa, a member of the PSI, arrested for accepting a bribe from a Milan cleaning firm. The Italian Socialist Party distanced themselves from Chiesa. Craxi called Mario Chiesa mariuolo, or \\"villain\\", a \\"wild splinter\\" of the otherwise clean PSI. Upset over this treatment by his former colleagues, Chiesa began to give information about corruption implicating his colleagues. This marked the beginning of the Mani pulite investigation; news of political corruption began spreading in the press. In 1992 general election, the Christian Democracy, led by Forlani, lost many votes, but its coalition managed to keep a small majority. However the largest opposition party, the PCI, split after the fall of the Soviet Union and there was no opposition leadership. Many votes went to Lega Nord, a party that was not inclined to alliances at the time. In the presidential election of the same year, the Christian Democracy proposed Forlani as his candidate to the presidency of the Republic. However, during the 5th and 6th ballots, held on 16 May 1992, Forlani missed the election of 39 and 29 votes respectively. Following these defeats, Forlani withdrew his candidacy as President of the Republic. =Resignation and decline= The defeat in the presidential election, shortly after the dramatic general election, marked the conclusion of Forlani's political life, who, after other defeats in regional and administrative elections and involvement in Mani pulite scandal, in which he was charged of having received illegal funds, resigned as party Secretary in October 1992 and subsequently retired from politics.Eutanasia di un potere ‚Äì Storia della politica d'Italia da Tangentopoli alla Seconda Repubblica His former spokesman, Pier Ferdinando Casini, is considered Forlani's politics direct heir.

A member of the Christian Democracy (DC), he served as the 39th Prime Minister of Italy from December 1968 to August 1970 and again from July 1973 to November 1974.Scheda di attivit√† di Mariano Rumor, Senato della Repubblica As Prime Minister, he led five different governments, supported by various coalitions.Mariano Rumor, Italian statesman Rumor also served as Minister of Agriculture from 1959 to 1963, Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1974 to 1976 and Minister of the Interior in two brief periods, in 1963 and from 1972 to 1973. Rumor was also Secretary of the Christian Democracy from 1964 to 1969.Mariano Rumor ‚Äì Biografia, Storiologia Early life and career Mariano Rumor was born in Vicenza, Veneto on 16 June 1915. His father, Giuseppe Rumor, was the owner of a typography and promoter of a local magazine, \\"The Catholic Worker\\" founded by Rumor's grandfather. While her mother, Tina Nardi, came from a liberal family.Mariano Rumor ‚Äì Dizionario Biografico, Enciclopedia Treccani He attended the classical lyceum Antonio Pigafetta in Vicenza, then he earned a degree from the University of Padua in literature in 1939.Mariano Rumor ‚Äì Biografia, Cinquantamila After his graduation, Rumor became a teacher at an Italian lyceum until his mobilization as a lieutenant in the Italian Army during the Second World War. Subsequent to the Armistice of Cassibile in 1943 between Italy and the Allied powers, Rumor joined the Italian resistance movement.Mariano Rumor, Patrimonio dell'Archivio Storico del Senato della Repubblica After the end of the war, he was among the founders of the Christian Associations of Italian Workers (ACLI),Mariano Rumor e le ACLI vicentine, Franco Angeli the widespread lay Catholic associations, and joined the Christian Democracy (DC), of whom he became one of the main leaders in Veneto, very close to Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi. In the 1946 election, Rumor was elected with more than 29,000 votes to the Constituent Assembly, for the constituency of Verona‚ÄìPadova‚ÄìVicenza‚ÄìRovigo.Elezioni del 1946: Circoscrizione Verona‚ÄìPadova‚ÄìVicenza‚ÄìRovigo, Ministero dell'InternoEinaudi, Mario The Constitution of the Italian Republic The American Political Science Review vol. 42 no. 4 (pp. 661‚Äì676), August 1948 He became a member of the new-born Chamber of Deputies in 1948. The 1948 election was heavily influenced by the Cold War confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and are now best known for the covert political warfare waged by the US State Department and Central Intelligence Agency on behalf of the DC. The elections were eventually won with a comfortable margin by De Gasperi's Christian Democracy that defeated the left-wing coalition of the Popular Democratic Front, that comprised the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI).Ministry of the Interior ‚Äì 1948 Election Results As a deputy he became very close to Giuseppe Dossetti, becoming a member of his Christian leftist wing.Mariano Rumor, Memorie (1943‚Äì1970), p. 12 Political career=First roles in government= Rumor in 1953 In 1950, Guido Gonella succeeded Paolo Emilio Taviani as National Secretary of the DC; the target of the new secretariat was to build a unitary management of the party in support of the government led by Alcide De Gasperi. In this context, Rumor was nominated for the first time as National Deputy Secretary, together with Dossetti.Guido Gonella ‚Äì Dizionario Biografico, Enciclopedia Treccani The withdrawal from politics of Giuseppe Dossetti, left his faction without a charismatic leader; however, Mariano Rumor played a decisive role in the birth of the new faction, called \\"Democratic Initiative\\", which brought together not only Dossetti's followers, such as Giorgio La Pira, Amintore Fanfani and Aldo Moro, but also members of the centrist pro-De Gasperi majority, as Paolo Emilio Taviani and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.La stagione del centrismo, Francesco Malgeri, page 114 Rumor himself presented the manifesto of Democratic Initiative, published on a magazine with the same name.Il prezzo della democrazia In this text, alongside the declaration of support for De Gasperi and the Atlantic Pact, Dossetti's principles of a Christian reformist party were reaffirmed, with the aim of moving the country towards a \\"democratic evolution\\".La stagione del centrismo, Francesco Malgeri, page 100 Rumor immediately played a leading role in the faction. This position, led him to hold the first government posts, becoming Undersecretary for Agriculture in De Gasperi's seventh government, a position he also maintained in De Gasperi VIII Cabinet and, after De Gasperi's retirement in 1954, in the short-lived government led by Giuseppe Pella.Governo De Gasperi VII, governo.it In the brief first Fanfani government, from January to February 1954, Rumor was appointed to Secretary of the Council of Ministers.Composizione del Governo Fanfani I, Senato della Repubblica In 1954, after the National Congress of Naples, which saw the affirmation of Democratic Initiative and the subsequent election of Fanfani as party's Secretary, Rumor was elected again deputy secretary.VIII Congresso di Napoli, Della Repubblica He held this office for the next five years, until Democratic Initiative split up. In fact, many members of the faction, started criticizing the political line of Fanfani's secretariat, who cautiously began to open to the prospect of a collaboration with Italian Socialist Party (PSI).III Legislatura, Della Repubblica Prominent members of the faction, including Rumor himself, put the Secretary in minority during the National Congress of March 1959. In this way, Democratic Initiative split up between the followers of Fanfani and the dissident group, now renamed by all Dorotei (\\"Dorotheans\\"), from the place where they had gathered before the congress, the convent of the sisters of Santa Dorotea in Rome. The new faction was built around Antonio Segni, Mariano Rumor and Aldo Moro, who was elected new Secretary.I Dorotei, Archivio 900' In the same year, as one the faction's leaders, Rumor was appointment Minister of Agriculture, in the second Segni's government, a position he would keep in the governments of Fernando Tambroni, and Fanfani.II Governo Segni, Della Repubblica In this role, Rumor contributed to the definition of one of the first plans for the development and innovation of the national agricultural sector, the so-called \\"Green Plan\\".Le \\"mie carte\\". Inventario dell'archivio di Mariano Rumor Rumor and Giovanni Leone visiting the site of the Vajont Dam disaster In 1963 election, the DC suffered a sharp decline of consensus.Elezioni del 1963, Ministero dell'Interno Rumor was appointed Minister of the Interior in the short-lived government chaired by Giovanni Leone.I Governo Leone, camera.it As minister, he had to face one of the most tragic events in Italian republican history, the Vajont Dam disaster.Il 9 settembre 1963 il disastro del Vajont: commemorazioni in tutta la regione, Friuli Venezia Giulia On 9 October 1963, a landslide occurred on Monte Toc, in the province of Pordenone. The landslide caused a megatsunami in the artificial lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,917 deaths. In the previous months, the Adriatic Society of Electricity (SADE) and the Italian government, which both owned the dam, dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster.La cronaca del disastro e il processo, ANSA Immediately after the disaster, government and local authorities insisted on attributing the tragedy to an unexpected and unavoidable natural event. However, numerous warnings, signs of danger, and negative appraisals had been disregarded in the previous months and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it.La tragedia del Vajont, Rai Scuola The communist newspaper L'Unit√† was the first to denounce the actions of management and government. =Secretary of the Christian Democracy= Rumor during the 1967 Christian Democratic congress In January 1964, Rumor was elected Secretary of the Christian Democracy, holding the office until January 1969 and leading the party in a complex phase of government cooperation with the socialists.Mariano Rumor, Enciclopedia Treccani In the five years leading the DC, Rumor tried to reassure the moderate electorate, in an attempt to recover the consensus lost in the previous elections.I socialisti e la svolta politica del 1962, Mondoperaio Rumor embodied the typical characteristics of the Dorotheans: caution, moderation, the propensity for mediation rather than for decision, attention to practical and concrete topics, rather than to major strategies, the representation of the interests of the provincial middle class, the privileged link with the public administration, with the Catholic world and with direct farmers.Rumor, quando la politica era capace di includere, Avvenire In the general elections of 1968, the DC managed to increase its votes, albeit slightly, gaining 39% of votes.Elezioni del 1968, Ministero dell'Interno This result was experienced as a success by the Rumor secretariat and he became a natural candidate for the leadership of the government. =First term as Prime Minister= On 12 December 1968, Mariano Rumor sworn is as Prime Minister for the first time, leading a government composed by Christian democrats, Socialists and Republicans.Governo Rumor I During his first term as Prime Minister, a number of progressive reforms were carried out. A law of 11 December 1969 extended access to higher education to all students holding a higher secondary school diploma. It was formerly limited to students who came from classical, and in some cases, scientific, curricula. A bill, approved on 30 April 1969 introduced broad provisions covering pensions under the general scheme. The multiplying coefficient was increased to 1.85%, applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 5 years of work (maximum pension, after 40 years of contribution: 74% of previous earnings). A social pension was also introduced for people over the age of 65 with low incomes and not eligible for any type of pension. In addition, cost of living indexation for all pensions (with the exception of social pensions) was introduced. A law of 2 February 1970 extended earnings replacement benefits to artisan undertakings in the construction industry.La DC ricorda Mariano Rumor, Imola Oggi Mariano Rumor speaks to the Chamber of Deputies in 1970 In foreign policy, Rumor signed, on 28 January 1969, of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However his first term as Prime Minister was deeply marked by the Piazza Fontana massacre, a terrorist attack that occurred on 12 December 1969 when a bomb exploded at the headquarters of National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, Milan, killing 17 people and wounding 88. In the same afternoon, three more bombs were detonated in Rome and Milan, and another was found unexploded.Bull, Anna Cento and Cooke, Philip. Ending Terrorism in Italy, Routledge, 2013 The attack was planned by a neo-fascist group, Ordine Nuovo (\\"New Order\\"), whose aim was to prevent the country falling into the hands of the left-wing by duping the public into believing the bombings were part of a communist insurgency. During his first term, Rumor led three different governments. From December 1968 to July 1969, the DC joined with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) as well as the Italian Republican Party (PRI). Then, from August 1969 to February 1970 he led a DC-only government; its collapse led to a 45-day long period without government, with issues such as Italian divorce law and the status of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) generating instability. After this period, which included an attempt by former Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani to form a government, Rumor led a new coalition with the Socialist, Republican, and Democratic Socialist parties from March until July 1970. =Interior Minister and assassination attempt= An image of the 1973 Milan massacre, of which Rumor was considered the main target In 1972, Rumor was appointed Minister of the Interior, in the government of Giulio Andreotti.Governo Andreotti, governo.it In 1973, Rumor was the target of an assassination attempt, planned by Gianfranco Bertoli, a self-described anarchist. Four were killed during the bombing, and 45 injured, while Rumor escaped alive from it. Bertoli was given a life-term in 1975. Bertoli was an informant of SISMI, the \\"Military Intelligence and Security Service\\", at the time. Court proceedings later showed that this connection was one of mistaken identity. =Second term as Prime Minister= After three years under Emilio Colombo and Giulio Andreotti's ministries, Rumor returned to the office of Prime Minister, first leading a coalition composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans, and Democratic Socialists from July 1973 to March 1974. After this government collapsed, Rumor formed a new coalition within two weeks, calling upon the Socialists and Democratic Socialists to join with DC from March until October 1974. During his second term, the Parliament approved a law on 2 March 1974, with which legal minimum for pensions was raised to 27.75% of the average industrial wage for 1973. A law of 16 July 1974 extended family allowances to INPS pensioners, in lieu of child supplements. While a bill of August 1974 extended hospital assistance to all those not previously covered by any scheme.Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora Weathering a cabinet resignation in June 1974, Rumor's final cabinet would fall in October 1974 after failing to come to an agreement on how to deal with rising economic inflation. =After the premiership= Mariano Rumor in 1978 In November 1974, Rumor was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in Aldo Moro's fourth cabinet.Governo Moro IV, governo.it' During his ministry, he signed the Osimo Treaty with Yugoslavia, defining the official partition of the Free Territory of Trieste. The port city of Trieste with a narrow coastal strip to the north west (Zone A) was given to Italy; a portion of the north-western part of the Istrian peninsula (Zone B) was given to Yugoslavia.The Europa World Year, Taylor & Francis Group The Italian government was harshly criticized for signing the treaty, particularly for the secretive way in which negotiations were carried out, skipping the traditional diplomatic channels. Italian nationalists of the MSI rejected the idea of giving up Istria, since Istria had been an ancient \\"Italian\\" region together with the Venetian region (Venetia et Histria). Furthermore, Istria had belonged to Italy for 25 years between World War I and the end of World War II, and the west coast of Istria had long had a sizeable Italian minority population. Some nationalist politicians called for the prosecution of Prime Minister Moro and Minister Rumor, for the crime of treason, as stated in Article 241 of the Italian Criminal Code, which mandated a life sentence for anybody found guilty of aiding and abetting a foreign power to exert its sovereignty on the national territory.Aldo Moro e la ferita del Trattato di Osimo, Il Piccolo The defeat in the 1975 regional elections led to the removal of Amintore Fanfani from the party secretariat. Rumor was proposed by Moro as the new party secretary, but he was vetoed by some members of his own faction. Due to this veto, Rumor abandoned the Dorotheans, approaching the positions of the new secretary Benigno Zaccagnini. Following the Dorotheans' split, Rumor was slowly excluded from relevant positions in the party and in the government. In 1979, Mariano Rumor was elected in the European Parliament, where he later became Chair of the Political Affairs Committee in 1980, serving in that post until he left the European Parliament in 1984. Death and legacy Rumor with the President of the Chamber, Nilde Iotti, in 1989 Rumor died of a heart attack in Vicenza on 22 January 1990 at the age of 74. In the years since his death, Rumor's legacy has been widely debated.Denis Mack Smith, Modern Italy: A Political History, (London: Yale University Press, 1997) The Lockheed bribery scandals, of which Rumor was exonerated by the Italian Parliament, took place under his government and culminated in the trials of two former Defense ministers, Luigi Gui and Mario Tanassi. Rumor was implicated in the scandal after a Lockheed codebook referenced \\"Antelope Cobbler\\" as \\"Prime Minister\\", which could have been any of Rumor, Aldo Moro, or then-President Giovanni Leone during the relevant time period. While Leone later resigned from the Presidency due to accusations of corruption, none of the three men were ever convicted of being \\"Antelope Cobbler\\". Others have criticized his Presidential Decree No. 1092, a measure which allowed Italian governmental workers to retire after nineteen and a half years of work or fourteen and a half years if they were a woman; such retirees were later termed \\"baby pensioners\\" by detractors. The program, instituted in 1973, was terminated in 1992. As of 2014 it was estimated that around half a million pensioners who benefited from the decree were still drawing an average of ‚Ç¨1,500 per month.

His early life was marked by the death of his mother and his father's banishment from Russia after marrying a commoner in 1902. Grand Duke Dimitri and his elder sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, to whom he remained very close throughout his life, were raised in Moscow by their paternal uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich and his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia, a sister of Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. His uncle was killed in 1905 and as his aunt entered religious life, Dimitri spent a great deal of his youth in the company of Tsar Nicholas II and his immediate family at the Alexander Palace as they viewed him almost like a foster son. Grand Duke Dimitri followed a military career, graduating from the Nikolaevskoe Cavalry School. He was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment. An excellent equestrian, he competed in the Olympics games of 1912 in Stockholm. As a grandson of Tsar Alexander II on the male line, he occupied a prominent position as the Russian Imperial court, but he had little interest in his military career, leading instead a fast life. Through his friendship with Felix Yusupov, he took part in the assassination of the mystic peasant Grigori Rasputin, who was seen to have undue influence on the Tsar and his wife. Banished to the war front in Persia, he escaped the Russian Revolution and emigrated to Western Europe. He lived briefly in England and during the 1920s in Paris, where he had a brief but notorious affair with the famous French fashion designer Coco Chanel. He also lived briefly in the United States. In 1926, he married Audrey Emery, an American heiress. The couple had a son before divorcing in 1937. As the youngest Grand Duke to have survived the Russian Revolution, he was a prominent figure of the Russian community in exile, but he was not interested in politics, supporting instead the claim of his first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia. By the outbreak of World War II, his health was already in decline and he died of tuberculosis in Davos, Switzerland age 50. Early life Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, his wife with Grand Duchess Maria Pavlova and Grand Duke Paul with his son Dimitri on his lap Grand Duke Dimitri was born on 18 September [O.S. 6 September] 1891 at , the country estate of his uncle Grand Duke Serge Alexandrovich. He was the second child and only son of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and his first wife, Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia, born Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. Dimitri's father, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, was the youngest child of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and his first wife, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, n√©e Duchess Maximilienne Wilhelmine of Hesse and by Rhine. Dimitri's mother, Alexandra, was a daughter of George I of Greece and Olga Konstantinovna of Russia.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 43 Alexandra, was seven months pregnant with Dimitri when, while she was out with friends, she jumped into a boat, falling as she got in.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Palovich p. 48 The next day, she collapsed in the middle of a ball from violent labor pains brought on by the previous day's activities; Dimitri was born in the hours following the accident. Alexandra slipped into a coma from which she never emerged. She died of eclampsia six days after Dmitri's birth. Although doctors had no hope for Dimitri's survival, he still lived, with the help of his uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who gave the premature Dimitri the baths that were prescribed by the doctors, wrapped him in cotton wool and kept him in a cradle filled with hot water bottles to keep his temperature regulated, the treatment of the time to keep premature babies alive. Grand Duke Paul was so distraught by the unexpected death of his young wife that he initially neglected his two small children: Dimitri and his older sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna. The children were cared for by Paul's elder brother, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, who had no children of his own. In his widowhood, Grand Duke Paul settled with his children in his palace in St Petersburg. The children occupied a nursery suite on the second floor, looked after by nurses and attendants.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 141. A commander of the Imperial horse Guards, Grand Duke Paul loved his children, but as was customary at the time, he refrained from showing them spontaneous affection. Dimitri and his sister were raised by governesses and tutors, while they adored their father who visited them twice daily.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 142. The children spent Christmases and later some summer holidays with Grand Duke Sergei and his wife Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna. The couple set aside a playroom and bedrooms for the youngsters at their country home, Ilinskoe. Education Grand Duke Dimitri and his sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna jr with their uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who was their guardian and foster father. In 1895, Grand Duke Paul began an affair with a married woman, Olga Valerianova Pistolkors. He was able to obtain a divorce for her and he eventually married Olga in 1902, while the couple was staying abroad. As they had married defying Nicholas II's opposition, the Tsar forbade them to return to Russia and Grand Duke Paul was not allowed to take the children with him into exile.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 166. Left fatherless, eleven-year-old Dmitri and his twelve-year-old sister were sent to live with their uncle, Grand Duke Sergei, and his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (the Empress's sister), in Moscow.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 167. The loss of their father and the sudden move to Moscow caused the children great distress.See letter of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich to Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, 27 October 1939. Dimitri and Maria resented their aunt and uncle, blaming them for the forced separation from their real father, who had abandoned them. The original is in the family archive at Insel Mainau, home of the late Count Lennart Bernadotte In her memoirs, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (the Younger) describes Grand Duke Sergei as a stern disciplinarian, and his wife, Grand Duchess Elizabeth as a cold and unwelcoming presence.Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna (1931) \\"Education of a Princess\\". The Viking Press. Grand Duke Dimitri was educated at home by private tutors. Like all male members of the Romanov family, he was destined to follow a military career which traditionally began for a Grand Duke at the age of seven.Hall & Beeche, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 176. This was delayed in Dimitri case until he was nine years old. In the spring of 1901, his education was entrusted to General George Mikhailovich Laiming. Laiming was a warm affectionate man who became devoted to his charge. He moved into the place with his wife and their four- year-old son Boris. In their apartments, Dimitri and his sister enjoyed a warm family environment. In 1903, at the age of twelve, Dimitri was enrolled in the Chevalier Guard regiment following studies at the Calvary Academy.Hayter- Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 51. On 4 February 1905, Grand Duke Sergei, who had recently resigned from the post of Governor-General of Moscow, was assassinated by Ivan Kalyaev, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 50. Kalyaev, armed with a homemade bomb, had aborted his first attempt to kill the Grand Duke when he spotted Dmitri and Marie with their uncle in his carriage. His uncle's death was only one of several assassinations that robbed Dimitri of close family members.His paternal grandfather, Alexander II, was murdered by revolutionary terrorists in 1881, and his maternal grandfather, George I of Greece, would be shot by an assassin in 1913. His father, Paul, and half-brother Vladimir (\\"Bodya\\") Paley would be murdered by the Bolsheviks in January 1919. After Sergei's death, Dimitri's father, Grand Duke Paul was allowed to return to Russia to attend the funeral. He asked Nicholas II to restore the custody of his children but instead, Nicholas named Sergei's widow Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna as the children's guardian. Maria Pavlovna continued to have some feelings of anger toward her aunt, whom she would blame for her overly hasty marriage to Prince Wilhem of Sweden in 1908, but Dmitri formed a very strong bond with Elizabeth and came to admire her personal fortitude. Formative years Grand Duke Dimitri and the Imperial Family. Clockwise: Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarevich Alexei, Grand Duchess Olga, Grand Duchess Tatiana, Empress Alexandra, and Grand Duke Dimitri Maria Pavlovna's wedding to Prince William took place at Tsarskoe Selo in 1908, and she departed for Sweden with her husband. Elizabeth Feodorovna stayed on for a time at Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo as guests of the Emperor and the Empress. It was during this period that Dimitri began to form a close bond with Nicholas II, looking upon him as a surrogate father. He would join him on his daily walks and seek to spend as much time with him as possible. Nicholas, in turn, treated Dimitri very kindly. He seems to have loved the young man's free spirit and sense of humor, a welcome diversion from the stresses of his daily life.Dimitri wrote several letters to his sister during his stay with Nicholas and Alexandra, describing how much he was enjoying himself there. The original letters survive in the Bernadotte family archive on the Island of Mainau. His later correspondence with Nicholas II, from 1908-1914, would fall into the hands of the Bolsheviks and be published in 1925 in \\"Nicholas II and the Grand Dukes\\" [\\"–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π II –∏ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–µ –ö–Ω—è–∑—å—è\\"], edited by V.P. Semennikov. In 1909, Dimitri left his aunt's care to move to St Petersburg with his head tutor and companion, General Laiming. He lived at his father's vacant palace and then at the Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, which he had inherited from his uncle Grand Duke Sergei and this would become his principal residence until he left Russia. He prepared to enter the Nikolaevskoe Cavalry School. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment, which his father had once commanded and in which he had been enrolled at birth. He was a very good equestrian, and he competed in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the Equestrian Individual and Team Jumping events. He placed ninth in Individual Jumping and fifth in Team Jumping. Disappointed in the performance of the Russian team, Dimitri started the idea of a national Russian sports competition, the very beginning of what under Soviet rule became the Spartakiad.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 51. In Spring 1914, Dimitri's father returned to live in Russia settling with his second wife and new family at Tsarskoye Selo. Around the same time, Dimitri's sister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, who had divorced her husband, returned to Russia moving with Dimitri. A few months later, World War I began. All members of the family joined the war effort. Dimitri served with the Life Guards Horse Regiment, participating in the campaign in East Prussia. During the first weeks of the war he was awarded the Order of St. George after he rescued a wounded corporal under heavy gunfire.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 52. Killing of Rasputin Grand Duke Dimitri (on the right) next to his father Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich during the war. In August 1915 when Nicholas II left St. Petersburg to take full command of the Russian armies fighting World War I, his wife Empress Alexandra Feodorovna took on the daily administrative affairs of the government from the capital. Alexandra relyed on Grigori Rasputin, a peasant healer who appeared to have brought her hemophiliac son Alexei, the Tsarevich, back from the brink of death. As Russian defeats mounted during the war, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. Eventually, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich joined Felix Yusupov, Vladimir Purishkevich (the leader of the monarchists in the Duma) Dr. Stanislaus de Lazovert and Lieutenant Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin, an officer in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, in a conspiracy to kill Grigory Rasputin hoping that ending his influence over the Imperial Family this would have a beneficial effect on the Tsar's policies. On Friday night 16/17 December (OS), Yusupov, who had visited Rasputin regularly in the past few months for treatment, invited Rasputin to his home. With Stanislaus de Lazovert dressed in a chauffeur uniform, Felix went to Rasputin's home to pick him up. Around 1:30 am, they arrived at Yusupov's Moika Palace where a room in the basement in the east wing had been specially prepared for the killing. For about an hour, Felix entertained the unsuspected Rasputin with red wine until he got him drunk. Then, while both were sitting, Yusupov shot Rasputin at close range using Dimitri's Browning revolver.Nelipa, Killing Rasputin, loc 4977The bullet entered Rasputin's body from the left side perforating the stomach, liver, and kidney.Nelipa, Killing Rasputin, loc 5829The wound was lethal, but Rasputin did not die right away bleeding profusely instead. In shock, Yusupov let Rasputin alone to die. He joined his fellow conspirators: Grand Duke Dimitri, politician Vladimir Purishkevich, and army officer Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin who were waiting in a ground floor study/drawing-room. Meanwhile, Rasputin, still alive, tried to flee through a side door into a gated courtyard that opened onto the street outside. Alarmed he might escape, Purishkevich then shot Rasputin in the back, on the doorstep.Nelipa, Killing Rasputin, loc 5043 The bullet lodged into the vertebral column. The body was taken inside and Rasputin was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. In a rage, Yusopov kicked Rasputin's corpse with the tip of his military boots smashing the nose, the right eye, and disfiguring the face. Then, the assassins drove to Varshavsky Rail Terminal where they burned Rasputin's clothes and returned to Yusupov's home. At 4.50 a.m. Dimitri drove the men and Rasputin's body, wrapped in a broadcloth, to Petrovskii Bridge that crossed toward Krestovsky Island. About 5 a.m, they threw the body into the Malaya Neva into a hole they made in the ice. All along, Grand Duke Dimitri, who was driving the car, never saw Rasputin.Nelipa, Killing Rasputin, loc 5141 News of Rasputin's murder spread quickly. That Saturday, an evening newspaper already published details of the assassination correctly identifying the place and some of the details. By Sunday, Dimitri was placed under house arrest. Felix Yusupov, who had tried to flee to Crimea was stopped at the train station. He was then living at his mother-in-law's palace, but on the advice of his uncle by marriage Grand Duke Nicholas Michailovich, he moved to Dimitri's palace for protection as it was only the prerogative of the Tsar to prosecute members of the Imperial family. Rasputin's body was found on 19 December by a river policeman who was walking on the ice and discovered the frozen body. The post mortem was held the following day. Major-General Popel carried out the investigation of the murder. By this time Dr. Stanislaus de Lazovert and Lieutenant Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin had fled from the city. He did interview Grand Duke Dimitri, Felix Yusupov, and Vladimir Purishkevich, but he decided not to charge them with murder.His own letters and diary entries, at times, written under emotional duress as he relived events that would as always disturb him greatly, support the conventional historical account of the assassination. His final break with Yusupov in London in 1920 is documented in letters exchanged between the two men, none of which have ever been published. The originals are all part of the Ilyinsky family collection, along with Pavlovich's diaries. Pavlovich, who, as an adolescent, had envisioned Nicholas II as a 'man of action' and admired him greatly, was disillusioned by the Tsar's attitude and behavior during the war years. Like many other grand dukes, he had unsuccessfully tried to warn Nicholas of what he saw as Russia's imminent peril. The assassination was, in his conception, a patriotic act and one of desperation, but he almost immediately regretted it and would later describe on several occasions in his letters and diaries the disgust and remorse that he felt about his own involvement in the affair. Yusupov was, in 1920, offered a chance to speak about the assassination on a US lecture tour, the profits from which would go to the Red Cross, and it was his interest in pursuing the tour that proved to be the last straw in his relationship with Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich. Exile=Banishment to Persia= Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich in exile, 1921. As a result of his participation in Rasputin's assassination, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich was banished from the Russian court and was sent to exile to the Persian war front.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 175 Pleads for clemency from Romanov relatives on his behalf were dismissed by the Tsar.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich p. 54 In the early hours of , Grand Duke Dimitri left Saint Peterburg never to return.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 136. After four days of travel, he reached Baku on the Caspian sea, sailing the next morning to the southern, Persian shore.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 137. At his arrival in Persia, he was welcomed by his officers as his reputation for the Rasputin assassination had made him popular. He served ten weeks under General Nikolai Baratov who headed the 1st Caucasus Cossack Corps on the Caucasus Front in the Persian city of Kazvin. Within two months Nicholas II was forced to abdicate ending the rule of the Romanov dynasty. General Baratov asked Dimitri to leave since there were rumblings from the lower ranks, and his safety could not be guaranteed. Ronald Wingate entertained Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich when he passed through Najaf. The Provisional Government invited him to return to Russia, but he declined. Lacking both friends and money, he lived precariously. In the summer of 1917, Dimitri left the Russian occupation zone moving to Tehran.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 214. Dimitri stayed briefly with General Meidel, then the head of the Persian Cossack Division, before being taken in by the British Minister to Tehran, Sir Charles Murray Marling, and his wife, Lucia. Through 1917 and most of 1918 Grand Duke Dimitri lived with the Marlings.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 176 Sir Charles obtained an honorary commission for Dimitri as a liaison officer with the British Mission and eventually persuaded the British Foreign Office in 1918 that Dimitri would become the next Emperor of Russia, gaining his admission to England after many previous rejections. Marling became an important father figure to Grand Duke Dimitri, and the relationship there established between the Grand Duke and the entire Marling family would prove to be close and enduring.See Sir Charles's correspondence with the Foreign Office, preserved at the Public Records Office, Kew, UK. Nikolai Nikolaevich's papers are at the Hoover Institute, Stanford, and Pavlovich's diaries likewise provide a detailed account of his life in Persia, his relationship with the Marlings and his attempts to gain entry to England. =Interlude in England= Dmitri in exile in the 1920s. Marling and his family took Dimitri with them when they left Tehran for England at the end of 1918. During the long journey to England in a slow steamer, Grand Duke Dimitri fell ill with typhoid fever in Bombay and nearly died. He had to recuperate in Cairo. In January 1919 he arrived in France via Egypt.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 256. He crossed the Mediterranean disembarked in Marseilles continuing by land to Paris. He had kept an apartment at the Hotel Georges V and in France, he learned of the tragic end of many of his Romanovs relatives.The Russian Revolution was disastrous to Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich's family. Prince Vladimir Paley, Dimitri's half-brother was arrested in St. Petersburg on March 26, 1918, along with three sons of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, a grandson of Nicholas I: Prince Ioann, Prince Konstantin, and Prince Igor. On July 18, 1918, the day after the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, Dimitri's half-brother Prince Vladimir Paley, Prince Ioann, Prince Konstantin, Prince Igor, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, Dimitri's aunt and his former guardian, were murdered by the Bolsheviks. The Marlings took him to London where he was reunited with his maternal aunt Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna. She provided him with the money from the proceeds from the sale of his St Petersburg palace, which had gone through before the Bolsheviks seized to power. Dimitri took a room at the Ritz and spent most of his time with his aunt. He went to Sussex and visited Natalia Brasova, his youthful crush. She was devastated by the loss of her husband, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, and Dimitri quickly returned to his own life. Lady Marling went to see the King's assistant private secretary Lord Cromer to inform him of the grand duke's arrival. But George V was horrified at the development and Dimitri was quickly visited by a Foreign Office representative who asked him to leave Britain, suggesting him to go to Malta. He refused unless the order came directly from George V and the matter was dropped. He was the only Romanov Grand Duke permitted to live in England but his presence was an inconvenience to the British government that did not want to upset the new Bolshevik regime and the Tsar's regime had been seen in Britain as brutal and bloody. In London, Dimitri was finally reunited with his sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna who had escaped Revolutioray Russia though Ukraine with her second husband Prince Putiatin. Dimitri moved with his sister and brother in law taking a house together in South Kensington.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 178 The Yusupovs had escaped Russia with the Dowager Tsaritsa and they too settled in London.Felix tried to renew their former friendship but Dimitri avoided him, resenting Yusupov breaking off the oath of silence regarding the event of Rasputin's assassination. Relations between Dimitri and Putiatin also soon soured.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 161 In spring 1920, Maria Pavlovna returned to Paris to meet with their stepmother, Princess Olga Paley, and their two half-sisters. She decided to stay in the French capital in order to be close to them.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 163 Unhappy in England, Dimitri followed his sister to Paris in the summer of 1920. =Exile in Paris= Grand Duke Dimitri and Coco Chanel in the 1920s. In Paris, Dimitri took rooms at a hotel until he found a modest two-room apartment. The proceeds from the sale of his St Peterburg palace enabled him to live well but they depleted quickly. He had given generously to other emigres in need and to Russian charities. In the summer of 1921, Dimitri accompanied his sister to Denmark to a reunion with her son Prince Lennart. While in Denmark, Dimitri saw the Marling family again and with his sister visited the Dowager Empress, Maria Feodorovna, who had retired to her villa Hvidore.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 179 With his economic resources depleting, Grand Duke Dimitri found employment serving on the board of a Champagne firm.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 55. An American journalist described him around this time as attractive: \\"He is, in his slender well-groomed person, all that a grand duke should be - especially if you like your grand duke young clean-shaven, and concave at the waistline.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 55. He has a figure like Rudolph Valentino\\".Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 55. Well known in the Paris scene of the 1920s, Dimitri was then having an affair with opera singer Marthe Davelli.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 56. It was through her that Dimitri became close to Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 56. \\"You take him\\", the singer allegedly offered him to her old friend: \\"He is too expensive for me\\".Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 56. Chanel and Dimitri, who had actually met before in pre-World War I Paris, became lovers.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 179 Their relationship lasted around a year. It began in spring 1921 with an off-season stay in Monte Carlo where they tried to live as discreetly as possible.Diary of Grand Duke Dmitri, March/April 1921Rumours that Pavlovich was bisexual have never been substantiated, and they are firmly contradicted by his own letters and diaries. Dimitri's sister, Maria Pavlovna, found a niche for herself in the rising Paris fashion industry by founding a business called \\"Kitmir\\" that specialized in bead and sequin embroidery and did much work for Chanel.Hayter-Menzies, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, p. 56. It was Dimitri who introduced Chanel to Ernest Beaux, the perfumer who created Chanel No. 5, her most enduring product.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 262. Coco and Dimitri spent a happy summer at a villa near Arcachon.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 262. Their romance fizzled out, but they remained friends. Chanel would later comment: \\" These grand dukes, they are all the same, an admirable face behind which there is nothing, green eyes, broad shoulders, fine hands... the most peaceful people, shyness itself. They drink just not to be afraid. Tall, handsome, superb these Russians are. And behind that is nothing: hollowness and vodka.\\"Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 263. As the youngest Grand Duke to have survived the Russian Revolution, Dimitri was a prominent figure of the Russian community in exile. He had been proposed as a potential candidate for the throne by several monarchist groups. During the early 1920s, there was a bitter rivalry between the camps of the supporters of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and those of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich. While those who supported neither Nicholas nor Kirill advocate for Dimitri's candidacy for the Russian throne. On 8 August 1922, a makeshift Zemsky Sobor was convened at Priamurye, and Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich was ‚Äúelected‚Äù Emperor. The Grand Duke neither accepted nor refused this empty gesture. Having waited for confirmation of the death of Tsar Nicholas II, his son, and his brother, in 1924 Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich announced (also on August 8) that he would assume ‚Äúguardianship‚Äù of the throne of Russia. Shortly thereafter, on September 13, he issued his manifesto on the assumption of all imperial rights and the title of Emperor. On 25 September 1924, Grand Duke Alexander Michailovich issued an appeal to Russians to stand with Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. It was at this time that Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, who had no political ambitions for himself, supported instead the claim of his first cousin, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. Grand Duke Dimitri was also active politically. Together with his cousin, Prince Dimitri Alexandrovich, he was very involved in the monarchist youth organizations which sprang up in the years between the wars. By 1923, the largest of these was the ‚ÄúUnion of Young Russia‚Äù which preached orthodoxy, nationalism, monarchism and peasant collectivism.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 300. =Marriage= Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia with his wife Audrey Emery and their son in the 1920s. In 1923 Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna divorced her second husband and bought a small house at Boulogne-sur-Seine and Dimitri moved with her to the top floor.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 179 As he worked at Reims for the champagne company, he was out most of the day but spent the evening with his sister.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 179 Invited to a tea party at Versailles with his sister, he met Audrey Emery, a sophisticated and attractive American heiress. Her father was a self-made millionaire and after his death, his mother had married a son of the second Earl of Lichfield.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 180 Grand Duke Dmitri had no fortune to offer, but they fell in love and they were married in the Orthodox Church at Biarritz on 21 November 1926.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 180 It was a morganatic marriage, and Audrey, who converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Anna Ioannovna in baptism, was granted the title Her Serene Highness, Princess Romanovskaya-Ilyinskaya by his cousin, Grand Duke Kyril. They spent their honeymoon in England where they established their first home.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 180 The couple's only child, Paul Romanovsky-Ilyinsky, was born in London in 1928.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 180 Paul grew up in France, Britain, and the United States; he served as a US Marine in the Korean War. In 1989, he was elected Mayor of Palm Beach, Florida, and thus became the only Romanov descendant known to have held elected public office. Following the fall of communist Russia in 1991, a delegation of Russian royalists approached him and asked him to assume the title of Tsar, which he declined.Xavier Waterkeyn Assassination: Political murder through the ages New Holland Publishers p. 111 In 1928, the Dowager Empress died, and Grand Duke Kirill was received at the funeral as head of the House of Romanoff by the Royal family of Denmark ‚Äì it was the last time that the entire Dynasty appeared as a single undivided family and Grand Duke Dmitri was a prominent figure in the proceedings. The youngest of the Grand Dukes, Dimitri Pavlovich frequently represented Grand Duke Kirill at events public, private, and political. He was prominent at the funerals of Constantine I of Greece (1923), Queen Astrid of the Belgians (1935), at the wedding of Grand Duke Kirill‚Äôs daughter, Grand Duchess Kira to Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1938), and also at the ceremonies surrounding the accession of Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia to the rights of the headship of the Imperial House on the death of his father in 1938. Grand Duke Dimitri was a noted collector of model trains and was at one point considered to have had one of the largest collections in Europe. During the Nazi annexation of Paris, Dimitri's collection vanished, and it has since been theorized that they were seized by Hermann G√∂ring, a model train collector himself. In the late 1920s, Grand Duke Dimitri became involved with his cousin, Prince Dimitri Alexandrovich Romanoff in the monarchist youth organizations which sprang up in the years between the wars. By 1923, the largest of these was the Union of Young Russians which was renamed the Union of Mladorossi (C–æ—é–∑ –ú–ª–∞–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–æ–≤) by 1925. It was a Russian nationalist group influenced by Italian fascism, formed with the express purpose of establishing a \\"Soviet monarchy\\" in Russia. He joined this group as a stand-in for Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, who, as pretender to the throne, could not affiliate himself directly with any political organization or party. In 1935, Grand Duke Dimitri gave a series of speeches to Young Russia chapters throughout France. Over the course of the next few years, however, he grew very disillusioned with the group, and he ultimately broke with it entirely. He loathed Hitler and National Socialism, and he spoke out publicly against Hitler in January 1939.Unpublished letter of Constantine de Grunwald to Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, 3 June 1939, Mainau. Grand Duke Dimitri reputedly rebuked later advances from Hitler to lead exiled Russian nobles within the German army against the Bolsheviks with the firm statement that nothing would induce him to fight against fellow Russians. Last years Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich and his wife could afford a very opulent lifestyle with homes in London, Biarritz, Neuilly-sur-Seine, and Ch√¢teau de Beaumesnil near Caen, and visits to America.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 180 After ten years of marriage, they were divorced in 1937.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 181 Dimitri then lived at the Ch√¢teau de Beaumesnil in Beaumesnil, Eure, France, which he had bought in 1927. Over the years, Dimitri became disappointed with the prospects for the restoration of the monarchy in Russia and withdrew from public life. He lived at the Ch√¢teau de Beaumesnil until 1938 when, due to the deterioration of his health, he sold the ch√¢teau. In 1937, his ex-wife remarried. His son was at school in England, but Dimitri was able to spend the school days holidays with him until 1939 when it was decided to send Paul to America for safety. Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 181They saw each other for the last time in Genoa spending three days before Paul embarked to America.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 310. Despite not having strong health, Grand Duke Dimitri was, for most of his life, a very active sportsman, excelling at polo, horse riding, tennis, and bobsledding. His doctors in London and Davos estimated that he first contracted tuberculosis around 1929, which ran a chronic course. He entered the Sanatorium Schatzalp in Davos Switzerland on 2 September 1939, the day after the German invasion of Poland, and remarked in a letter to his sister that he had never before spent a single night in any kind of hospital or medical institution. His health began a steady decline in August 1940. In the autumn of that year, he underwent an unsuccessful operation and was confined to bed for three months afterward.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 312. After two more operations, in January and February 1941, the doctors spoke optimistically.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 312. From the safety of the sanatorium in Davos, Dimitri followed with great interest the events of World War II writing to a friend on 10 April 1940, on the eve of the collapse of France \\"everything stars looking petty in comparison with world events\\".Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 311. On 4 March 1942, Grand Duke Dimitri organized a Russian festival to entertained himself with his friend and the staff.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 181 The celebration continued until late into the night.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 181 The next day in the morning Dimitri suffered a sudden attack of uremia and died at the age of fifty.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 181 He was laid to rest in the Waldfriedhof, Davos. After the death of Dimitri's sister Maria Pavlovna in December 1958, his nephew, Prince Lennart Bernadotte, had him buried alongside his sister, in the chapel of his castle on the island of Mainau in Lake Constance, where they now lie beside his sister in the Bernadotte family crypt. There is no cause listed on his death certificate, and all of Schatzalp's medical records were destroyed after the conversion of the sanatorium into a hotel in the 1950s. His son believed he had died of tuberculosis, and his cousin Prince Michael Feodorovich of Russia cited uremia, and his New York Times obituary cited uremia as well. Rumors of murder sprang up locally but have never been substantiated, and there was no police investigation.William Lee, \\"Leben und Sterben in Davos,\\" in Davoser Revue, 2000.

The magazine has several regional editions, with the UK and US editions becoming the best selling PC games magazines in their respective countries. The magazine features news on developments in the video game industry, previews of new games, and reviews of the latest popular PC games, along with other features relating to hardware, mods, \\"classic\\" games and various other topics.  Review system  PC Gamer reviews are written by the magazine's editors and freelance writers, and rate games on a percent scale. In the UK edition, no game has yet been awarded more than 96% (Kerbal Space Program, Civilization II, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Minecraft, Spelunky and Quake II). In the US edition, no game has yet received a rating higher than 98% (Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Half-Life 2, and Crysis). In the UK edition, the lowest numerical score was 2%, awarded to The 4th Golden Satellite Awards for Interactive Media Winner Big Brother 1. The sequel, Big Brother 2, was given an even lower score of N/A%, the review explaining that \\"[PC Gamer] put as much effort into reviewing it as they did in making the game\\". In issue 255, August 2013, the score of 2% was matched by the review of the re-released Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude, originally given 3% when it first launched. In the US edition, the lowest score awarded was 4%, given to Mad Dog McCree, unseating the previously lowest-rated game, Skydive!, given 5%.  Editions  There are two main editions of PC Gamer, a British version and an American version, both are published by Future plc. Founded in the United Kingdom in November 1993, the American sister version was launched a year later in June 1994. There are also numerous local editions that mainly use the materials of one of the two editions, typically the British one, including a Malaysian (discontinued in December 2011) and Russian edition(discontinued in December 2008, respectively). The Swedish edition, though rooted in its UK counterpart, has grown to be more independent, largely due to the immense popularity of PC games compared to console games in Sweden, and now produces most of its own material. An Australian edition was published monthly by Perth-based Conspiracy Publishing since August 1998, but it appears to have been discontinued in mid-late 2004. A Spanish edition titled \\"PC Juegos y Jugadores\\" also exists. Both American and British magazines are published thirteen times per year (twice in December), although there are sometimes variations.  PC Gamer UK = Magazine = The British edition of PC Gamer has been in constant monthly publication since 1993. Subscribers get a special edition of the magazine with no headlines on the front cover (only the masthead and BBFC rating). Almost exclusively devoted to PC games, the magazine has a reputation for giving in-depth reviews. The magazine originally shipped with an accompanying floppy disc. A CD demo disc (labelled CD Gamer) was released alongside the floppy disk edition from issue 11 onwards with the first CD Gamer containing all the content from the previous 10 issues' floppy discs. The single CD was later expanded to two CDs. An edition with a 9 GB DVD known as DVD Gamer ran alongside the 2CD edition for a couple of years, until production of the CD Gamer edition ceased as of issue 162. The UK Edition then only came with a single double-sided DVD. In August 2011, the UK magazine announced it was to be discontinuing the disk as of issue 232, and replacing it with more pages of content within the magazine and exclusive free gifts.  Regular features  The magazine has many regular features which make up each edition of the magazine. These include sections called ¬¥Eyewitness¬¥, ¬¥Previews¬¥, ¬¥Send¬¥, where letters from the readers are spread over 2 two page spreads, at least one special feature, which reports on gaming related issues such as the effect of PC gaming on the environment, a review section which reviews the latest released PC games and re-reviews titles that have been released on budget and ¬¥Extra Life¬¥ which reports on modding games and gaming culture and revisiting old games. There is also a ¬¥Systems¬¥ section, which reviews and recommends hardware such as video cards and monitors. The back page of the magazine is entitled ¬¥It's All Over¬¥ and usually consists of game related artwork such as a version of Dal√≠'s The Persistence of Memory featuring items from Portal. For a time, one of the magazine's features, ¬¥Gamer Snap¬¥, where amusing pictures sent in by readers were printed in the magazine, however the feature was discontinued and replaced with a ¬¥Guess the game¬¥ where readers sent in drawings of memorable scenes in video games drawn in Microsoft Paint. = Forum and blog = The PC Gamer blog was started to coincide with the transfer of the PC Gamer UK site to become part of the Computer and Video Games network which incorporates all of Future plc's gaming magazines. The move brought some controversy, with many long-standing members of the forum leaving due to the new forum's cramped spacing, advertising and slow loading times. The introduction of a blog was seen as one of the redeeming features of the switch. The blog has since been regularly updated with contributions from many of the magazine's staff. The topics discussed range from the controversy over violent video games, to the benefits of buying a PC over a console. In 2010, PC Gamer re-launched their website and blog by bringing together the online communities of both the US and UK magazines into one website. As a result, the PC Gamer blog now has contributions from both the US and UK magazines, all hosted at the new website along with the forums for both magazines. = Podcast = The PC Gamer UK podcast was started on 4 May 2007 and ran 93 episodes until its final episode, which was released on 5 July 2013. It had a rotating cast made up of members of the staff including Chris Thursten, Tom Senior, Graham Smith, Tom Francis, and Marsh Davies. The podcast was formerly hosted by Ross Atherton until his departure in June 2009 and then Tim Edwards until his departure in 2012. The host position varied between Chris Thursten and Graham Smith from week to week. Previously monthly, the podcast was recorded every fortnight. Participants discussed the games they had been playing and news from the industry, and answered questions submitted via Twitter. The podcast began again in March 2016 with a new episode being released weekly.  PC Gamer US = Magazine = The American edition of PC Gamer launched in 1994. In 1999, Future US, then known as Imagine media, purchased rival magazine PC Games and merged its staff into the magazine.  Demo disk  Similarly to the British edition, the magazine shipped with a demo disk, though diskless versions were available. The CDs were replaced by DVDs in the American edition on a month-to-month basis. When PC games with full motion video (FMV) sequences were popular in the mid-to-late 1990s, PC Gamer's CD-ROM included elaborate FMV sequences featuring one of their editors. To access the features of the CD, including the demos, patches and reviews, the user had to navigate a 'basement', which played very much like classic PC games such as Myst. It was in this game sequence that the magazine's mascot, Coconut Monkey, was introduced just as the editor was leaving the magazine, marking the transition from the FMV demo CDs to the more contemporary menu driven demo CDs that were subsequently used. In the September 2011 edition of PC Gamer, it was announced that they would be dropping the demo disk altogether and concentrating on improving the quality of the magazine instead with a promise of a larger magazine printed on a heavier paper stock. The usual demo disk content would be made available online.PC Gamer (US), September 2011 Ethics controversy In January 2015, writer Tyler Wilde was found to have written numerous articles about Ubisoft while dating a Ubisoft employee with the title \\"Communications Associate\\". This, together with the fact that Editor-in-Chief Tim Clark was aware of the relationship, led to general questions about the publication's ethics policies. Clark and Wilde responded, pointing out that Wilde had not reviewed any Ubisoft games during the relationship, and admitting that the relationship should have been disclosed in other coverage. Clark stated, \\"PC Gamer writers will continue to be obliged to disclose any significant personal relationships with people whose work they might cover.\\"  References  External links  Archived PC Gamer magazines on the Internet Archive Magazines established in 1993 Home computer magazines Monthly magazines published in the United States Computer magazines published in the United Kingdom Computer magazines published in the United States Video game magazines published in the United Kingdom Video game magazines published in the United States 1993 establishments in the United Kingdom 1994 establishments in the United States Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom ","title":"PC Gamer"},{"id":"628436","text":"Corgarff Castle is located slightly west of the village of Corgarff, in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland.

Life The castle was built around 1530 by the Elphinstone family and leased to the Forbes of Towie.The Castles of Scotland, Martin Coventry In 1571 it was burned by their enemy, Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, resulting in the deaths of Margaret Campbell, Lady Forbes, her children, and numerous others, 26 in total, and giving rise to the ballad Edom o Gordon. In May 1607 the castle was captured from Alexander, 4th Lord Elphinstone by Alexander Forbes of Towie and his companions including a piper called George McRobie. They used hammers and battering rams to break down the gate, then fortified the house with a garrison of \\"Highland thieves and limmers\\".Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1885), p. 303. In 1626 it was acquired by the Earl of Mar. In 1645 it was used as an assembly point by the troops of the Marquis of Montrose. It was burnt again in both 1689 and 1716 by Jacobite supporters. It was resettled by the Forbes family in 1745 but had to be forfeited due to their Jacobite leanings.The Castles of Scotland, Martin Coventry In 1748 it was bought by the British government and rebuilt and extended as a barracks. A detachment of government troops were stationed there, on the military road from Braemar Castle to Fort George, Inverness. Military use continued as late as 1831, after which the tower was used to suppress illegal whisky distilling in the surrounding area. It remained part of the Delnadamph estate belonging to the Stockdale family until they passed the castle into state care in 1961 and gave the ownership of the castle to the Lonach Highland and Friendly Society. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public. It has been designated a scheduled ancient monument.

Biography  Alexei Leont'ev's life was closely linked to the Lomonosov Moscow State University (MGU). In 1921, he began his studies at the historical-philological Faculty of the University. The historical-philological Faculty, at the time, included a Department of Philosophy at which G. I. Chelpanov was teaching psychology, and Leont'ev studied psychology with him. In 1924, Leont'ev graduated from what became the Faculty of Social Sciences. A.N. Leont'ev worked with Lev Vygotsky (1896‚Äì1934) and Alexander Luria (1902‚Äì1977) from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of a Marxist psychology as a response to behaviourism and the focus on the stimulus-response mechanism as explanation for human behaviour. Leont'ev left Vygotsky's group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in Kharkov. He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters (Veer and Valsiner, 1991). Leont'ev returned to Moscow in 1934. Later, he became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University. In 1966, Leont'ev became the first ever Dean of the newly established Faculty of Psychology at the Moscow State University, where he worked until his death in 1979. He died of a heart attack.  Scientific work  Leont'ev's early scientific work was done in the framework of Vygotsky's cultural-historical research program and focused on the exploration of the phenomenon of cultural mediation. Representative of this period is Leontiev's study on mediated memory in children and adults The development of higher forms of memory, 1931. Leont'ev's own research school is based on the thorough psychological analysis of the phenomenon of activity. Systematic development of the psychological foundations of activity theory was started in the 1930s by Kharkov group of psychologists headed by Leont'ev and included such researchers as Zaporozhets, Gal'perin, Zinchenko, Bozhovich, Asnin, Lukov, etc. In its fullest form, activity theory was subsequently developed and institutionalized as the leading psychological doctrine in the Soviet Union in the post-war period after Leont'ev had moved to Moscow and took a position at the Moscow State University. For Leont'ev, ‚Äòactivity‚Äô consisted of those processes \\"that realise a person‚Äôs actual life in the objective world by which he is surrounded, his social being in all the richness and variety of its forms\\" (Leont‚Äôev 1977). The core of the Leont'ev's work is the proposal that we can examine human processes from the perspective of three different levels of analysis. The highest, most general level is that of activity and motives that drive it. At the intermediate level are actions and their associated goals, and the lowest level is the analysis of operations that serve as means for the achievement of the higher-order goals.

The class was nominally designed to support the Baltic Project, a plan by Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher that was intended to land troops on the German Baltic Coast. Ships of this class were fast but very lightly armoured, with only a few heavy guns. They were given a shallow draught, in part to allow them to operate in the shallow waters of the Baltic but also reflecting experience gained earlier in the war. To maximize their speed, the Courageous-class battlecruisers were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers. The first two ships, and , were commissioned in 1917 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. They participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and were present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later. Their half-sister was designed with a pair of guns, the largest guns ever fitted on a ship of the Royal Navy, but was modified during construction to take a flying-off deck and hangar in lieu of her forward turret and barbette. After some patrols in the North Sea, her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked the Zeppelin sheds during the Tondern raid in July 1918. All three ships were laid up after the war, but were rebuilt into the Courageous-class aircraft carrier during the 1920s. Glorious and Courageous were sunk early in the Second World War and Furious was sold for scrap in 1948.  Design and description  Right elevation and plan view of the Courageous class from Brassey's Naval Annual 1923 The first two Courageous-class battlecruisers were designed in 1915 to meet a set of requirements laid down by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, with his Baltic Project in mind. They were to be large enough to ensure that they could maintain their speed in heavy weather, have a powerful armament and a speed of at least to allow them to outrun enemy light cruisers. Their protection was to be light for a cruiser, with of armour between the waterline and the forecastle deck, anti-torpedo bulges amidships and the machinery as far inboard as possible, protected by triple torpedo bulkheads. Shallow draught was of the utmost importance and all other factors were to be subordinated to this. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, responded on 23 February 1915 with a smaller version of the s with one less gun turret and reduced armour protection. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had forbidden any further construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915, so Fisher designated the ships as large light cruisers to evade this prohibition. If this restriction had not been in place, the ships would have been built as improved versions of the preceding Renown class. The two ships were laid down a few months later under a veil of secrecy, so they became known in the Royal Navy as \\"Lord Fisher's hush-hush cruisers\\" and their odd design also earned them the nickname of the Outrageous class.Burt, p. 303. Their half-sister Furious was designed a few months later to meet a revised requirement specifying an armament of two BL 18-inch Mk I guns, the largest guns ever fitted on a Royal Navy ship, in single turrets with the ability to use twin gun turrets if the 18-inch guns were unsatisfactory. Gunnery experts criticized this decision because the long time between salvoes would make spotting corrections useless and reduce the rate of fire and thus the probability of a direct hit. Her secondary armament was upgraded to BL Mk I guns, rather than the guns used by the first two ships, to compensate for the weakness of the two main guns against fast-moving targets like destroyers. Her displacement and beam were increased over that of her half-sisters with slightly less draught. The Baltic Project was only one justification for the ships. Admiral Fisher wrote in a letter to the DNC on 16 March 1915: \\"I've told the First Lord that the more that I consider the qualities of your design of the Big Light Battle Cruisers, the more that I am impressed by its exceeding excellence and simplicity‚Äîall the three vital requisites of gunpower, speed and draught so well balanced!\\"Roberts, p. 51. In fact they could be considered the epitome of Fisher's belief in the paramount importance of speed over everything else. Fisher's adherence to this principle is highlighted in a letter he wrote to Churchill concerning the battleships of the 1912‚Äì13 Naval Estimates. In the letter, dated April 1912, Fisher stated: \\"There must be sacrifice of armour ... There must be further VERY GREAT INCREASE IN SPEED ... your speed must vastly exceed [that of] your possible enemy!\\"Roberts, p. 46. Fisher's desire for a shallow draught was not merely based on the need to allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than anticipated and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.Roberts, p. 53. = General characteristics = The Courageous-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They displaced normally and at deep load. They had a metacentric height of at deep load and a complete double bottom.Roberts, pp. 64‚Äì65. Their half-sister Furious was the same length, but had a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load. She had a metacentric height of at deep load. = Propulsion = To save weight and space the Courageous-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers despite the latter's significantly heavier maintenance requirements. Furthermore, to save design time, the turbine installation used in the light cruiser , the navy's first cruiser with geared turbines, was simply doubled. The Parsons turbines were arranged in two engine rooms and each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. Furiouss propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. They were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of , but achieved slightly more than that during Gloriouss trials, although she did not reach her designed speed of .Roberts, pp. 71, 74, 76, 79. They were designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but could carry a maximum of . At full capacity, they could steam for an estimated at a speed of .Burt, p. 306. = Armament = The Courageous-class ships mounted four BL 15-inch Mark I guns in two twin hydraulically powered Mark I* turrets, one each fore (designated the 'A' turrets) and aft (the 'Y' turrets). These turrets were originally intended for a that was canceled shortly after the war began.Burt, pp. 291, 308. The guns could be depressed to ‚àí3¬∞ and elevated to 20¬∞; they could be loaded at any angle up to 20¬∞, although loading at high angles tended to slow the gun's return to battery (firing position). The ships carried 120 shells per gun. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing shells. Furious had a single 18-inch gun fitted The Courageous-class ships were designed with 18 BL 4-inch Mark IX guns, fitted in six triple mounts. These were manually powered and quite cumbersome in use as they required a crew of thirty-two men to load and train the guns. The gun's rate of fire was only 10 to 12 rounds per minute as the loaders kept getting in each other's way. They had a maximum depression of ‚àí10¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 30¬∞. They fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of . At maximum elevation the guns had a maximum range of . The ships carried 120 rounds for each gun. Each ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt\\"cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 30 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. anti-aircraft guns on single high-angle Mark II mountings. These were mounted abreast the mainmast in the Courageous-class ships and before the funnel on Furious. The gun had a maximum depression of 10¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 90¬∞. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12‚Äì14 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . All three ships carried ten torpedoes and mounted two submerged side-loading torpedo tubes fitted near 'A' turret. They were loaded and traversed by hydraulic power, but fired by compressed air.Roberts, p. 83. The 18-inch BL Mark I gun carried by Furious was derived from the 15-inch Mark I gun used in her half-sisters. It was intended to be mounted in two single-gun turrets derived from the twin-gun 15-inch Mark I/N turret, and her barbettes were designed to accommodate either turret in case problems arose with the 18-inch gun's development, but only one turret was actually fitted. The gun could depress to ‚àí3¬∞ and elevate to a maximum of 30¬∞. It fired a , 4 crh armour-piercing, capped shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . It could fire one round per minute and the ship carried sixty rounds of ammunition. The turret's revolving mass was , only slightly more than the of its predecessor. Furiouss secondary armament consisted of 11 BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns. The guns had a maximum elevation of 25¬∞ on their pivot mounts. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 12 rounds per minute. Their maximum range was at 25¬∞ elevation. = Fire control = The main guns of the Courageous-class ships could be controlled from either of the two fire-control directors. The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore-top on the foremast.Roberts, p. 93. The secondary armament was also director-controlled.McBride, p. 106. Each turret was provided with a rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The fore-top was equipped with a rangefinder as was the torpedo control tower above the rear superstructure. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a simple rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure.Burt, p. 307. = Protection = Unlike on other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the Courageous-class ships was made from high-tensile steel, a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline belt consisted of covered by a skin. It ran from barbette to barbette with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward bulkhead well short of the bow. The belt had a height of , of which was below the designed waterline. From the forward barbette a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from , with the greatest thicknesses over the magazines and the steering gear. After the loss of three battlecruisers to magazine explosions during the Battle of Jutland, of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.Burt, pp. 308, 313. The turrets, barbettes and conning tower were made from Krupp cemented armour. The turret faces were thick while their sides ranged from in thickness and the roof was thick. The barbettes had a maximum thickness of above the main deck, but reduced in thickness to between the lower and main decks. The conning tower armour was thick and it had a three-inch roof. The primary fire-control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood. The face of the hood was six inches thick, its sides were two inches thick and its roof was protected by three inches of armour. A communications tube with three-inch sides ran from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the main deck. The torpedo bulkheads were increased during building from to in thickness.Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113. All three ships were fitted with a shallow anti-torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.Roberts, p. 111.

The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret.Burt, p. 309. In addition, the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical flange of the angle iron securing the deck armour in place.Burt, pp. 309, 313. The exact cause remains uncertain, but Courageous received of stiffening in response; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918.Roberts, p. 54. Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck.McBride, p. 109.Burt, p. 314. Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).Parkes, p. 621. Furious as originally completed Even as she was being built, Furious was modified with a large hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle replacing the forward turret. A 160-foot (49 m) flight deck was built along its roof. Aircraft were flown off and, less successfully, landed on this deck. Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun trialled, it was not long before Furious returned to her builders for further modifications. In November 1917 the rear turret was replaced by a 300-foot (91 m) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar.Parkes, p. 622. Her funnel and superstructure remained intact, with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks. Turbulence from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden.Parkes, p. 624. Her 18-inch guns were reused on the monitors and during the war.Buxton, p. 73. All three ships were in the 1st CS of which Courageous was flagship when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October 1917, possibly indicating some sort of raid. Admiral Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. Furious was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4¬∞ East and to return before dark. The other two ships were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day.Newbolt, pp. 150‚Äì151. Two German light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy headed to Scandinavia during the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships, but they proved to be too fast and the British ships were unsuccessful.Newbolt, pp. 156‚Äì157. = Second Battle of Heligoland Bight = Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st CS covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.Newbolt, pp. 164‚Äì165. The German ships, four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight Sperrbrechers (cork-filled trawlers, used to detonate mines without sinking) and two trawlers to mark the swept route, were spotted at 7:30 a.m.,The times used in this article are in UTC, which is one hour behind CET, which is often used in German works. silhouetted by the rising sun. Courageous and the light cruiser opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted. One 15-inch hit was made on a gun shield of , but it did not affect her speed. At 8:33 the left-hand gun in Gloriouss forward turret was wrecked when a shell detonated inside the gun barrel. At 9:30 the 1st CS broke off their pursuit so they would not enter a minefield marked on their maps; the ships turned south, playing no further role in the battle. The German ships had too much of a lead to be caught by the British ships before they had to turn to avoid the minefield.McBride, pp. 110‚Äì112. Both ships had taken minor damage from their own muzzle blasts, and Glorious required five days of repairs.McBride, p. 115. Courageous fired 92 rounds of 15-inch while Glorious fired 57, scoring only the single hit on Pillau between them. They also fired 180 and 213 four-inch shells respectively.Campbell, p. 67. Courageouss mine fittings were removed after the battle and both ships received flying-off platforms on top of their turrets in 1918. A Sopwith Camel was carried on the rear turret and a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter on the forward turret.Campbell, p. 66. Furious was recommissioned on 15 March 1918 and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918 she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid, attacking the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern with moderate success.Newbolt, p. 347. All three ships were present at the surrender of the German fleet on 21 November 1918. = Post-war history = Courageous was reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February 1919 before being assigned to the Gunnery School at Devonport the following year as a turret drill ship. She became flagship of the Rear-Admiral Commanding the Reserve at Devonport in March 1920. Glorious was also reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February and served as a turret-drill ship, but succeeded her sister as flagship between 1921 and 1922. Furious was placed in reserve 21 November 1919 before beginning reconstruction as an aircraft carrier in 1921.Burt, p. 315. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 required the signatory nations to severely curtail their plans for new warships and scrap many existing warships to meet its tonnage limits. Up to of existing ships, however, could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy chose to convert the Courageous-class ships because of their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a full-length flight deck during the 1920s. Their 15-inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during the Second World War for , the Royal Navy's last battleship.Parkes, p. 647. As the first large, or \\"fleet\\", carrier completed by the Royal Navy, Furious was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first ever carrier night-landing in 1926.Jenkins, p. 274. Courageous became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War II when she was torpedoed in September 1939.Rohwer, pp. 1‚Äì3. Glorious unsuccessfully hunted the in the Indian Ocean in 1939. She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, but was sunk by the German battleships and on 8 June 1940 in the North Sea.Rohwer, p. 26. Furious spent the first months of the war hunting for German raiders and escorting convoys before she began to support British forces in Norway. She spent most of 1940 in Norwegian waters making attacks on German installations and shipping, and most of 1941 ferrying aircraft to West Africa, Gibraltar and Malta before refitting in the United States. She ferried aircraft to Malta during 1942 and provided air support to British forces during Operation Torch. Furious spent most of 1943 training with the Home Fleet, but made numerous air strikes against the and other targets in Norway in 1944. She was worn out by late 1944 and was reduced to reserve in September before being decommissioned the following year. Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap.Jenkins, pp. 277‚Äì288.

At a later time it was advocated for and popularized by Alexei Leont'ev. Some of the traces of the theory in its inception can also be found in a few works of Lev Vygotsky,Yasnitsky, A. (2018). Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography. London and New York: Routledge BOOK PREVIEW. These scholars sought to understand human activities as systemic and socially situated phenomena and to go beyond paradigms of reflexology (the teaching of Vladimir Bekhterev and his followers) and classical conditioning (the teaching of Ivan Pavlov and his school), psychoanalysis and behaviorism. It became one of the major psychological approaches in the former USSR, being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, and in education, professional training, ergonomics, social psychology and work psychology. Activity theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive theory. It considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality‚Äîit studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object- oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system. This system includes the object (or objective), subject, mediating artifacts (signs and tools), rules, community and division of labor. The motive for the activity in AT is created through the tensions and contradictions within the elements of the system. According to ethnographer Bonnie Nardi, a leading theorist in AT, activity theory \\"focuses on practice, which obviates the need to distinguish 'applied' from 'pure' science‚Äîunderstanding everyday practice in the real world is the very objective of scientific practice. ... The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity.\\" Sometimes called \\"Cultural-Historical Activity Theory\\", this approach is particularly useful for studying a group that exists \\"largely in virtual form, its communications mediated largely through electronic and printed texts.\\"Foot, K. (2001). Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as Practical Theory: Illuminating the Development of a Conflict Monitoring Network. Communication Theory, 11(1), 56‚Äì83. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00233.x/abstract AT is particularly useful as a lens in qualitative research methodologies (e.g., ethnography, case study). AT provides a method of understanding and analyzing a phenomenon, finding patterns and making inferences across interactions, describing phenomena and presenting phenomena through a built-in language and rhetoric. A particular activity is a goal-directed or purposeful interaction of a subject with an object through the use of tools. These tools are exteriorized forms of mental processes manifested in constructs, whether physical or psychological. AT recognizes the internalization and externalization of cognitive processes involved in the use of tools, as well as the transformation or development that results from the interaction.Fjeld, M., Lauche, K., Bichsel, M., Voorhorst, F., Krueger, H., Rauterberg, M. (2002): Physical and Virtual Tools: Activity Theory Applied to the Design of Groupware. In B. A. Nardi & D. F. Redmiles (eds.) A Special Issue of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): Activity Theory and the Practice of Design, Volume 11 (1‚Äì2), pp. 153‚Äì180. History The origins of activity theory can be traced to several sources, which have subsequently given rise to various complementary and intertwined strands of development. This account will focus on three of the most important of these strands. The first is associated with the Moscow Institute of Psychology and in particular the \\"troika\\" of young Russian researchers, Vygotsky, Leont'ev and Luria. Vygotsky founded cultural- historical psychology, a field that became the basis for modern AT; Leont'ev, one of the principal founders of activity theory, both developed and reacted against Vygotsky's work. Leont'ev's formulation of general activity theory is currently the most influential in post-Soviet developments in AT, which have largely been in social-scientific, organizational, and writing-studies rather than psychological research. The second major line of development within activity theory involves Russian scientists, such as P. K. Anokhin and Nikolai Bernstein, more directly concerned with the neurophysiological basis of activity; its foundation is associated with the Soviet philosopher of psychology Sergei Rubinstein. This work was subsequently developed by researchers such as Pushkin, Zinchenko & Gordeeva, Ponomarenko, Zarakovsky and others, and is currently most well-known through the work on systemic- structural activity theory being carried out by G. Z. Bedny and his associates. Finally, in the Western world, discussions and use of AT are primarily framed within the Scandinavian activity theory strand, developed by Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m. =Russian= After Vygotsky's early death, Leont'ev became the leader of the research group nowadays known as the Kharkov School of Psychology and extended Vygotsky's research framework in significantly new ways. Leont'ev first examined the psychology of animals, looking at the different degrees to which animals can be said to have mental processes. He concluded that Pavlov's reflexionism was not a sufficient explanation of animal behaviour and that animals have an active relation to reality, which he called \\"activity\\". In particular, the behaviour of higher primates such as chimpanzees could only be explained by the ape's formation of multi-phase plans using tools. Leont'ev then progressed to humans and pointed out that people engage in \\"actions\\" that do not in themselves satisfy a need, but contribute towards the eventual satisfaction of a need. Often, these actions only make sense in a social context of a shared work activity. This led him to a distinction between \\"activities\\", which satisfy a need, and the \\"actions\\" that constitute the activities. Leont'ev also argued that the activity in which a person is involved is reflected in their mental activity, that is (as he puts it) material reality is \\"presented\\" to consciousness, but only in its vital meaning or significance. Activity theory also influenced the development of organizational-activity game as developed by Georgy Shchedrovitsky. =Scandinavian= AT remained virtually unknown outside the Soviet Union until the mid-1980s, when it was picked up by Scandinavian researchers. The first international conference on activity theory was not held until 1986. The earliest non-Soviet paper cited by Nardi is a 1987 paper by Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m: \\"Learning by expanding\\". This resulted in a reformulation of AT. Kuutti notes that the term \\"activity theory\\" \\"can be used in two senses: referring to the original Soviet tradition or referring to the international, multi-voiced community applying the original ideas and developing them further.\\" The Scandinavian AT school of thought seeks to integrate and develop concepts from Vygotsky's Cultural-historical psychology and Leont'ev's activity theory with Western intellectual developments such as Cognitive Science, American Pragmatism, Constructivism, and Actor-Network Theory. It is known as Scandinavian activity theory. Work in the systems-structural theory of activity is also being carried on by researchers in the US and UK. Some of the changes are a systematisation of Leont'ev's work. Although Leont'ev's exposition is clear and well structured, it is not as well-structured as the formulation by Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m. Kaptelinin remarks that Engestr√∂m \\"proposed a scheme of activity different from that by Leont'ev; it contains three interacting entities‚Äîthe individual, the object and the community‚Äîinstead of the two components‚Äîthe individual and the object‚Äîin Leont'ev's original scheme.\\"Kaptelinin 1996, p. 57 Some changes were introduced, apparently by importing notions from human‚Äìcomputer interaction theory. For instance, the notion of rules, which is not found in Leont'ev, was introduced. Also, the notion of collective subject was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s (Leont'ev refers to \\"joint labour activity\\", but only has individuals, not groups, as activity subjects). Theory Activity system diagramThe goal of activity theory is understanding the mental capabilities of a single individual. However, it rejects the isolated individuals as insufficient unit of analysis, analyzing the cultural and technical aspects of human actions. Activity theory is most often used to describe actions in a socio-technical system through six related elements (Bryant et al. as defined by Leonti'ev 1981 and redefined in Engestr√∂m 1987) of a conceptual system expanded by more nuanced theories: * Object-orientedness ‚Äì the objective of the activity system. Object refers to the objectiveness of the reality; items are considered objective according to natural sciences but also have social and cultural properties. * Subject or internalization ‚Äì actors engaged in the activities; the traditional notion of mental processes * Community or externalization ‚Äì social context; all actors involved in the activity system * Tools or tool mediation ‚Äì the artifacts (or concepts) used by actors in the system. Tools influence actor-structure interactions, they change with accumulating experience. In addition to physical shape, the knowledge also evolves. Tools are influenced by culture, and their use is a way for the accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tools influence both the agents and the structure. * Division of labor ‚Äì social strata, hierarchical structure of activity, the division of activities among actors in the system * Rules ‚Äì conventions, guidelines and rules regulating activities in the system Activity theory helps explain how social artifacts and social organization mediate social action (Bryant et al.). Information systems The application of activity theory to information systems derives from the work of Bonnie Nardi and Kari Kuutti. Kuutti's work is addressed below. Nardi's approach is, briefly, as follows: Nardi (p. 6) described activity theory as \\"...a powerful and clarifying descriptive tool rather than a strongly predictive theory. The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity...Activity theorists argue that consciousness is not a set of discrete disembodied cognitive acts (decision making, classification, remembering), and certainly it is not the brain; rather, consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do.\\"Nardi, B. A. (1996). Activity theory and human computer interaction In B. A. Nardi (Ed.), Context and Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction (pp. 1‚Äì8). Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. Nardi (p. 5) also argued that \\"activity theory proposes a strong notion of mediation‚Äîall human experience is shaped by the tools and sign systems we use.\\" Nardi (p. 6) explained that \\"a basic tenet of activity theory is that a notion of consciousness is central to a depiction of activity. Vygotsky described consciousness as a phenomenon that unifies attention, intention, memory, reasoning, and speech...\\" and (p. 7) \\"Activity theory, with its emphasis on the importance of motive and consciousness‚Äîwhich belongs only to humans‚Äîsees people and things as fundamentally different. People are not reduced to 'nodes' or 'agents' in a system; 'information processing' is not seen as something to be modelled in the same way for people and machines.\\" In a later work, Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that \\"activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness\\" and therefore \\"... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools.\\" For Activity Theorists \\"consciousness\\" seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions. Over the last 15 years the use and exploration of activity theory in information systems has grown.Ditsa, G. (2003). Activity theory as a theoretical foundation for information systems research Information management (pp. 192‚Äì231): IGI Publishing.Chen, R., Sharman, R., Rao, H. R., & Upadhyaya, S. J. (2013). Data Model Development for Fire Related Extreme Events: An Activity Theory Approach. MIS Quarterly, in press. One stream of research has focused on technology mediated change and the implementation of technologies and how they disrupt, change and improve organisational work activity. In these studies, activity systems are used to understand emergent contradictions in the work activity, which are temporarily resolved using information systems (tools) and/or arising from the introduction of information systems. Information science studies use a similar approach to activity theory in order to understand information behaviour \\"in context\\".Allen, D., Karanasios, S., & Slavova, M. (2011).

Their work has illustrated this perspective with analyses of online interactions between gay men and their religious family membersEtengoff, C. & Daiute, C. (2015).

Sunni-Muslim American Religious Development during Emerging Adulthood, Journal of Adolescent Research, 28(6), 690‚Äì714. Human‚Äìcomputer interaction The rise of the personal computer challenged the focus in traditional systems developments on mainframe systems for automation of existing work routines. It furthermore brought forth a need to focus on how to work on materials and objects through the computer. In the search of theoretical and methodical perspectives suited to deal with issues of flexibility and more advanced mediation between the human being, material and outcomes through the interface, it seemed promising to turn to the still rather young HCI research tradition that had emerged primarily in the US (for further discussion see Bannon & B√∏dker, 1991). Specifically the cognitive science-based theories lacked means of addressing a number of issues that came out of the empirical projects (see Bannon & B√∏dker, 1991): 1. Many of the early advanced user interfaces assumed that the users were the designers themselves, and accordingly built on an assumption of a generic user, without concern for qualifications, work environment, division of work, etc. 2.In particular the role of the artifact as it stands between the user and her materials, objects and outcomes was ill understood. 3. In validating findings and designs there was a heavy focus on novice users whereas everyday use by experienced users and concerns for the development of expertise were hardly addressed. 4.Detailed task analysis and the idealized models created through task analysis failed to capture the complexity and contingency of real-life action. 5.From the point of view of complex work settings, it was striking how most HCI focused on one user ‚Äì one computer in contrast to the ever-ongoing cooperation and coordination of real work situations (this problem later lead to the development of CSCW). 6.Users were mainly seen as objects of study. Because of these shortcomings, it was necessary to move outside cognitive science-based HCI to find or develop the necessary theoretical platform. European psychology had taken different paths than had American with much inspiration from dialectical materialism (Hyd√©n 1981, Engestr√∂m, 1987). Philosophers such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein came to play an important role, primarily through discussions of the limitations of AI (Winograd & Flores 1986, Dreyfus & Dreyfus 1986). Suchman (1987) with a similar focus introduced ethnomethodology into the discussions, and Ehn (1988) based his treatise of design of computer artifacts on Marx, Heidegger and Wittgenstein. The development of the activity theoretical angle was primarily carried out by B√∏dker (1991, 1996) and by Kuutti (Bannon & Kuutti, 1993, Kuutti, 1991, 1996), both with strong inspiration from Scandinavian activity theory groups in psychology. Bannon (1990, 1991) and Grudin (1990a and b) made significant contributions to the furthering of the approach by making it available to the HCI audience. The work of Kaptelinin (1996) has been important to connect to the earlier development of activity theory in Russia. Nardi produced the, hitherto, most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature (Nardi, 1996). =Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)= At the end of the 1990s, a group of Russian and American activity theorists working in the systems-cybernetic tradition of Bernshtein and Anokhin began to publish English-language articles and books dealing with topics in human factors and ergonomicsBedny, G. Z. & Meister, D. (1997). The Russian Theory of Activity: Current Applications to Design and Learning, Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. and, latterly, human‚Äìcomputer interaction.Bedny, G. Z. & Karwowski, W. (2003b). A Systemic-Structural Activity Approach to the Design of Human-Computer Interaction Tasks. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 16, pp. 235‚Äì260. Under the rubric of systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT), this work represents a modern synthesis within activity theory which brings together the cultural-historical and systems-structural strands of the tradition (as well as other work within Soviet psychology such as the Psychology of Set) with findings and methods from Western human factors/ergonomics and cognitive psychology. The development of SSAT has been specifically oriented toward the analysis and design of the basic elements of human work activity: tasks, tools, methods, objects and results, and the skills, experience and abilities of involved subjects. SSAT has developed techniques for both the qualitative and quantitative description of work activity.Bedny, G. Z. & Karwowski, W. (2006) A Systemic-Structural Theory of Activity: Applications to Human Performance and Work Design. Boca Raton, CRC Press/Taylor & Francis. Its design-oriented analyses specifically focus on the interrelationship between the structure and self-regulation of work activity and the configuration of its material components. An explanation This section presents a short introduction to activity theory, and some brief comments on human creativity in activity theory and the implications of activity theory for tacit knowledge and learning. =Activities= Activity theory begins with the notion of activity. An activity is seen as a system of human \\"doing\\" whereby a subject works on an object in order to obtain a desired outcome. In order to do this, the subject employs tools, which may be external (e.g. an axe, a computer) or internal (e.g. a plan). As an illustration, an activity might be the operation of an automated call centre. As we shall see later, many subjects may be involved in the activity and each subject may have one or more motives (e.g. improved supply management, career advancement or gaining control over a vital organisational power source). A simple example of an activity within a call centre might be a telephone operator (subject) who is modifying a customer's billing record (object) so that the billing data is correct (outcome) using a graphical front end to a database (tool). Kuutti formulates activity theory in terms of the structure of an activity. \\"An activity is a form of doing directed to an object, and activities are distinguished from each other according to their objects. Transforming the object into an outcome motivates the existence of an activity. An object can be a material thing, but it can also be less tangible.\\" Kuutti then adds a third term, the tool, which 'mediates' between the activity and the object. \\"The tool is at the same time both enabling and limiting: it empowers the subject in the transformation process with the historically collected experience and skill 'crystallised' to it, but it also restricts the interaction to be from the perspective of that particular tool or instrument; other potential features of an object remain invisible to the subject...\\". As Verenikina remarks, tools are \\"social objects with certain modes of operation developed socially in the course of labour and are only possible because they correspond to the objectives of a practical action.\\" =Levels= An activity is modelled as a three-level hierarchy. Kuutti schematises processes in activity theory as a three-level system. Verenikina paraphrases Leont'ev as explaining that \\"the non-coincidence of action and operations... appears in actions with tools, that is, material objects which are crystallised operations, not actions nor goals. If a person is confronted with a specific goal of, say, dismantling a machine, then they must make use of a variety of operations; it makes no difference how the individual operations were learned because the formulation of the operation proceeds differently to the formulation of the goal that initiated the action.\\" The levels of activity are also characterised by their purposes: \\"Activities are oriented to motives, that is, the objects that are impelling by themselves. Each motive is an object, material or ideal, that satisfies a need. Actions are the processes functionally subordinated to activities; they are directed at specific conscious goals... Actions are realised through operations that are determined by the actual conditions of activity.\\" Engestr√∂m developed an extended model of an activity, which adds another component, community (\\"those who share the same object\\"), and then adds rules to mediate between subject and community, and the division of labour to mediate between object and community. Kuutti asserts that \\"These three classes should be understood broadly. A tool can be anything used in the transformation process, including both material tools and tools for thinking. Rules cover both explicit and implicit norms, conventions, and social relations within a community. Division of labour refers to the explicit and implicit organisation of the community as related to the transformation process of the object into the outcome.\\" Activity theory therefore includes the notion that an activity is carried out within a social context, or specifically in a community. The way in which the activity fits into the context is thus established by two resulting concepts: * rules: these are both explicit and implicit and define how subjects must fit into the community; * division of labour: this describes how the object of the activity relates to the community. =The internal plane of action= Activity theory provides a number of useful concepts that can be used to address the lack of expression for 'soft' factors which are inadequately represented by most process modelling frameworks. One such concept is the internal plane of action. Activity theory recognises that each activity takes place in two planes: the external plane and the internal plane. The external plane represents the objective components of the action while the internal plane represents the subjective components of the action. Kaptelinin defines the internal plane of actions as \\"[...] a concept developed in activity theory that refers to the human ability to perform manipulations with an internal representation of external objects before starting actions with these objects in reality.\\"Kaptelinin 1996, p. 51 The concepts of motives, goals and conditions discussed above also contribute to the modelling of soft factors. One principle of activity theory is that many activities have multiple motivation ('polymotivation'). For instance, a programmer in writing a program may address goals aligned towards multiple motives such as increasing his or her annual bonus, obtaining relevant career experience and contributing to organisational objectives. Activity theory further argues that subjects are grouped into communities, with rules mediating between subject and community and a division of labour mediating between object and community. A subject may be part of several communities and a community, itself, may be part of other communities. =Human creativity= Human creativity plays an important role in activity theory, that \\"human beings... are essentially creative beings\\" in \\"the creative, non-predictable character\\". Tikhomirov also analyses the importance of creative activity, contrasting it to routine activity, and notes the important shift brought about by computerisation in the balance towards creative activity. Karl Marx, a sociological theorist, argued that humans are unique compared to other species in that humans create everything they need to survive. According to Marx, this is described as species-being. Marx believed we find our true identity in what we produce in our personal labor. =Learning and tacit knowledge= Activity theory has an interesting approach to the difficult problems of learning and, in particular, tacit knowledge. Learning has been a favourite subject of management theorists, but it has often been presented in an abstract way separated from the work processes to which the learning should apply. Activity theory provides a potential corrective to this tendency. For instance, Engestr√∂m's review of Nonaka's work on knowledge creation suggests enhancements based on activity theory, in particular suggesting that the organisational learning process includes preliminary stages of goal and problem formation not found in Nonaka. Lompscher, rather than seeing learning as transmission, sees the formation of learning goals and the student's understanding of which things they need to acquire as the key to the formation of the learning activity. Of particular importance to the study of learning in organisations is the problem of tacit knowledge, which according to Nonaka, \\"is highly personal and hard to formalise, making it difficult to communicate to others or to share with others.\\" Leont'ev's concept of operation provides an important insight into this problem. In addition, the key idea of internalisation was originally introduced by Vygotsky as \\"the internal reconstruction of an external operation.\\" Internalisation has subsequently become a key term of the theory of tacit knowledge and has been defined as \\"a process of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge.\\" Internalisation has been described by Engestr√∂m as the \\"key psychological mechanism\\" discovered by Vygotsky and is further discussed by Verenikina.

In 2001, Ali Abunimah and Hussein Ibish warned pro-Palestinian activists in a mass email that Shamir was espousing views that are antisemitic and merely disguised as leftist pro-Palestinian activism. In 2006, discussing the upcoming Iranian International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, Deutsche Welle wrote that the Iranian government \\"said it intended to invite academics such as German neo-Nazi [lawyer] Horst Mahler and the Israeli journalist and Christian convert Israel Shamir, both of whom are Holocaust deniers.\\"Deutsche Welle, In December 2010, Shamir's connection with WikiLeaks brought him more public attention.

Russian Reporter claims that it has \\"privileged access\\" to the 2010 United States diplomatic cables leak via Shamir. Shamir described his relation with WikiLeaks as being \\"a freelancer who was 'accredited' to WikiLeaks\\". Shamir's son Johannes Wahlstr√∂m is a spokesperson for WikiLeaks in Sweden. Former WikiLeaks staff member James Ball has said he knew the organization's denial of its connection to Shamir were untrue because Julian Assange instructed him to give Shamir 90,000 US cables. Former Wikileaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg said Wikileaks' ties to Shamir were among the reasons he quit the organization. He described Shamir as a \\"famous Holocaust denier and anti-Semite.\\" Yulia Latynina, writing in The Moscow Times, alleged that Shamir concocted a cable which allegedly quoted European Union diplomats' plans to walk out of the Durban II speech by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for publication in the pro-Putin Russian Reporter in December 2010. Shamir has denied this accusation. In an article published on the CounterPunch website in December 2010, Shamir praised the Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko and said WikiLeaks had exposed America's \\"agents\\" in the country. Shamir has been accused of passing \\"sensitive cables\\" to the Lukashenko government. He is believed to have visited Belarus in December 2010 and to have given Vladimir Makei, then Lukashenko's chief of staff, unpublished and unredacted US diplomatic cables. Soviet Belarus, a state-run newspaper began publishing what it claimed were WikiLeaks cables given to Lukashenko by Shamir in January 2011.

This method allows the generation of pulses of light with a duration as short as a few femtoseconds. The optical Kerr effect is a process which results from the nonlinear response of an optical medium to the electric field of an electromagnetic wave. The refractive index of the medium is dependent on the field strength. Hard aperture Kerr-lens modelocking principle Soft aperture Kerr-lens modelocking. Within crystal from inside to outside: Green=pump, blue=pulse, red=cw Because of the non-uniform power density distribution in a Gaussian beam (as found in laser resonators) the refractive index changes across the beam profile; the refractive index experienced by the beam is greater in the center of the beam than at the edge. Thus a rod of an active Kerr medium functions as a lens for high intensity light. This is called self-focusing and in extreme cases leads to material destruction. In the laser cavity short bursts of light will then be focused differently from continuous waves (cw). To favor the pulsed mode over cw, the cavity could be made unstable for cw-operation, but more often a low stability is a by-product of a cavity design putting emphasis on aperture effects. Older designs used a hard aperture, that simply cuts off, while modern designs use a soft aperture, that means the overlap between the pumped region of the gain medium and the pulse. While the effect of a lens on a free laser beam is quite obvious, inside a cavity the whole beam tries to adapt to this change. The standard cavity with flat mirrors and a thermal lens in the laser crystal has the smallest beam width on the end-mirrors. With the additional Kerr lens the width on the end-mirror gets even smaller. Therefore, small end-mirrors (hard aperture) favor pulses. In Ti:Sapphire oscillators telescopes are inserted around the crystal to increase the intensity. For a soft aperture consider an infinite laser crystal with a thermal lens. A laser beam is guided like in a glass fiber. With an additional Kerr lens the beam width gets smaller. In a real laser the crystal is finite. The cavity on both sides features a concave mirror and then a relative long path to a flat mirror. The cw light exits the crystal end face with a larger beam width and slight divergence. It illuminates a smaller area on the concave mirror, leading to a small beam- width on the way to the flat mirror. Thus diffraction is stronger. Because of the divergence the light is effectively coming from a point farther apart and leads to more convergence after the concave mirror. This convergence is balanced with diffraction. The pulsed light exits the end face with a smaller beam width and no divergence. Thus it illuminates a larger area on the concave mirror and is less convergent afterwards. So both cw and pulses light fronts are mirrored back onto themselves. A cavity close to a confocal one means to be close to instability, which means the beam diameter is sensitive to cavity changes. This emphasizes the modulation. With a slightly asymmetric cavity prolonging the cavity emphasizes diffraction and even makes it unstable for cw-operation, while staying stable for pulsed operation. The length of the medium used for KLM is limited by group velocity dispersion. KLM is used in Carrier envelope offset control.  Starting a Kerr-lens modelocked laser  Initiation of Kerr-lens modelocking depends on the strength of the nonlinear effect involved. If the laser field builds up in a cavity the laser has to overcome the region of cw operation, which often is favoured by the pumping mechanism. This can be achieved by a very strong Kerr-lensing that is strong enough to modelock due to small changes of the laser field strength (laser field build-up or stochastic fluctuations). Modelocking can also be started by shifting the optimum focus from the cw-operation to pulsed operation while changing the power density by kicking the end mirror of the resonator cavity (though a piezo mounted, synchronous oscillating end-mirror would be more 'turn key'). Other principles involve different nonlinear effects like saturable absorbers and saturable Bragg reflectors, which induce pulses short enough to initiate the Kerr-lensing process.  Modelocking ‚Äì evolution of the pulse  Intensity changes with lengths of nanoseconds are amplified by the Kerr-lensing process and the pulselength further shrinks to achieve higher field strengths in the center of the pulse. This sharpening process is only limited by the bandwidth achievable with the laser material and the cavity- mirrors as well as the dispersion of the cavity. The shortest pulse achievable with a given spectrum is called the bandwidth-limited pulse. Chirped mirror technology allows to compensate for timing mismatch of different wavelengths inside the cavity due to material dispersion while keeping the stability high and the losses low. The Kerr effect leads to the Kerr-lens and Self-phase modulation at the same time. To a first approximation it is possible to consider them as independent effects.  Applications  Since Kerr-lens modelocking is an effect that directly reacts on the electric field, the response time is fast enough to produce light pulses in the visible and near infrared with lengths of less than 5 femtoseconds. Due to the high electrical field strength focused ultrashort laser beams can overcome the threshold of 1014 W cm‚àí2, which surpasses the field strength of the electron-ion bond in atoms. These short pulses open the new field of ultrafast optics, which is a field of nonlinear optics that gives access to a completely new class of phenomena like measurement of electron movements in an atom (attosecond phenomena), coherent broadband light generation (ultrabroad lasers) and thereby gives rise to many new applications in optical sensing (e.g. coherent laser radar, ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography), material processing and other fields like metrology (extremely exact frequency and time measurements).

Initially a songwriter for Acuff-Rose Music, he gained a recording contract with RCA Nashville in 1990. His debut single, \\"You've Got to Stand for Something\\" became a popular anthem for American soldiers fighting in the Gulf War and helped to establish him as a neotraditionalist country act with songs that catered primarily to the American working class. Under RCA's tenure, he recorded five studio albums and a Greatest Hits package. Tippin switched to Lyric Street Records in 1998, where he recorded four more studio albums, counting a compilation of Christmas music. After leaving Lyric Street in 2006, he founded a personal label known as Nippit Records, on which he issued the compilation album Now & Then. A concept album, In Overdrive, was released in 2009. Tippin has released a total of nine studio albums and two compilations, with six gold certifications and one platinum certification among them. In addition, he has charted more than thirty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including three Number Ones: \\"There Ain't Nothin' Wrong with the Radio\\" (1992), \\"That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You\\" (1995), and \\"Kiss This\\" (2000), as well as the top ten hits \\"You've Got to Stand for Something\\", \\"I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way\\", \\"My Blue Angel\\", \\"Workin' Man's Ph.D.\\", \\"For You I Will\\", and \\"Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly\\". Biography Aaron Tippin was born in Pensacola, Florida, but raised on a farm in Travelers Rest, South Carolina, where he went to Blue Ridge High School. In the 1970s, he made a living as a singer, performing in various local bars. By the time Tippin was 20, he was working as a commercial pilot and a pipe fitter. In 1986, he moved to Nashville, where he eventually became a staff writer at Acuff-Rose. He competed on TNN's You Can Be a Star talent contest in 1986 landing a song publishing contract in 1987. During this time he wrote songs for The Kingsmen, David Ball, Mark Collie, and Charley Pride. Musical career=1991‚Äì1997: RCA Records= Tippin performed his first Nashville nightclub show in 1990, and it earned him a contract with RCA Records Nashville. His first single, \\"You've Got to Stand for Something\\", was released in 1991. The song, with its message of standing up for one's personal beliefs, became popular as an anthem for soldiers fighting in the Gulf War at the time, and reached a peak of No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. It was also the title track to his debut album, released in late 1991. Although the album was certified gold in the United States, the next two singles performed poorly: \\"I Wonder How Far It Is Over You\\" peaked at No. 40, and \\"She Made a Memory Out of Me\\" at No. 54. Brian Mansfield of Allmusic, in his review of the album, said that \\"This exciting hardcore country comes from a man whose previous blue-collar experience as a farm hand, welder, pilot, and truck driver made him a publicist's dream.\\" Giving it an \\"A\\", Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly praised Tippin's \\"humor\\" and \\"pointed language\\". Tippin's second album, Read Between the Lines, was released in 1992. Its first single was \\"There Ain't Nothin' Wrong with the Radio\\", which spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Also released from this album were the singles \\"I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way\\", \\"I Was Born with a Broken Heart\\" (previously a chart single in 1988 for Josh Logan), and \\"My Blue Angel\\", which peaked at No. 5, No. 38 and No. 7, respectively, on the country charts. Read Between the Lines became Tippin's first platinum album. In 1993, Tippin released his third studio album, titled Call of the Wild. It produced three straight Top 40 country hits in \\"Workin' Man's Ph.D.\\", the title track, and \\"Whole Lotta Love on the Line\\", while \\"Honky Tonk Superman\\", the final single, failed to make Top 40. One year later, Tippin released his fourth album, Lookin' Back at Myself, which produced the No. 15 \\"I Got It Honest\\" and the minor Top 40 \\"She Feels Like a Brand New Man Tonight\\". Tool Box, his fifth album for RCA, produced his second Number One country hit in the ballad \\"That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You\\"; the second single, \\"Without Your Love\\", peaked at No. 22, while the album's last two singles both failed to make Top 40. Like Call of the Wild and Lookin' Back at Myself before it, Tool Box also earned a gold certification from the RIAA. Tippin's final release for the RCA label, a compilation titled Greatest Hits‚Ä¶ and Then Some, was issued in 1997. This album produced two chart singles which both failed to make Top 40. In 1994 Tippin performed the National Anthem at Starrcade the annual Professional Wrestling Pay Per View Event for World Championship Wrestling. =1998‚Äì2005: Lyric Street= In 1998, Tippin moved to Lyric Street Records, then a newly formed subsidiary label of the Walt Disney Company. His first single for the label, the No. 6 hit \\"For You I Will\\", served as the lead-off to his 1998 album What This Country Needs and became his first Top Ten hit since \\"That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You\\". Following it were \\"I'm Leaving\\" at No. 17, \\"Her\\" at No. 33, and the title track at No. 48\\\\. 2000 saw the release of the single \\"Kiss This\\". Co- written by Tippin with his wife, Thea, the song went to the top of the Billboard country charts, becoming his third and final Number One hit. It served as the lead-off to his second Lyric Street album, People Like Us, and the David Lee Murphy-penned title track reached Top 20 in 2001. People Like Us was also certified gold. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, he released the patriotic-themed song \\"Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly\\". His biggest crossover hit, the song reached No. 2 on the country charts and No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was included on his album Stars & Stripes, which was released in early 2002 (following the release of his Christmas album A December to Remember). Stars & Stripes produced three more singles, including the ballad \\"Love Like There's No Tomorrow\\", a duet with Thea. Tippin's last release for Lyric Street was a single entitled \\"Come Friday\\", which was slated to be included on an album entitled I Believed. The single peaked at No. 42 on the country charts, and I Believed was not released; by 2005, he had exited Lyric Street. =2006‚Äì2012= In 2006, Tippin formed his own record label, Nippit Records, in a joint partnership with Rust Nashville. His first release for the album, Aaron Tippin: Now & Then, produced the singles \\"Ready to Rock (In a Country Kind of Way)\\" and \\"He Believed\\", the latter of which peaked at No. 55 on the country charts. On September 9, 2007, Aaron released a new single called \\"Drill Here, Drill Now\\" which was inspired by the \\"Drill Here\\" movement led by Newt Gingrich at his American Solutions organization. Tippin signed to Country Crossing Records in 2008. His first album for the label, In Overdrive, was released in February 2009. This album comprises covers of country songs that have truck driving themes. Personal life On July 15, 1995, Tippin married the former Thea Corontzos at a Greek Orthodox ceremony in Nashville. Along with his manager, Billy Craven, Aaron and Thea Tippin created Tippin's company, Tip Top Entertainment. They reside in Dowelltown, Tennessee. The couple have two sons. Tippin also opened two hunting supply stores called Aaron Tippin Firearms: one in Smithville, Tennessee, and the other was run by his late father, Willis Emory Tippin, in Oak City, North Carolina. (Willis died in 2005.) According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Tippin is an instrument rated commercial pilot with single and multi-engine ratings. He also has private pilot privileges for rotorcraft-helicopter. He is a certified airframe and power plant mechanic. Musical style Tippin's singing voice is a baritone, characterized by a heavy, nasal Southern twang. His phrasing has been compared to Hank Williams for \\"the catch in the throat, followed by a sliding moan\\", as described by Entertainment Weekly reviewer Alanna Nash in her review of Tippin's debut. Several of Tippin's songs, such as \\"Workin' Man's Ph.D\\" and \\"You've Got to Stand for Something\\", are mid-tempo anthems that address the working class, and are often patriotic in nature. Occasionally, Tippin records love-themed ballads, such as \\"That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You\\". Other songs of his, such as \\"There Ain't Nothin' Wrong with the Radio\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Superman\\", are honky tonk-influenced novelties.

He was best known for his novels that focus on the people of the southern provinces of China and Southeast Asia. He was also the first Chinese professor who taught Sanskrit at a Chinese university.  Life = Early life = Xu was born in Tainan, Taiwan. His father, Xu Nangying (Ë®±ÂçóËã±) was a Taiwanese jinshi who assisted Liu Yongfu to establish the Republic of Formosa in Tainan. After the Japanese takeover in 1895 his family escaped to Shantou via the harbour of Anping. Following the fall of the Republic of Formosa Xu Nangying resided with his relatives and started teaching in Thailand and Singapore. After returning from Southeast Asia, Xu Nangying obtained his family registration in Fujian and settled down in Guangzhou where Xu lived and studied. During his stay in Guangzhou, Xu learned Cantonese, Cantonese opera, Cantonese folk songs and pipa. He spoke both Taiwanese Hokkien and Teowchew dialect as his mother tongues. Although he studied at a modern school in Guangzhou, he was deeply influenced by traditional Chinese studies. After the 1911 Revolution, Xu Nangying got a position in administration in southern Fujian. Xu Dishan accompanied his father and taught in primary and secondary schools in Zhangzhou. Later he also worked as a teacher in a Chinese-language school in Yangon, Myanmar. In 1917, Xu went to Yenching University for his undergraduate studies. After graduation, he worked as Zhou Zuoren's teaching assistant and studied theology at Yenching. Xu was considered one of the active participants and pioneers of the May Fourth Movement. In January 1921, Xu and scholars such as Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao and Zheng Zhenduo established a literature society and a monthly literature journal. He was deeply interested in Indian literature, and translated Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali into Chinese. = Academic career = In 1922, he went to Columbia University to study comparative religion and history of religion, and obtained a Master of Arts degree two years later. Later he read historiography of religion, Indology, Sanskrit and Buddhism at Oxford University, where he also picked up French, German, Greek and Latin. In 1926, he graduated with a Bachelor of Letters degree. He was appointed as professor at Yenching in 1927, and taught at Peking University and Tsinghua University. With the recommendation of Hu Shih, he was appointed as the head of the Department of Chinese of the University of Hong Kong in 1935.

He was one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove who held aloof from the dangerous politics of third-century China to devote themselves to art and refinement. Ji Kang is noted as an author and was also a famous composer and guqin-player. He was described as a handsome and tall man (approximately 1.88 metres). Life As a thinker, Ji Kang wrote on longevity, music theory, politics and ethics. Among his works were Yangsheng Lun (È£¨ÁîüË´ñ, Essay on Nourishing Life), Shengwu Aile Lun (ËÅ≤ÁÑ°ÂìÄÊ®ÇË´ñ, Discourse on sounds [as] lacking sorrow or joy, i.e. On the Absence of Sentiments in Music), Qin Fu (Áê¥Ë≥¶, A Composition on the Qin), and Shisi Lun (ÈáãÁßÅË´ñ, Discourse on Individuality). As a musician, Ji Kang composed a number of solo pieces for the qin. Ji Kang was highly critical of Confucianism and challenged many social conventions of his time, provoking scandal and suspicion. He married Cao Cao's granddaughter (or great-granddaughter according to some). Ji Kang assumed a post under the Cao Wei state, but official work bored him. When the regent Sima Zhao came to power, he offered Ji Kang a civil position, but Ji Kang insolently rejected Sima Zhao's envoy Zhong Hui. When one of Ji Kang's friends was imprisoned on false charges, Ji Kang testified in his defense, but both were sent to jail. At Zhong Hui's urging, Sima Zhao sentenced Ji Kang to death. Three thousand scholars petitioned for his pardon, but his enemies were implacable. Before his execution, Ji Kang is said to have played one last melody on the guqin, a swan song forever lost. Ji Kang wrote Guangling San, a composition for the Guqin recounting the assassination of a king of Han.

It premiered in Monthly Asuka's May 1992 issue and ran there until the magazine's editors showed concern in the increasingly violent stories. The series went on long-term hiatus in March 2003 and has yet to be concluded. The story takes place at the end of days, in the year 1999. The series follows Kamui Shir≈ç, a young esper who returns home to Tokyo after a 6-year absence to face his destiny as the one who will determine humanity's fate. Kadokawa Shoten collected and published the individual chapters in 18 tank≈çbon volumes, with five chapters published in the book \\"All about Clamp\\". All but several final chapters have been published. It has been adapted into a series of audio dramas, a 1996 animated feature film and a television series in 2001 with the two latter produced by Madhouse. Viz Media published all 18 volumes in North America, while the film and the TV series have released in DVDs by Manga Entertainment and Geneon, respectively. The series is a foray into apocalyptic fiction; it combines elements from various end of the world scenarios, both secular and religious, with its own mythos. Its many themes include exploring the personality of mankind and their relationship with others and external conflicts, such as the impending Armageddon. It has also garnered mostly positive reviews, despite its lack of an ending.  Plot  In 1999, a teenager named Kamui Shir≈ç returns to Tokyo after a six-year absence. He comes to protect those dearest to him, Kotori and F≈´ma Monou, and fulfill his mother's dying wish of changing fate. The end of the world is fast approaching as superhuman individuals gather and take sides in Tokyo, the battle site of Armageddon. Following Kamui's arrival the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth, the two factions in the final battle for humanity's future, vie for the young man's allegiance, convinced his power will assure their victory. The Dragons of Heaven are the first to contact Kamui. The Dragons of Heaven are guided by Hinoto, dreamgazer for the Legislature of Japan. They are the protectors of the , spiritual barriers (in the form of buildings such as the Tokyo Tower) that hold the fabric of nature together. As long as the kekkai survive, Judgment Day is postponed. The Dragons of Earth are the counterpart to the Dragons of Heaven. Their mission is to destroy the kekkai and unleash earthquakes so the Earth can be cured of the plague of humanity. They were assembled by Hinoto's sister Kanoe, secretary to the Governor of Tokyo. As Kamui is forced to choose between the two sides, he concludes he only wants to protect Kotori and F≈´ma, and becomes a Dragon of Heaven. At the same time, F≈´ma has a change of personality and becomes the \\"Kamui\\" of the Dragons of Earth as he was destined to be Kamui's opposite. F≈´ma kills Kotori and swears to kill Kamui. Deciding he wishes to bring F≈´ma back to normal, Kamui joins the Dragons of Heaven in their fight against the Dragons of Earth. Because of the issues regarding the manga's serialization, the plot from the series has yet to be concluded by Clamp. The animated films and the TV series follow the manga's initial story and come to two different endings. In the film all the Dragons of Heaven and Earth die in the ensuing battles, leaving Kamui and F≈´ma as the last Dragons. In the final battle, Kamui decapitates F≈´ma and the film ends with Kamui crying why he ended killing his best friend. In the TV series, all the Dragons of Heavens lose their powers to create kekkai because they lose their most important people leaving the Tokyo defenseless. As Hinoto commits suicide to stop her alternate self from attacking the Dragons of Heaven, Kamui goes to face F≈´ma. In the fight's outcome, Kamui is killed by F≈´ma, but uses his last forces to transform his body into a kekkai that protects the world from the change from the Dragons of Earth, and causes F≈´ma to return to his old self.  Design  Clamp's X appears to defy the conventions of \\"boys' manga\\" and \\"girls' manga\\". Intended for a female audience, the series is drawn in the ornate style characteristic of sh≈çjo manga; but the emphasis on moral conflict and gruesome violence expected of seinen works attracts male readers as well. The story develops the group's ideas on Man's responsibility to itself, its family and the planet; and is influenced by the works of Go Nagai and Kyokutei Bakin. = Development = After the success of Tokyo Babylon and Clamp School Detectives, the members of Clamp were approached by their editor at Monthly Asuka to script a longer series.\\"Interview with Clamp: X (Part 1)\\" in Clamp no Kiseki, Volume 8. Kodansha, 2005. . Nanase Ohkawa, the group's head writer, seized the opportunity to script her long-in-development \\"end of the world\\" epic. Conceived while she was still in middle school, Ohkawa's original story focused on a group of warriors fighting a losing battle in the name of \\"justice\\". While the idea never materialized, many aspects were carried over into Clamp's manga, including the lead characters of Kamui and Fuma.Ten years of X. PUFF magazine, January 2002, 19-21. Ohkawa cites Go Nagai's Devilman as a stylistic and thematic influence. Beyond his penchant for drawing extreme violence, Nagai's writing involves themes like the nature of good and evil and fear, ideas that left an impression on Clamp's writer at an early age. Like Devilman, X follows two male best friends destined to fight each other at Armageddon, a confrontation brought about by the murder of the hero's childhood sweetheart. The rest of the cast includes characters from the group's entire canon, including unpublished works, effectively creating a whole world inhabited by their creations.\\"Interview with Clamp: Clamp School Detectives\\" in Clamp no Kiseki, Volume 5. Tokyopop, 2006. . The ensemble cast, inspired on Kyokutei Bakin's Nans≈ç Satomi Hakkenden, includes Subaru Sumeragi and Seishiro Sakurazuka from Tokyo Babylon, as well as the main characters of Clamp School Detectives. The title of \\"X\\" was chosen because it has no fixed meaning. In mathematics, it is a common variable. Beyond mathematics, \\"X\\" is a generic placeholder whose value is secret or unknown. \\"X\\" is also a cruciform, an allusion to Christian mythos, and the representation of death and rebirth in Kabbalah. = Influences = The motif of the \\"dragons of earth\\" in opposition to \\"dragons of heaven\\" was influenced by the concepts of the firmament and earth dragons in Chinese mythology, especially feng shui. In feng shui, earthquakes are attributed to the shifting of earth dragon when it is agitated. Similarly in X, Tokyo is fated to be destroyed by a series of earthquakes created by the dragons of earth.

The series combines elements from various end of the world scenarios and myths, including Christian eschatology,Asuka Staff. (1993). Clamp Interview: X. Monthly Asuka, 6. with Clamp's own modern mythology to tell the tale of the fate of the world. The X mythos is inspired by the Apocalypse of John, with Tokyo standing in as a modern-day Babylon. Like the biblical city,\\"Interview with Clamp: Tokyo Babylon\\" in Clamp no Kiseki, Volume 3. Tokyopop, 2005. . Clamp's Tokyo is \\"the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird,\\" (Rev. 18:2 KJV) and is slated for destruction. Kamui is established as a Christ figure.X Infinity: Illustrated Collection 2. (Kadokawa Shoten: ). 2005. He is the one prophesied to return to Tokyo and the one who will determine humanity's fate. The construction of Kamui as a messiah is reinforced by his miraculous birth and given name. \\"Kamui\\", like \\"Christ\\", doubles as a title that alludes to the character's divine nature. Apocalyptic allusions abound with respect to nomenclature. The Dragons of Heaven take their moniker from the seven seals introduced in Chapter 5 of the Book of Revelation, while the antagonistic Angels allude to the seven celestial beings ordered to \\"go [their] ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth\\" (Rev. 16:1 KJV).X Zero: Illustrated Collection. (Kadokawa Shoten: ). 2000. On the side of the Angels is , a sentient supercomputer branded with the number 666. Other apocalyptic standards such as earthquakes are employed, but the apocalypse of Clamp's manga trades the religious element for an environmental theme. Inspired by the Gaia theory, the idea that the Earth itself is one living organism, Ohkawa crafts an endtime brought on by humanity's abuse of the planet.Oshiguchi, Takashi. ‚ÄúNanase Okawa.‚Äù In Anime Interviews: The First Five Years of Animerica, Anime & Manga Monthly (1992-97). VIZ Media LLC, 1997, pp. 172‚Äì183. . The story reflects environmental concerns in its depiction of Judgment Day. Mankind exists in binary opposition to the Earth. By the end of days, humanity has become such a nuisance that the only way to save the planet is to destroy the whole of civilization. The Angels, human beings themselves, expect a post-judgment return to paradise.The \\"return to paradise\\" is a standard motif of apocalyptic writings like the Book of Revelation (\\"And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new\\" Rev. 21:5) and the Book of Enoch (\\"A generation of righteousness shall arise, and wrongdoing shall be destroyed, and sin shall depart from the earth\\" 1 Enoch 10:7). With mankind gone, the planet can regulate itself back to health and experience a rebirth. The Seals, however, look to preserve the status quo and to entrust the future of the planet to the people. = Themes = The conflict between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth is at the heart of the series. The characters carry the story, and their confrontations go beyond the physical as mankind's continued existence becomes a question of ethics, ideals, and biology. Like its predecessor Tokyo Babylon,\\"Interview with Clamp: xxxHOLiC\\" in Clamp no Kiseki, Volume 10. Kodansha, 2005. . X deals with societal issues. Being set in the present provides an outlet for the authors to reflect and comment on Japan's state of affairs. But unlike Tokyo Babylon, where the characters were vocal in their concerns,In Tokyo Babylon Book 1, Vol. 0, the character of Seishiro Sakurazuka remarks: \\"I still love Tokyo... even as it is now. Where else on Earth do so many people enjoy their descent into destruction?\\" topics in X go unspoken and implied. The story places an emphasis on familial dignity and individualism. The Dragons of Heaven, Kamui excepted, were appointed from birth with the task of protecting mankind. They were raised individually with their destiny in mind and the obligation to their families prevents them from haphazardly changing sides. While it is possible for the Seals to sympathize with the Angels' ideals, ultimately, they must do what feels right for them. Their ability to summon the kekkai, and thus the status as a Dragon of Heaven, is bound to the will to fight for something or someone. X delves into the relationship between Man and the Earth. In an interview with Puff Magazine, Ohkawa talks of how mankind's concern for the preservation, restoration and improvement of the planet stems from a desire to perpetuate its own existence. She explains \\"people will save the Earth to save themselves, but who will risk themselves to save the Earth?\\" = Motifs = X plays out like a tragedy, where the characters are at the mercy of forces greater than themselves. The series shares some motifs with apocalyptic literature, like the disclosure of future events through dreams, and establishes a dual nature to its characters and concepts. Two Kamuis. The recurring dream sequence represents the protagonist's struggle with himself and his destiny. Ohkawa admits to being fascinated with the doctrine of dualism. Dualism is the interdependence between opposing elements, the generalization that two opposing-complementary forces are found in all things. She interprets it as \\"qualities that seem pleasant in one person but can make you hate the next. That's the dual nature we all have.\\" Inspired by the works of Go Nagai, Ohkawa sought to create heroes capable of wrongdoing, even evil. Kamui is the personification of this doctrine. carries a double connotation: \\"the one who represents the majesty of God\\", meaning the one who protects the world and carries out God's will; and \\"the one who hunts the majesty of God\\", meaning the one who kills those given God's power and destroys the world. Kamui's decision to save the world as he knows it is a defining moment as it gives rise to his twin star, Fuma. Fuma undergoes a personality change to the point he is no longer recognizable to his best friend. He takes the name of \\"Kamui\\", thus fulfilling the dual prophecy and bringing balance to the conflict. Fuma's \\"Kamui\\" persona is Kamui's other half;Nanase Ohkawa (Scriptwriter).

In xxxHolic, the characters' dreams comprise a whole world parallel to their own. Dreams in X depict the future, the destruction of mankind. Hinoto, dreamgazer for the Dragons of Heaven, is convinced it can be changed. Ohkawa explains it as lucid dreaming, where the individual can exert conscious control over the dream to the point it can perform impossible feats. Kakyo of the Dragons of Earth is a dreamgazer in a permanent coma who lives in the dreamscape, always dreaming of the future and knowing there is nothing he can do about it. Although he hopes for a better future, he cannot get involved and is convinced all is predetermined, including Kamui's return. Kamui's arrival in Tokyo unwillingly sets Armageddon in motion. Kotori's death and Fuma's turning were foretold, but subject to the young man's allegiance. Thinking of the people he loves, Kamui chooses to become a Dragon of Heaven to protect them, but ends up losing them for it. Other characters are also at the mercy of fate. Sorata Arisugawa is destined to die for a woman; but, unlike Kamui, the warrior monk embraces his preordained future and chooses Arashi Kishu of the Dragons of Heaven as the one he'll give his life for. Subaru Sumeragi expresses no interest in the future of the Earth, but still he and his counterpart are drawn to Tokyo on the Promised Day. Even with the fatalist atmosphere that persists in the series, Ohkawa is convinced individuals exert control over their destiny the same way they choose between right and wrong.  Media =Manga= X began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka on May 1992. Publishing the series proved troublesome on account of its subject matter, which depicted disasters reminiscent of real events in Japan such as earthquakes or murders committed by juveniles. Serialization stopped in March 2003, and in March 2005 Clamp stated they were searching for a proper magazine to conclude it. The chapters were collected in a total of eighteen tank≈çbon volumes, with the first one released on July 29, 1992, and the eighteenth on September 17, 2002. On September 26, 2006, Kadokawa Shoten published Clamp Newtype Platinum, a special Clamp edition of Newtype. The issue includes the \\"X 18.5\\" supplement, a re-print of five previously uncollected chapters. The series was expected to reach twenty-one volumes upon completion. The North American version of the manga, retitled X/1999 in its initial printing, was serialized in Viz Media's Animerica Extra and released under the Sh≈çjo imprint. In July 2001, Viz Media removed the series from Animerica Extra due to licensing issues, but it later returned in its issue published in March 2003. All eighteen volumes were released by Viz Media, ending in 2005. Beginning in 2011, Viz re-issued the series in North America as three-in-one volumes, unflipped, titled X. =Music video= On November 21, 1993, SME Records released , pronounced in English as \\"Double-X\\", a short film based on Clamp's manga, set to the music of rock band X Japan.

The supernatural thriller focuses on the roles Kamui, Kotori, and Fuma play in the Apocalypse, reducing the Dragons of Heaven and Earth to peripheral characters. Even though the abbreviated story fails to place the characters' action in the proper context, the film is praised for its dreamlike atmosphere, powerful imagery and visually engaging action sequences. The film was given a limited release in the United States in early 2000 and released to DVD on September 25, 2001. X: The Destiny War, a comic book based on the feature film, was released on September 30, 1996 (Kadokawa Shoten: ).

A total of twelve DVD volumes from the series, each containing two episodes, were released in Japan from February 25, 2001 to January 25, 2002 by Bandai Visual.

The game was not released outside Japan and it has two different endings. X: Card of Fate, a card battle video game for the WonderSwan Color, was released June 27, 2002. Reception In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson wrote \\"even without a proper ending, the series has a lot going for it. For one, it's absolutely gorgeous\\", adding \\"the Storytelling isn't Clamp's best, but it's hard not to get swept up in the momentum toward the day of destiny\\". The film is considered a technical masterpiece, but it lacks plot and character development. The television series is considered a better adaptation than the feature film. The 2001 incarnation makes use of its longer running time and episode format to explore the original mythos and works the characters' back-stories into the narrative through the use of flashbacks. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network finds that the series \\"tries hard to please everyone, and comes daringly close to succeeding.\\" Zac Bertschy comments that \\"the animation quality is consistently very high\\" and that the characters are \\"never off model\\" and \\"each episode is animated with an amazing flash of style and fluidity\\". Though the manga has some elements that neither the film, nor the TV series had adapted, each is treated more or less as its own interpretation of events, especially when it comes to how each adaptation ends.
