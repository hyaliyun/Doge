Glowing cover blurbs by Kenneth G. Masden II, Duncan G. Stroik, Michael Blowhard,Michael Blowhard and Dean A. Dykstra. Preface by Prince Charles, and Foreword by Kenneth G. Masden II. This book is a re-working of previously published articles used to teach a senior architecture studio class. Four of the twelve chapters were originally written in collaboration, and the co-authors include Michael Mehaffy, Terry Mikiten, Debora Tejada, and Hing-Sing Yu. Originality This book joins a recent movement to explain socio-cultural phenomena by means of scientific models. Writers who have spearheaded this general effort by writing popular science with serious implications include Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, and Edward Osborne Wilson. Ever since Benoit Mandelbrot mentioned that traditional architecture was more intrinsically fractal than 20th-Century buildings, people have been intrigued about the possibility of understanding architectural form in mathematical terms. The fractal nature of natural structures is evident in topography, and people have noticed that traditional architecture blends better with the landscape. Salingaros builds upon Christopher Alexander’s work, including Notes on the Synthesis of Form, A Pattern Language, and The Nature of Order. Salingaros has collaborated with Alexander for many years, and was one of the editors of \\"The Nature of Order\\". He proposes mathematical laws of scaling, argues for an essential role for fractals in architecture, and describes rules for coherence among subdivisions that can help produce a more pleasing design. These are, in effect, original aesthetic rules coming from science rather than from any traditional artistic sources. Yet, like Alexander, Salingaros argues that this design theory corresponds more closely to what human beings have evolved to appreciate. The book introduces many innovative science-based ways of approaching design, and opposes abstract or formal methods based on imageability.Inside Track newsletter Influence Prince Charles has written the Preface to this book, declaring Salingaros to be “an intriguing, perhaps historically important, new thinker”. Prince Charles’ detractors may be surprised to find that this book is not at all about Classical architecture. Like Prince Charles, Salingaros is a great admirer of Islamic architecture, and the design theory he presents is claimed to be equally valid for Classical, Islamic, or any other vernacular or traditional architecture.Architecture, Patterns, and Mathematics by Nikos Salingaros for the Nexus Network Journal vol.3 no.1 Winter 2001 Salingaros’ book presents a very different view of architecture and design from the teaching texts used for courses in architecture schools during the past several decades. He criticizes present-day architectural education for continuing to rely uncritically on models that he argues lead automatically to non-adaptivity and unsustainability. If one can get beyond the natural reaction to such criticisms, then designers will find much useful material for a new approach to architectural education. Anthropologists K. Sorvig and J. Quillien commented: “The spirit of Jacob Bronowski permeates the work of Nikos Salingaros. \\"A Theory of Architecture\\" takes us directly to the heart of difficult questions. Salingaros explores ways to clarify and formalize our understanding of aesthetic forms in the built environment, using mathematics, thermodynamics, Darwinism, complexity theory and cognitive sciences. He postulates that cross-cultural universals derived from scaling rules in nature govern human appreciation of architecture.” Notes de Lectures MCX Architect and educator Ashraf Salama observed: “This book is of great value to architectural educators. It helps them correct some of the misconceptions inherited in architectural education … Knowledge is usually presented to students in a retrospective way where abstract and symbolic generalizations used to describe research results do not convey the feel of the behavior of the phenomena they describe; the late Donald Schön emphasized this view in 1988 … Rather than giving students ready-made interpretations about the work of star architects, this book offers a deeper insight into the understanding of the true essence of architecture. This is a marvelous piece and I suggest it to architectural educators as an excellent textbook for theory courses introduced in both undergraduate and graduate programs of architecture worldwide.” Architecture-Urbanism: A Theory of Architecture: Nikos A. Salingaros (2006) Individual chapters have been translated into several different languages.,Chapter 1: “The Laws of Architecture from a Physicist’s Perspective” in SpanishChapter 9: “Geometrical Fundamentalism” in Italian Chapter 12: “Architectural Memes in a Universe of Information” in French Primary topics =Darwinian processes= Designs evolve in two ways: in the architect's mind towards a final conception, and by variants of a building typology being built on the ground. A Darwinian process plays a significant role in both design and in the evolution (or persistence) of architectural typologies. Salingaros creates a framework where these mechanisms determine how designs evolve, and outlines a detailed model. His key concern is understanding the criteria for selection among competing variants: is selection driven by adaptation to human needs, or is it based upon matching to arbitrary images? What type of architecture results from each? Salingaros utilizes the work of Richard Dawkins, especially the meme model, to explain how architectural typologies and design elements are transmitted in society. An innovative application, but one that underlies a trenchant criticism of modernist, post-modernist, and deconstructivist architectural styles. Salingaros claims they are not really adaptive: he argues that they transmit in society in the manner of an advertising jingle, and not because of intrinsic worthwhile qualities. Supporting arguments are explored in this book. =Complexity= Salingaros uses a model of organized complexity to estimate the degree of “life” in a building, a quantity that measures the organization of visual information. His model is based on an analogy with the physics of thermodynamic processes, and extends earlier work by Herbert A. Simon and Warren Weaver. The terminology arises from an analogy with biological forms. Salingaros distinguished between “organized” and “unorganized” complexity, going further to claim innate (biologically based) positive advantages of the former. At least for those who like traditional buildings, the correlation between Salingaros’ “life” measure and the perceived degree of life in a building is high. Minimalist and deconstructivist buildings, on the other hand, rate very low, and this is a point of controversy with most architects. Christopher Alexander reproduces Salingaros’ results in Book 1 of “The Nature of Order”, saying that: “It is telling that a simply constructed arithmetical function, based on the considerations of the nature of living structure, no matter how crudely, could get these kinds of results at all. It shows that, while the question itself may be a million times more subtle, there is something tangible, and ultimately measurable, in the degree of life the living structure has.” [Christopher Alexander, The Phenomenon of Life: The Nature of Order, Book 1 (Berkeley, California: Center for Environmental Structure, 2002), page 471] =Emergence and evidence-based design= Salingaros describes architecture (or at least architecture that he terms “adaptive”) as a characteristic phenomenon of Emergence. Contemporary architectural thinking has recently been moving in this direction, and this book advances the field forward. It is generally acknowledged nowadays that Architectural theory has degenerated into a narrow point of view, neglecting architectural space and meaning.(PDF) In proposing a broader discourse, contemporary theorists are turning once again to phenomenology. Christopher Alexander and Salingaros have moved past the limited philosophical tools of phenomenology to derive evidence-based results. Evidence-based design is already being used in the innovative design of healing environments such as hospitals and health-care facilities.Evidence- Based Design Research for Healthcare In parallel with intellectual advances in other fields driven by the revolution in scientific research at the end of the millennium, authors such as Salingaros, Alexander, and others seek to build theoretical knowledge in architecture from experimental findings. These arguments are now being adopted and supplemented by a group of architects applying biophilia, a term coined by Edward Osborne Wilson to describe an intrinsic, genetic predisposition of human beings towards structures found in other living objects such as animals and plants.Biophilia in Practice: Buildings that Connect People with Nature The key researchers in biophilic design refer to Salingaros’ work, and to chapters of this book in particular.,Environment and Planning B abstract =Pattern languages= Salingaros develops pattern languages originally introduced by Christopher Alexander and used in architecture as well as in software design. He earlier wrote an influential paper \\"The Structure of Pattern Languages\\", which described the combinatorics of patterns necessary to use them effectively. This applies both to software and to architectural and urban design. In \\"A Theory of Architecture\\", Salingaros shows how a Pattern Language and a Form Language combine into an Adaptive Design Method. The discussion, while fairly abstract, digs at the scientific foundations of design, having more in common with Evolvable hardware than with the more philosophical discussions found in contemporary Architectural theory. =The fractal mind= This book discusses how our mind perceives and conceives architectural form, and postulates that fractal and other organizational mechanisms play a key role in perception. It then argues that human beings naturally prefer fractal, organized structures, based on how the mind works.Recurrent fractal neural networks: a strategy for ...[Biosystems. 2002 Aug–Sep] – PubMed Result Most modern evolutionary biologists accept the idea that evolution is dependent on the geometry of the natural environment, and thus must be consistent with biological structure and morphology. However, the view that selection has shaped the mind to prefer certain shapes and configurations is more controversial. =Geometrical fundamentalism= The phrase \\"geometrical fundamentalism\\" in this book was coined by Michael Mehaffy and Salingaros as a provocative way of expressing the dominance of abstract, monolithic forms of Modern architecture. Being easy to build, those simple typologies are passed on globally and now dominate world architecture. “One of the strengths of the International Style was that the design solutions were indifferent to location, site, and climate”. Nevertheless, by not allowing architectural form the freedom to adapt to a particular set of local circumstances, the built environment has tended further and further away from Sustainability. =Meme encapsulation= The book also coins the term “encapsulation” to describe an architectural meme bundled inside a social meme. The model suggests that such memetic replication models human culture, in which building and urban typologies proliferate for reasons other than their utility. The contention is that typologies that are passed on are the ones whose encapsulation is more appealing. Salingaros and Terry Mikiten propose that encapsulation helps an architectural meme to survive and reproduce. In particular, phenomena such as (possibly impractical) architectural fashions, where clients enable certain memes that do not promote mental health and feelings of wellbeing to reproduce, can be explained as encapsulations helping their enclosed memes to replicate.“Darwinian Processes and Memes in Architecture: A Memetic Theory of Modernism”, by Nikos Salingaros and Terry Mikiten The converse is also true: an adaptive architectural typology, such as found in older vernacular architectures, is often avoided because it is encapsulated within a socially negative label (not “progressive” enough). When looked at from the point of view of meme encapsulation and selection, many architectural phenomena that were difficult to explain become easier to understand.

The first use of the term \\"Anglo-Japanese\\" occurs in 1851.Widar Halen. Christopher Dresser1990, p. 33 The style was partly the local version of a wider European cultural trend called Japonisme, but had distinct characteristics. The British interest in Eastern or Oriental design and culture is regarded as a characteristic of the Aesthetic Movement during the same period. History Garden at Tatton Park built in the Anglo-Japanese style The Museum of Ornamental Art, later the Victoria and Albert Museum, bought Japanese lacquer and porcelain in 1852, and again in 1854 with the purchase of 37 items from the exhibition at the Old Water-Colour Society, London. Japanese art was exhibited at London in 1851, Dublin in 1853; Edinburgh 1856 and 1857; Manchester in 1857, and Bristol in 1861. The 1862 International Exhibition in London had a Japanese display which has been considered 'one of the most influential events in the history of Japanese art in the West.'Widar Halen. Christopher Dresser. 1990, p. 34 The painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler introduced the Pre-Raphaelite painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti to Japanese art, thus establishing a veritable cult of Japan within this Bohemian circle. By the 1880s, the style had become a major influence on the art and decoration of the time, leaving its mark on Whistler's paintings and designs (principally The Peacock Room). The style developed in advance of the British Arts and Crafts Movement (the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was formed as late as 1887), but both are best regarded as branches from the mainstream Aesthetic Movement. The Japanese garden at Tatton Park is an example of Anglo-Japanese gardening style. Although elements of traditional Japanese garden design was incorporated, many English garden elements flowed into the overall appearance as well.https://www.tattonpark.org.uk/what_to_see_and_do/mansion/mansion_exhibitions/alan- de-tattons-japanese- garden.aspxhttps://www.tattonpark.org.uk/what_to_see_and_do/gardens/garden_areas/japanese_garden.aspxhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/step- into-a-rarity-an-anglo-japanese-garden-that-works-5gdvsq8wcwb =Interior design= Anglo-Japanese furniture designs by E.W. Godwin 1877 In the design of furniture, the most common and characteristic features are simple rectilinear structure, minimal decoration, often limited to incised and gilt lines or motifs such as 'mons', and most particularly an ebonized finish (or even ebony) echoing the well known 'japanned' finish. Halen (p. 69) proposes an ebonized chair exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition by A.F. Bornemann & Co of Bath, and described (and possibly designed) by Christopher Dresser as the quaint and unique Japanese character, to be the first documented piece of furniture in the Anglo-Japanese style. The types of furniture required in England such as wardrobes, sideboards and even dining- tables and easy-chairs did not have a Japanese precedent therefore Japanese principles and motifs had to be adapted to existing types in order to meet English requirements. In much the same way as with Anglo-Japanese furniture, early examples of Japanese influence and inspiration in ceramics were noted by Dresser in his reviews of the International Exhibition, London 1862, where he remarked on Minton's 'vases enriched with Chinese or Japanese ornament'.Halen. p. 119 In the early 1870s, the Watcombe pottery in Devon produced unglazed terracotta wares, some of which rely entirely on Japanese forms and the natural colour of the clay for their ornamental effect. Japanese inspired porcelains by the Worcester porcelain factory at a similar date were much admired by the Japanese themselves. Some pottery produced at the Linthorpe Pottery, founded in 1879, closely followed Japanese examples in simple forms and especially in rich ceramic glaze effects quite revolutionary in the English market. In commercial mass-produced tablewares, the style was most represented by transfer prints depicting Japanese botanical or animal motifs such as bamboos, and birds; scenes of Japan or Japanese objects such as fans. Often these were placed in a novel asymmetrical fashion in defiance of Western tradition. Glass ware was also influenced by Japanese art and the 'Frog decanter' exhibited by Thomas Webb at the International Exhibition in Paris 1867 is in its subject, simplicity and asymmetry the earliest example of Japanese influence on English glass identified to date. The style anticipated the minimalism of 20th-century Modernism. British designers working in this style include Christopher Dresser; Edward William Godwin; James Lamb; and perhaps Philip Webb; and the decorative arts wall painting of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. In the United States some of the glass and silverwork by Louis Comfort Tiffany, textiles and wallpaper by Candace Wheeler, and the furniture of Kimbel & Cabus, Daniel Pabst, Nimura & Sato, and the Herter Brothers (particularly that produced after 1870) shows influence of the Anglo- Japanese style. Oscar Wilde reported and commented upon the progress of the style, referring to \\"the influence which Eastern art is having on us in Europe, and the fascination of all Japanese work\\" in a lecture he gave in the United States in 1882 (The English Renaissance of Art).

Palazzo Spini Ferroni is a large Gothic palace located along Via de' Tornabuoni at the corner of Piazza Santa Trinita, in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It stands across from the church of Santa Trinita. History Detail of the fresco of the Resurrection of the Boy by Domenico Ghirlandaio, in the Sassetti Chapel of Santa Trinita. The palace was commissioned in 1289 by the rich cloth merchant and banker Geri Spini, on plots that he had bought after the 1288 flood of the Arno, from the monks of Santa Trinita. At the time, it was the largest privately owned palazzo in Florence, rivaling in size the contemporary Palazzo Vecchio, the seat of government of the Republic. The design of Palazzo Spini Feroni has been attributed to list of architects including Arnolfo di Cambio or Arnolfo's father, Lapo Tedesco. The edifice's original appearance can be seen in Ghirlandaio's frescoes in the Sassetti Chapel of the neighbouring church of Santa Trinita. Built during a turbulent medieval century in the city, noted for internecine conflict between families, the palace is a fortress-like stone block, with street level arches in a tall first story, with a protruding cornice surmounted by merlons. In the 14th century, the palazzo was divided between the two branches of the Spini; the section facing the piazza was sold in the 17th century. In the 1670s, Marquis Francesco Antonio Ferroni, a member of Grand Duke Cosimo III ruling circle, had it redecorated with stuccoes by Giovan Battista Foggini and Lorenzo Merlini. During this refurbishment, the frescoes (1609–1612) by Bernardino Poccetti depicting Paradise with a Choir of Musician Angels and Adoration of the Shepherds were moved from their original location. In 1846, after a spell as a hotel, the palace was purchased by the comune of Florence, and later used for state offices during the period (1865–1871) when Florence was capital of Italy. In 1874, it was partly renovated in neo-medieval style; shop-fronts were opened in the ground floor and a tower and an arch facing the river Arno were demolished, giving the palace the present appearance. In the 1930s, it was bought by the shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo. Since 1995 the Palazzo has housed a museum dedicated to Ferragamo. References Touring Club Italiano. Firenze e dintorni.

The phenomenon can involve the activity of political actors exploiting the issue of race to forward an agenda.  North America  = In Canada = Rosemary Brown has been described as one of the earliest politicians to attempt to challenge the divisive racial politics of Canada, during the 1975 NDP leadership election. In 2015, Jagmeet Singh campaigned against police carding, in what Maclean's described was \\"racial politics were at the crux\\" of the policy. Ahead of the 2019 Canadian federal election, while describing them as \\"conditional multiculturalists\\", an National Observer analysis stated that white Canadians didn't easily engage in racial politics. = In United States = One of the Racial politics in United States is to describe racially charged political actions by Abigail Thernstrom, the vice-chairman of the U.S. commission on civil rights. The practice has been a major part of American government since its creation, and often divides the Republican and Democratic parties. The United States Government has since the time of its creation been divided, and in many ways developed based upon issues of race. In 1861 the Civil War between the Northern and Southern states of the nation was fought partially over the abolition of slavery. Furthermore, the tension between the Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats continued for many years after as the South created Jim Crow laws and continued the segregation of individuals of color. The Northern Republicans realized that the South would not simply erase the strong racial divide that existed despite the abolition of slavery, and so in hopes of having a functioning Government allowed for such restrictions to exist. In 1896, the Supreme Court of the United States determined that the, \\"separate but equal\\", doctrine was constitutional in the case Plessy v. Ferguson. Segregation was legal, so long as the segregated schools and facilities provided to whites and blacks were equal. Plaintiff Homer Plessy, whose ancestry was 1/8 African American, was persuaded by civil rights activists in New Orleans to test a new law that required separate accommodations for blacks and whites on railroads. In 1954, the ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned in the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. The Supreme Court determined that the establishment of separate schools for whites and blacks was inherently unequal and unconstitutional. This was a major success for civil rights advocates, including the NAACP. In 1967, California Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Mulford Act as reaction to growing racial politics in the country. Supported by the NRA, the motivation of the Act has been described as racially motivated, in relation to the growing Black Panther movement. In 1997, the interim replacement of Yvonne Gonzalez with a white man as Dallas ISD superintendent, was met with public unrest due to the racial politics of the situation. Perhaps the most glaring aspect of racial politics today is the re-drawing and shaping of district lines to seclude minorities in certain areas. In doing this, Republicans and Democrats alike ensure certain trends in voting patterns and constituent concerns, as they place a high concentration of minorities within a voting district. This is a crucial aspect of modern-day politics and is often a major factor in elections. By 2019, racial politics was being increasingly identified as a reemergent phenomenon, with some media describing it at its most extreme in the history of the United States. In October 2019, on the death of Elijah Cummings, a CNN analysis discussed the congressman's understanding of racial politics in the US, praising his ability to \\"navigate a white world - how to get along with white Americans as a means of better holding the country to account\\".  Oceania  = In Australia = In 2014, Vox reported how \\"Australia's twisted racial politics created horrific detention camps for immigrants\\", such as Nauru Regional Processing Centre, describing the country's treatment of immigrants as a return to the racial insecurities of white Australians and the white supremacy of the 20th-century White Australia policy. Rita Panahi publicly dismissed Australian basketball player Ben Simmons' claim that he was refused entry to Crown Melbourne due to his race in August 2019. Panahi wrote that \\"He seems to be afflicted by this racial politics that everyone in the US has gone nuts with where they see everything with a filter of race\\". In October 2019, author Peter FitzSimons stated that his latest book on James Cook, was an attempt to improve the racial politics of the country, which he compared unfavorably with New Zealand's race relations.  Asia  = In Malaysia = Malaysian politician Chang Ko Youn said \\"Malaysia has practised racial politics for 51 years and we know it is divisive as each party only talks on behalf of the racial group it represents... When all races are in a single party, no one person will try to be the champion of the party.... It is easy to be a Malay hero, a Malaysian Chinese hero or a Malaysian Indian hero but it is difficult to be a Malaysian hero.... The country is facing economic problems now and it is important that the Government and political parties come up with a Malaysian agenda on how to unite the people and face these challenges...\\" On August 13, 2008, a letter was sent to The Star with the title \\"Why we can't get our experts to return\\" saying: Writer A. Asohan wrote: \\"...you started to grow up, and race increasingly became a factor. You became aware of race politics here. Insidious people would hint that being friends with the \\"Other\\" made you a traitor to your own race. The racist rot seems to have intensified over the subsequent generations. The bigotry we learned as adults are now being picked up by our primary schoolkids. Our leaders may, in a fit of progressiveness (by their standards), talk about racial tolerance, but acceptance and appreciation for other races and cultures seem beyond their ken. Racial intolerance in the country is getting worse, we tell ourselves, looking back to a more idyllic past. Bah, what crock! We Malaysians have always been racists. Heck, the entire human race has always found some illusive basis for discrimination. Race, religion, colour, creed, whether you were born north or south of that artificial line called a border – we spend an inordinate amount of our time and resources on delineating our differences rather than celebrating our similarities. If you married someone from a different race in the old days, you faced severe social censure and were treated as an outcast. Parents wrung their hands and tore at their hair, wailing \\"What did we do wrong? Aiyoh, how can you do this to us?\\" Marina Mahathir wrote: \\"...The same thing happened in our country. Unfortunately, race politics has not really died down yet, and some people reacted as if ethnic cleansing had just taken place....\\" Politician Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham when he was asked \\"What do you dislike most about Malaysians?\\", he replied: Racial politics. Chris Anthony wrote: \\"...After 50 years of living and working together side-by-side, the people have voted to do away with racial politics but unfortunately the politicians are far from showing signs of heeding their calls for multiracialism....\\" Philip Bowring of International Herald Tribune wrote that the political organization of Malaysia has long been largely on racial lines, Islam has at times become a device for use in racial politics, a yardstick for measuring the commitment of competing parties to Malay racial advancement. In 2019, the Malay Mail reported how the 2019 Tanjung Piai by-election would be an opportunity to move away from racial politics, by respecting the racial pluralism of Mohamed Farid Md Rafik, after his unexpected death. Cause According to many historians, the root cause of this strife between the ethnic communities and Malay nationalist sentiments like ketuanan Melayu was the lack of assimilation or amalgamation between the Malays and non-Malays. Because most of the migrants came as \\"guest workers\\" of the British, they felt little need to integrate into Malay society. (The Straits Chinese, most of whom were rich merchants instead of manual labourers, were an exception and managed to assimilate reasonably well, with many of them habitually speaking Malay at home, dressing in the Malay style, and preferring Malay cuisine.) Few bothered to even learn the Malay language; the census taken at independence showed that only 3% of Chinese aged ten and over, and 5% of Indians in the same age group, were literate in Malay. The comparable figure for the Malays stood at 46%.[41] The British educational policies, which segregated the different ethnicities—providing minimal public education for the Malays, and leaving the non-Malays to their own devices – did little to help matters. The Malays, who were predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the non-Malays, most of whom resided in towns. The economic impoverishment of the Malays, which set them apart from the better-off Chinese, also helped fan racial sentiments. This failure to assimilate or amalgamate has in turn been blamed on the British. George Maxwell, a high ranking colonial civil servant, credited the Malay aristocracy for its acceptance of non-Malay participation in public life, and attributed political discrimination to British colonial policy: \\"With thirty-five years service in Malaya, and with intimate friendship with Rulers over two generations, I can say that I never heard one of them say anything that would tend to support [the exclusion of non-Malays from administrative appointments]. From the very earliest days of British protection, the Rulers have welcomed the leaders of the Chinese communities as members of their State Councils. Other [non-Malays] are now members of the State Councils. The policy of keeping [non-Malays] out of the administration owes its inception to British officials, and not to the Rulers.\\" On the basis of these policies, historians have argued that \\"Given the hostility toward Chinese expressed by many colonial officials and the lack of physical and social integration, it is not surprising that most Malays formed the opinion that Chinese were only transients in Malaya with no real attachments to the country.\\" Another contributing factor to ketuanan Melayu, according to historians, was the Japanese occupation during World War II. One states that the war \\"awakened a keen political awareness among Malayan people by intensifying communalism and racial hatred.\\" This was widely attributed to the Japanese policies which \\"politicised the Malay peasantry\\" and intentionally fanned the flames of Malay nationalism. Racial tension was also increased by the Japanese practice of using Malay paramilitary units to fight Chinese resistance groups. Two Malay historians wrote that \\"The Japanese hostile acts against the Chinese and their apparently more favourable treatments of the Malays helped to make the Chinese community feel its separate identity more acutely ... it was also the beginning of racial tension between the Malays and Chinese.\\"[44] A foreign commentator agreed, stating that \\"During the occupation period ... Malay national sentiment had become a reality; it was strongly anti-Chinese, and its rallying cry [was] 'Malaya for the Malays'...\\" The rich In the year 2006, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on his release from 6 years of prison said in a number of interviews that the NEP should be abolished and that all races should be given equal opportunities and also that the NEP was bad because only the cronies of UMNO party became rich from it, however Khairy Jamaluddin from UMNO party hit out at him (Anwar Ibrahim) for saying that. Khairy said: \\"What cheek he has to speak\\" and also said that Anwar Ibrahim was the greatest UMNO party member of all and a very rich one too.

A new incarnation of KAJA was begun in 2005. Origin Several Korean-American reporters  pioneers among Asian-American journalists  founded the Korean American Journalists Association, or KAJA, in 1987. They held an inaugural gathering at Arirang restaurant in New York City. KAJA was born from the discussions at that meeting. KAJA's founding officers and their KAJA titles: K.W. Lee of The Sacramento Union, president; K. Connie Kang, legal affairs reporter of the San Francisco Examiner, vice president; Kapson Yim Lee, a veteran of Korean ethnic media, including the Korea Times newspaper, secretary/treasurer; and T.S. Suhr of Los Angeles, a journalist- turned-lawyer, who joined KAJA's board of directors and helped draw up its bylaws. The other charter members were: Chong Wha Pyen of The Ann Arbor News and Jae Hoon Ahn of The Washington Post. Over time, as the leadership entered their 60s and 70s, KAJA became dormant, until a younger generation took up the reins and rebooted KAJA. Rebirth In 2005, four Korean-American journalists, Jinah Kim of KNBC/NBC, Eleanor Hong of washingtonpost.com, HyunJu Chappell Hine of The Washington Post, and Carolyn Ayon Lee, a veteran wire- service writer and editor, sought to reactivate KAJA. They realized that KAJA's mission, to accurately portray Korean-Americans, Koreans and Korea in mainstream United States media, was still of vital importance, and that this role was not being filled by other similar organizations, such as the Asian American Journalists Association, with which KAJA maintains a little sister- big sister relationship. These journalists were sparked by the legacy of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The North Korea-South Korea dynamic was growing tense, amidst U.S. President George W. Bush’s categorization of North Korea as part of an \\"axis of evil.\\" With the help of Grace Jang of KoreAm Journal and Ariana Eunjung Cha of The Washington Post, this small group of Korean-American journalists organized a daylong conference on Oct. 29, 2005, in Los Angeles at the Korean Cultural Center. Its focus was North Korea media coverage and issues. Calvin Sims, a longtime foreign correspondent for The New York Times, delivered the keynote address to the audience of members of the Korean- American community and local journalists. Excerpts of Sims' documentary, Nuclear Nightmare: Understanding North Korea, were screened.

It was the first product of the Avia company, and it was originally designated BH-1 exp. The BH-1 was a low-wing braced monoplane of wooden construction, with tailskid undercarriage. Power was provided by a Daimler engine, which proved inadequate to fly the aircraft with both seats occupied. Soon after its first flight, it was exhibited at the inaugural International Aviation Exhibition in Prague. Its reception there was so enthusiastic that Czechoslovakian president Tomáš Masaryk awarded Avia a 100,000 CSK development grant. The BH-1 was subsequently rebuilt with a Gnome Omega rotary engine and was finally able to fly with two people aboard. It was known as the BH-1 bis in this configuration, and in 1921 won the Czechoslovakian national cross-country rally with an average speed of 125 km/h (78 mph) over the 860 km (536 mi) course. The aircraft was damaged in a crash the following spring and was never repaired, having been surpassed by improved designs.

The ten countries or trading ports are China, Korea, Siam, Malacca, Palembang, Java, Sumatra, Pattani, and Sunda Kelapa (Jakarta). There are 242 volumes in total, including four lists, and an extra four sections. It is believed that the documents were first formally compiled in 1697 from documents kept at the Naha Tempi Palace. Some documents were already lost at this time, and copies contained errors. It is not known whether the documents had been kept separately or bound prior to this. The compilation first became known to the public, and put on display, in 1932, when it was moved from the Tenson Shrine in Naha to the Okinawa Prefectural Library.

Summary  Galactic Trader was created in the early 1980s by Stephan Meier. Meier released five major versions, with the final release being 5.33 on February 6, 1992. Galactic Trader is a space-based commodities trading game which shares many ideas with the personal computer game Elite, such as the hostile Thargoid race, player ranks, and the names and descriptions of some ships and equipment. In the most commonly encountered version, 4.55, the player begins as a trader with 200,150 credits, enough to buy a basic trading vessel and a small amount of cargo.

Filipino revolutionaries laid siege to a fortified church manned by colonial Spanish troops in the town of Baler, Aurora, for 337 days, from 1 July 1898 until 2 June 1899. The war had ended with the Treaty of Paris in December 1898, with Spain's surrender and cession of the Philippines to the United States. Cut off from communications with their own government and military, the Spanish forces in Baler continued their defense against the Filipino forces until 1899.  Background  Baler is located on the eastern coast of Luzon, about from Manila. The Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule started in 1896. In September 1897, the Spanish garrisoned Baler with 50 Cazadores under Lieutenant José Mota, to prevent Emilio Aguinaldo from receiving smuggled arms. Mota's forces were attacked on the night of 4 October by Novicio's men, killing Mota and six other Spaniards, wounding several and capturing 30 Spanish Mauser rifles. The initial phase of the revolution ended with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1897. By 1898, with the resumption of the Philippine Revolution, Baler was still reachable only by ship or by traversing on foot through nearly impassable jungle trails across the Sierra Madre mountain range that were often washed out by torrential tropical rains. During this phase of the revolution, the Philippines was involved in the Spanish–American War, and the Filipino rebels allied themselves with the American forces. This alliance would end with the outbreak of the Philippine–American War in 1899. Baler was garrisoned by a 50-man detachment of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion Cazadores of the Philippines, under Captain Enrique de las Morenas, as the district political-military governor. On 1 June 1898, Las Morenas began work to dig a well, stock food supplies and ammunition, and to fortify the church compound of San Luís de Tolosa in Baler's town square against a possible attack. The church was the only stone building in the area.  Siege  The church amidst the siege On 26 June 1898, it was noticed that the town residents were leaving. On the night of 30 June, 800 Filipino troops under Teodorico Luna attacked, and the garrison fell back to the church. The town priest, Candido Gómez Carreño, also quartered himself in the church. The first few days of the siege saw several attempts by the Filipinos to get the Spanish to surrender by leaving letters, while they surrounded the church with trenches. On 8 July, the revolutionary commander, Cirilo Gómez Ortiz, offered a suspension of hostilities until nightfall, which was accepted. On 18 July, Calixto Villacorta took command of the Filipinos. He also sent a warning letter, which was rebuffed. The Spanish had to endure confinement in a small, hot, humid space. As the siege progressed, their food supply began to diminish through usage and spoilage. Enemy rifle fire did cause casualties but diseases such as beriberi, dysentery, and fevers did more damage. The first Spaniard to die was Gómez Carreño. In September, Lieutenant Alonso was killed; in November, Captain Las Morenas succumbed to beriberi and command fell to Lieutenant Saturnino Martín Cerezo. More than once the Spanish made forays to burn nearby houses to deprive the Filipinos of much needed cover. The Filipinos attempted to smoke them out by setting fires beside the church wall but were repulsed and had their timber captured. At the start of the siege, the Spanish had provisions of flour, rice, beans, chickpeas, bacon, canned Australian beef, sardines, wine, sugar, and coffee – but no salt. Supplementing their food supplies, the Spanish foraged for pumpkins, pumpkin leaves, oranges, plantain shoots, various herbs, and planted a garden of peppers, tomatoes and pumpkins. By mid-November, having failed to dislodge the Spanish defenders, Villacorta, under a flag of truce, left newspapers on the church steps that told of Spain's planned departure from the Philippines and that the Spanish–American conflict was over. Martín Cerezo considered this a ruse de guerre. Villacorta brought in Spanish civilians and ultimately a uniformed Spanish officer left behind to wrap up Spain's affairs on the island, to no avail. By 22 November, a total of 145 days had elapsed since the siege began, during which 14 Spanish soldiers died of disease. Of the 38 remaining troops, only 23 were effective, with the rest being sick. The Filipinos also had suffered casualties, mostly from Mauser rifle fire the Spanish were able to inflict on them from their protected firing positions. Gómez Ortiz was one of these. The new year brought more Spanish emissaries to Baler, but again Martín Cerezo turned them away. At the end of February, the Spanish killed three water buffaloes, eating the meat before it spoiled, and using the leather for footwear. In April, the Americans intervened when Commander Charles S. Sperry, commanding the , attempted to rescue the Spanish. By this time, the Philippines had been at war with the United States since February. Five Americans on a reconnaissance mission were killed. Lieutenant James Clarkson Gilmore and nine others were captured, and held prisoner by the Filipinos until rescued in December. When their food ran out on 24 April, the Spanish resorted to eating stray dogs, cats, reptiles, snails and crows. On 8 May, Filipino artillery shelling hit an improvised cell that held three Spaniards who had attempted to desert earlier in the siege. One of them, Alcaide Bayona, ran out and joined the Filipinos. This was a blow to the Spanish as the deserter had important intelligence to share about their dire straits, and helped fire the cannon on the church to good effect. On 28 May 1899, there was yet another attempt to get Martín Cerezo to surrender. Again, another Spanish officer, Lieutenant Colonel Cristóbal Aguilar y Castañeda, appeared under a flag of truce and was turned away. He had brought recent Spanish newspapers, which Cerezo initially dismissed as bogus, until Martín Cerezo read an article concerning a close friend's posting, plans of which only he knew, convincing him the newspapers were genuine and that indeed Spain had lost the war. On 2 June, Martín Cerezo surrendered to the Filipinos.  Aftermath  The survivors on their arrival in Barcelona General Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the First Philippine Republic, decreed that they were to be considered, \\"Not as prisoners of war but as friends.\\" He added: \\"... the valor, determination, and heroism with which that handful of men, cut off and without any hope of aid, defended their flag over the course of a year, realizing an epic so glorious and worthy of the legendary valor of El Cid and Pelayo.\\" Three months later, on 1 September, the survivors including Martín Cerezo, arrived in Barcelona where they were received and honored as heroes. Martín Cerezo later published a memoir, El Sitio de Baler, where he gave his reasons for holding out: \\"It would be somewhat difficult for me to explain, principally, I believe through mistrust and obstinacy. Then also on account of a certain kind of auto-suggestion that we ought not for any reason surrender because of national enthusiasm, without doubt influenced by the attractive illusion of glory and on account of the suffering and treasury of sacrifice and heroism and that by surrender, we would be putting an unworthy end to it all.\\" The two Franciscan priests, Félix Minaya and Juan López, plus the Yorktown seaman George Arthur Venville, were kept as prisoners by Novicio, until the priests were rescued by the Americans on 3 June 1900, having re- garrisoned Baler earlier that year. Venville however was led to his death by the hands of Ilongots, before the American arrival. Furthermore, Novicio was put on trial for ordering the Yorktown sailor Ora B. McDonald buried alive after the ambush. Found guilty, Novicio faced a life sentence of hard labor in Bilibid Prison. Las Morenas was posthumously promoted to major and awarded the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand, Spain's highest military medal. His widow received a pension of 5,000 pesetas. Martín Cerezo was promoted to major with an annual pension of 1,000 pesetas. He also was decorated with the Royal Cross of the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand, and went on to become a major general. He died in 1948. Lieutenant Zayas received a posthumous promotion. The enlisted men received the Cross of Military Merit, and each received a monthly pension of 60 pesetas. Of the 50 men who entered the church, around thirty survived the 11-month siege. Fourteen men died from disease. Only two men died from wounds. There were four deserters from the garrison. Two men were imprisoned for helping in the desertion of another (Alcaide), and executed on orders of Martín Cerezo on the day before their surrender. The feat of the Spanish so inspired the American General Frederick Funston that he had Martín Cerezo's memoir translated and gave copies to all his officers. It was published as Under the Red and Gold. The survivors were known as \\"the last ones of the Philippines\\". A century after their return, the modern-day Spanish government paid homage to them.  In media  The Siege of Baler is portrayed in the 1945 Spanish film Los últimos de Filipinas, the 2008 Filipino film Baler, and the 2016 Spanish film 1898, Our Last Men in the Philippines. The incident also appears in a two-part episode, \\"Tiempo de valientes\\", of the Spanish television series El Ministerio del Tiempo.

She attended the Universities of London, Bristol, and Adelaide. As of 2018, she is an Emeritus Professor of Epithelial Biology in the Department of Pathology at University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences.Academy of Medical Sciences: Fellows: Professor Margaret Stanley (accessed 6 January 2009) She is also an Honorary Fellow of the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and an Honorary Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge.Christ's College, University of Cambridge: Prof Margaret Anne Stanley (accessed 6 January 2009) Stanley is a research scientist in the field of virology with particular focus on the human papillomavirus (HPV). Her research work has led to new scientific findings on HPV. Additionally, she uses her expertise on HPV to serve on multiple different advisory committees and journal editorial boards. Research Stanley's main research interest is the pathogenesis of HPV and she currently leads a research group focusing on the prevention and treatment of human papillomavirus infection, which causes cervical cancer. Early in her research, she generated a non-tumorigenic human cervical keratinocyte cell line, W12, from a low-grade cervical lesion. W12 cells can harbor HPV-16 episomes, and thus allow researchers the ability to investigate the complex processes of cervical cancer development. Additionally, she helped to discover the temporal association between high- level chromosomal instability and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) integration, a key step in cervical carcinogenesis, such that integration precedes chromosomal abnormalities. She also studies the host cell responses to infection with the human papillomavirus in individuals who are immunodeficient, most commonly HIV-positive immunosuppressant individuals. Evidence from animal models show that a CD4(+) T cell-dominated Th1 response leads to regression of anogential warts, an effective cell-mediated immune response (CMI). She states that a failure to produce this effective CMI response to the human papillomavirus facilitates viral persistence and this can lead to the progression of high-grade disease and invasive cervical cancer.  Career  From 2000-2003, she was a member of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). Since then, she has served on multiple UK Research Council committees. From 2004-2010, she served on the Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee (SEAC). Stanley’s involvement in the SEAC was to provide independent scientific data to the UK government on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and advise the government’s public health, food safety, and animal health policies. In 2017, Stanley was recruited by the American Society of Clinical Oncology to be on a multidisciplinary expert panel that presented new evidence-based recommendations for the primary prevention of cervical cancer. The number of recommended dosages of the HPV vaccine varies based on resource availability, age, and sex. Stanley endorses the reduction of the recommended HPV vaccine dosage from 3 to 2 for children aged 14 and younger. Additionally, she states that there is preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of just one dosage of the HPV vaccine and further research needs to be conducted. Currently, Stanley serves as an expert on HPV for the HPV subcommittee of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation. She also serves on the editorial board for the following scientific journals: Sexually Transmitted Infections, Journal of Clinical Virology, and Reviews in Medical Virology. Stanley is also working as a consultant for companies that market HPV vaccines. Some of these companies include GSK, MSD, and Sanofi Pasteur MSD.  Advocacy  Stanley is a vocal advocate of HPV vaccination pre-puberty, specifically between the ages of 13 and early 20s. Stanley acknowledges that the recommended HPV vaccines have been shown to generate a high enough concentrations of antibodies to fight the virus.“The development of vaccines and immunotherapies against human papillomaviruses, the cause of cervix cancer” event Nov. 2012 (Accessed April 18, 2016)The Naked Scientist Interview May 2010 (Accessed April 18, 2016) Stanley also urges that both sexes be vaccinated because both are susceptible to HPV-related illnesses. She endorses both of the licensed HPV L1 VLP vaccines, the bivalent vaccine for HPV types 16 and 18 (Cervarix) and the quadrivalent vaccine for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (Gardasil). Stanley states that both licensed HPV vaccines are safe and highly immunogenic. Stanley is currently the Vice President of the International Papillomavirus Society (IPVS) and a member of the IPVS’s Executive, Policy, and Strategy and Planning Committees. Her main work with the IPVS is to encourage nations to endorse and utilize the readily available and effective HPV vaccinations in order to help prevent and treat the HIV infection in young people. Awards and honours In 2004, Stanley was awarded an OBE for services to virology.London Gazette (31 December 2003) Suppl. 1: S13 In 2010, she was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) for her contributions to cervical cancer and cervical precancers research. She also holds a lifetime award for achievement from the International Papillomavirus Society.

The construction date of the church remains unknown but documents detailing the church property suggest that it was built before the year 1447. Archaeologists believe that the church was constructed some time before the rise of the Ottoman Empire very likely in the 13th century.

The church has a cruciform architectural plan, with a rectangular base. The architect of the church is unknown but it is believed that he was influenced by the architecture of Armenian churches, particularly the roof. Reconstruction work was carried out on the church in the 14th century, shortly before the arrival of Ottoman Turks in Macedonia. A wooden iconostasis was constructed within the church and by the 20th century numerous saints along with the Virgin Mary have been portrayed on the apse.

The line operated from the late nineteenth century until closing to passengers in 1952 and goods in 1965. For a short line, it had a complex history, built in three separate sections and operated jointly by two rival railway companies. Its construction needed twelve years of blasting through solid rock and three extensions of Parliamentary time.  Inception  The need in the early 1820s to transport stone led to an older railway, the Merchant's Railway, being promoted. A public company authorised by Act of Parliament, the company existed for a long time after the closure of the railway. The railway initially consisted of a tramway, then an incline from Priory Corner to Castletown Pier. This was a distinct railway from the later Portland Branch, although an attempt by the Easton and Church Hope railway to take it over failed at the parliamentary stage. The line was at any event not standard gauge and the stock not compatible with main line standards.  Construction  PBR bridge over the Fleet A line from Weymouth to Portland was part of the original plan for the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway but not followed through. Then in 1861 two schemes were put forward, one down Weymouth Backwater and another including a harbour tramway. The harbour scheme was constructed. An Agreement of 1862 leased the line in perpetuity to the GWR and the LSWR who agreed to work it jointly. Construction of the Weymouth and Portland railway started at the end of 1862 and was completed by April 1864. A need for further work on the timber viaducts over the backwater and The Fleet held up the opening until September when another year was spent arguing about where the trains should go in Weymouth station. The line was mixed gauge when it opened on 16 October 1865. In 1866 another line, the Easton and Church Hope, was proposed on the other side of the Isle of Portland. Initially it was to link Portland's quarries to the sea. This line was started but powers expired in 1872 and the line lay dormant for eleven years. In the meantime an Admiralty railway was built from the end of the Weymouth and Portland line to a pier on the new Admiralty Breakwater, mainly to supply coal to ships. The Easton and Church Hope was revived with hopes of running powers over this line but although construction was authorised in 1884 none was undertaken until 1888. When it did the work involved blasting through three and a half miles of solid rock in a task taking twelve years. A new station was completed at Easton in 1900. A delay caused by the need to bring the Admiralty stretch up to passenger standard followed. The Admiralty terminated its agreement with the GWR and LSWR, allowing the Easton and Church Hope to carry out the work itself. The line opened to passenger traffic on 1 September 1902. This left the north coast of Portland served by three different railways in a very short distance.  Operation  A 1937 Ordnance Survey map of Portland showing the Portland Branch Railway Although worked as a continuous line the Weymouth and Portland and Easton and Church Hope companies nominally remained independent until nationalisation in 1948. In 1908 to 1909 as part of a GWR plan to fight road competition halts were opened on the line, at Westham and Wyke Regis, and Rodwell station was enlarged and a loop installed. In 1908 the wooden backwater bridge was replaced and some land reclaimed. A separate station, known as Melcombe Regis, was built at the northern end of the bridge to save the branch train from having to reverse to enter Weymouth Station. Sandsfoot Castle Halt opened in 1932.  The final years  The branch closed to passenger traffic in 1952, remaining open for goods traffic until 1965. Although it officially closed in 1952, Melcombe Regis Station was retained as an overflow of the main Weymouth station, notably on summer Saturdays, until 1959. The backwater bridge remained until it collapsed in a storm in November 1974, and was subsequently demolished.  The line today  Today, parts of the line can still be walked, but the course of the backwater railway viaduct has long since been replaced by Weymouth’s Swannery road bridge, which was built in virtually the same place. The former platforms at Westham and Rodwell are still to be seen and this section is a popular green trailway, the Rodwell Trail. The bridge over The Fleet at Smallmouth was demolished in 1972. The route now passes through a boatyard, then along the Portland causeway over open common land. Reaching the southwest corner of Portland Harbour, the route now lies under a landscaped earthen embankment, which marks the edge of Portland's National Sailing Academy. Here, there is little evidence of the old railway, until east of Castletown, within Portland Port, where it re-emerges to climb the steep hillside of East Weares. This section has become a fine walk and leads to the spectacular cliffside cutting above Church Ope Cove. This section made it one of the most scenic coastal branch lines in the south of England; it is now part of Dorset's World Heritage Jurassic Coast.

These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these subdivisions. The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in the official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses. The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings. Each neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them. Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood’s population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three-tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council. Baghdad Bank The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Governorate outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The final step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome but Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 74,000 people.

Previous roller hockey had been played using quad roller skates. In line skates were faster, changing the speed of the game. WRHL was one of the first events to give public exposure to the new development in an organized form. Former NHLers such as Ron Duguay and Pierre Larouche played in the league. The season lasted slightly less than two months in the early summer of 1993 as a made for television event. Games were taped during the short season and aired on ESPN. They were later aired in Canada on TSN. The intent was to capture the viewers enthusiasm for the sport of roller hockey, which at the time had 10 million participants and 28,000 amateur leagues. The games were faster because, as Jerry Greene the Orlando Sentinel observed \\"These guys can't stop.\\" Former NHL All Star Robert Picard, who played for the Titans observed \\"It really is a good game. It's a little slower than ice hockey, but the flow is better because you can't stand still.\\" Memorabilia from WRHL is housed in the Roller Hockey Hall of Fame.

Early life Princess Blücher was an Englishwoman, the daughter of Frederick Stapleton-Bretherton of a Catholic landed gentry family by Isabella, daughter of William Bernard Petre, 12th Baron Petre. They settled in Rainhill, Lancashire, living in what was then Rainhill Hall, now Loyola Hall. She was the great-granddaughter of Peter Bretherton, a coach proprietor, and a brother to the better known Bartholomew Bretherton, coach proprietor of Liverpool. On 19 August 1907, she married Gebhard Blücher von Wahlstatt, the fourth Fürst (Prince) Blücher (1865–1931), an Anglophile descended from the great Prussian General-Field-Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher (1742–1819), the first Prince, who had contributed notably to the allied victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.Princess Blücher (1921), p. 1. Her sister, Gertrude Stapleton-Bretherton, married Vice- Admiral Kenneth Dewar (1879–1964). World War I After leaving the Channel Islands, where the family had taken the lease of Herm, the smallest of the habitable islands, she spent the War years with the Prince in Germany, where he commanded a hospital train for the Silesian Order of Malta. Here she kept a diary, describing life in Berlin and at the family estate of Krieblowitz (now Krobielowice) in Silesia (now in Poland), from the point of view of an English exile among the deeply conservative Prussian nobility. This became the basis for her account of the war published as Princess Blucher, English Wife in Berlin: a private memoir of events, politics and daily life in Germany throughout the War and the social revolution of 1918 (Constable, 1920). The journal remains a well-known source of information on life in Germany during World War I. During the cold winter of 1916/1917 she noted the shortages of fuel and food in Berlin which caused public morale, especially of the poorest, to plummet. Also described are the last weeks of the German Empire, with the decline of the old order, the fall of the monarchy, and the appalling social conditions that led to Spartacist uprisings and the German Revolution as the country became a failed state:Princess Blücher (1921), p. 161. > There is intense cold here, such as has not been known for more than half a > century.

It has bare red orbital skin, yellow bill, red legs, white wings and its head is partially bare with a dense crest of green or gloss blue and white plumes on the nape. The Madagascan ibis is the only member of the genus Lophotibis. Taxonomy The Madagascan ibis was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected on the island of Madagascar. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Tantalus cristatus in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The Madagascan ibis is now the only species placed in the genus Lophotibis that was erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek lophos meaning \\"crest\\" and ibis; the specific epithet cristata is from the Latin crustatus meaning \\"crest\\". Description The Madagascan ibis, with a length of , is among the largest birds in the Madagascan forest. The head is black and the upper parts are rufous brown. The chin, neck and throat and underparts are dark brown and the wing largely white. Part of the face is naked and red, including round the eye, and the crown and back of the neck bear a crest of long feathers which are black with a metallic sheen. In the subspecies L. c. cristata, the sheen is green and there are flecks of white; in the subspecies L. c. urschi, the throat, neck and crest have a greenish sheen mixed with yellowish-orange, and the body colour is darker chestnut. The iris is brown, the very long beak is horn-coloured and the legs and feet are red. Distribution and habitat The Madagascan ibis is endemic to the woodlands and forests of Madagascar at altitudes of up to . It is found in both primary and secondary forest, including humid forest in the northeast of the island and dry forests in the west and south. Ecology Its diet consists mainly of insects, spiders, frogs, reptiles, snails and invertebrates. The female usually lays three eggs in a platform nest made from twigs and branches. Status The total population of this ibis is thought to be declining due to ongoing habitat loss, and overhunting in some areas, it being a favourite quarry. The bird is evaluated as being a near-threatened species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Plot Street-smart white detective Danny Bassett (Alex Rocco) teams with educated black detective Sgt. Jesse Williams (Hari Rhodes) to investigate a theft of $400,000 at a fund- raiser for Representative Aubrey Hale Clayton (Rudy Challenger).Van Gelder, Lawrence (October 9, 1998).

Unlike many films set in Detroit (such as Robocop and Bird on a Wire), Detroit 9000 was shot on location in downtown Detroit and close-in neighborhoods. A number of now demolished landmark buildings can be seen including the J.L. Hudson Company, and the Fort Street Terminal train station. Fort Street Station was already closed when filming was taking place and the approach tracks to the station were used for a chase scene. The now restored Book Cadillac Hotel was used in the reception scenes, including the hotel's famed crystal ballroom. Although the hotel closed in 1983 and sat dormant for over 20 years, it was restored and reopened by the Westin Hotel group in 2009. Although Detroit suffered from race rioting in July 1967, and the riots are referred to in the movie, the film avoided showing areas that still showed signs of heavy damage from the rioting. The final shootout takes place in historic Elmwood Cemetery. Sacred Heart Seminary stands in for the \\"Longview Sanitarium,\\" where Bassett goes to visit his institutionalized wife. The hospital is Detroit Memorial Hospital on St. Antoine St. (The building was torn down in 1987.) Detroit Police headquarters at 1300 Beaubien Street (Re-located to the new Detroit Public Safety Headquarters building with the Detroit Fire Department on 1301 Third Street in 2013) is also shown. A number of local Detroit celebrities appeared in the film, such as disc jockey Dick Purtan, who plays the police detective who converses with Alex Rocco's character just prior to his boarding a police helicopter. Then-Detroit Police Chief John Nichols played himself in the TV station scene, and Detroit radio personality Martha Jean \\"The Queen\\" Steinberg played the host. The Soul Train dancer Pat Davis also made a cameo in the film. The title is a reference to the Detroit Police radio code \\"9000,\\" which means \\"officer down.\\" Re-Release Championed by Quentin Tarantino, the film was given a limited re-release theatrically by his short-lived Rolling Thunder Pictures distribution company in October 1998.Box Office Mojo. http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=detroit9000.htm Detroit 9000 (Re- issue).

The New York Times Tarantino also included a line of dialogue from the film into the soundtrack for his own film Jackie Brown. Reception During the film's original theatrical run, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it two stars out of four and called it \\"a tough, cynical, big-city cop movie that occasionally tries to rise above its genre but doesn't quite make it. Maybe it would have worked better if it hadn't tried so hard.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded an identical two-star grade and wrote that Alex Rocco \\"turns in another excellent performance,\\" but the film needed \\"a strong rewrite of its script, a revision that would remove the tedious black-and- white insults that pepper its principal characters' speech.\\"Siskel, Gene (October 4, 1973). \\"The Slams\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 4. Variety stated, \\"Filming is generally good and the acting by the leads is better than adequate ... But editing and cutting is jerky and the one flashback, an important part of the denouement, is so abrupt that it takes several moments to realize that a dying girl didn't suddenly get up and start walking around in the street. And there such stilted bits of dialogue as, 'Those boys were real top pros,' laced through the picture.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Detroit 9000\\". Variety. August 22, 1973. 12. The Independent Film Journal wrote, \\"Give Detroit 9000 one point for originality. It's the first black and/or cops and robbers film in a while that hasn't revolved completely about drugs. They, in fact, are hardly mentioned here, but it doesn't matter much. The rest of the film is much the same. A lot of corruption, a lot of running around and a lot of blood, particularly in the final reels ...

Vol. 72, No. 10. p. 24-25. The re-release met with generally favorable reviews. The New York Times critic Lawrence Van Gelder claimed \\"In general release, Detroit 9000 illustrates the wisdom of the adage \\"better late than never,\\" and praised the film's complex racial politics, while the A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin opined that, while the film was flawed, it was also an \\"interesting, thoroughly watchable film, and considering its genre and origins, that's something of an achievement.\\" Reviewing the film's 2013 re- issue by Lionsgate Films as part of a Rolling Thunder Picture triple-pack (with The Mighty Peking Man and Switchblade Sisters), DVD Talk's Ian Jane called it a \\"top notch cops and robbers urban crime thriller\\" which is \\"Not content to just titillate the audience with the more exploitative elements inherent in the genre... [the] film addresses head on the issues of racial tension, marital infidelity, and the difficulties of trying to make ends meet while still playing the part of an honest cop.\\" The film currently holds a score of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews.

They were popular in the United States, Europe and Australia from around 1880 to 1920,Reublin, Parlor Songs, April 2001. though the earliest such songs date from minstrel shows as far back as 1848.Hubbard-Brown, Janet; Scott Joplin: Composer; Chelsea House; New York: 2006. p.22. The genre became extremely popular, with white men giving performances in blackface and making recordings. White women known as coon shouters also gained popularity. Rise and fall from popularity The song \\"Zip Coon\\", a variant of \\"Turkey in the Straw\\", first became popular in the 1830s, notably in performances by George Washington Dixon, who performed in blackface. The word \\"coon\\", a slur meaning \\"black person\\", was in use at that time. \\"Coon\\", Online Etymological Dictionary. Retrieved 28 April 2020 The first explicitly coon-themed song, published in 1880, may have been \\"The Dandy Coon's Parade\\" by J.P. Skelley.Dormon, 452. Other notable early coon songs included \\"The Coons Are on Parade\\", \\"New Coon in Town\\" (by J.S. Putnam, 1883), \\"Coon Salvation Army\\" (by Sam Lucas, 1884), \\"Coon Schottische\\" (by William Dressler, 1884). By the mid-1880s, coon songs were a national craze; over 600 such songs were published in the 1890s.Dormon, 453.Lemons, 106. The most successful songs sold millions of copies. To take advantage of the fad, composers \\"add[ed] words typical of coon songs to previously published songs and rags\\".Reublin & Maine. 180px The first hit recorded song by a black man was “The Whistling Coon” by George W. Johnson. After the turn of the century, coon songs began to receive criticism for their racist content.Abbott, 35. In 1905, Bob Cole, an African- American composer who had gained fame largely by writing coon songs, made somewhat unprecedented remarks about the genre. When asked in an interview about the name of his earlier comedy A Trip to Coontown, he replied, \\"That day has passed with the softly flowing tide of revelations.\\" In 1908 the Broadway company Cinemaphone, created by J. A, Whitman, released a short film \\"Coon Song\\" which had an audible track featuring singers such as Blanche Ring, Anna Held, Eva Tanguay and Stella Mayhew.Blacks in Films, Jim Pines, The First Holywood Musicals: Edwin M Bradley Following further criticism, the use of \\"coon\\" in song titles greatly decreased after 1910. On August 13, 1920, the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League created the Red, Black and Green flag as a response to the song \\"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon\\" by Heelan and Helf. That song along with \\"Coon, Coon, Coon\\" and \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me\\" were identified by H.L. Mencken as being the songs which firmly established the derogatory term \\"coon\\" in the American vocabulary. Originally in the 1830s, the term had been associated with the Whig Party. The Whigs used a raccoon as its emblem, but also had a more tolerant attitude towards blacks than the other political factions. The latter opinion is likely what transformed the term \\"coon\\" from mere political slang into a racial slur.Sotiroupoulos, 91. It is possible that the popularity of coon songs may be explained in part by their historical timing: coon songs arose precisely as the popular music business exploded in Tin Pan Alley. However, James Dormon, a former professor of history and American studies at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, has also suggested that coon songs can be seen as \\"a necessary sociopsychological mechanism for justifying segregation and subordination.\\"Dormon, 466. The songs portrayed Blacks as posing a threat to the American social order and implied that they had to be controlled. Composers Sheet music to 180pxSheet music to \\"Ma Honey Gal\\". Coon songs suggested that the most common living arrangement for blacks was a \\"honey\\" relationship (unmarried thumb At the height of their popularity, \\"just about every songwriter in the country\\" was writing coon songs \\"to fill the seemingly insatiable demand\\". Writers of coon songs included some of the most important Tin Pan Alley composers, including Gus Edwards, Fred Fisher (who wrote the 1905 \\"If the Man in the Moon Were a Coon\\", which sold three million copies),Lemons, 108. and Irving Berlin.Hamm, 145–146. Even one of John Philip Sousa's assistants, Arthur Pryor, composed coon songs. (This was meant to ensure a steady supply to Sousa's band, which performed the songs and popularized several coon song melodies.) Many coon songs were written by whites, but some were written by blacks. Important black composers of coon songs include Ernest Hogan (who wrote \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me\\", the most famous coon song);Dormon, 459.Lemons, 105. Sam Lucas (who wrote the most racist early coon songs by modern standards); minstrel and songwriter Sidney L. Perrin (who wrote \\"Black Annie,\\" \\"Dat's De Way to Spell Chicken,\\" \\"Mamma's Little Pumpkin Colored Coons,\\" \\"Gib Me Ma 15 Cents,\\" and \\"My Dinah\\"); Bob Cole (who wrote dozens of songs, including \\"I Wonder What the Coon's Game Is?\\" and \\"No Coons Allowed\\"); and Bert Williams and George Walker.Lemons, 107. Even classic ragtime composer Scott Joplin wrote at least one coon song (\\"I Am Thinking of My Pickaninny Days\\"), and may have composed the music for several more, using lyrics written by others.Blesh, Rudi and Harris, Janet; They All Played Ragtime; Alfred P. Knopf; New York: 1950.; p.37. Characteristics Coon songs almost always aimed to be funny and incorporated the syncopated rhythms of ragtime music. A coon song's defining characteristic, however, was its caricature of African Americans. In keeping with the older minstrel image of blacks, coon songs often featured \\"watermelon- and chicken-loving rural buffoon[s]\\".Dormon, 455. However, \\"blacks began to appear as not only ignorant and indolent, but also devoid of honesty or personal honor, given to drunkenness and gambling, utterly without ambition, sensuous, libidinous, even lascivious.\\" Blacks were portrayed as making money through gambling, theft, and hustling, rather than working to earn a living, as in the Nathan Bivins song \\"Gimme Ma Money\\": > Last night I did go to a big Crap game, How dem coons did gamble wuz a sin > and a shame... I'm gambling for my Sadie, Cause she's my lady, I'm a > hustling coon, ... dat's just what I am.Dormon, 456. Coon songs portrayed blacks as \\"hot\\", in this context meaning promiscuous and libidinous. They suggested that the most common living arrangement was a \\"honey\\" relationship (unmarried cohabitation), rather than marriage.Dormon, 458. Blacks were portrayed as inclined toward acts of provocative violence. Razors were often featured in the songs and came to symbolize blacks' wanton tendencies. However, violence in the songs was uniformly directed at blacks instead of whites (perhaps to discharge the threatening notion of black violence amongst the coon songs' predominantly white consumers). Hence, the spectre of black-on-white violence remained but an allusion.Dormon, 460. The street-patrolling \\"bully coon\\" was often used as a stock character in coon songs.Dormon, 460–461. The songs showed the social threats that whites believed were posed by blacks. Passing was a common theme,Dormon, 461. and blacks were portrayed as seeking the status of whites, through education and money.Dormon, 462. However, blacks rarely, except during dream sequences, actually succeeded at appearing white; they only aspired to do so.Dormon, 463. Use in theater Coon songs were popular in vaudeville theater, where they were delivered by \\"coon shouters\\", who were typically White women. Notable coon shouters included Artie Hall,Abbott, 17. Sophie Tucker, May Irwin, Mae West, Fanny Brice, Fay Templeton, Lotta Crabtree, Marie Dressler, Emma Carus, Nora Bayes, Clarice Vance, Elsie Janis, Trixie Friganza, Eva Tanguay and Julia Gerity. 180px As with minstrel shows earlier, a whole genre of skits and shows grew up around coon songs, and often coon songs were featured in legitimate theater productions. Effects on African-American music Coon songs contributed to the development and acceptance of authentic African-American music.Dormon, 467. Elements from coon songs were incorporated into turn-of- the-century African-American folk songs, as was revealed by Howard W. Odum's 1906–1908 ethnomusicology fieldwork.Abbott, 25–26. Similarly, coon songs' lyrics influenced the vocabulary of the blues, culminating with Bessie Smith's singing in the 1920s. Black songwriters and performers who participated in the creation of coon songs profited commercially, enabling them to go on to develop a new type of African American musical theater based at least in part on African-American traditions. Coon songs also contributed to the mainstream acceptance of ragtime music, paving the way for the acceptance of other African-American music.

Fire pots have been used since prehistoric times to transport fire from one place to another, for warmth while on the move, for cooking, in religious ceremonies and even as weapons of war. Early times Campfire Fire pots were vital to the development of civilization. Once humans had learned to contain, control and sustain fires, they had an invaluable tool for cooking food that would have otherwise not been edible. Fire pots were also useful for sharpening spears, hollowing out canoes, baking pottery, and many other tasks, such as staying warm. At first, humans relied on natural fires, caused by lightning strikes or other natural occurrences, to provide them with a flame to start their own fires. Since natural fires are not very common, humans learned how to make fires by igniting tinder from sparks caused by striking stones together, or by creating friction using a bow drill. Given the time-consuming nature of early firestarting, humans eventually began to use earthenware vessels, or fire pots, in which slow-burning fires could by kept alight indefinitely by using small quantities of fuel. Nomadic people could carry these small fires with them, using them to start larger fires for their evening camps. Archaeologists found that fire pots were being used 10,000, or more, years ago, according to finds during the 1936-37 dig in Fells Cave ,Tedesco, Laura Anne. \\"Fell's Cave (9000–8000 B.C.)\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 of which is located in the valley of the Rio Chico, not far from the Strait of Magellan. Semi-nomadic and sedentary people would have made or acquired more advanced types of fire pots, as opposed to the fully nomadic people who would have used more primitive types. Being more sedentary, people were able to more effectively work with clay, and would have kilns to bake the pottery in, instead of using the traditional fire-baking methods. Warmth Portable fire pots have long been used as a source of warmth. =Kangdi= A Kangdi Sleeping with Kangdi is a traditional earthen fire pot from Kashmir, used to warm the hands or feet. In Kashmir, in winter, people usually wear a \\"Phiran\\" or long woolen gown over their normal dress. To keep the inside of the Phiran warm, they sometimes use a Manann, a fire-pot made of clay. But with no insulation on its clay handles, the Manann is inconvenient. A Kangdi is an improved version of the Manann, a semi-spherical clay pot enclosed in willow rushes, with handles also made of willow rushes. The pot holds burning coals that stay warm throughout the day. Throughout Kashmir in winter, it is common to see people with one hand holding their Kangdi inside their Phiran, doing the daily chores with the other. Cooking Hot pot with grill surrounding it The fire pot was probably invented long after people discovered the value of cooking over fire. Once fire-proof containers became available, such as iron pots, it was natural to design fire pots that both heated and supported the cooking vessel. Over time, these developed into stoves, used both for cooking and heating. =Adogan= An earthenware fire-pot or indigenous stove found in West Africa ,Historical Archaeology in Nigeria by Kit W. Wesler, P. Allsworth- Jones: Africa World Press, 1998 notably in Ilora and Oyo, an Adogan has a flat bottom with a carinated wall and an out-turned rim with three decorated lugs to support the cooking pot. A U-shaped hole is cut in one side to allow air to enter, and through which fuel is inserted. =Chinese hot pot= Hot pot or huoguo (Simplified Chinese: 火锅) is a traditional Chinese social meal. The literal Chinese translation is fire pot, as huo means fire, while guo refers to pot. The Chinese hot pot consists of a simmering metal pot of stock at the center of the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, thinly sliced ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. This type of cuisine is also referred to as \\"steamboat\\". In Western cooking, the fondue is used in a similar way, although usually with different ingredients. Warfare Drawing of a carcass shell Small earthen pots filled with combustibles were used as early thermal weapons during the classical and medieval periods. Containers made at first from clay, later from cast iron, known as 'carcasses', were launched by a siege engine, filled with pitch, Greek fire or other incendiary mixtures. These fire pots could cause great damage to besieged cities with largely wooden construction. In the Siege of Petra (550–551), the Sasanians used fire pots containing sulfur and bitumen—an early form of chemical weapon. A description of how to make military fire pots is given in Lucar, 1588, cited by Martin 1994:207-217 Martin, Colin J. M. 1994 Incendiary Weapons From the Spanish Armada Wreck La Trinidad Valencera, 1588. The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 23(3):207-217. \\"Make great and small earthen pots which must be but half baked, and like unto the picture in the mergent . . . . Fill every of those pots half with grosse gunpowder pressed down hard, and with one of the five several mixtures next following in this Chapter, fill up the other half of those pottes: This done, cover the mouth of every pot with a piece of canvass bound hard about the mouth of the pot, and well imbued in melted brimstone. Also tie round about the middle of every pot a packthreed, and then hang upon the same packthreed round about the pot so many Gunmatches of a finger length as you will, & when you wil throe any of these pottes among enemies, light the same gun-matches that they may so soone as the pot is broken with his fall uppon the ground, fire the mixture of the potte. Or rather put fire to the mixture at the mouth of the pot, & by so doing make the same to burn before you doe throe the potte from you, because it is a better and more surer way than the other: I meane than to fire the said mixture after the pot is broken with burning gunmatches. Moreover this is to be noted, that the small pottes do serve for to be throne out of one ship into an other in fight upon the sea, and that the great pots are to be used in service upon the land for the defence of towns, fortes, walls, and gates, and to burn such things as the enemies shall throe into ditches for to fill up the same ditches, and also to destroy enemies in their trenches and campes\\" By the mid-17th century, fire pots had largely been replaced by shells filled with explosives, which may be seen as the direct descendants of military fire pots. Religion and the arts There is an element of mystery in fire, which at times has led to fire worship. Fire pots have been used in religious ceremonies for thousands of years .http://www.pyracantha.com/Z/atarsh.html THE SACRED FIRE - Essay on fire and Zoroastrianism It would be inappropriate, and probably impossible, to cover all religious uses of fire pots in this article, but a few examples are relevant. =Censers= A large censer in front of a Taipei temple A Censer is any type of vessel made for burning incense. They range from simple earthenware bowls to intricately carved silver or gold vessels, small table top objects a few centimetres tall to as many as several metres high. In many cultures, burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer. Before a Buddhist tantric ritual, an assisting monk may swing a censer or thurible as he passes to 'purify' the room. This is a container usually made of metal that hangs form three chains. Inside it, powdered incense that has been put on a smoldering bit of charcoal burns slowly, and the smoke escapes through pierced openings in the closed lid. One tradition says that during one of the Buddha's sermons a monk heedlessly swatted a mosquito. The Tathagatha is said to have ordered that, in the future, incense ought to be lit in order to keep the flies away, so that people could more easily concentrate on Dharma teachings, but also to prevent the needless taking of lives. Censers are used in the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic, Old Catholic and Eastern Orthodox sects of the Christian religion during important rituals such as benedictions, processions and important masses. =Early Jewish symbol of God= In Genesis 15, a chapter of the Bible , The Bible, King James Version God instructs Abraham to cut a heifer, a she goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon into halves. When it got dark, \\"a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between the pieces\\", and later God made a covenant with Abraham granting him and his heirs extensive lands between the River of Egypt (either the Nile or the Wadi el Arish in the Sinai) and the Euphrates. Texts from Mari in northern Mesopotamia from about the same period say that parties entering into a covenant would seal the agreement by cutting a donkey in half and then walking between the severed pieces. One interpretation of the ceremony described in Genesis 15 is that God made an unconditional covenant when God alone (symbolized by the fire pot, or the fire in it) passed between the two halves of the slaughtered animals. =Japanese Kodo ceremony= Kōdō Kodo: The Way of Incense with Other (Paperback) by David Pybus, Tuttle, 2001. () (香道 - Way of Fragrance) is the Japanese art of appreciating incense, and involves using incense within a structure of codified conduct. Participants sit near one another and take turns smelling incense from a censer as they pass it around the group. Participants comment on and make observations about the incense, and play games to guess the incense material. =Sakthi Karagam= Sakthi Karagam is a dance performed in Tamil Nadu with a fire pot on the head in the Mariamman or Durga temple rituals. Today it is danced with a pot decorated with flowers on the head and is known as 'Aatta Karagam' and symbolises joy and merriment. In earlier times, the clay pot, or Karagam, was considered the residence of the local deity during the festival ,Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society, 1700-1900, By Susan Bayly: pp35-36: Cambridge University Press, 2004 which played a crucial role in community bonding. It is not clear whether the pot ever contained fire, or was so named because it was carried over fire by fire walkers. Descendants of the Fire Pot A porcelain hibachi A typical propane barbecue grill in a backyard in California Although the fire pot and its ancestor the fire pit are still in use in their original forms, successive technical refinements have led to many modern descendants whose origin in the simple clay container might be hard to guess. Some have been driven by the need to adapt to new fuels, such as charcoal, oil, coal, coke, kerosene, propane, electricity and microwaves. Others have been made possible through discovery of new materials such as iron, bronze, ceramics and asbestos. Always the motive would have been to improve the design, to make a device for managing fire that was cheaper, more robust, more convenient, more capable of meeting new demands. Often improvements made for industrial purposes found their way into improved cooking devices, and vice versa. An incomplete list of fire pot descendants includes: * Brazier: A standing or hanging metal bowl or box containing the fire, with perforations for ventilation. A Hibachi is a type of brazier. * Stove: An enclosed space containing the fire, with dampers and regulators to adjust the draft and thus control the heat. A stove allows for cleaner, hotter and more efficient use of fuel than a fire pot or brazier. * Oven: An enclosed compartment of a stove, separate from the fire, used for heating, baking or drying. Ovens may have their origin in the practice of enclosing food in clay or leaves before placing it in the fire, still used in Kalua, the traditional cuisine of Hawaii. Ovens make it practical to cook slowly, heating the food throughout, and are the basis of many types of cuisine. Ovens enable pottery and today are used in many industrial processes. * Boiler: A closed vessel in which water is heated. The discovery that boilers could build up explosive pressure if too well sealed led to the invention of the steam engine, a pivotal technology in the Industrial Revolution. * Barbecue: A device for cooking on a grill over a box containing burning wood, charcoal or, more recently, propane or natural gas.

She was later found guilty as an under-aged terrorist and sent to a Gulag labor camp in the Komi-Zyryan ASSR, to the west of the Ural mountains in the north-east of the East European Plain. She was exiled from the Estonian SSR for eight years. At the labor camp in the Komi-Zyryan ASSR, she worked in a coal mine and later married fellow prisoner Ülo Jõgi, an Estonian who had been convicted as a Finnish spy (he had been a veteran of the Erna group, organized jointly by Finnish military and German Abwehr) and exiled from Estonia for life. Thus, she and her husband could not return to Estonia until 1970. They both moved back to Ülo Jõgi's parental home in Tallinn in 1971. Back in Estonia, she worked as a secretary at an architect's office, and was also a shooting sports instructor at a school in Keila. In February 1998, Jõgi and her friend Paavel were awarded the Estonian Order of the Cross of the Eagle for their fight against the Soviet regime (\\"Freedom fighter of military merit\\") by the Estonian President Lennart Meri. Aili Jõgi and Ageeda Paavel are the only women awarded the Order of the Cross of the Eagle. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Jõgi was politically active in the Estonian Pro Patria party. In that capacity, she took part in round table talks with opponents of the removal of the Bronze Soldier in 2007. References *Decorations of the Republic of Estonia.

The opera house resumed operations as \\"The Music Hall\\". It in 1885 it became \\"The Grand Opera House\\". On September 18, 1899, it became the \\"Victoria Opera House\\", and in 1903, it became the Victoria Theatre,Dalton, Curt \\"When Dayton Went to the Movies\\" Dayton: Curt Dalton, 1999: 75 two years after the death of Queen Victoria of England. Damage again befell The Victoria during the catastrophic Great Dayton Flood of 1913 which severely damaged the Dayton region along with the ground floor of the theater. The theater's interior was rebuilt and remodeled. But on January 16, 1918, fire struck again and gutted portions of the building. Reconstruction was delayed due to material shortages during World War I. Thus, after Armistice, The Victoria saw extensive interior remodeling and in 1919 re-opened as \\"The Victory Theatre\\" – a name commemorating the American war effort and its result. For decades, the theater thrived as a major national embarkation point for traveling theater and stock companies. This included performances by Al Jolson, The Marx Brothers, Helen Hayes, Fannie Brice, George M. Cohan, Lynn Fontayne, Gertrude Lawrence, Alfred Lunt, Harry Houdini, and many other names. A Victory Theatre Playbill Cover from 1919 In 1930, the Victory Theatre was outfitted for talking pictures, in its effort to continue as a full-service cinema house. By the late 1960s, Dayton's changing business patterns Downtown and the proliferation of freeways and suburban shopping malls threatened the Victory Theater's existence, and in 1975 it was slated for demolition, in favor of a proposed parking lot. A public outcry for the theater's preservation that year helped to earn the building its listing in the National Register of Historic Places and, thus, it escaped demolition. However, portions of the building were in poor or fading condition. All the while, it continued to be visited extensively by traveling theater companies. Choreographer Twyla Tharp used the Victory as a try-out venue for various productions before taking the material to the East Coast. A popular vintage film series drew patrons during the summertime and featured pipe organ house music and silent film accompaniment, thanks to the acquisition of an NCR- donated Estey pipe organ. The theatre had a network of access tunnels stretching out beneath the city's streets for several blocks. It was said that, during Vaudeville times, the tunnels allowed circus animals to be unloaded from railroad cars blocks away from the theatre, and held underground until showtime. As late as 1979, much of the tunnel network was accessible to employees, although some sections were blocked off by city steam pipes. The stage also bore remnants of its original gas footlights. Throughout the 1970s, the theater was operated as \\"The Victory Theater\\". It staged legitimate theatrical shows, rock concerts and movies. The theatre was also home to the nationally-known Dayton Ballet Company. A mainstay through the period was its screening of \\"Midnight Movies\\", offered by a local independent producer, on Friday and Saturday nights that drew a, largely, teen audience for films with counter-cultural themes. During revitalization efforts in the late 1970s, the stage manager, Gary Kuzkin, overhauled much of the stage's technical capabilities. Crews from the Stagehands Union (IATSE) local restored much of the theatre's ancient hemp-and-sandbag fly galley, replacing several hundred thousand feet of rope—along with miles of electrical wiring. In 1978, the theatre was greatly benefited by the donation of a cache of equipment and stage draperies from National Cash Register's (NCR) auditorium, which had been slated for demolition. NCR also donated its historic five-rank Estay pipe organ to the Victory, which was renovated and installed by aficionados. In 1986, Virginia Kettering donated $7 million to fund a downtown arts center, conditioning her donation on the requirement that the center include the Victory Theater and be located within the same one-block area. The 1989 rebuilding of the theater was extensive. It involved razing the interior commercial space within the forward, Main Street-facing section of the building as well as the stage house, while carefully preserving and restoring the 1866–71 facade and the 1919 auditorium. At the same time, the interior auditorium portion of the structure was completely renovated. All of the commercial space at street level was reclaimed for a grand, new lobby. The result was an extensively-new Victoria Theatre (as it was now so re-named) designed expressly for the performing arts. The auditorium retained its original appearance with completely restored plaster work, drapery, marble work, gilding, and fresco detailing. Additionally, the house received state- of-the-art upgrading to its wiring, lighting, and sound systems and now accommodated infrared sound transmitters for headphone use. The current theater accommodates 1,154, with 635 seats in the orchestra, and 519 in the balcony. The proscenium measures 37'7\\" wide by 29'0\\" high by 39'3\\" deep. A full-sized orchestra pit lies just below the stage lip. Ten dressing rooms, accommodating up to 18 people, are off-stage left, in the basement and at stage level. In 2003, the Benjamin and Marian Schuster Performing Arts Center, under the operation of The Victoria Theatre Association, opened as another venue to house the Associations larger Broadway productions as well as large acts. The Dayton Philharmonic, the Dayton Opera, and the Dayton Ballet also rent the building for their performances. These two venues along with the Metropolitan Arts Center, which is a renovated former department store building next to the Victoria Theatre, are able to hold a variety of performances of any size and is the heart of the performing arts district in Downtown Dayton. Victoria Theatre Association The Victoria Theatre Association (VTA) is the company which owns and operates the Benjamin & Marian Schuster Performing Arts Center, Victoria Theatre, the Arts Annex (opened in 2018), and the Metropolitan Arts Center (home of The Loft Theatre) for the benefit of the community and the arts organizations that use them. They also own and operate Citilites at the Schuster and The Arts Garage. All theatres are used for different series throughout the season. In addition to the Premier Health Broadway Series (featuring Broadway musicals and productions), Victoria Theatre Association also presents the Morris Furniture Family Series (for families with children ages 4–12), the Cool Films series (classic movies run in the Victoria Theatre during the summer months), Projects Unlimited Star Attractions (any one or two night shows), and the Frank M.

The club has four senior XIs playing Saturday sides that compete in the Cheshire County Cricket League of which the 1st XI is in the ECB Premier League.  History  The first game at Boughton Hall was played 20 May 1873. In the 1870s Boughton Hall was a large private house standing in spacious grounds. The owner of the time, Mr John Thompson, acquired a taste for cricket on his scholastic travels which took him to Rossall School and then Cambridge. Thompson, upon his return, converted part of the Hall's grounds into a cricket field to which he invited friends to play, under his captaincy, as Boughton Hall Cricket Club. Early games were against local teams such as Eaton Park Club, 22nd regiment and Arnold House. Liverpool and Warrington also visited and played host to the ‘Hall but generally came second place to a club which was quickly established as the envy of the area. Even in these early days fixtures were commonplace against the likes of Huyton. Oxton, New Brighton and Birkenhead Park. In the 1880s the club, now run by a committee and levying subscriptions, went from strength to strength and began to run a second XI. At this time there was a Chester and District League which accommodated teams such as Tattenhall, Bunbury, Chester City, Saltney, Buckley, St Oswald's and Flint. Boughton Hall, however, played teams further afield and in 1887 the inaugural fixture against Neston was played. Fixtures played in 1900 included: Bootle, Neston, Western, Wrexham, Winnington Park, Warrington, Llandudno, Northern, Knutsford, Birkenhead Park, Eaton Park and Rock Ferry. Fixtures ran from 28 April to 8 September. *1910 The first County game in Chester. Cheshire stumbled to an ignominious defeat to Northumberland in what was described as ‘unkind weather’. *1913 The club allowed Chester Nomads Football Club (founded in 1904) to make use of the fine facilities. The Nomads had previously had no permanent ground. hence the name! 1913 also saw the inception of the Boughton Hall Knockout. The first victors were \\"Land Valuation\\" who saw off the challenge of the \\"Prudential\\" to take the title which is still played for today. The War saw a major reduction in fixtures but club members were able to keep the ground in order so that in 1919, returning War Heroes could once more don the whites. Pre and post war. the brothers Jones - LN and WE - dominated the scorecards of Boughton Hall and indeed Cheshire. There are many references in the Centenary book to centuries, hat tricks and even 10 wicket hauls. Not to mention 9 fors, county centuries etc. etc. These outstanding cricketers went on to play until 1939 and 1943 respectively. *1925 Post war cricket prospered, particularly at Boughton Hall, which saw the return of County cricket as well as its inception in the Liverpool Competition. Major ground development and the general growth of the club had seen a transformation from 'a rich man's club' to (in 1925) 'Boughton Hall Cricket Club Limited'. During the 20s, which are described as the halcyon days, the philosophy of the 1st XI was to score as many runs as possible - quickly and then bowl the opposition out. Tactics repeated by captains in latter years no doubt! With the Joneses, names like Pratt, Churton, Hack and Stockton coming to the fore the team swept all before them. Indeed, a match v Sefton in 1928 saw a remarkable crowd of over 5000 watching the carnage. *1930s The Boughton Hall Knockout was THE competition to be in if you were a local cricketer and crowds of over 1000 appeared to support their team. The trophy (still in use) dates from the 19th century and is the (then defunct) Chester and District Competition trophy. The club's success was mirrored between the wars by the 'superb condition of the ground'. The man responsible was a certain 'Mac' MacGregor. His only mechanical aid was that of a horse! He also umpired, coached juniors and even turned our for the 'extra' XI on a Wednesday. Another character of the day was Alf Snape who was persuaded to umpire a match and found himself in that post for the next 33 years. He also took a leading role in fundraising and earned a reputation as an objective reporter of the club's deeds in the local press. The 1930s ended with the emergence of a new generation of Joneses. The local paper found that the collective noun for the clan should be a plague! Bill, Leslie, Brian and Bruce all appeared to occasionally make six joneses in the 1st XI. In September came the War and with it an era had ended as LN Jones played his last game. *1957 Shared the Liverpool Competition title with Neston. *1974 Won the Liverpool Echo Knockout Trophy, beating Southport and Birkdale. *1980 Won the Liverpool Echo Knockout Trophy, beating Southport and Birkdale. *1982 Won the Liverpool Echo Knockout Trophy, beating Birkenhead Park. *1985 Champions of the Liverpool Competition.

It is thought to be a second generation, Population II, or metal-poor, star ([Fe/H] = −2.95). The star was found in the sample of bright metal-poor halo stars from the Hamburg/ESO Survey by Anna Frebel and collaborators. The group's research was published in the May 10, 2007 issue of The Astrophysical Journal. Age The star's age, as measured by ESO's Very Large Telescope, is 13.2 billion years. This makes it among the oldest stars and nearly as old as the estimated age of the universe itself (13.8 billion years as measured by Planck). The measurement uncertainty in the age estimate is 0.7 to 2.7 billion years, depending upon the assumptions made to estimate the uncertainty, although the uncertainty in the relative age of this and other stars using the same method is smaller. HE 1523-0901 is the first star whose age was determined using the decay of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium in tandem with measurements of several neutron capture elements. It is believed to have formed directly from the remnants of the first-generation stars that reached the end of their longevity and exploded as supernovae early in the history of known matter.  Designation  The designation \\"HE 1523-0901\\" indicates that the star is part of the Hamburg/ESO Survey catalog. A list of astronomical catalogues can be used to find which catalog a star or other object is from based on its prefix. Most objects are listed in several catalogs and will often be known by several different designations. Observation HE 1523-0901 is approximately 0.8 Solar masses.

He improved the detection procedure for the cholera and other pest pathogens. He developed a regular methodology for monitoring the river and tap water, which was especially significant as this was a primary means for the spread of cholera. His pioneering research in city sanitation led the European Water Association to award a \\"Dunbar Medal\\" for outstanding scientific contributions to the waste water treatment and water protection.

Known for his rigorous integrity and his political impartiality , Abdallah Yafi is considered to be one of the most popular politicians in Lebanese 20th century history. His ethical behavior in public service is cited as an example in the official civic education high-school textbooks as well as in the graduation of law students. El-Yafi was at the forefront of the struggle to give women the right to vote, which he was able to achieve with his cabinet in power in 1952. Early life and education Abdallah El-Yafi was born in Beirut, Lebanon on 7 September 1901 into a Sunni Muslim family to parents Aref El-Yafi and Jamila Ostwani, a Damascene. Raised with two brothers, he first attended Sheikh Abbas School, a Muslim elementary school, then \\"Pères Jésuites\\" (Jesuit Fathers), a Roman Catholic school, and went on to earn his French Baccalaureate Degree. He pursued his advanced studies in law at the \\"Pères Jésuites\\" and earned a Juris Doctor. In 1923, Abdallah El-Yafi enrolled in a PhD program at La Sorbonne University in Paris, France from which he graduated in 1926. El-Yafi's political involvement lasted throughout his school years. He was President of the Arab Students Association, () and was militating in France against the French Mandate which was then in place in Lebanon. He was known for organizing political demonstrations and giving fiery speeches, which once led to his arrest by the French Authorities only to be released a couple of days later. Abdallah El-Yafi is the first Arab to receive a PhD from the Sorbonne University, where he wrote his thesis about women's rights in Islam. The thesis subject was \\"The Legal Status of Women in the Law of Islam\\" (). Drawing from Quranic decrees and Islamic principles, he made a case about how women are supposed to be allotted more rights in society. Abdallah El-Yafi was known to be a man of strong and correct principles , who believed that the empowerment of women was crucial for building a stronger society, equality providing a steadier base. These thoughts, when expressed in the 1920s, had quite an ‘avant-garde’ ring to conservative Muslim ears: they were not always welcome with wide open arms or minds. Later on in his political life, Abdallah El-Yafi's political opponents brandished his thesis as a weapon of defamation to tarnish his reputation. According to them, he was not a \\"righteous Muslim\\" but a French minion who had given in to the French authorities—the colonial mandate authority in Lebanon at the time—in blaspheming the Islamic religion in reward of a \\"Doctorat d’État\\". These were aimed at ruining the honest image that he so carefully cultivated throughout his life. Personal life On 1 August 1937, in Damascus, Abdallah El-Yafi married Hind El-Azm, a Damascene from one of the most prominent political families in Syria. Her uncle was Prime Minister of Syria himself. They have five children: *Ghada El-Yafi (born 1939), a physician hematologist, who ran for Lebanese Parliament in year 2000. She has one daughter: Hind Kaddoura fathered by Mohammad Kaddoura. *Nahila El- Yafi (born 1942) is a physician ophthalmologist. Children: Tarek, Hisham and Zeinab fathered by Hani Al Hassan. *Aref El-Yafi, (born 1944) the eldest son, is an entrepreneur. Spouse: Joumana El-Yafi (née Noueiri). Children: Abdallah El-Yafi, Ghaith El-Yafi, Sara El-Yafi and Firas El-Yafi. *Wassek El-Yafi (born 1946) is a physician cardiologist. Children: Jamil El-Yafi and Walid El-Yafi *Ghias El-Yafi (born 1949) is an entrepreneur. Spouse: Leila El-Yafi (Née El- Azm). Children: Khaled Yafi and Tarek Yafi. Political career In 1933, for the first time, Abdallah El-Yafi ran for parliamentary elections in Beirut. He waded through the process because a good friend of his, Khayreddin al-Ahdab, was aiming for the same position. As the tension rose, Abdallah El-Yafi decided to step down famously stating \\"I will not sacrifice my friend for a parliamentary position\\". Abdallah El-Yafi eventually went on to become Prime Minister of Lebanon twelve times. He was appointed Prime Minister in the government of every Lebanese President with the exception of Fouad Chehab because Abdallah El-Yafi was opposed to the idea of appointing a military general to the post of Presidency. In 1947, Abdallah El-Yafi was appointed, alongside future President of the Republic Camille Chamoun, to the Lebanese delegation to the UN that voted against the division of Palestine. In the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, Yafi pressured President Chamoun to officially sever ties with France and Grand Britain in alignment with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's demands. He resigned along with oil minister Saeb Salam on 16 November 1958 in protest against Chamoun's refusal to do so. Later during the 1958 Lebanon Crisis, Yafi joined ranks with Saeb Salam, Kamal Jumblatt, and Rashid Karami in support of Arab nationalist rebels fighting to dissolve Lebanon into Gamal Abdel Nasser's United Arab Republic. He was appointed again as Prime Minister by Charles Helou in 1966, but was forced to resign once again in the wake of the Intra Bank scandal. The last term he served as Prime Minister was in 1969. In 1974, President of Lebanon Suleiman Frangieh asked Abdallah El-Yafi to be the Prime Minister, he refused. He was the Minister of Finance four times: in 1954, 1966, 1968 and from 1968 to 1969. =Women's suffrage in Lebanon= The struggle to achieve equal rights for women was one of Abdallah El-Yafi's principal political goals. In fact, Abdallah El-Yafi was the main politician who lobbied for women's suffrage in Lebanon. Despite a growing voice of dissent among his political adversaries, El-Yafi was able to extend the ballot to women during one of his terms. In 1952, the cabinet of Abdallah El-Yafi voted for a new policy that allowed voting rights to women with an elementary education and a minimum voting age of 21. The law came in effect for the 1953 8th Parliamentary elections and is still in effect today. =Integrity= In the civic education classes in Lebanese schools, students are taught a lesson on honesty and honor through the story of Abdallah El-Yafi whose integrity was constantly cited as an example for all young people in Lebanon: Abdallah El-Yafi was a young lawyer in October 1938, when then Lebanese President Emile Edde asked him to form a new government. During his tenure, he closed his law cabinet because he wanted to separate public services from private services. But after just 8 months in office, he decided to resign over a governmental policy dispute. In the morning following his resignation, he woke up much earlier than usual and sat on the balcony meditating. His wife tried to console him for losing his premiership position. He famously replied: \\"I’m not worried about the premiership, but I’m worried about how to announce to you that I will have to cancel our telephone subscription for lack of money in my possession given the fact that my law firm has been closed for eight months and I am without clients.\\" He is famous for having once said to a man who asked him to join a prolific business project \\"I would never even dare give the chance to the smallest villager in the most remote town to even think that I made a benefit of one penny\\" . Another story relates how a relative of his wife wanted Abdallah El-Yafi to grant him a license to build a tunnel in Dahr El-Baydar, an area in Mount Lebanon promising him a worthy profit. Abdallah El-Yafi told his wife \\"You either throw him out of my house now, or I will throw him down the stairs myself\\". =Death= Abdallah El-Yafi was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at an old age. His sight got worse as he grew older, and therefore stopped reading, which let him degenerate further more into Alzheimer's. He died in Beirut, in his home, on 4 November 1986.

It is also commonly used in real-time 3D rendering (such as in video games) to add additional effects. Uses in video production Video post-processing is the process of changing the perceived quality of a video on playback (done after the decoding process). Image scaling routines such as linear interpolation, bilinear interpolation, or cubic interpolation can for example be performed when increasing the size of images; this involves either subsampling (reducing or shrinking an image) or zooming (enlarging an image). This helps reduce or hide image artifacts and flaws in the original film material. It is important to understand that post-processing always involves a trade-off between speed, smoothness and sharpness. *Image scaling and multivariate interpolation: Nearest-neighbor interpolation linear interpolation bilinear interpolation cubic interpolation bicubic interpolation Bézier surface Lanczos resampling trilinear interpolation  Tricubic interpolation * SPP (Statistical-Post-Processing) * Deblocking * Deringing * Sharpen / Unsharpen (often referred to as \\"soften\\") * Requantization * Luminance alterations * Blurring / Denoising * Deinterlacing weave deinterlace method bob deinterlace method linear deinterlace method yadif deinterlace method * Deflicking * 2:3 pull-down / ivtc (inverse telecine) for conversion from 24 frames/s and 23.976 frames/s to 30 frames/s and 29.97 frames/s * 3:2 pull-up (telecine conversion) for conversion from 30 frames/s and 29.97 frames/s to 24 frames/s and 23.976 frames/s Uses in 3D rendering Additionally, post- processing is commonly used in 3D rendering, especially for video games. Instead of rendering 3D objects directly to the display, the scene is first rendered to a buffer in the memory of the video card. Pixel shaders and optionally vertex shaders are then used to apply post-processing filters to the image buffer before displaying it to the screen. Some post-processing effects also require multiple-passes, gamma inputs, vertex manipulation, and depth buffer access. Post-processing allows effects to be used that require awareness of the entire image (since normally each 3D object is rendered in isolation). Such effects include: * Ambient occlusion (HBAO, Screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO, reflections), etc. * Anaglyph * Anti-aliasing (FXAA, AGAA,http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/AggregateI3D15/ SMAA, MLAA, and custom anti-aliasing methodsnot sample-size AA like MSAA and SSAA) * Bloom * Blur (depth of field, motion blur, smart) * Bloodlust effect (red vignetting with particles, etc.) * Bokeh * Bump mapping * Cel shading * Chromatic aberration * Color correction * Color grading * Contrast adjustment  Dynamic contrast * Crepuscular rays * Digital camera light compensation * Dithering (including subpixel) * Eye adaptation * Film grain * Filmic scene tone mapping * Fog/mist * Gamma correction * Global illumination * Glow * Grayscale * Haze (depth, heat) * High dynamic range rendering * Image distortion * Infrared * Lens flare (cubic lens distortion flare, pseudo lens flare) * Light scattering * Nightvision * Outlines * Particle effects * Pixel vibrance * Point light attenuation * Posterization and deposterization * Scanline * Screen borders * Screen rotation * Shading (ink, paint, sketch) * Shadow mapping * Sepia tone * Sharpen/unsharpen (texture unsharp mask, LumaSharpen, sharpen, sharpen complex 1/2, adaptive-sharpen) * Sobel operator * Split screen * Upscaling (i.e. xBR, Super xBR, SuperRes) * Texture filtering (point, linear, bilinear, trilinear, anisotropic, and custom algorithms) * Vignette See also * Post-production References External links * Videotranscoding Wiki -(documentation on server-side usage of MPlayer for transcoding) Category:Video processing ","title":"Video post-processing"},{"id":"11196588","text":"Tanner may be a surname of either English, German or Finnish origin.

It is located near Guadix in Andalusia, Spain, and its name is a portmanteau of Andalusia and Sol (Sun in Spanish). The Andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt as thermal energy storage to continue generating electricity, irrespective of whether the sun is shining or not.  Description  Andasol is the first parabolic trough power plant in Europe, and Andasol 1 went online in March 2009. Because of the high altitude (1,100 m) and the semi-arid climate, the site has exceptionally high annual direct insolation of 2,200 kWh/m2 per year. Each plant has a gross electricity output of 50 megawatts (MWe) and 49.9 MWe net, producing around 165 gigawatt-hours (GW·h) per year. The collectors installed have a combined surface area of 51 hectares (equal to 70 soccer fields); it occupies about 200 ha of land. Andasol has a thermal storage system which absorbs part of the heat produced in the solar field during the day. This heat is then stored in a molten salt mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate. This process almost doubles the number of operational hours at the solar thermal power plant per year. Each unit fully loaded storage system holds 1,010 MW·ht of heat, enough to run the turbine and produce electricity for about 7.5 hours at full-load, in case of overcast skies or after sunset. The heat reservoirs each consist of two tanks measuring 14 m in height and 36 m in diameter and containing molten salt. Andasol 1 is able to supply environmentally friendly solar electricity for up to 200,000 people. Andasol consists of 3 projects: Andasol-1(NREL) Andasol-1 (completed 2008), Andasol-2(NREL) Andasol-2 (completed 2009) and Andasol-3(NREL) Andasol-3 (completed 2011). Each project generates approximately 165 GW-h each per year (a total of 495 GW-h for all three combined). The total cost of building the three projects was estimated to €900 million.http://www.power-technology.com/projects/andasolsolarpower/  Rationale  Andasol 1 cost around €300 million (US$380 million) to build. Thermal energy storage costs roughly US$50 per kWh of capacity (150 lbs of salt per kWh at a storage temperature of 400 °C), according to Greg Glatzmaier of the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), totaling about 13% of Andasol's initial cost. The developers say Andasol's electricity will cost €0.271 per kilowatt-hour (kW·h) to produce. Under current government policy in Spain, solar-thermal electricity will receive a feed-in tariff of just under €0.27/kW·h for the next 25 years. Like every power plant with a thermal engine, cooling is needed for the working fluid. As Andasol is built in the warm middle of the south of Spain, every Andasol unit vaporizes 870.000 m³ water per year (according to the developer), or 5 l/kWh (1.3 USgal/kWh). Most power plants vaporize less water (typically less than 2.5 l/kWh), or close to none if they are cooled by river or sea water.Cooling power plantsConsumptive Water Use for U.S. Power Production Although water supply is generally a problem in Spain, Andasol has ample supply due to its location near the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Developers Andasol 1 & 2  Satellite images of the site. The developer of the Andasol 1 and Andasol 2 plants are Solar Millennium (25%) and ACS Cobra (75%). After planning, engineering and construction Solar Millennium sold their shares to ACS Group. In 2017, the two international funds, Antin Infrastructure Partners and Deutsche Asset Management's infrastructure investment business, and the Spanish construction company Cobra Sistemas y Redes, sold full ownership to Cubico Sustainable Investments Limited. In 2018, the ICSID – the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes – issued a ruling that required Spain to pay €112 million to Antin Infrastructure Partners, which had claimed €218 million over the cuts to renewable energies subsidies in 2010.

K. Alagiri, is an Indian politician from Tamil Nadu and was a Union Cabinet Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers from 13 June 2009 to 20 March 2013. He is the first son of the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi and his second wife Dayalu Ammal and the head of South Zone of Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (up to 2014). Early life Azhagiri is the second son of former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Karunanidhi and his second wife Dayalu Ammal. He is believed to have spent his early life under the tutelage of his father and after his marriage on 10 December 1972, settled in Madurai. His wife is Ganthi Azhagiri and they have three children, two daughters Kayalvizhi and Anjugaselvi, and a son, Dayanidhi Azhagiri. Azhagiri graduated from the Presidency College in Chennai with a BA degree. Role in Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam alt=MK Stalin, the younger brother of Alagiri Karunanidhi always appeared to prefer his younger son, M. K. Stalin, former mayor of Chennai and former Deputy Chief minister of Tamil Nadu, for succeeding him as the leader of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Azhagiri shifted his base to Madurai during 1989 and did not hold any post officially in the party. In spite of holding no posts, he was all in command in the Madurai region and senior leaders in the party were unhappy about the factionalism created within the party. The DMK general secretary, K Anbazhagan, in 2001, directed the party men to have any contact with Azhagiri. During the period of 2008, Azhagiri was instrumental in the party winning three by-elections, the notable of which was Thirumangalam, where the party won with a massive difference. Based on the victory, Azhagiri was appointed as the organizing secretary of the party for southern districts. Following the by-poll victories in the state, Azhagiri was given the ticket for Madurai Lok Sabha Constituency in 2009 general elections, which he won eventually and later went on to become a cabinet minister. There were widespread fights between the supporters of Azhagiri and Stalin frequently. The succession crisis came out to a peak when party members loyal to Azhagiri attacked the Madurai office of Dinakaran and set it to fire, in which three staff were killed. Dinakaran is a part of the Sun TV group owned by Kalanidhi Maran (son of Murasoli Maran), the grand-nephew of Karunanidhi. The newspaper published a higher prominence for Stalin over Azhagiri. He was removed from the DMK party as member and as Secretary, South Zone on 24 January 2014. =Elections contested= {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" - !width=50Year !width=100Constituency !width=70Result !width=70Vote percentage !width=150Opposition Candidate !width=70Opposition Party !width=70Opposition vote percentage - style=\\"background:#cfc;\\" bgcolor=98FB982009Madurai Won 54.48P. MohanCPM36.67 } Controversies Azhagiri's name is associated with various controversies including conspiring in the murder of the former DMK Minister, T. Kiruttinan on 20 May 2003, initiating a cash-for-vote in Tamil Nadu for the Thirumangalam by-elections, attacking the Madurai office of the newspaper Dinakaran,Vaasanthi 2008, p. 153 and the Dhaya Cyber Tech Park land grab case. He is seen as the party strong man in Southern districts of Madurai. There have been various clashes in the state between his supporters and the ones of his younger brother M.K.Stalin over the question of succession and leadership of the party. He is also accused to inducing his strongmen in the party, who otherwise have criminal cases against them. Azhagiri is alleged of instigating the attacks of popular Tamil newspaper Dinamalar in February 1997 when the daily published a criticism about him. His supporters like Nallamaruthu (brother of Essar Gopi) and Annadurai were convicted in Leelavathi murder, a high profile political murder case involving murder of Leelavathi, a member of CPI(M) party and elected councilor of Villapuram. =T. Kiruttinan case= Azhagiri was accused as the main conspirator in the murder of the former Highways Minister, Pasumpon T. Kiruttinan, on 20 May 2003. Kiruttinan was hacked to death by unidentified men while he was out for a morning walk near his residence in KK Nagar, Madurai. The next day Azhagiri was arrested on charges of conspiring the murder due to intra-party conflict, along with other accused, namely P.M. Mannan who later became the Deputy Mayor of Madurai city, Essar Gobi, Madurai Corporation councillor I. Mubaraq Manthiri and V. Sivakumar (also called \\"Karate\\" Siva). Azhagiri was held as the main accused and charged with criminal conspiracy, murder and abetment. The case was transferred to Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh after the DMK came to power in the state in 2006, based on an order by Supreme Court of India. He was acquitted by the Principal District and Sessions Court in May 2008. The Madurai Police planned to appeal against the order in the Supreme Court as of July 2013 after a gap of five years from the judgement of the lower court. A leave petition was filed in the Supreme Court by the state, challenging the order of the Chitoor Court in September 2013. The petition was quashed by the Supreme Court counsel, which ruled that the state of Tamil Nadu had no locus standi in the case as it was transferred to Andhra Pradesh and that only the government of Andhra Pradesh can appeal against the lower court judgement. =Thirumangalam by-election= According to secret cables revealed by WikiLeaks through The Hindu, he gave away 5,000 as a bribe to each voter through the morning newspaper in the January 2009 Assembly by-election at Thirumangalam and around 500 per voter in the 2009 Parliamentary elections. The by-election is believed to have started the cash-for-vote in Tamil Nadu. =Dinakaran attack case= In 2007 May, Dinakaran, the newspaper run by Kalanidhi Maran, the elder brother of Dayanidhi, ran into a controversy when it published the results of a series of opinion polls which showed M. K. Stalin, the second son of Karunandhi, having more approval (70%) than his elder brother M. K. Azhagiri (2%) as the political heir of Karunanidhi. It also showed others as 20%, possibly indicating Dayanidhi Maran and Kanimozhi. The Madurai office of Dinakaran was fire bombed by supporters of Azhagiri and three employees were killed The Sun TV office in Madurai was also attacked by the perpetrators.Phandis 2009, p. 145 A day after the incident, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi came to Chennai for felicitating Karunanidhi for 50 years in legislative assembly. Daynaidhi Maran, who usually accompanies Karunanidhi on every function, discarded the event as a mark of protest. On 13 May, the DMK administrative committee empowered Karunanidhi to remove Dayanidhi from the party. This subsequently led to his resignation from the central ministry. Karunanidhi family started Kalaignar TV to counter Sun TV of the Marans that started focusing on opposition leaders who were voceferous on Azhagiri and also covering the 2G Specturm Case on minister A Raja, the DMK minister replacing Dayanidhi in the Union IT ministry.Outlook, Volume XLVIII, No. 51, p. 15 There were several attempts of reconciliation by the Marans, with two public meeting, once during Stalin's birthday in March 2008 and other during May when Karunanidhi was discharged from a Chennai hospital having been treated for neck and back pain.Outlook Volume XLVIII, p. 18 But when the Marans went to greet Karunanidhi on his 85th birthday on 3 June 2008, they were made to wait for an hour before finally denying entry. The family later reconciled with the efforts of Selvi, the eldest daughter of Karunanidhi. While the reason for reconciliation is not known, it was rumoured that the family reconciled to keep the third wife, Rajathi and her daughter Kanimozhi away from the family – that Kanimozhi was missing in the family reunion picture supported this argument. The management of Dinakaran accused the police of ignoring their formal complaint, which specifically sought action against Azhagiri, and instead choose to act on a suo motu complaint which did not include his name even in the First Information Report. =Land grab case= In 2011, a series of land grab cases were filed against Azhagiri's close associates and several of them have been arrested. It was alleged that Kanthi Azhagiri, the wife of Azhagiri bought lands worth 20 crores for 85 lakh from a lottery seller named Santiago Martin, who had 50 criminal cases against him. The deal took place soon Azhagiri became a central minister. According to the allegation, the family owned Dhaya Cyber Tech Park was built in a land out of the belonging to a temple in Uthangudi near Madurai. Azhagiri family refuted the claims stating that it is a vendetta politics by the opposing ADMK, which ruled the state when the charges were leveled. The family were cleared off the charges by rural police in September 2011 that ran the investigation. Subsequently, the Corporation of Madurai recovered 8 cents (0.08 acre) of land from Dhaya Cyber Tech Park on 26 February 2013, that were encroached. The concrete wall, trees and lawn in the encroached land were demolished by the Corporation officials amidst tight security. Tenure as chemical minister Azhagiri was appointed as the cabinet minister of Chemical and Industries in the Union Cabinet, following UPA victory in the 2009 Indian Parliamentary Elections. He won his elections from the Madurai parliamentary constituency securing 430,688 votes against his next competitor P. Mohan from CPM, who secured 290,157 votes. During his early tenure, he requested the speaker of Lok Sabha to allow him to answer in Tamil, while senior Lok Sabha officials wanted him to answer in English or Hindi following precedents. Jena, the State minister of the ministry, answered all the questions raised in the parliament on behalf of Azhagiri. There were protests by the opposition party members in the Lok sabha during the Budget session in 2010 over the absence of Azhagiri. In January 2013, the Union minister of state for the Chemical and Industry ministry, Srikanth Kumar Jena, accused Azhagiri of inaction as a senior minister, in the alleged misuse of government subsidies by the fertiliser companies. He accused Azhagiri of not responding to any of his five letters he wrote to his senior colleague between March and August 2012. In his letters, he complained that the fertiliser companies, in spite of utilizing one third of the subsidies provided to the farmers, kept raising the prices of the fertilisers. Following the irregularities quoted by Jena, there were allegations by certain section of media of a possible scam to an extent of 1,000 crores in the fertiliser ministry. There were also allegations of nexus between the corrupt official in the ministry with the fertiliser companies, who together dictated the government policy on fertilizers. DMK pulled out of the ruling UPA on 20 March 2013 following widespread protests in Tamil Nadu against the central government for not taking up the concerns of Tamils in Sri Lanka in the UN resolution against the alleged human rights violation against Tamils by Sri Lankan government. Azhagiri resigned from his ministry along with other ministers from DMK. There was a brief controversy when Azhagiri did not accompany the contingency led by T.R. Baalu, the head of MPs from the DMK party, to tender resignation in the Prime minister's office and to hand over the letter of withdrawal to the President on 20 March 2013. It was claimed as a mark of protest against his father Karunanidhi's decision to pull out from the central ministry. Some sources claim he delayed his resignation as he was not kept in the loop while taking the decision. Following his resignation, Srikanth Jena was appointed the minister of Chemical and Fertilizers.

Miller was born in York, Pennsylvania. A carpenter by trade, he kept several journals throughout his life which he filled with simple watercolors, richly embedded with text and captions chronicling life in the early and mid-19th century. His work is most notable for its depiction of life of ordinary people in rural Pennsylvania Dutch country. It is of special interest to historians for its depictions of everyday life and insight into local culture and customs. He spent most of his life in and near York, but also traveled to Europe (including Württemberg and the upper Rhine near where his parents had been born) and later in life frequently visited Christiansburg, Virginia, drawing and capturing scenes and events for posterity. He drew a series of watercolors depicting scenes in York during the American Civil War, including several related to the Gettysburg Campaign and the Battle of Hanover. Miller's works today can be found in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia; the York County History Center in York, Pennsylvania; Montgomery Museum in Christiansburg, Virginia; and at the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Virginia.

Early to middle years After not quite finishing high school (he later took a number of university credit courses, but is essentially an autodidact), Woods worked for two years in Manhattan as a first-generation computer programmer, until in 1960 (\\"Didn't want to get my fingernails dirty as an Army draftee,\\" but also to finally see Europe) he joined the U.S. Air Force for a four-year stint, three years of which were spent in Germany. Honorably discharged following a tour in Wyoming (\\"It was four years of guerrilla warfare, me against them, ending in a draw\\"), he returned to Germany, where he married twice, fathered two daughters, and successfully sold encyclopedias to US military personnel for five years, the entire time continuing to write poems, essays and short stories (a calling he first discovered at age 15). In late 1968, Woods made his first journey to the East, remaining there until early 1973. During that time he was variously a restaurant manager in Hong Kong, a 'kept man' in Singapore (by a Chinese drag- queen prostitute), a features writer for the Bangkok Post (Tennessee Williams, with whom Woods hung out and traveled, through Malaysia to Singapore and back, was but one of many celebrated personalities he encountered at that time), a stringer for both The New York Times and ABC Radio News, a disc jockey (Radio Thailand English-language service), owner of a gay bar (in Pattaya, Thailand) and the managing director of Dateline Asia (a Bangkok-based features service he launched with three other journalists). In Bali, where he stayed for six months, he was known as \\"Durian Ed\\" and \\"Mushroom Ed\\" (having developed a unique method of liquefying psilocybin mushrooms and rendering them toxin- free). He was additionally in Laos, Okinawa, the Philippines, Macao, Java and Japan. Before returning to Europe, he explored much of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and spent several months as a lay devotee at the Theravada Buddhist Island Hermitage. In June 1973, in London, he met Jane Harvey, with whom he would years later start Ins & Outs magazine. Shortly thereafter, in the midst of doing a variety of odd jobs for Gentle Ghost, an alternative work agency, Woods authored nearly 30 articles for Edward de Bono's Eureka! An Illustrated History of Inventions from the Wheel to the Computer. He and Harvey then traveled overland to Asia, cycled across large stretches of India, were journalists for the Tehran Journal (Woods as sports and night editor, Harvey as business and local news editor), and crisscrossed much of the sub-continent and beyond. In 1976, Woods visited the United States for the first time in 12 years, where he wrote articles for the Berkeley Barb, published stories and poems in The Bystander, Odalisque, etc., and then hitchhiked across the South and up to New York. A two-year stretch back in London was exceptionally prolific: numerous poems and short stories, publication in Libertine, Iron magazine and other literary periodicals, as well as a series of personality profiles and features pieces for the International Times, an underground newspaper whose Amsterdam editor he would become during the early 1980s. Ins & Outs years After editing three issues of Ins & Outs magazine in 1978 (contributors included Allen Ginsberg, with the first-ever publication of his Plutonian Ode, William Levy, Ira Cohen, Rachel Pollack, Simon Vinkenoog, Hans Plomp, Mel Clay, Heathcote Williams, Marc Morrel and Woods himself; while among the magazine's international readership, beginning with issue #1, was Henry Miller), Woods and Harvey left the Netherlands, passed through Paris and ended up in Barcelona. Ties to the Dutch capital were already too strong, however. In 1979, the couple (who by then were married, but separated in late 1981, while remaining the closest of friends and professional colleagues) rented an attic flat in the heart of Amsterdam's red-light district and immediately got involved in publishing projects.

Burroughs, Patti Smith, et al.) and a scathing critique of organized literary events, penned by Woods under the pseudonym Woodstock Jones and published and internationally distributed by Ins & Outs Press, caused a minor storm not only in Amsterdam but all the way to San Francisco. The Newsletter and its years-long aftermath are covered in Woods' Soyo Benn: A Profile and A Brief History of Ins & Outs Press.Woods, Eddie (undated). \\"Amsterdam: A Brief History of Ins & Outs Press\\". Exquisite Corpse: A Journal of Book and Ideas. Retrieved March 30, 2012. Early in 1980, Woods, Harvey and the Dutch bookseller Henk van der Does formed the Ins & Outs Press Foundation (known as a stichting in the Netherlands) and also opened the Ins & Outs Bookstore (with the latter continuing for two years; after which Van der Does started his own bookshop and Woods turned the ground floor of the six-story Ins & Outs building into a gallery-cum-performance space). Ins & Outs magazine #4/5 was published in the summer of that year. Within its pages were Paul Bowles, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Bert Schierbeek, Gerard Malanga, Bob Kaufman, Charles Henri Ford, Gregory Corso, Roberto Valenza, John Wilcock, Steve Abbott, the photographers Diana Blok and Marlo Broekmans, Neeli Cherkovski and many others. Further publications followed throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, including: * Natural Jewboy by William Levy * Sale or Return by Woods * a postcard series that included Ira Cohen's Bandaged Poets * audio cassettes of live readings at Ins & Outs Press by Jack Micheline and Harold Norse * limited-edition silkscreen prints by Kirke Wilson of Burroughs, Ginsberg, Herbert Huncke, Snuffie the Gangster Woof of Amsterdam, Xaviera Hollander and the \\"night mayor of Rotterdam\\" Jules Deelder After that the press went into \\"suspended animation\\" for more than a decade. Woods, who had secluded himself from 1987, reemerged in 1992 with a string of performances as \\"The Gangster Poet\\", including at the North Sea Jazz Festival, Zuiderstrand Festival, Crossing Border Festival, appearances with the Kali Quartet, et al. From 1995 through most of 1998, Woods organized monthly poetry-reading evenings at a small, working-class Amsterdam café that quickly became the literary talk of the town, written up in national newspapers and even featured on Dutch television. In the autumn of 1998, Woods relocated to Devonshire, England to live with Jenny Brookes, whom he had first met in India in 1975 but had not seen (prior to visiting her in May 1998) for 18 years. The relationship lasted for six years. Upon its collapse, Woods returned to Amsterdam and Ins & Outs Press resumed its publishing activities. Woods' spoken-word CD Dangerous Precipice was released in 2004 and his book Tsunami of Love: A Poems Cycle (two long narrative poems and four shorter ones, chronicling \\"the rise and fall of an incredible love affair\\") in 2005. The CD Tsunami of Love (Woods reciting the entire collection, with a special introduction added) appeared in August 2007. In January 2012, Tsunami of Love was again published, this time in an Amazon Kindle edition, by Barncott Press (London). Since 2005, Woods has made several on-stage appearances at the annual Whitsun weekend Fiery Tongues literary festival, held in the artists colony village of Ruigoord, near Amsterdam. In May 2015 he was presented with the Ruigoord Trophy, making him only the third non-Dutch person to be so honored. In July 2009, Woods attended a major Burroughs symposium in Paris, NakedLunch@50, where he delivered his homage to Burroughs entitled \\"Thank God You're Not Eddie Woods!\\" and also participated in a special tribute to the old Beat Hotel at 9 Rue Gît-le-Coeur, together with Jean-Jacques Lebel, the poet Nina Zivancevic, Scottish artist Elliot Rudie, and others. In December 2011, Sloow Tapes (Stekene, Belgium) released the Eddie Woods spoken-word audio cassette The Faerie Princess & Other Poems. And in September 2013, Inkblot Publications (Providence, Rhode Island) published Tennessee Williams in Bangkok, Eddie Woods' memoir of his time (early 1970s) in Thailand and Singapore. A Kindle edition of the same book was published by Barncott Press (London) in August 2014. This was followed in December 2014 by a Dutch-language edition entitled Bangkok Confidential, published by SpeakEasy (Amsterdam, Netherlands). In February 2014, Barncott Press (London) published Woods' collection of short fiction entitled Smugglers Train & Other Stories. Also in February 2014, a Yarre Stooker film based on the Eddie Woods poem \\"Mary\\" and starring Win Harms in the title role was released online. The film is entitled Mary In February 2017, Moloko+ (Schönebeck, Germany) published the Eddie Woods book Smugglers Train, a collection of 19 poems in the original English and six prose pieces as translated into German by Pociao (Sylvia de Hollanda). Archive The Eddie Woods Archive was acquired by Stanford University in 2003, after he and the writer/radio disc jockey Bart Plantenga had worked for five years assembling it (with Woods regularly shuttling back and forth from England specifically for that purpose). Further material was added in late 2007 (the Jenny Brookes file), and again in early 2020 (several dozen assorted files).

He was captured by the British Army at the end of the war, but was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav authorities, who tried and executed him for war crimes. Early life Kosta Mušicki was born on 7 April 1897 in Slavonski Brod, Austria- Hungary (now in Croatia) to Milutin and Jelena Mušicki (née Mihailović). An ethnic Serb, he began his military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He later married and had two children. During the interwar period, Mušicki served as an aide to King Alexander and Queen Maria. He joined the fascist Yugoslav National Movement (, Jugoslovenski narodni pokret, Zbor) following the king's assassination in 1934. World War II Mušicki was stationed in Slavonski Brod at the time of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 and served as the Royal Yugoslav Army commander responsible for the railroad between Belgrade and Zagreb in the rank of colonel. He demonstrated his support for the Germans by helping their forces during the invasion. Yugoslavia was quickly conquered by the Axis powers and Mušicki remained in Slavonski Brod for several months after the conquest. He attempted to join the Ustaše Militia there, but was rejected. He went to Belgrade in mid-August, where he was received by Zbor leader Dimitrije Ljotić. On 6 October, Milan Nedić, the Prime Minister of the Axis-installed puppet Government of National Salvation, appointed Mušicki to lead the Serbian Volunteer Command (, SDK). Mušicki was involved in executing Serb civilians in the town of Čačak in December 1941. He and Milan Aćimović contacted Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović on 5 December, possibly in an effort to warn him in advance of the assault the Germans had planned, codenamed Operation Mihailovic. This action prompted the Germans to question Mušicki's loyalty. He was removed from command at the end of 1941 and imprisoned by the Germans, but was later freed at Nedić's intervention. In early 1943, the Serbian Volunteer Command was renamed the Serbian Volunteer Corps (, SDK), and placed under the direct command of General der Artillerie Paul Bader, the commanding general in Serbia. The SDK was not part of the SS, nor was it formally a part of the Wehrmacht. It was fed and clothed to German standards, with these expenses reimbursed to the Germans by the puppet government, who also paid the troops at the same rates as the Serbian police. The service oath of this latter SDK was amended to state that the members of the SDK would fight, to the death if necessary, both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetniks. Neither organisation was able to infiltrate the SDK due to its indoctrination with the ideas of Ljotić. Mušicki was re-appointed as its commander in the rank of general. The SDK was the only Serbian armed force that the Germans trusted during the war, and its units were often praised by German commanders for their bravery in combat. Mušicki attempted to flee Yugoslavia towards the end of the war, but was captured by the British. He was extradited to Yugoslavia and placed on trial. At his trial, he gave testimony about the involvement of Serbian volunteers in the Kragujevac massacre. He was found guilty of collaborating with the Germans, sentenced to death, and was executed in Belgrade on 17 July 1946.

Career After completing his degree, Sir John Boreham had a varied and successful career in the Government Statistical Service (GSS).Ward & Doggett, pp. 72, 73, 81, 84–85, 86. He joined the Agriculture Economic Research Institute in Oxford and shortly afterward in 1950, joined the statistics division of the Ministry of Food as a higher executive officer. In 1951, he joined the Ministry of Agriculture as an assistant statistician and then in 1955, he moved to the General Register Office. He moved to the Central Statistical Office in 1958 and returned to the General Register Office on promotion to chief statistician in 1963. Between 1967 and 1971, he was director of economics and statistics at the Ministry of Technology. In 1972, he moved from the Ministry of Technology to the Central Statistical Office as an assistant director. A year later, he was promoted to deputy director. He became director of the Central Statistical Office and head of the Government Statistical Service on 1 August 1978. Director of the Central Statistical Office A key event during the tenure of Sir John Boreham as director of the Central Statistical OfficeWard & Doggett, pp. 84–85, 86, 92. was the Rayner Review of theCentral Statistical Office and the Government Statistical Service, which was an early part of a policy of a newly elected government to reduce the size of the Civil Service.Great Britain, Privy Council Office (1981) Government Statistical Services, Report of the Rayner Review, London: HMSO. As a result of this review, the budget of the Central Statistical Office was cut by 33% and manpower by 25%. By streamlining and compressing the work of the office, Boreham implemented most of the recommendations of the Rayner Review by mid-1981 while still providing the same service to government. After 35 years in the Government Statistical Service, he retired on 31 July 1985. International roles One of the duties of the director of the Central Statistical Office was to attend the twice- yearly Conference of Directors General of the National Statistical Offices of the member countries of the European Community.Ward & Doggett, pp. 87–90. One meeting each year was held in Luxembourg and the other was hosted in turn by the member countries. The United Kingdom hosted the Conference at Leeds Castle in spring 1983.

It is notable as the birthplace of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. Taktser was originally an area of pasture land for the larger village of Balangtsa, about two hours walk away in the valley. Cattle were brought to feed on the fertile grazing lands in summer, which caused them to give very rich milk. Later, when people realized that this was also a good place to farm, permanent houses were built, and the village comprised about thirty cottages by the time Tenzin Gyatso was born in 1935.Thubten Jigme Norbu, Heinrich Harrer, Tibet is my country, op. cit., p. 22. The village is on the route from Xining, which was the seat of local Chinese government administration, to Labrang Tashi Khyi, the largest monastery in the area after the famous Kumbum Monastery.Tibet is My Country: Autobiography of Thubten Jigme Norbu, Brother of the Dalai Lama as told to Heinrich Harrer, p. 21.

The brother of the 14th Dalai Lama Gyalo Thondup said that in 1710, a large part of Amdo had been incorporated into the Manchu empire as part of the region known as Qinghai. He also said that people speak a mixture of Tibetan and Qinghai Chinese language. Tibetan researcher Dr. Wang Xiaolin pointed out that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, most of people already spoke the Qinghai Chinese language, and only a very small amount of Tibetan vocabulary was involved. It was reported that the family of the 14th Dalai Lama spoke Chinese at home, and mother of the 14th Dalai Lama spent 2 years to learn the Tibetan language in Lhasa. Taktser is not, as it is usually taken to be, in the proximity of the Kumbum Monastery, rather it is approximately east of the monastery, and around southwest of the town of Ping'an (, Tibetan: Bayan khar), which is also the seat of the government for the county of the same name.

The birthplace of the 14th Dalai Lama House where the 14th Dalai Lama was born The village of Taktser gained fame as the birthplace of the 14th Dalai Lama in 1935.. It also saw the birth of his elder brother, Thubten Jigme Norbu, who was acknowledged by the 13th Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the great lama Taktser Rinpoche.Taktser Rinpoche: reincarnate lama and brother of the Dalai Lama, Obituary, TimesOnLine, 16 septembre 2008. In 2018, the house has reportedly been renovated and is monitored by the Chinese Communist Party. In her book \\"Dalai Lama, My Son. A Mother's Story\\", published in 2000, the 14th Dalai Lama's mother, Diki Tsering, reports on the cursory description that the 5th Reting Rinpoche gave of her household after seeing it in a vision: \\"there was a tree in the back yard and a stupa (...) at the doorway and (...) we had a small black-and-white dog and a large mastiff on the terrace (...), there were many nationalities in our home.\\".Diki Tsering, Dalai Lama, My Son. A Mother's Story, edited and introduced by Khedroob Thondup, Hermondsworth, Viking Arkana, 2000. In 1954, the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer, who had the opportunity of speaking to Dzasa Kunsangtse, one of the monk investigators sent to look for the 13th Dalai Lama's reincarnation, describes the house as \\"a little Chinese peasant house with carved gables.\\".Seven years in Tibet, translated from the German by Richard Graves; with an introduction by Peter Fleming; foreword by the Dalai Lama, E. P. Dutton, 1954, (). \\"When the regent, after long prayers, came to the water and looked in its mirror, he had a vision of a three-storied monastery with golden roofs, near which stood a little Chinese peasant house with carved gables.\\" Michael Harris Goodman portrayed the house as \\"typically Tibetan: a single-storied rectangular structure with a broad, flat roof situated around a paved courtyard with no windows in the outside walls. In the center of the yard was a round stone base supporting a tall wooden mast from which fluttered a banner of white cotton bearing hundreds of block-printed prayers.\\" To find a more substantial description of the house, one has to turn the biography, published in 1959, of the Dalai Lama's elder brother, Thubten Jigme Norbu. In it the exterior appearance and interior arrangement of the house are depicted in minute detail.Thubten Jigme Norbu, Heinrich Harrer, Tibet is my country, op. cit., pp. 22-24. The house was a rectangular, ground- level building, with its various parts arranged around a wide central courtyard. It had a rectangular flat roof. There were no openings in the outside walls, except for the doorway. In the roof there were three chimneys stacks and two air-holes. Around the roof were small gutters with spouts giving out into the courtyard. Over the entrance there was a socket fixed in the roof to take a 10-foot-high flagpole. The flag itself was inscribed with innumerable prayers. The house was entered from the east side as this was the only side that afforded protection from the weather. A wide corridor led into the yard. To the right was the kitchen, which took up almost the whole eastern wing. In the northern wing was the best room, the altar room and the bedroom of the Dalai Lama's parents, all connected with each other. The byre, the guest room and the store room were in the western wing, while the stable, the kennel and the sheep-pen were in the southern wing. The yard, the covered in- way and the stalls were paved with stone slabs. The rooms had wooden floors. A more recent account of the home comes from Rudy Kong in Dragons, Donkeys, and Dust: Memoirs from a decade in China, published in 2010. Kong visited the home in 2001 and described \\"a living room of bare concrete that contained nothing more than simple wooden furniture. On the tables and walls were old black and white family photos. In the photos we could see the young child Tenzin Gyatso, who would be pronounced an incarnation of Buddha himself and become the God- King of the Tibetans: the Dalai Lama.\\"  A Monastery of the 4th Karmapa  Shadzong Ritro monastery before destruction by the Communist Chinese Standing on a mountain peak 7 km from Taktser, the monastery of Shadzong Ritro was founded by the 4th Karmapa (1340–1383) at the beginning of the 14th century. It is in this monastery that the 4th Karmapa conferred the first vows to Tsongkhapa (1357–1419). At the time of this ceremony, the Karmapa cut a wick of hair of the child, then sent it on a close boulder of the cave where he lived, creating a crack in the rock. A Juniper exhaling an odor of human hair and still visible these days would have grown from it.Goodman, Michael H. (1986), The Last Dalai Lama, Shambhala Publications, Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of his return from China, the 13th Dalai Lama, stayed for a while in this monastery, finding the place magnificent, and gazing at the house of his next reincarnation,Roland Barraux, Histoire des Dalaï Lamas, Quatorze reflets sur le Lac des Visions, Albin Michel, 1993. Réédité en 2002, Albin Michel, . a detail the monks remembered.Gilles van Grasdorff, Hostage of Beijing: the abduction of the Panchen Lama, Shaftesbury, Dorset ; Boston, Mass., 1999. According to Thubten Jigme Norbu, in 1949, by the end of the Chinese Civil War, plundering hordes controlled by the Communists, robbed and destroyed what they could not take, burning the buildings of Shadzong Ritro.Thubten Jigme Norbu, Tibet Is my country, autobiography dictated to Heinrich Harrer in 1959, and updated with a new essay in 1987 () and 2006 () Climate Located at above sea level, Taktser has an elevation-influenced dry-winter subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dwc) with long, very cold winters and short, fresh summers. Taktser experiences large diurnal temperature variations, especially in winter months. January has a difference between the average high and low temperatures.

Urocanase is coded for by the UROC1 gene, located on the 3rd chromosome in humans. The protein itself is composed of 676 amino acids which then fold, producing the final product which has 2 identical subunits, making the enzyme a homodimer. To catalyze the hydrolysis of urocanate in the catabolic pathway of L-histidine the enzyme utilizes its two NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adnene Dinucleotide) groups. The NAD+ groups act as electrophiles, attaching to the top carbon of the urocanate which leads to sigmatropic rearrangement of the urocanate molecule.

Hotel and Restaurant Employees, 468 U.S. 491 (1984), is a 4-to-3 ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that a New Jersey state gaming law requiring union leaders to be of good moral character was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).. Lee and Chelius, \\"Government Regulation of Labor-Management Corruption: The Casino Industry Experience in New Jersey,\\" Industrial and Labor Relations Review, July 1989. Background In 1976, New Jersey amended their state constitution to permit casino gambling in Atlantic City. On June 2, 1977, Governor Brendan Byrne signed the Casino Control Act (N.J. Stat. Ann. Section 5:12-1 et seq.) into law.Waggoner, \\"Casino Unit's Power Is Termed Absolute,\\" New York Times, June 4, 1977. The act established the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and instituted comprehensive regulation of casino gambling—including the regulation of labor unions representing gaming industry employees. In an attempt to forestall organized crime influence over labor unions, Sections 86 and 93 of the act imposed certain qualifications on officials of labor organizations representing casino industry workers. Among these qualifications were that the official be of \\"good moral character,\\" not been convicted of certain felonies, and was not associated with organized crime. If a labor union's leaders did not meet these criteria, the union was prohibited from collecting or receiving dues from its members and from administering pension and welfare funds.Janson, \\"Judges' Reasoning on Casino Unions,\\" New York Times, June 12, 1983; Mattiace, \\"State Moves Against Casino Union, Cites Mob,\\" Associated Press, May 14, 1981. Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union Local 54 represented about 12,000 workers, 10,000 of whom were employed in Atlantic City casinos. Almost all of these casino workers had been organized since the legalization of gambling in the state. On May 13, 1981, the Casino Control Commission found that Frank Gerace, president of Local 54, and Frank Materio, the local's grievance manager, were associated with organized crime. The commission also ruled that Karlos LaSane, the union's business agent, was ineligible to be a union officer or agent because he had previously been convicted of extortion. The commission also found that union officers refused to cooperate with Casino Control Commission investigators, and held stock in Resorts International, Inc. (which owned one of the casinos in which Local 54 represented workers). Both actions contravened state regulations. The commission feared that Local 54 was being influenced by Nicodemo \\"Little Nicky\\" Scarfo, a reputed leader of the Scarfo organized crime \\"family\\" based in Philadelphia. National and state AFL-CIO officials, fearing the New Jersey law might open the door to extensive new state regulation of labor unions, asked Local 54 to test the New Jersey law in court. After a regulatory appeal, the Casino Control Commission unanimously rejected the union's contention that the law was unconstitutional and preempted by the NLRA.Janson, \\"Casino Agency Rebuts Attack by Local Union,\\" New York Times, August 6, 1981. Local 54 then filed suit in federal district court, seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the act. At trial, the union argued that the law infringed on its members' constitutional right of freedom of association and was preempted by federal labor law. The state countered that the regulation was a permissible infringement of the freedom of association because keeping criminal elements out of the gaming industry was a compelling governmental interest. On March 22, 1982, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey held that the New Jersey statute was not unconstitutionally vague and did not impermissibly infringe on union members' First Amendment rights. The union appealed. While the appeal was pending, the Casino Control Commission ordered Gerace and Materio to vacate their union positions. The commission demanded that both men relinquish their union offices by October 12, 1982, or the local would not be permitted to collect dues or administer its pension plan.Wade, \\"Leaders Ordered Out of Casino Workers' Union,\\" Associated Press, September 28, 1982. On June 30, 1983, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled 2-to-1 that the district court had erred. The appellate court granted the union's injunction, finding that Section 93 of the act was preempted by Section 7 of the NLRA.Janson, \\"Court Hears Appeal by Casino Union,\\" New York Times, November 21, 1982. The Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Supreme Court's decision in Hill v. Florida ex rel. Watson, 325 U.S. 538 (1945), when it concluded that Section 7 conferred \\"an unfettered right on employees to choose the officials of their own bargaining representatives.\\"Brown, 468 U.S. at 504. The state sought a rehearing en banc, but the entire court of appeals refused to rehear the case after it deadlocked in a 5-to-5 vote.Janson, \\"Court Won't Rehear Case on Casino Union Control,\\" New York Times, July 6, 1983. The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari (464 U.S. 990 (1983)). Decision Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Chief Justice Burger and Justices Harry Blackmun and William Rehnquist joined. Justice Byron White, joined by Justices Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and John Paul Stevens, dissented. Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the hearing or decision of the case. =Majority opinion= Justice O'Connor concluded that Section 7 of the NLRA did not contain explicit pre-emptive language nor indicate congressional intent to usurp a state role in labor-management relations. \\"[A]ppropriate consideration for the vitality of our federal system and for a rational allocation of functions belies any easy inference that Congress intended to deprive the States of their ability to retain jurisdiction over such matters.\\"Brown, 468 U.S. at 503. O'Connor then rejected the appellate court's reading of Hill v. Florida ex rel. Watson. Subsequent to Hill, O'Connor noted, Congress had enacted the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (the \\"Landrum-Griffin Act\\"). Section 504(a) of the Landrum-Griffin Act explicitly barred from office for a five-year period union officers convicted of any number of crimes. By enacting Section 504(a), O'Connor concluded, Congress \\"unmistakably indicated that the right of employees to select the officers of their bargaining representatives is not absolute...\\"Brown, 468 U.S. at 505. Citing the plurality opinion in De Veau v. Braisted,. O'Connor noted that the Court had previously held that the Landrum-Griffin Act had not preempted the role of state legislation in regulating union officials. O'Connor next addressed the New Jersey statute's enforcement mechanism. O'Connor recognized the continuing controlling nature of Hill in this regard, and acknowledged that questions of constitutionality and preemption must \\"be assessed independently in terms of its potential conflict with the federal enactment.\\"Brown, 468 U.S. at 510. O'Connor concluded, however, that the record was too incomplete on this issue, and remanded the issue to the appellate court so that it could order further proceedings. =Dissenting opinion= Justice White, writing for the dissent, argued that the linkage between Section 93 and Section 86 of the New Jersey act rendered the act preempted by federal law. If Section 86 merely imposed qualifications on union officials, White concluded, the law would not be preempted by the NLRA.Brown, 468 U.S. at 513-14 (White, J., dissenting). But the act went far beyond that, and imposed sweeping penalties on the union. For the dissent, this proved critical: > It is not clear what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it > expressly refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund > administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than > impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified > under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a > mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears > that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals > from acting as union officials as long as it does not impose sanctions on > the union itself, it is not clear that anything in § 93(b) enables the State > to do that.Brown, 468 U.S. at 514, FN 1. White noted that although Section 7 of the NLRA granted employees the absolute right to choose collective bargaining representatives of their choosing, that right was not coextensive with the less absolute right to determine who should serve as officers in that organization.Brown, 468 U.S. at 514, FN 3. In the current case, White noted, the workers had chosen an organization rather than an individual as their collective bargaining agent. White agreed with the majority that the state can permissibly impose qualifications on the officers of Local 54. But the language of Section 7 of the NLRA as well as the Court's ruling in Hill permitted the state to impose sanctions only on the officers, not on the union. Interfering with the relatively untrammeled right of the union to carry out its duties as collective bargaining agent was impermissible as a matter of federal law: > Allowing the State to so restrict the union's conduct infringes on the > employees' right to bargain collectively through the representative of their > own choosing because it prevents that representative from functioning as a > collective-bargaining agent. ... A union which cannot sustain itself > financially obviously cannot effectively engage in collective-bargaining > activities on behalf of its members.Brown, 468 U.S. at 515. The record, White noted, was quite clear in showing that Local 54 would not be able to function if either of the Casino Control Commission's sanctions were imposed.Only one of the Commission's sanctions—denying the union the right to collect dues—had been imposed. The majority argued that since the other sanction—denying the union the right to administer its pension and benefit funds—had not been imposed, this made the matter unripe for review by the Court. 468 U.S. at 512. Thus, White would have overturned the statute on grounds of preemption under Section 7 of the NLRA: > I am willing to hold that, as a matter of law, a statute like § 93(b), which > prohibits a union from collecting dues from its members, impairs the union's > ability to represent those members to such an extent that it infringes on > their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.Brown, > 468 U.S. at 515-16. Consequences of the ruling Gerace resigned shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling. However, Local 54 immediately rehired Gerace as a $48,000-a-year \\"consultant.\\" The Casino Control Commission declared this \\"a subterfuge.\\" The gaming commission declined to impose either of its statutory sanctions, and instead sought a court injunction forcing Gerace to resign his consultancy. In November 1984, a New Jersey state superior court ruled that the gaming commission had the right to force Gerace's resignation. Gerace initially fought the court's order, but eventually resigned after concluding that the continuing legal battle would \\"be disruptive to the operation of the union.\\" Materio and LaSane also resigned, but were later hired by the union as business agents to handle non-casino related matters.Janson, \\"State to Keep Monitoring the Casino Union,\\" New York Times, December 16, 1984. Five years after the ruling in Brown v. Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union an academic study concluded that the Casino Control Act had been only marginally successful in preventing or eliminating organized crime influence in New Jersey's casino unions. The study noted that the law had not been used since its initial 1981 enforcement action, and that many union officials were merely rehired as consultants rather than as elected officers. The state gaming commission never again attempted to use its two statutory sanctions against any union, and relied instead on the threat of injunctions to remove officials it suspected of links to organized crime.

The Union was completed in 1929 as a memorial to the students, faculty, and staff of the University who fought and died in World War I. The Union has more than 26 meeting and activity rooms and eight dining kiosks. The Meacham Auditorium has 400 seats, and the Molly Shi Boren Ballroom, on the third floor, seats up to 500 banquet guests. History OU students began an effort to build a student union in 1921. The movement grew, and by 1925 serious efforts began for construction of a combination student union and football stadium. The original architect's drawing for the combined facility showed a facade quite similar to the present day union. However, the consolidated union/stadium was scrapped after football coach Bennie Owen said it would be best to build two structures, a stadium and a student union, instead of one. Construction of the Union began in 1929 at an original cost of US$350,000, which came from the million dollar fundraising campaign – the first in the University's history – to build both structures.Burr, Carol J. An Enduring Union . Sooner Magazine, Winter 2007. The plans called for the construction of the outer shell of the building so it could be filled in with offices and rooms as the University grew. When the central part of the Union was finished, students and faculty enjoyed a large cafeteria, a book exchange, and a large open area with two regulation-sized bowling alleys and several pool & snooker tables on the ground floor. Offices, a men's lounge, and the ballroom were located on the second and third floors. The Union's landmark clock tower was completed in 1936 as a Works Progress Administration project. Carillon bells were installed in the tower in 1955. A downsized model of the Sooner Schooner sits inside the Will Rogers dining area in the Union. When enrollment at the University skyrocketed after World War II ended, momentum increased to complete the interior of the structure. The north and south wings of the building, including the Meacham Auditorium, were completed in 1951 for $2.3 million. The cafeteria expanded into the north wing and was renamed the Will Rogers Cafeteria, to honor Will Rogers. Small retail shops opened on the ground floor, and student groups and some administration offices occupied the first and second floors of the south wing. After this construction, the Union began a period of decline as the University's campus expanded south. By the time the Union Parking Garage was completed in the early 1980s, the Will Rogers Cafeteria, once Norman's favorite Sunday-after- church luncheon spot, had become a relic, and its decor – and food offerings – were firmly stuck in the 1950s. The book exchange was only large enough to hold the engineering texts and supplies; Crossroads Restaurant was the lone competition to the Will Rogers Cafeteria. The new student dormitories were over half a mile (0.8 kilometers) south along with new classroom buildings. The Union was quiet except for banquet traffic, from both student groups and Norman-area businesses and civic organizations, and visits to Career Planning and Placement (now OU Career Services), the University's employment office for graduating seniors, on the third floor. Soon after the parking garage was opened, student organization offices began to move back into the Union, which brought more foot traffic into the building. As enrollment again increased in the late 1980s and early 1990s, small areas were refurbished on an intermittent basis, but it was clear that the Union needed more than cosmetic improvements. When the University's 13th president, David Boren, arrived in 1994, he and his wife Molly led a $11.5 million campaign to remodel the building. The result was a facility that welcomed students, and the Union quickly regained its status as a campus gathering place. Oklahoma Memorial Union - Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman, OK In October 2006, custodians began to notice small paint chips and sawdust on window sills on the Union's third floor. Expert inspectors quickly deduced that the roof beams above the third floor were pushing the lintels on the third floor windows down, which pushed the walls apart and also pressed against the walls of the north wing. Construction quickly began to rescue the building, and more than $1 million was spent to remove the brick on the east and west sides of the building, strengthen the beams, and repair the walls. The work was completed in the spring of 2007.

Life Warhola was born Júlia Justína Zavacká to a peasant family in the Rusyn village of Mikó, Austria-Hungary (now Miková in northeast Slovakia) and married Andrij Varkhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola) there in 1909. He emigrated to the United States soon after, and in 1921 she followed him to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The couple had three surviving children: Paul, John, and Andrew (Andy). The family lived at several Pittsburgh addresses, but beginning in 1932 at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of the city. The family was Byzantine Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Her husband died in 1942. Julia enjoyed singing traditional Rusyn folk songs and was artistic. She loved to draw. Her favorite subjects were angels and cats. She also did embroidery and other crafts, such as bouquets of hand-made flowers made from tin cans and crepe paper. During the Easter season she decorated eggs in the Pysanka tradition. As a widow, she moved to New York City in 1951 to take care of Andy. He often used her decorative handwriting to accompany his illustrations. She won awards for her lettering, including one from the American Institute of Graphic Arts for an album cover for The Story of Moondog, featuring the musician Louis Thomas Hardin in 1958. In 1957 she illustrated a small book called Holy Cats and she also worked on 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy. In 1966, Andy made a movie called Mrs. Warhol (color, 66 minutes). It features Julia in her basement apartment in Andy's house playing \\"an aging peroxide movie star with a lot of husbands,\\" including the most current spouse, played by Richard Rheem. Andy follows her about with his camera as she goes about her daily domestic routines. In 1971, she returned to Pittsburgh and died a year later. She is buried, alongside her husband and near her son Andy, in St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, a south suburb of Pittsburgh.

Encased in a basic fairing which could hold fuel and remote-control equipment, the unit weighed 5,600 pounds (2550 kg) and generated a thrust of approximately 6,200 pounds-force (27.6 kN); the Atar Volant was able to cause vertical lift, which was precisely its purpose. There were later Atar Volant models, each made improvements and alterations to the previous designs, and eventually resulted in a full-fledged craft.  Background and purpose  The Coléoptère was a VTOL or \\"Vertical Take-Off and Landing\\" aircraft that was designed by SNECMA during the 1950s. While the Coléoptère was not the first VTOL aircraft, none of its predecessors had an annular wing designed to land vertically. The benefit of this annular wing was the requirement for very little landing or take-off space. However, the design of the Coléoptère met with many problems, such as overcoming the torque imparted to a vertical engine by its own turbine wheels and rotating compressor, and discovering and developing a method of balancing the craft on the column of air released from its jet pipe during the take-off and landing phase, as well as, more particularly, during manoeuvres out of the vertical positioning. To address some of these problems, as well as to provide a way to achieve vertical lift, SNECMA set to work on what was to become the first model of the Atar Volants.  Improvements, alterations and later models  There were at least four Atar Volant models constructed, each improving or making alterations on the last: the first (C.400 P.1), C.400 P.2, C.400 P.3. and the last, the C.450-01. The second in the series had much success at an international air display in Le Bourget, in Paris, and the third became a full-scale coleopter in its own right, due to numerous improvements and alterations made to the model. The C.450-01 model's maiden flight took place in May 1959. Two months later, while being put through its paces, the single prototype crashed. The pilot was seriously injured, and the prototype wrecked, resulting in the abandoning of its development and the project.

A Contribution to Political Science, translation by W. Hastie, Edinburgh: Clark, 1891. In Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch (1795), Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics by establishment of political community.Kant, Immanuel. Perpetual Peace. Trans. Lewis White Beck (377). For a summary and His classical republican theory was extended in Doctrine of Right (1797), the first part of Metaphysics of Morals.Manfred Riedel Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy, Cambridge 1984 At the end of the 20th century Kant's political philosophy had been enjoying a remarkable renaissance in English-speaking countries with more major studies in a few years than had appeared in the preceding many decades. Overview Kant's most significant contribution to political philosophy and the philosophy of law is the doctrine of Rechtsstaat. According to this doctrine, the power of the state is limited in order to protect citizens from the arbitrary exercise of authority. The Rechtsstaat () is a concept in continental European legal thinking, originally borrowed from German jurisprudence, which can be translated as \\"the legal state\\" or \\"state of rights\\". It is a \\"constitutional state\\" in which the exercise of governmental power is constrained by the law,Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political, ch. 7; Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy and is often tied to the Anglo-American concept of the rule of law. Kant's political philosophy has been described as liberal for its presumption of limits on the state based on the social contract as a regulative matter.• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland, 2011, \\"Liberalism\\", 1.1, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). The Metaphysics of Morals, Part 1), Bobbs- Merrill. In a Rechtsstaat, the citizens share legally based civil liberties and they can use the courts. A country cannot be a liberal democracy without first being a Rechtsstaat. German writers usually place Immanuel Kant's theories at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the Rechtsstaat.Friedrich Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty. The Rechtsstaat in the meaning of \\"constitutional state\\" was introduced in the latest works of Immanuel Kant after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century. Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written constitution. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea: a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity. Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but constitutionalism and constitutional government. Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a state is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.” Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twentieth century. The Rechtsstaat concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals: \\"The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of the theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law.\\"Immanuel Kant, in History of Political Philosophy, edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987 The concept of the Rechtsstaat appeared in the German context in Robert von Mohl's book Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grundsätzen des Rechtsstaates (\\"German police science according to the principles of the constitutional state\\", 1832–1834), and was contrasted with the aristocratic police state. Kant opposed \\"democracy\\"which, in that era, meant direct democracybelieving that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, \\"…democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which \\"all\\" decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, \\"all\\", who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom.\\"Kant, Immanuel. Perpetual Peace. Trans. Lewis White Beck (352). As most writers at the time he distinguished three forms of government: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with mixed government as the most ideal form of government. A distinctive feature of Kant's political philosophy is his conviction that the university should be a model of creative conflict: the philosopher's role within the university should be to \\"police\\" the higher faculties (which in his day were theology, law and medicine), making sure their teaching conforms to the principles of reason; likewise, the goal of perpetual peace in society can be achieved only when the rulers consult with philosophers on a regular basis.For an explanation and defense of these two aspects of Kant's political theory, see Stephen Palmquist's essays: \\"Kant's Ideal of the University as a Model for World Peace\\", in Papers of International Conference on Two Hundred Years after Kant (Tehran, Iran: Allame Tabataba'i University Press, 2005), pp.207-222; and \\"The Philosopher as a 'Secret Agent' for Peace: Taking Seriously Kant's Revival of the 'Old Question'\\", in Valerio Rohden, Ricardo R.

The squadron was formed in England in October 1917 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, and disbanded in early 1919. It was re-formed by the Royal Australian Air Force on paper in June 1940, and operationally in January 1942. After seeing action during the Pacific War flying Lockheed Hudson and, later, DAP Beaufort bombers, the squadron was disbanded a second time in December 1945. History No. 7 Squadron was established during World War I, being raised as a flying training squadron of the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) at Yatesbury, England, on 24 October 1917. Equipped with a wide range of aircraft, the squadron commenced training operations in February 1918 and was tasked to provide replacement aircrew to No. 3 Squadron until being disbanded in early 1919. Upon formation it was designated as No. 32 (Australian) (Training) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, before adopting its AFC designation in early 1918. Its first commanding officer was Captain H.D.E. Ralfe.. During World War II, No. 7 Squadron was re- formed at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, on 27 June 1940.. It was originally intended to equip the squadron with Lockheed Hudson aircraft, but the unit was reduced to cadre status. The squadron was re-formed in January 1942 as a Hudson operational training unit responsible for preparing aircrew for posting to other squadrons. Commanded by John Balmer,. the squadron undertook several convoy escort flights and anti-submarine patrols along the Australian eastern seaboard. In early June, one of the squadron's aircraft located and attacked a Japanese submarine, possibly damaging it. Shortly afterwards, the majority of the squadron was absorbed into No. 1 Operational Training Unit. In August 1942, what remained of the squadron moved to Nowra, New South Wales, where it was re-equipped with DAP Beaufort medium bombers and began training to operate in the bomber-reconnaissance role. The squadron completed its training in October and moved to Ross River near Townsville, Queensland, where it undertook convoy escort patrols over Australia's northern waters. During these operations, the squadron's aircraft damaged another Japanese submarine, shot down two Japanese Aichi E13A \\"Jake\\" seaplanes and damaged several others.. The squadron was based at Horn Island, Queensland, from April to October 1944, when it moved to Tadji, Papua New Guinea. From November 1944 until the end of the war, the squadron flew strike missions against Japanese positions in New Guinea in support of the Australian 6th Division. The squadron also participated in rescue operations for aircrew that came down behind Japanese lines. No. 7 Squadron was disbanded at Tadji on 19 December 1945. During the war, 33 personnel from the squadron were killed in action or died on active service. Aircraft operated The squadron operated the following aircraft: *Airco DH.6 (October 1917 – 1918); *Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 (October 1917 – 1918); *Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 (October 1917 – 1919); *Avro 504 (February 1918 – 1919); *Bristol Fighter (February 1918 – 1919); *Lockheed Hudson (January 1940 – August 1942); *DAP Beaufort (August 1942 – December 1945).

It documents Delisle's three-month deployment in December 1997 to Shenzhen, a big city developed by the People's Republic of China near Hong Kong, where he is acting as the liaison between Dupuis, a Belgian animation production company and a Chinese studio, where Chinese animators draw child-oriented films (Papyrus) from the layout phase taking the French storyboards as a guide. He struggles with boredom, the difficulties of outsourcing and the culture shock of a Westerner in this profit-oriented Chinese city. The book has 145 pages. Some of the frames are drawn by Chinese artists and by a friend of Delisle's. Plot Delisle had already been to China in Nanjing. He is deployed to Shenzhen as part of an outsourcing project, where he will spend three months in the Great Wall Hotel. Unlike in Hong Kong, there are not many bilingual Chinese so he has language problems during his stay, including with the interpreters at work. Often he has to recourse to drawing or pointing to communicate. Among his experiences of life in Shenzhen include a visit to a Chinese dentist to cure a toothache, but after seeing the unhygienic conditions of the clinic, he is relieved to find out it is just a case of mesialization. Since the main leisure activity in Shenzhen is shopping, Delisle tries to read books, works for L'Association's Lapin magazine, and buys Chinese artbooks (drawings by children, Wang Chi Yun, Hu Buo Zhong). He realizes that the Spirou that he liked as a child is no longer funny. An allegory he applies to the Chinese rural exodus is the Divine Comedy, with the Chinese countryside as the Inferno; the USA as the Paradiso; and the big Chinese cities, Shenzhen and Hong Kong as intermediate rings. He finds a copy of Théodore Poussin. His Chinese-speaking acquaintances bring him to try Chinese food. He finds Guangzhou and Hong Kong more interesting than Shenzhen. The only tourist attraction he visits in the new city is the Window of the World, since his Chinese friends are not interested in Splendid China. He spends a Christmas dinner with a Chinese animator who, while a fan of Rembrandt, has only a black-and-white photo of Bathsheba at Her Bath. There is less political commentary than in his later Pyongyang comic.

There are 1,553 poems in the collection, but many are repeated; the number of unique pieces is 1,144.Sakihara, Mitsugu. A Brief History of Early Okinawa Based on the Omoro Sōshi. Tokyo: Honpo Shoseki Press, 1987. p6. The hiragana used, however, is a traditional orthography which associates different sounds to the characters than their normal Japanese readings, due to it originally being based on an earlier stage of Northern Ryukyuan that has not yet undergone vowel raising characteristic of the modern languages. The characters used to write omoro, for example (おもろ), would be written this same way, but pronounced as umuru in Okinawan. The poetry contained in the volumes extends from the 12th century, or possibly earlier, to some composed by the Queen of Shō Nei (1589-1619). Though formally composed and recorded at these times, most if not all are believed to derive from far earlier traditions, as a result of their language, style, and content. The poems contained in the compilation vary, but follow a general pattern of celebrating famous heroes of the past, from poets and warriors to kings and voyagers. A few are love poems. They range from two verses to forty, some making extensive use of rhyme and couplet structures. Etymology Sōshi (草紙) means simply a written work, but the origins and meaning of the term \\"omoro\\" are more elusive. Iha Fuyū was among the scholars who traced it to various words associated with oracles and divine songs. He further derived the term as referring to omori, a Ryukyuan word for sacred groves. Nakahara Zenchū, on the other hand, traced it back to the Ryukyuan umuru, or umui, meaning \\"to think\\".Sakihara. pp3-4. Regardless of the true meaning or origins of the term, however, a basic cloud of meanings is nevertheless apparent. The omoro sōshi, a \\"compilation of thoughts\\" or of collective memory, is also associated with sacred groves and with divine songs. History The omoro, as a form, are said to be the predecessors in Ryukyuan culture to distinct forms of music, dance, and literature; they incorporate all three of these. Only after centuries of development, and influence from China, Japan, and various South Seas cultures, did distinct traditions of music, dance, and literature develop, literature being the only one to be recorded with any consistency. Outside of what might be inferred or reconstructed from the Omoro Sōshi, no record survives today of earlier forms of Ryukyuan music and dance. Though reflective of ancient folk traditions, the poetry also reflects the intricate links the Ryukyus enjoyed with other nearby states. Many of the Ryukyuan islands, largely culturally and linguistically isolated, are mentioned, along with various locations in Japan, China, Southeast Asia, and the South Seas. The Omoro Sōshi was first compiled in 1531, and again in 1613 and 1623, as part of attempts by the royal government to secure their cultural or spiritual legitimacy and power. The first compilation came just after the reign of Shō Shin, who consolidated, centralized, and reformed the government, and the second came just after Ryukyu became a direct vassal to Satsuma. At both times, cultural and ideological means, as well as more mundane political ones, were needed to ensure unity and to maintain a connection to tradition and history. Only a small handful of scholars has studied the documents in any significant depth. The vast changes in Ryukyuan culture and language over the last several centuries have made the poetry difficult to access and understand, and Iha Fuyū (d. 1947) and Nakahara Zenchū (d. 1964) were among the only ones to extensively study it. Iha, Nakahara, and several others have used the compilation as a basis for research into ancient Ryukyuan customs and society. Thorough analysis has yielded elements of a foundation of understanding of ancient governance, social structures, and folk religion, but it cannot be expected that a comprehensive understanding may be derived from the material.

The church had split from the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America (SAS) in 1870. Prior to the split the SAS had placed a Norwegian seminary in Marshall, Wisconsin, which today is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and known as Augsburg University. When the Conference separated from the SAS in 1870, another church body also split from the SAS, the Norwegian-Danish Augustana Synod in America (NAS). The difference between the NAS and the Conference was the inclusion of the Book of Concord. The NAS wanted to include the entire Book of Concord as the confessional base. The Conference wanted to use only the three ecumenical creeds, Luther's Small Catechism, and the Unaltered Augsburg Confession. The two groups along with the Anti-Missourian Brotherhood group from the Norwegian Synod united in 1890 to form the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 633. Its full name is Claughton-on- Brock to distinguish it from another Claughton in Lancashire in the Lune valley between Lancaster and Hornby. St Thomas the Apostle Church The village has both a Roman Catholic church (St Thomas Apostle) and a Roman Catholic primary school (St Mary's), but no Church of England presence, which is unusual for a parish in England. The nearest Church of England church is in the neighbouring parish, Barnacre-with-Bonds. History The parish was historically in the Amounderness Hundred. It lies between the Calder and Brock valleys. The A6 road runs through the west end of the parish, a short distance south of the town of Garstang. Claughton is mentioned in the Domesday Book appearing as Clactune. Later variations include Clacton, 1184; Clagton Clahton, 1253; Claghton, 1284. The name is believed to be of Saxon origin, meaning 'farm on the hill'. The Fitzherbert-Brockholes family have been associated with Claughton on Brock since the time of Edward II. They were regarded as recusants during and after the Reformation. The family has a large agricultural estate with 16 farms, which date back to 1395, the oldest being Manor House Farm is believed to be the 'Farm on the hill' of which the name Claughton originates from. The parish had a public house, the Brockholes Arms, which closed for business in 2013. Afterwards, the building was converted into an Italian restaurant, which has also since closed for business. In 2018 the Brockholes Arms reopened as a public house. Another old house of Claughton is Claughton Green which was once part of the Claughton Green Estate before being bought by the Fitzherbert-Brockholes Family. Adjacent to Manor House Farm, the large whitewash house originates from the 18th century. Education Claughton RC Primary School There are multiple local primary and secondary schools available from Claughton, including: Saint Mary's RC Primary School, John Cross Church of England Primary School, Whitechapel Primary School and Calder Vale CE Primary. Secondary schools include Garstang Community Academy, Broughton High School, Our Lady's Catholic High School and Saint Cecilia's Roman Catholic Technology College. Colleges are in abundance in the area, including: Cardinal Newman College, Preston's College, Blackpool Sixth, Blackpool and Fylde, Lancaster Girls Grammar, Lancaster Royal Grammar and Myerscough College. Universities in a twenty-mile radius include: Lancaster University, UCLan (University of Central Lancashire), University of Cumbria, Myerscough College & Blackpool and the Fylde University Centre  Geography  The parish of Claughton lies on the northern bank of the River Brock, extending from the A6 to the foot of Bleasdale Moor, in the Borough of Wyre in Lancashire.

History  In 1984, musician and electronic hobbyist Rick Campbell began servicing amplifiers for patrons of the now defunct Belmont 8 recording studio in Portland, Oregon. The servicing of old amplifiers quickly evolved to the construction of new amplifiers, and Mr. Campbell eventually went on to produce an estimated four- to five-hundred Rick-Tone amplifiers between the years of 1984 and 1992. Most of these amplifiers were custom built for musicians in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, who were often referred to Mr. Campbell through word of mouth reputation or through small advertisements posted in local musical instrument shops. Rick-Tone amplifiers were usually intended for the amplification of electric guitar, though a few were constructed for other uses such as electric bass or mandolin. Unlike most contemporary amplifiers of the 1980s, all Rick-Tone amplifiers utilized glass vacuum tubes instead of modern transistors and integrated circuits, and the method of construction was entirely point-to-point hand wiring instead of modern printed circuit boards. Amplifiers of this type were considered obsolete by many musicians of the 1980s, and the Rick-Tone brand did not fare well financially. Production of Rick-Tone amplifiers ceased in 1992. With the resurgence of interest in vacuum tube guitar amplifiers in recent years, it is not uncommon to see well kept Rick-Tone amplifiers selling for far more than their original sales prices.  Related  Some Rick-Tone amplifier circuits were inspired by 1950s era amplifiers from the Valco company.

It is located just south of the Strand, next to the Savoy Hotel. It sits on the site of the Savoy Palace, once owned by John of Gaunt, that was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Work was begun on the building in 1502 by King Henry VII and it received its first charter to operate as a hospital foundation in 1512 to look after 100 poor and needy men of London. The hospital had fallen into ruin by the late 18th century; only the chapel survived the consequent demolition, which enabled the construction of an approach road at the north of first Waterloo Bridge. The chapel is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster and as such is a Royal Peculiar, not being under the jurisdiction of a bishop, but under that of the reigning monarch. The church is the chapel of the Royal Victorian Order, although since the number of the members of the Order exceeded the width of the chapel their gathering takes place at St George's Chapel, at Windsor Castle. It is designated as a Grade II* listed building. History Part of the old Savoy Hospital (top) and the 'Church of St Mary Savoy' (bottom) in 1753. The chapel was founded as part of Peter of Savoy's palace which was destroyed during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The present chapel building commenced in the 1490s (being completed in 1512) by Henry VII as a side chapel off the Savoy Hospital's long nave (the nave was secular rather than sacred, held 100 beds and was demolished in the 19th century). The Savoy Chapel has hosted various other congregations, most notably that of St Mary- le-Strand whilst it had no church building of its own (1549–1714). Also the German Lutheran congregation of Westminster (now at Sandwich Street and Thanet Street, near St Pancras) was granted royal permission to worship in the chapel when it separated from Holy Trinity (the City of London Lutheran congregation now at St Mary-at-Hill). The new congregation's first pastor, Irenaeus Crusius (previously an associate at Holy Trinity), dedicated the chapel on the 19th Sunday after Trinity 1694 as the Marienkirche or the German Church of St Mary- le-Savoy. Archibald Cameron of Lochiel, the last Jacobite leader to be executed for treason, was buried there in 1753. An Anglican place of worship, the chapel was noted in the 18th and 19th centuries as a place where marriages without banns might occur outside of the usual parameters of ecclesiastical law of that time. The Rev. Henry White was the chaplain of Savoy Chapel from 1860 to 1890 and might have set a record for officiating at the marriages of actors and actresses. It was referred to in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited as \\"the place where divorced couples got married in those days—a poky little place\\".\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" In 1755 Joseph Vernon married Jane Poitier here and the curate and vicar were transported for fourteen years for carrying out an unlicensed wedding. In 1908 it was the scene of a suffragette wedding between Victor and Una Duval. The wedding was attended by leading suffragettes and the wedding caused much debate because the bride refused to say \\"and obey\\", despite the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1939, it was announced by the office of the Duchy of Lancaster that the Savoy Chapel would be known as The King's Chapel of the Savoy. Many of the chapel's stained glass windows were destroyed in the London Blitz during the Second World War. However, a triptych stained glass memorial window survives which depicts a procession of angelic musicians. It is dedicated to the memory of Richard D'Oyly Carte (who was married at the chapel in 1888) and was unveiled by Sir Henry Irving in 1902; after their deaths, the names of Rupert D'Oyly Carte and Dame Bridget D'Oyly Carte were added.Goodman, Andrew. Gilbert and Sullivan's London (1988; 2000) Faber & Faber Present Diamond Jubilee window Savoy Chapel nave in 2012 The chapel has been Crown property for centuries as part of the Savoy Hospital estate and remains under the aegis of the monarch as part of the Duchy of Lancaster and thereby is a Royal Peculiar. It was inaugurated as a Chapel Royal in November 2016. The chaplain is appointed by the Duchy (and since 1937 as ex-officio chaplain of the Royal Victorian Order) and effectively it is the \\"parish church\\" of the Savoy Estate, the Duchy of Lancaster's principal London landholding. Armorial plates commemorating GCVOs past and present are displayed throughout the chapel; the Royal Victorian Order's present Honorary Genealogist is David White, Somerset Herald. Most of the chapel's costs and maintenance are met by the Duchy of Lancaster, with recent works including landscaping of its garden in honour of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and restoration of the chapel ceiling in 1999. The chapel was further refurbished and a new stained-glass window commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was unveiled by the Queen in November 2012. The Savoy Chapel uses the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the King James Bible for worship. Services are held each Sunday, to which members of the public are welcomed, excepting occasional special events. The chapel is open for visitors from Monday to Thursday. Music =Organ= The Chapel possesses a three-manual pipe organ, presented by Queen Elizabeth II, constructed to the specifications of the previous Master of the Music, William Cole and manufactured by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd. The organ casework was designed by Arthur Bedford Knapp-Fisher (1888-1965). It was dedicated on 27 October 1965 at a service attended by the Queen to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the Duchy of Lancaster. =Organists= The current Master of the Music is Philip Berg (since 1995); the sub-organist is Justin Luke (since 2002). Previous Masters of the Music include Henry Bromley Derry (from to 1954) and William Cole (from 1954 to 1994). =Choir= The choir is rooted in the English cathedral tradition, and consists of up to 21 boy choristers (aged ten upwards) and six professional gentlemen. The trebles are drawn exclusively from St Olave's Grammar School. Each year up to four prospective year-six pupils are selected to sing as trebles in the choir (after passing an academic and vocal test), with their place at St Olave's confirmed for the following year. Some choristers also join in year 7, during their first year at St Olave's. Chorister are expected to stay in the choir until their voices break and will attend rehearsals three times a week at school and once a week at the chapel itself. The boy trebles are known as Wakeham choristers in recognition of the 49 years of association that Michael Wakeham had with the Choir. The choir sings weekly Sunday morning services of either Eucharist or Matins, as well as those on Christmas and Easter Day. They also sing for various weddings, carol services and royal events throughout the year. London Choir School provided all the choristers to Savoy Chapel between 1915 and 1952. In popular culture The Savoy Chapel is mentioned in Evelyn Waugh's 1946 novel Brideshead Revisited where the venue for the marriage of Julia Flyte and Rex Mottram is discussed: \\"Oh, Charles, what a squalid wedding! The Savoy Chapel was the place where divorced couples got married in those days—a poky little place not at all what Rex had intended.

Teacher demands The teachers, counselors and nurses, represented by the Hayward Education Association (HEA), were upset over a 16% raise given to two district administrators in summer 2006. Negotiations broke down, with the HEA asking for an 8.08% retroactive raise initially, reaching 16% after 2 years, and the district offering a one time 5.5% raise (one source stating 7%) with possible subsequent increases of 1.6%, which was rejected. The district offered an additional one time 3% bonus, which was also rejected. The district had come out of receivership in 2005, and the administration was concerned about the district going back into the red. Teachers cited the administrator's raises as evidence the district undervalued teachers and might be hiding money that could be applied to teacher salaries. Strike The strike commenced on 5 April 2007, with only 45 of approximately 900 teachers showing up to work, with the balance appearing in picket lines.Nanette Asimov, \\"Hayward Teachers' strike jolts schools on its first day\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 6 April 2007 (accessed 15 September 2007) District administrator Dale Vigil initially dismissed the strike effects, but after a week of the strike, Vigil looked to file an injunction against the HEA, to force the teachers back into classrooms. Vigil was confronted at one point by angry strikers, who pounded on his car and pushed him. Impact on schools Only 4,100 of approximately 22,000 district students showed up for classes the first day of the strike. 29 schools were affected initially. Community and media response Farm Workers Union founder and activist Dolores Huerta showed up to support the striking teachers. Local TV and newspaper outlets covered the story. Conclusion The Hayward Teachers strike ended in a tentative agreement on 25 April 2007, when Vigil announced the settlement during a regular school board meeting. Teachers voted to pass the agreement detailing an 11% raise over the next two years, the following day, as classes resumed.

It has its origins in Chinese cuisine and is typically used in Cantonese and Fujian cuisines. Foods poached or braised in the master stock are generally referred to as lou mei. Composition Master stocks are typically begun by simmering meat and bones with typical Chinese ingredients, namely water, soy sauce, rock sugar and Shaoxing or rice wine. Other commonly added spices and flavourings include scallions, shallots, star anise, dried citrus peel, cassia bark, sand ginger, Sichuan pepper, garlic, ginger, and dried mushrooms. Use Once the base stock has been prepared, it is then used as a poaching or braising liquid for meat. Chicken is the most common meat that is cooked in a master stock, although squab, duck, quail, and pork are also often used.master stock@Everything2.com The defining characteristic of a master stock from other stocks is that after initial use, it is not discarded or turned into a soup or sauce. Instead, the broth is stored and reused in the future as a stock for more poachings. With each use, the poached meats and other ingredients absorb the stock's flavor while imparting their own back into the stock. In this way, over time, flavour accumulates in the stock, making it richer and more complex with each poaching, while subsequent poached meats absorb this flavor and likewise become more flavorful. In Non- Chinese cultures =Japan= Many oden restaurants keep their broths as master stocks, straining them nightly to maintain their lightness and clarity even as their flavors grow in complexity. =Thailand= The Bangkok restaurant Wattana Panich has kept the broth for its beef stew and beef noodle soup as a master stock for over forty years since moving to its current location. =United States= Between August 2014 and June 2015, Louro, a New York restaurant under the direction of chef David Santos, created dishes from a master stock. As part of the restaurant's social media presence, the stock was dubbed \\"Perpetual Stu\\" (a pun on \\"perpetual stew\\") and had its own Twitter account, highlighting new ingredients as it developed. Safety After use, if the master stock will not be immediately reused, it is usually boiled, skimmed, strained and cooled quickly to kill any microorganisms in the stock. The growth of microbes in the stock can potentially spoil the flavour of the stock or pose a health risk. The stock is then refrigerated or frozen until required. Refrigerated stocks may be kept for up to three days, while frozen stocks may be kept for up to a month. If the stock is to be kept longer it must be boiled before being returned to storage. In theory, a master stock could be sustained indefinitely if due care is taken to ensure it does not spoil. Otafuku, an oden restaurant in Japan, has kept its broth simmering since 1945 (an earlier batch was destroyed in WWII). There are claims of master stocks in China that are hundreds of years old, passed down through generations of cooks in this way.

He found his high in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska. Most sought wealth in gold; Birch found it in copper. Birch succeeded while others failed because he had assets that many prospectors lacked- a technical education, wealthy friends and remarkable tenacity.”Elizabeth A. Tower, Ghosts of Kennecott: The Story of Stephen Birch (Anchorage: Roundtree, 1990). Under his direction, the Kennecott Corporation became the largest copper producer in America and the second largest fabricator of copper. The Birch Mansion now serves as an administration building at Ramapo College of New Jersey  Early life  Birch was born in 1872 in New York. He was the second son out of six children. His father was a Union Army sergeant who died when Stephen was only ten years old. Three years after her husband's death, Stephen's mother moved her six children from Brooklyn to Mahwah, New Jersey to be near relatives. The young Birches quickly became friends with the children of their neighbors, Theodore Havemeyer, the vice-president of American Sugar Refining Company, and his wife Lillie. “Mrs. Havemeyer took a special interest in young Stephen providing financial assistance for his education at Trinity School, New York University, and Columbia School of Mines.”He received his M.E. from Columbia in 1898.  Career  “At the peak of the Klondike gold rush in 1898, Stephen announced that he wanted to go to Alaska rather than continue working with an engineering team that was surveying for the New York City subway system.” While many of his friends and relatives did not take him seriously, Mrs. Havemeyer offered to pay for his trip to Valdez, a newly established city named “the port for an All American route to Alaska's interior.” Because of Mrs. Havemeyer's kind gesture, Birch was able to travel to Valdez in the summer of 1898. He quickly made a name for himself in the mining industry and found his wealth in copper up in the Wrangell Mountains, the future site of Kennecott, Alaska. In Alaska, he examined a vastly rich copper deposit in the Copper River region. “He bought 21 claims and consolidated them in 1903 as the Alaska Copper and Coal Company. Equipment and supplies had to be hauled in by boat and horse team to the remote site at the base of the Kennicott Glacier.”National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum, \\"Mining Hall of Fame Inductees Database: Stephen Birch,\\" (accessed November 5, 2010). In need of proper resources, Birch formed an organization and sought out the help of Daniel Guggenheim and J.P Morgan. It became known as Kennecott Mining Company with offices in New York City and Birch as Managing Director. In 1915 Birch had full power and became President of the reorganized Kennecott Copper Company. “As resources were depleted at the Alaska Mines, which closed in 1938, Birch led the diversification into related products and alternate sources of copper in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Chile.” “Under his direction, Kennecott Copper experienced impressive growth. In 1915, the firm had 450 employees and $11 million in sales.” Harvard Business School, \\"20th Century American Leaders Database,\\" (accessed November 5, 2010). Stephen Birch resigned as President of the Kennecott Copper Company in 1933 and was replaced by E.T Stannard. “Birch continued as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee. In addition to his positions with Kennecott, Birch was president and director of the Alaska Steamship Company, chairman of the board of directors of the Braden Copper Company, and a director of the Alaska Development and Mineral Company, the Banker's Trust company of New York, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company, the Colorado and Southern Railway Company and the Northern Pacific Railway Company.” “At his death, Kennecott held nearly 15 percent of the world's known copper resources and was the largest copper producer in the United States.” Also, in the year of his death, “the company employed 28,872 employees and had sales of $177,250,036.” Kennecott Copper Company's original location in Alaska is now frequently referred to as a “ghost town” and is a tourist attraction. The buildings and mills are still standing but remain untouched, as the companies Alaska location closed down many years ago. Birch is positively renowned for his successful business ventures and has received various honors such as being inducted into the Mining Hall of Fame and being named among the 20th Century American Leaders by Harvard Business School.  Personal life  Birch married Mary C. Rand in Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 24, 1916. His best man was longtime friend, Henry O. Havemeyer.\\"Marriage Announcements,\\" The New York Times, June 24, 1916. He and his wife had two children whom they named Stephen and Mary. The Havemeyers sold their mansion and 730 acres of their estate to Birch and the York Room was added to the mansion for his daughter Mary and her husband in the 1920s. He lived in the mansion with his family until he died at age 68 in 1940. “Birch is buried at Ferncliff Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York. A stained glass window depicting Alaskan mountain scenery adorns this mausoleum.” After his death, his estate went to his son, Stephen. Stephen died in 1970 at the same time that the founders of Ramapo College were searching for land to build the school on. After visiting the land, it was decided that the Birch estate would be the new home to Ramapo College. “The final settlement on all of the Birch property was not concluded until 1972 for $3,133,000 or a little over $10,000 an acre.”Henry Bischoff, A History of Ramapo College of New Jersey: The First Quarter Century- 1971-1996 (Mahwah: Ramapo College of New Jersey,1997),22. The Birch mansion is now used as an administration building at Ramapo College of New Jersey. Birch was said to be a very private man. During his lifetime, he avoided publicity and seldom gave interviews or had his picture taken, though he did have his portrait painted in 1911 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury. But while he may have been mysterious, it is undeniable that he was admired. Katherine Wilson wrote for Copper Tints magazine that “Stephen Birch is personally little known. Today one of the financial powers in New York City, he shuns publicity and evades acclaim as a captain of industry. But to those who know him he is a man of deep and broad humanity, inspired in all that he does by a keen sense of his responsibility to the national welfare. With his intimates, he is a finely perceptive and generous friend, of an unshakable loyalty. Stephen Birch is an outstanding American.”  Philanthropy  “In 1938 he founded the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation, Inc. to support health service, hospitals and civic organizations. It provided major funding for the Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum at the University of California, San Diego.” Even though 2010 marks the 70th anniversary of his death, his legacy still lives on through this foundation, which recently “made a $10 million contribution to Sharp HealthCare Foundation for Transforming Health Care in San Diego: the Campaign for Sharp Healthcare, the capital campaign launched in 2003 to raise funds for a new health care facility at Sharp Memorial Hospital. In recognition of this generous gift, Sharp will name the new facility the Stephen Birch Healthcare Center at Sharp Memorial Hospital. The Birch contribution is the largest in Sharp's history and brings the total that the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation has donated to Sharp to more than $16 million.”\\"Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation Donates $10 Million to Sharp Healthcare Foundation,\\" (accessed November 5th, 2010).

It is close to the M1 and M50, motorways and Dublin Airport, via the N32. There are Dublin Bus services (27, 42, 43 and 15) on the Malahide Road, and Clongriffin DART station is 15-20 minutes walk away.

Adjacent housing developments in Balgriffin include Castlemoyne and St. Samson's Court, both to the north. Belmayne lies in the administrative area of Dublin City Council.  History  The development was begun by Stanley Holdings in 2006, with construction by LM Developments. Originally a civic centre was promised, agreed between Dublin City Council and developers, on a specified block of land. Facilities, including a library, were included, but this proposal was later repudiated by the developers on economic grounds, and the lands transferred from Dublin City Council to a special government agency.

Early life Pollack is the eldest of three children born to Enrique A. Pollack-Diehl and Dolores \\"Loly\\" Aguilar-Perna, both from very prestigious families. His mother is closely related to Santiago Rey Perna, signatory of the Cuban Constitution of 1940, and his father is related to the Rothschild banking family as well as being the nephew of the Duchess of Seville, María Luisa de la Torre y Bassave. Her heirs and the Pollacks are related to the current King of Spain, Juan Carlos de Borbon. He attended Pater Noster Preparatory School in Los Angeles, CA, University High School in West Los Angeles, CA, Miami Dade Community College, and Florida International University. He is also the firstborn great-grandson of Mark A. Pollack (1874–1946), the American-born patriarch of a wealthy Cuban tobacco dynasty and owner of the famous \\"La Mansion\\", a neo-classical mansion in the Cubanacan Section (aka Country Club section) of Havana built in 1930 by the Cuban architect, Leonardo Morales y Pedroso (1887–1965). Editions: , (German, French, English), (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese) Politics and Recent Events Pollack often appears on television shows due to his anti-Castro stance. On April 16, 2004, the Cuban government officially protested to the United Nations about Pollack's actions in Geneva, after he placed posters protesting human rights violations in Cuba next to Communist Cuban posters on display in the main hall of the Human Rights Section of the United Nations Building in Geneva. Pollack was a congressional aide to Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from 1993–2006. He has also edited and produced two films, \\"Cuba Before Castro\\" and \\"The elegance that was Cuba before the Revolution\\". Both films have received hundreds of thousands of hits on YouTube and show a very different Cuba in the rare and vintage footage.

He arrived in the Straits Settlements and the Crown Colony of Singapore from England. Dunman was the first Commissioner of Police in Singapore, Straits Settlements from 1856 to 1871. History Born in the United Kingdom in 1815, Dunman came to Singapore in 1840 as an assistant in the merchant firm Dyce & Co. He entered the police force in 1843. He was made Superintendent of Police in 1851, and Commissioner of Police in 1856. During his time heading the police force, Dunman was known for being on good terms with the people of various classes and communities within Singapore, and thus able to gain assistance and first-hand information regarding what was happening in the city. He was respected by leaders of the European community, and supported by influential Muslim Malays leaders, Straits Chinese leaders and the local Indian community. During this time, Singapore was flooded with new immigrants who often got to the then British Crown Colony though illegal means from non-British controlled part of Malaysia such as Kuala Lumpur, and also snuck in from hidden cabins in ships from India and Southeast Asia, often hiding illegal and contraband items such as drugs especially opium for sale in Singapore then with the colonial British government profiting off colonial slaves called \\"coolies\\" making them work for free by addicting them and selling them high-priced opium in opium dens. Because of this liberalization of the vice trades, many opium merchants saw Singapore as a seaport of vices where they could become rich overnight or hide their illegal gains. As a result, there were many secret societies known as \\"Triads\\". In Chinese, the underworld of criminal activity is known as \\"Black Society\\". Thomas Dunman witnessed Singapore as a colonial hotbed of crime, including sex trafficking, murders over human trafficking debt bills, known in Singapore as the slave trade of the Chinese coolies, which the Chinese referred to under the euphemism of \\"selling piglets\\" (Chinese: Mai Zhuzai). Criminals kidnapped the most beautiful virgin girls by raiding the rural towns and cities of Southern China's coastline, abducted these girls, and sold them to expensive high-class brothels in Singapore previously tolerated by the British. As a result, many Chinese girls died of sex diseases, some were drowned during their voyage to Singapore, still many others committed suicide or were murdered by criminals in secret societies, when they could not repay their \\"slave debt\\" and the high interest piled on them when the colonial banking industry headed south. At one point, almost all the women in Singapore died out, and prostitutes had to be imported from Macau, then a Dutch province, to supply more sex slaves to the colony so the British port could continue to collect high rents and sell land to shady criminals who hoarded tenancies and land for vices in the sex trade, the slave trade and illegal \\"ventures\\" in gambling and racketeering. Thomas Dunman was assigned to enforce the British colonial laws that have gone for decades ignored. He established a stricter stance against criminals \\"for their own good\\". He improved the efficiency and training of the police force. Among the measures he introduced were improved pay and working hours for policemen, setting up training programmes and night classes for members of the force, and creating a pension scheme for retired policemen. Morale in the force improved and the crime rate in Singapore decreased under his leadership.. A wooden plaque commemorating Thomas Dunman at Orchard Road Presbyterian Church Dunman was the founding president of The Tanglin Club in 1865. Dunman was also one of the founding members of Orchard Road Presbyterian Church in Singapore. Many students and elite alumni of the school are also affiliated with this church, although the majority at Dunman High School are freethinkers or Buddhists, Taoists and Confucianists, which Islam is a more common religion in Dunman Secondary School. Later life and death Dunman retired from the police force in 1871, and spent the next few years on his coconut plantation, Grove Estate (in what is now the Mountbatten area of Katong). He returned to England in 1875, and died in Bournemouth, England in 1887. Legacy Dunman's Green, the park in Singapore was named after him before its eventual renaming to Hong Lim Green in 1876 and to Hong Lim Park in 1960 respectively. Along with Dunman Road and Dunman Lane in the Katong area of Singapore, Dunman High School and Dunman Secondary School are also named after Thomas Dunman.

It was located in the Frontier Town section of the park adjacent to the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad near Mean Streak. It was demolished in 2005 and replaced by Maverick. Ride experience The double drop of White Water Landing at night As part of the Frontier Town area of the park, White Water Landing embraced an Appalachian river ride theme. The revolving station featured boats alongside a rustic warehouse before they turned along the edge of a lagoon and approached the ride's first lift — a conveyor that gently elevated the canoes through a mine shaft and splashed them into a faster section of river. A few quick turns along the rapids and the canoes approached the second lift, which raised riders to the treetops at a height of 50 feet. Canoes alternated drop chutes, then skimmed the hydro- jump before floating alongside the lagoon as they returned to the station. Incident On July 20, 2002, two boats got jammed together at the bottom of the hill. When the next boat came down the hill, it collided with another boat. All six people only suffered minor injuries and were transported to a local hospital where they were shortly released. The ride reopened the next day after an investigation. Demolition At the end of the 2005 season, it was announced that White Water Landing would be closing to make room for another attraction. The attraction was a secret until September 7, 2006 when the park released information on the 21 million dollar Maverick. Its station and queue is still intact, and used for Maverick. Part of the station's roof still has the faded White Water Landing logo on it. There is still a concrete section of the track from White Water Landing located by the queue, before entering the final queue area, or White Water Landing's former loading platform. The track segment is used as a small stream. The ride was similar to the defunct Kenton's Cove Keelboat Canal at Kings Island.

And the time of trouble, conquest of the nations, and events connected with the day of wrath, have only ample time, during the balance of this forty years, for their fulfillment.\\" The Three Worlds, p. 189. 1874 was considered the end of 6,000 years of human history and the beginning of judgment by Christ.In 1935, the idea that the 6,000 years ran out in 1874 was moved forward 100 years. . A 1917 Watch Tower Society publication predicted that in 1918, God would begin to destroy churches and millions of their members.Studies in the Scriptures, Vol. 7, 1917, p. 485, \\"In the year 1918, when God destroys the churches wholesale and the church members by the millions, it shall be that any that escape shall come to the works of Pastor Russell.\\" J.F. Rutherford, who succeeded Russell as president of the Watch Tower Society, predicted that the Millennium would begin in 1925, and that biblical figures such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David would be resurrected as \\"princes\\". The Watch Tower Society bought property and built a house, Beth Sarim, in California for their return.The Watchtower, May 15, 1922; Sep. 1, 1922; Apr. 1, 1923; Millions Now Living Will Never Die, 1925, p. 110 From 1966, statements in Jehovah's Witness publications raised strong expectations that Armageddon could arrive in 1975. In 1974 Witnesses were commended for selling their homes and property to \\"finish out the rest of their days in this old system\\" in full-time preaching.Kingdom Ministry, Watch Tower Society, May 1974, page 3. In 1976 The Watchtower advised those who had been \\"disappointed\\" by unfulfilled expectations for 1975 to adjust their viewpoint because that understanding was \\"based on wrong premises\\".\\"A Solid Basis for Confidence\\", Watchtower, July 15, 1976, page 441. Four years later, the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding 1975.The Watchtower, March 15, 1980, p.17 \\"With the appearance of the book Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, ... considerable expectation was aroused regarding the year 1975. ... there were other statements published that implied that such realization of hopes by that year was more of a probability than a mere possibility. It is to be regretted that these latter statements apparently overshadowed the cautionary ones and contributed to a buildup of the expectation already initiated. ... persons having to do with the publication of the information ... contributed to the buildup of hopes centered on that date.\\"  Lutheran Church  Michael Stiefel predicted the end of the world in 1533 and lost his living as minister in consequence. He was found another by Philip Melanchthon.Thorndike, pp. 392-3. *Lynn Thorndike, in a chapter \\"The Circle of Melanchthon\\" in his multi-volume History of Magic and Experimental Science. It appears as Chapter XVII in what Google Books has as Part 9, but that is from a paperback edition not respecting the original structure of 8 volumes. One later writer noted, \\"In all of [ Martin Luther's ] work there was a sense of urgency for the time was short... the world was heading for Armageddon in the war with the Turk.\\"Luther's View of Church History, John M. Headley, Yale University Press, 1963, pp 13,14 Even after Luther's death in 1546, Lutheran leaders kept up the claim of the nearness of the end. About the year 1584, a zealous Lutheran named Adam Nachenmoser wrote the large volume '[Prognosticum Theologicum]' in which he predicted: \\"In 1590 the Gospel would be preached to all nations and a wonderful unity would be achieved. The last days would then be close at hand.\\" Nachenmoser offered numerous conjectures about the date; 1635 seemed most likely.Prophecy and Gnosis — Apocalypticism in the Wake of the Lutheran Protestant Reformation, Robin Bruce Barnes, p 64 The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod issued a study in 1989 refuting any end times claim, declaring that \\"repeatedly taught by Jesus and the apostles is the truth that the exact hour of Christ's coming remains hidden in the secret counsels of God (Matt. 24:36).\\"The \\"End Times\\": A Study on Eschatology and Millennialism. A Report of the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. September 1989 Latter Day Saints Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon faith, made several dozen prophecies during his lifetime, many of which are recorded in the sacred texts of the Mormon faith. The prophecies included predictions of the Civil War, the coming of Jesus, and several less significant predictions. Church apologists cite prophecies that they claim came true, and church critics cite prophecies that they claim did not come true.  Mennonites  Russian Mennonite minister Claas Epp, Jr. predicted that Christ would return on March 8, 1889, and, when that date passed uneventfully, 1891.Bartsch, Franz and Richard D. Thiessen.

Montanists Montanus, who founded the Montanist movement in 156 AD, predicted that Jesus would return during the lifetime of the group's founding members.  Presbyterian Church  Thomas Brightman, who lived from 1562 to 1607, has been called \\"one of the fathers of Presbyterianism in England.\\" He predicted that \\"between 1650 and 1695 [we] would see the conversion of the many Jews and a revival of their nation in Palestine...the destruction of the Papacy...the marriage of the Lamb and his wife.\\"A Great Expectation — Eschatological Thought in English Protestantism to 1660 by Bryan W. Ball and E.J. Brill, page 117 Christopher Love who lived from 1618–1651 was a bright graduate of Oxford and a strong Presbyterian. Love predicted that: (1) Babylon would fall in 1758 (2) God's anger against the wicked would be demonstrated in 1759 and (3) in 1763 there would occur a great earthquake all over the world.The Logic of Millennial Thought by James West Davidson, page 200 Roman Catholic Church When in 1525 Martin Luther, an ex-monk, married Katharina von Bora, an ex-nun, his enemies said that their offspring would fulfill an old tradition that the Antichrist would be the son of such a union. The Catholic scholar and theologian Erasmus remarked that the tradition could apply to thousands of such children.Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, vol. 7, chapter 5 In 1771 Bishop Charles Walmesley published, under the nom de plume of \\"Signor Pastorini\\",\\"Signior\\" is the spelling used in the book (see pages iii and following of the third edition). his \\"General History of the Christian Church from Her Birth to Her Final Triumphant State in Heaven Chiefly Deduced from the Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist\\". In it he attributed to what he called the fifth age of the Church a duration of 300 years, beginning with the Protestant Reformation in 1520 or 1525. This was widely interpreted as predicting the downfall of Protestantism by 1825. In fact, just four years later, the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 brought to a culmination the process of Catholic Emancipation throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

It has been described as San Diego's \\"leading all-ages venue for punk and alternative-rock concerts.\\" It is located at 3350 Sports Arena Blvd. History SOMA was originally opened in the early 1990s by Len Paul at an old warehouse in downtown San Diego on 555 Union Street, just south of Market Street and was originally a slaughterhouse – hence the name “SOuth of MArket.\\" At that time, the venue was mostly known as a dance club, but eventually made the transition to hosting live music. One unique feature of the club was that, in addition to the main concert hall located on the ground floor, it had a basement area, known as \\"The Dungeon\\" (Which was the actual freezer room for the slaughterhouse)that held approximately 100 people. It was in the dungeon that many local San Diego bands got their first opportunity to play at the club. If bands could bring in a large enough following, they would be given the opportunity to play upstairs on the main stage, in support of more popular local acts or nationally touring acts. At this downtown location some well-known San Diego bands such as Rocket from the Crypt, Blink-182, Unwritten Law, Stone Temple Pilots, and Buck-O-Nine built a strong local following before moving on to tour nationally in the mid-1990s. In 1994, SOMA moved to a former warehouse on Metro Street, just south of the University of San Diego. Major artists such as Faith No More, Fugazi, Pavement, Radiohead, The Ramones, The Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer performed here, as well as many local bands. The venue closed in 1999. In 2002, Paul reopened SOMA at its current home, a former multiplex movie theater that was renovated into a concert venue. Walls dividing individual theaters were torn down to create one large area for the main stage. It can hold up to 2,700 occupants in its main hall, and the side stage can accommodate 500+. Many of the theater's old production offices have been turned into dressing rooms for the bands which overlook the audience. There is a snack bar and merchandise area in the lobby. On September 22, 2016, SOMA served beer in the side-stage room for a show by the band Descendents. This marked the first time in the venue's history that alcohol had been served. Notable performances In 2004, Switchfoot performed a sold-out show that was later released as a DVD titled Live in San Diego. Dave Matthews Band's performance at Soma in 1995, broadcast live on radio, was later released as part of their Live Trax series. On 16 June 2018, As I Lay Dying performed for the first time as a band since lead singer, Tim Lambesis was released from prison in late 2016. According to Tim, the concert was about gratitude for the opportunity to play as a band again and gratitude for fans.

The settlement was based on a master plan vision from major developer Gannon Homes, with significant investment in transport infrastructure and also community and recreational amenities. Development slowed during the downturn in the economy, although activity renewed in recent years, with planning permission secured for a hotel and range of additional homes including a 16-storey apartment block with residential lounges and roof gardens..  Name  The name Clongriffin is a modern invention, a concatenation of \\"clon\\", the anglicisation of cluain (the Irish language word for meadow), and griffin. A griffin, griffon, or gryphon (the Irish of which is ghrífín) is a mythical beast and may be an element in the name of the adjacent district, Balgriffin. Allegedly, architect David Wright gave Clongriffin its name while working on its development.Sunday Independent LIFE Magazine, 2009-03-01, \\"Blame it all on the Lego\\"  Location  Clongriffin is inland from Baldoyle Bay and northeast of Dublin city centre, in northern Donaghmede, at the northern edge of Dublin's suburbs, in the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council. The development lies within the townland of Grange, in the civil parish of Baldoyle, from which Donaghmede was largely formed. Clongriffin is in the Dublin Postal District Dublin 13, and in the constituency of Dublin Bay North, having been previously in Dublin North-East.  History and composition  = Early history = The lands of Baldoyle, on which Clongriffin, and most of Donaghmede as a whole, are situated, formed part of a large tract of high mediaeval monastic grange farmland, sometimes called the \\"Grange of Baldoyle.\\" A reminder of this is the small church now called \\"Grange Abbey\\" to the south of Clongriffin. In 1166, the lands were assigned to All Saints Priory, on whose site Trinity College Dublin was later built, by Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster. Grange Abbey, Baldoyle by Brian Mac Giolla Phadraigh. Dublin Historical Record @ 1965 In 1369, parliament was held in the small church, called by Sir William de Windsor.An article on Fingal district, by William C. Stubbs, M.A., in the Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries for 1897; Dalton's History of the County Dublin; Archdall's Monasticon Hibernicum (Moran's). In the late 1530s, at the beginning of the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the entire settlement was invaded and seized at the behest of King Henry VIII of England, who in 1538 bestowed it on the Corporation of Dublin. = Modern history = Until 2003, most of the lands on which Clongriffin is being built were farmland. In July of the same year Dublin City Council granted planning permission for a mixed-use development to be called \\"Clongriffin at Grange Road, Donaghmede\\" now forming part of the Northern Fringe Development (from Clongriffin to Belmayne). Management plans were completed in 2004 and the development, comprising houses and apartments, started in 2005 and was planned to have educational, retail and service facilities, including a multi-screen cinema. Clongriffin was part of the Northern Fringe Development (along with Belmayne in Balgriffin and estates on the former Baldoyle Racecourse and in northern Coolock) and was approved by the local authorities to provide new accommodation for Dublin on green belt land, and was to complete the development of north Donaghmede. Clongriffin's early component developments comprised Grange Lodge, Beau Park, Station Point and Marrsfield. Clongriffin Town Centre Nearby, but across the main Dongaghmede-Portmarnock road, was the Priory Hall development. For further history and general notes, see also the Donaghmede and Baldoyle articles. = Provision of services = No area of the estate has yet been taken in charge by Dublin City Council and the Council maintains that it has made no commitment in this respect. Nevertheless, the Council, working with a private management company, perform refuse collection. However, the local community have been told that Irish Rail requested that Dublin City Council take Main Street in charge before the opening of the railway station.North Area Assistant Manager at the Safer Belmayne/Clongriffin Forum, Shop Unit 60, Main St. Clongriffin, 19 May 2009. = Pyrite settlement and remediation = In early 2008, it was alleged that the mineral pyrite was found in the stone hardcore used in the construction of some homes in various housing estates in north Dublin, including Beaupark in Clongriffin.Report on presence of pyrite in Beaupark, Clongriffin to DCC North Central Area Committee Pyrite remediation of affected ground level dwellings is underwayThe Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 after a settlement was reached in March 2011 in a Commercial Court case.

As a result, some areas of Clongriffin remained enclosed by construction hoarding for years. In the meantime, Dublin City Council formulated a Local Area Plan for Clongriffin and Belmayne (the North Fringe)North Fringe Local Area Plan as part of the Dublin City Development Plan 2011–2017,Dublin City Development Plan 2011-2017 and provision continued in the new City Development Plan. The developer stayed engaged with the community during the hiatus. In 2017, development resumed, and Clongriffin is now undergoing a second phase of development to enhance amenities and construct further housing.  Transport and access  = Road = Clongriffin is reached by Hole in the Wall Road from its junction with Grange Road and the N32 road, the latter in turn connecting to Malahide Road, and the M1 and M50 motorways.

The 54 acre (26 hectare) park includes some natural woodland. There is a peripheral running/cycling track, six playing pitches and six fitness stations. There are also a promenade, concert amphitheatre, and picnic areas with outdoor chess or draughts boards, two playgrounds and a skate park. = Education = Clongriffin has a crèche called The Learning Circle. While the development has no schools of its own, two new primary schools lie to the west of Clongriffin in the Belmayne development in Balgriffin, another constituent housing estate of the North Fringe. One of them, St. Francis of Assisi school, is under the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church and the other is an Educate Together (multi-denominational and co-educational) school.

The mosque would cater for up to 3,000 people. The latest report from Gannon Homes says that the construction of the mosque will not go ahead due to lack of funding and the land will be used for residential development as originally planned.http://www.thejournal.ie/irelands-largest-mosque- clongriffin-1060199-Aug2013/http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mosque- for-3000-gets-goahead-in-capital-29119030.htmlhttp://www.tommybroughan.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/03/TOMMY_BROUGHAN_TD_ONLINE_VOL_23_No_1.pdf On 8 July 2016 Dublin City Council gave planning permission for a housing development marketed as 'Belltree' under the planning application number 2601/16.

History  The school was founded in 1906 in Pleasantville, New Jersey, by Dr. Joseph M. Weidberg, a psychologist. Weidberg was concerned that many students were falling through the cracks of traditional education systems and therefore were not living up to their potential due to academic learning differences. In founding the Academy, Weidberg looked to the great educators of the past: the lessons of John Dewey and Socrates were central to the creation of the Oxford Method. The Oxford Method was also based heavily on the tutorial system of Oxford University: Weidberg believed that a unique curriculum personally designed for each student would allow academic and social success. By utilizing the Socratic method of question-and-answer education, these students were observed to display remarkable talent. In 1941, school enrollment was limited to a maximum of 15 students but has since grown to 48 students. In 1947 Dr. Edward R. Knight was selected to succeed Dr. Weidberg as Headmaster followed by Frank Effinger in 1973, Dr. Jonathan A. Woodhall in 1975, and Philip H. Davis in 1983. In 2010, Philip B.

Haney also evaluates the impact of inter- service rivalries and potential overlap created when Delta Force was formed, including the challenges of dealing with the Central Intelligence Agency. Central to the book is Haney's participation in Delta Force's first operation – the aborted 1980 Operation Eagle Claw to Iran to free American hostages. Inside Delta Force formed the inspiration for the CBS television series The Unit, in which Haney was involved as a writer, producer, and technical advisor. Criticism Since the publication of Inside Delta Force in 2002 and Haney's subsequent success with The Unit television show, three of his former Delta colleagues accused him of embellishing his accomplishments within the unit and fabricating several of the events depicted. Some of the criticism directed at Haney has focused on his stating that he was a \\"founding member\\" of Delta Force. Former operators acknowledge only one \\"founder,\\" Colonel Charlie Beckwith, who helped establish the unit and was its first commanding officer. Haney used the term \\"founding member\\" to indicate that he was among the first operators assigned to the 1SFOD-D. One operator, Logan Fitch, who first wrote publicly of the Eagle Claw mission for Penthouse Magazine in 1984 and was highly critical of Beckwith, called Haney a \\"crass opportunist\\" for capitalizing on his past service for personal gain. Despite the falling-out between Haney and some former Delta members, Haney stands behind the accuracy of his book. Another original member criticized Haney for revealing too much about Delta Force's training, tactics and early missions. A U.S. Army historian has questioned if this is really the case, as the information in Haney's book was current in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and Delta Force has surely changed its procedures since then. Moreover, operational information by Delta veterans had been made public before, including in Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden's book about the Battle of Mogadishu, in which Delta operators participated, and most notably in Beckwith's own book on the formation and training of the unit.

History Saint Austremonius, as depicted on the enamelled reliquary of Saint Calmin A monastery was founded here in either 533 or 680 by Saint Calminius (Saint Calmin) and his wife, Saint Namadia. Calminius is said to have given the new monastery relics of Saint Peter, to whom the foundation was dedicated, and of Saint Caprasius of Agen, brought from Agen, of which there has long been no trace. From \\"King Pepin\\", either Pepin the Short in 764 or Pepin II of Aquitaine in 848, the monastery received the relics of Saint Austremonius, first bishop of Clermont and responsible for the evangelisation of the Auvergne; the abbey passed under royal protection. These have survived until today and are preserved in a painted wooden casket of the sixteenth century. The chasse reliquary of Calminius, or Saint Calmin, is one of the outstanding masterpieces of Limoges enamel. In 1095 Pope Urban II launched the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont and at the same time affiliated Mozac to the Cluniac Order; nevertheless, Mozac was able to retain some of its independence, as it remained an abbey rather than becoming a dependent priory, as were most of Cluny's affiliated houses. The abbey was rebuilt in the early twelfth century. The buildings were severely damaged and largely destroyed in a series of earthquakes between 1477 and 1490, and among the few remains of the Romanesque architecture that have survived are carved Romanesque capitals (illustration) that were particularly noted by Prosper Mérimée in the first assessment of medieval monuments in France: \\"What renders the church of Mozat [sic] particularly interesting are its capitals, which, for the merit of their execution, may be compared to the best of Brioude\\".\\"Ce qui rend l'église de Mozat particulièrement intéressante, ce sont ses chapiteaux qui, pour le mérite de l'exécution, peuvent se comparer aux meilleurs de Brioude.\\" Prosper Mérimée (1837) The rebuilding was carried out in the Gothic style, using the harder Volvic stone instead of the limestone of the earlier constructions. From 1516 Mozac was ruled by commendatory abbots who were not in residence. In 1790 the abbey was dissolved in the French Revolution. The abbey church survives as the parish church of Mozac. Buildings and contents Romanesque capitals with figurative carvings of high quality survive in some quantity, and the church still contains some elements of Romanesque architecture. The relics of Saint Austremonius are still preserved here, as are those of the founder Saint Calminius, in a chasse reliquary shrine (illustrations of details) which is the largest extant reliquary in mediaeval Limoges enamel in the world.

He was a lawyer, businessman, politician, and leader in the Jewish community, founding Mel's Drive-In and serving as president of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.  Early life and education  Dobbs was born in 1918 in Roselle, New Jersey, to George Dobbs and Mary Dobbs (née Wolin), both Russian Jews who had emigrated to the United States in the early twentieth century. He attended Roselle's Jefferson High School for one year before his family moved to San Diego in 1934, in search of work for Dobbs' father George, who was a carpenter. Dobbs finished high school at San Diego High School and then attended San Diego State College for two years, becoming the first member of his family to attend college. In 1939, the Dobbs family moved once more to San Francisco, where George Dobbs hoped to find work at the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island. Despite not having graduated from college, Harold Dobbs enrolled at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, which at the time did not require its students to have college degrees. Dobbs graduated from Hastings and passed the California Bar Examination in 1942. Asthma kept Dobbs out of the military during World War II, but he worked as a clerk at his local Selective Service office during the war.  Career  Dobbs had a long and distinguished career that included multiple professions. Time Magazine recognized his potential early when they recognized Dobbs as one of the \\"100 Young Leaders of Tomorrow\\" in 1952. = Law = After graduating law school in 1942, Dobbs was hired by the law firm Lillick, Geary, Olson, Adams, & Charles, becoming the firm's first Jewish lawyer and first Hastings graduate. He remained there until 1956, when he left to establish his own firm with William Ferdon, called Dobbs & Ferdon. After the death of Ferdon, the firm became Dobbs & Doty, then Dobbs & Nielsen, and eventually Dobbs, Berger, Molinari, Vannelli, Nadel & Links. Dobbs' firm specialized in political law and was one of the first to counsel political candidates on compliance with new campaign finance regulations. = Business = Throughout his five decades practicing law, Dobbs was also an entrepreneur and businessman. In 1947, Dobbs and Mel Weiss co-founded Mel's Drive-In –– the first drive-in restaurant in San Francisco –– at 140 South Van Ness Avenue. After their initial success, Dobbs and Weiss built Mel's into a successful chain with locations across Northern California. Mel's became an icon of mid-century American culture when it was memorialized in George Lucas's 1973 film American Graffiti, which highlighted the cruising and rock and roll cultures of the early 1960s. Dobbs also owned several bowling alleys throughout the Bay Area and a chain of movie theaters in Hong Kong, and he was the founder of two additional restaurant chains called \\"King's\\" and \\"The Red Roof.\\" = Politics = Dobbs served for 12 years on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, first winning election in 1951 at age 32. He was re-elected to two additional four-year terms in 1955 and 1959, serving as President of the Board during his third term. A close political ally of Mayor George Christopher, Dobbs served as Acting Mayor on several occasions during Christopher's absences from the city. Dobbs ran for mayor himself three times, in 1963, 1967, and 1971. Each time, he placed second in a three-way contest: * In 1963, Dobbs won 92,627 votes (38.47%) against Congressman Jack Shelley's 120,560 (50.07%) and Edward Mancuso's 27,581 (11.46%). Shelley was elected mayor. * In 1967, Dobbs won 90,482 votes (37.37%) against Joe Alioto's 106,814 (44.11%) and Jack Morrison's 40,206 (16.61%). Alioto was elected mayor. * In 1971, Dobbs won 68,637 votes (27.66%) against Mayor Alioto's 95,744 (38.59%) and Dianne Feinstein's 53,911 (21.73%). Alioto was re-elected to a second term. In an editorial endorsing Dobbs in 1963, the San Francisco Chronicle said he \\"knows how to use the gifts of persistence and quiet persuasion (and) has the vigor of mind and body San Francisco needs in the years ahead.\\" = Community leadership = At various times throughout his long career, Dobbs served as president of the Concordia- Argonaut Club, Hastings College of the Law, the Jewish Home for the Aged, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, the Lake Merced Golf & Country Club, Lighthouse for the Blind, the Nob Hill Association, the S.F. Zoological Society, Saints and Sinners, Sinai Memorial Chapel, and the YMCA. He also served on the boards of the Florence Crittendon Home for Unwed Mothers, the Jewish Community Federation, Mount Zion Hospital, the Northern California Jewish Bulletin, the San Francisco Boy's Club, and St. Elizabeth's Infant Shelter. He was particularly devoted to Hastings, serving on its board of directors for more than 20 years and as its president for a half dozen. His leadership helped to preserve Hastings' autonomy when it was threatened. Dobbs was named the Hastings College of the Law Alumnus of the Year in 1983, and the atrium in the college's main building is named in his honor.  Personal life  Dobbs married Annette Dobbs (née Lehrer) in 1941. Annette was an important civic leader in her own right, serving on the boards of numerous San Francisco organizations, including as president of San Francisco's Jewish Community Federation. They remained married for 53 years, until Harold's death. Harold and Annette had five children together: Stephen, Marilyn, Gregory, Rusty, and Cathy. Dobbs was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987 and died in 1994, at the age of 75.

Initially the spot was occupied by a small village called Babice, with an eponymous fort located in its centre. In early 1920s the area surrounding the fort was bought by the Polish state and in 1922 the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs started the construction of the Transatlantic Radio Station. As the radio station did not occupy the entire terrain, in 1932 minister Ignacy Boerner ordered a construction of a housing area to accommodate the workers of the radio station, as well as other people working in communications industry in the nearby city of Warsaw. The settlement grew and in 1936 it was named after its founder. After the World War II the area was taken over by the Polish Army who constructed there the Babice Airfield that was to replace the destroyed Bielany Airfield, and a large university complex of the Military Technical Academy.

Early life Born in Belmont, Trinidad and Tobago, the son of a trade union organizer, Roach arrived in Canada in 1955 as an aspiring priest to study at the University of Saskatchewan. Roach was politicized by the civil rights movement, stating: \\"after the '50s, I started being more political... This was the spirit of the times. I'm really from the civil-rights era.\\" He then studied law at the University of Toronto and was called to the bar in 1963. Activism and law Roach worked as a staff lawyer for the city of Toronto in the 1960s, while also participating and organizing marches and demonstrations for equal rights. He opened his own law practice in 1968, eventually becoming the firm of Roach and Schwartz Associates. Among his clients were Black Panthers attempting to seek refuge in Canada from prosecution in the United States and other asylum seekers. He also represented domestic workers being deported in the 1970s. He further became a vocal critic of the police, accusing them of racism.Kopun, Francine; Toronto Star: He says nay to the Queen; May 11, 2007 In 1999, Roach went to Rwanda to represent Hutu journalist Mathieu Ngirumpatse against human rights abuse charges before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.Now Magazine: Charles Roach goes to Rwanda; March 11, 1999 Through his work, Roach became a leading figure in Toronto's Black community. He was a founder of the Caribana festival, serving as its first chair. Roach further established the Movement of Minority Electors in 1978 to encourage non-caucasians to enter electoral politics and was a founding member of the Black Action Defence Committee. Republican advocacy Roach was a member of the executive committee of Citizens for a Canadian Republic (CCR) and commented publicly on his desire to end the Canadian monarchy. He was a permanent resident of Canada, not obtaining Canadian citizenship because of his refusal to swear the Oath of Citizenship, as it contains a promise to bear allegiance to the Canadian monarch. Roach swore allegiance to the Queen of Canada twice before: once as a reservist in the 1950s, and again when he was called to the Bar.Brean, Joseph; National Post: Immigrant takes oath of allegiance to court; May 9, 2007 In 1992, Roach argued in the Federal Court of Canada that the Canadian oath for new citizens, which includes a statement of allegiance to the Canadian monarch, was a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The court ruled against his motion to have the requirement to take the oath struck down and his appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed. In 2007, Roach again sued, this time as a class action. On May 17, 2007, Justice Edward Belobaba of the Ontario Superior Court ruled that Roach could proceed with the lawsuit, dismissing a Crown motion to have the action quashed as frivolous and vexatious.CBC News: Lawyer allowed to challenge citizenship oath; May 18, 2007Gombu, Phinjo; Toronto Star: Lawyer cleared to challenge loyalty oath to the Queen; May 18, 2007 On February 19, 2008, the appeal by the federal government was dismissed by judges at the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the case went before the Ontario Superior Court.Roach v. Canada, 2008 ONCA 124 (CanLII) Roach's case was dismissed by the court in January, 2009. Roach again went to the courts in 2012 with another class action suit to argue the oath of allegiance to the sovereign is unconstitutional. On June 18, the Ontario Superior Court permitted the case's continuance. The case was dismissed in September, 2013. Death Roach died from malignant brain cancer in October 2012 in Toronto.

This is important because once this happens a country moves to a different stage in the demographic transition model. Phenomenon Even in the face of extreme measures aimed at lowering reproductive rates, the population will continue to grow due to a large proportion of its population entering its reproductive years. For example, when China first introduced its one-child policy, population growth continued regardless. Even though the number of children born reduced dramatically, the sheer number of maturing youth was significant. In 1979 when the one-child policy entered into force, the number of people becoming adults was based on the number of births around the 1950s, not 1979. As a result, the Chinese population maintained the same momentum of increase as for the past 20 years. It is only now that the Chinese population has reached a somewhat stabilized population growth.

His occupation outside football was as a farmer.\\"Farmer Pat\\", in Cockfield, County Durham: Darlington And Stockton Times online. Early years He originated from Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, and had the same name as his father, Patrick Partridge, MBE. Career He first became a referee in 1953, with the Durham County FA. During his period of compulsory National Service (1954–1956), he registered as an Army referee; during a military posting to Hong Kong, he was allowed to officiate in that country's Third and Fourth Divisions. Partridge returned to England and, for a short time from 1957, was appointed to referee games in the now-defunct North Eastern League. Following its disbandment in 1958, he moved to the Northern League to develop his career further. He was accepted as a Football League linesman for the 1965-66 season, and progressed to become a Football League referee in the following year. In his 1979 co-authored biography with John Gibson, he recalled his first ever top-class Football League match as man-in- the-middle, when he awarded three penalty kicks in the game between Manchester City and Leicester City at Maine Road in March 1967, which Leicester won 3-1. He also recounts a chain of events which led to a major change in the International Laws of Association Football. On 13 May 1967, Stoke City visited Old Trafford to play Manchester United, just after United had been confirmed as the old Division One champions. Paddy Crerand of United had an altercation with Peter Dobing of Stoke. Unknown to Partridge, TV cameras picked up Crerand's action of spitting over his shoulder at Tony Allen, another Stoke player. Partridge later received a letter from Alan Hardaker, the then secretary of the Football League, asking for his observations on the incident, but was unable to respond with conclusive evidence. Nevertheless the International Board changed the Laws of the Game to put spitting on a par with violent conduct, and therefore a dismissible offence. He was promoted to the FIFA list of referees in 1971, taking the place of the retiring Kevin Howley. Howley was another Teesside official who had played a key role in his early career. Just prior to this promotion the pair had run the line to Jack Taylor in the 1971 European Cup Final between Ajax and Panathinaikos at Wembley.‡ Although not chosen to officiate in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Finals, he did handle two friendly matches in Brazil as a precursor to that event. These were Brazil versus Czechoslovakia on 7 April 1974, and Brazil against Austria on 5 May 1974.Friendly internationals in Brazil, 1974: Barrie Courtney. His greatest domestic honour was being awarded control of the 1975 FA Cup Final between West Ham and Fulham on 3 May 1975, which West Ham won 2-0, both goals being scored by Alan Taylor.1975 FA Cup Final: TheFA.com website. As a FIFA referee, he returned to Brazil to referee the second leg of the 1976 World Club Championship Final (otherwise known as the Intercontinental Cup) in Mineirão, Belo Horizonte, between Cruzeiro and Bayern Munich. Bayern led 2-0 from the first leg, and a 0-0 draw in the latter game on 21 December 1976 meant that the German side took the Trophy that year.World Club Championship Final, second leg, 1976: Channel4.com website. On 11 May 1977, he took charge of the European Cup Winners Cup Final between SV Hamburg and Anderlecht in the Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam, which Hamburg won by 2-0.1977 Cup Winners Cup Final , Amsterdam; SportingChronicle.com; accessed 12 November 2014. 1978 was by far Partridge's busiest year. He was appointed to that year's League Cup Final at Wembley between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, which ended 0-0 after extra time. The replay was won 1-0 by Forest at Old Trafford from the award of a penalty kick by Partridge against Liverpool's Phil Thompson, Partridge believing Thompson's foul had taken place inside the penalty area, but television replays indicated it had not. After Partridge later compounded this error by wrongly disallowing Terry McDermott's equaliser for supposed handball, Liverpool defender Tommy Smith famously remarked that Partridge \\"should be shot\\". This is also the match where the same player is attributed with the first use of the phrase \\"professional foul\\".Phil Thompson article; mention of the 1978 League Cup Final and Replay: BBC.co.uk website. On 12 September 1978, he refereed an infamous meeting between Burnley and Celtic in the quarter final of the now-defunct Anglo-Scottish Cup, in which Steve Kindon gave Burnley the lead after 55 minutes. By the 80th minute, the mass of Celtic supporters showed their frustration to such a degree that Partridge led off both sets of players. Only a plea to the crowd from Kindon and Celtic manager Billy McNeill, at the referee's suggestion, allowed the game to resume.Anglo- Scottish Cup trouble in 1978: ThisIsLancashire.co.uk website. When it did, the score remained the same until the end. Partridge was chosen as a FIFA representative to officiate during the 1978 World Cup Finals in Argentina. He was linesman for two matches, both in Group A: Argentina v. Hungary, which Argentina won 2-1;Argentina v. Hungary, 1978 World Cup Finals: PlanetWorldCup website. and France v. Hungary, which France won 3-1.France v. Hungary, 1978 World Cup Finals: PlanetWorldCup website. He refereed just the one match in the Finals, the Second Stage Group B match between Peru and Poland, which finished 1-0 to Poland through a goal by Andrzej Szarmach.Peru v. Poland, 1978 World Cup Finals], planetworldcup.com; 12 November 2014. In his book, Partridge remarked at length as to the antics of the Peruvian goalkeeper, Ramon Quiroga, during that match. Having earlier executed two perfect tackles on outfield players during the match, on or near the halfway line, Quiroga then pulled down Grzegorz Lato in his opponents' half in the second period, earning himself a caution, despite standing and bowing apologetically towards the referee after the misdemeanor. The 1980 European Championships in Italy (the last tournament of his career) ended in his officiating in only one match throughout its duration. This was the encounter between Greece and Czechoslovakia on 14 June at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. The Greeks lost by 3 goals to 1, finishing bottom of Group A.\\"Euro 80\\" statistics: The Recreational Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation website. Partridge should have retired from refereeing directly after the Championships. However, the Football League had decided that the retirement age be raised to forty eight on an experimental basis (since confirmed).† This allowed him one final season (1980-81) on the List. Life outside football =Before= Upon leaving school, he had started his professional life as an electrician, meeting his future wife Margaret at the one firm he worked for in that capacity, Head Wrightson Ltd, which operated from Thornaby at the time.Head Wrightson , engineers, previously of Thornaby: mentioned in University of Durham Press Release, dur.ac.uk; accessed 12 November 2014. They married on 11 March 1961, and by 1973 had moved to the farm in Cockfield, County Durham, which was run by Margaret's father. He and Margaret then took a full role in the running of the farm. In time, they renamed the farmhouse \\"Law One\\". He was able to devote much more of his time to the farm business after being compulsorily required to end his involvement in football at the age of 48. He became Chairman of the Referees' Association and of the Association of Football League Referees and Linesmen, eventually taking up the position of President for the latter organisation. He was able to concentrate on his golf as a major hobby, and joined the Celebrity Golf Tour to help raise money for charity. He also became a local magistrate and prison visitor after his refereeing career ended, but has since retired from both occupations. In December 2002, however, he was stricken with pneumonia - a potentially fatal condition at the age of 69.Pneumonia strikes at age 69: TheNorthernEcho.co.uk website. Fortunately for him, he was able to fully recover. Enough, in fact, to come out of football retirement on 19 October 2003. As a spectator at the Northern Premier League match between Bishop Auckland and Prescot Cables, he watched as the match referee suffered an injury, causing one of his assistants to take his place in the middle. The replacement with the flag was deemed not up to the league standard, putting the future of the game in jeopardy. Having overheard all this, Partridge put himself forward to fulfill the assistant referee's duties as he had done many years ago, and ran the line in a 1-1 draw, at the age of 70 years and 4 months.Running the line at age 70: Darlington And Stockton Times online. This curiously mirrored the occasion in September 1972 when he refereed a match between Arsenal and Liverpool at Highbury. One of his linesmen tore a muscle and the flag was taken by TV expert and former player Jimmy Hill.¶ Honours On 11 May 2004, Partridge attended a North Riding FA dinner, at which he was honoured for 50 years membership of the Referees' Association.Further biography for Pat Partridge: TheNorthernEcho.co.uk website.

Burpee Company from 1915 until 1970. He was known for his experimentation and hybridization of vegetables and flowers that were for the general population.  Early life and education  David Burpee was born on April 5, 1893 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Blight School and Doylestown High School, and later Culver Military Academy in Indiana. In 1913, he enrolled in Cornell University to study agriculture until his father, W. Atlee Burpee, died in 1915. Burpee dropped out and took over the family business selling seeds. In 1937, Burpee married Lois Torrance after meeting her at a flower show.  Career  As head of Burpee Seeds, he immediately began shifting the firm's focus from vegetables to flowers. In 1917 the W. A. Burpee Company was incorporated with Burpee as president. Sales were $900,000 that year, equal to $ today. Burpee initiated a War Gardens campaign during World War I when overseas seed supplies were interrupted and there were food shortages. These programs were aimed at city folk, teaching them how to grow food during shortages by buying Burpee seeds. During the 1930s the company started a cross-breeding program to produce healthier and more disease- resistant hybrids. This period also saw the development of Golden Gleam, a double nasturtium, the Big Boy tomato, the Ambrosia cantaloupe, and also new varieties of petunias and marigolds. During the 1940s Burpee moved on to genetic engineering, altering flower chromosomes using the chemical colchicine extracted from crocus plants. This research led to new varieties of snapdragons and zinnia. World War II meant more shortages and another opportunity to sell seeds in the Victory Gardens campaign. By 1959 Burpee had grown his father's company into the largest seed catalog mail order house in the world with sales over $6 million, equal to $ today. In 1960 Burpee mailed 4 million seed annuals to customers. By 1960, he had hybridized the marigold to be odorless and it became the best-selling flower in the United States. He later unsuccessfully lobbied to make the marigold the national flower. In 1970, Burpee sold the company to General Foods and in 1979 it was passed on to ITT. Both companies retained David Burpee as a consultant until his death. His son Jonathan Burpee was the director of the customer service department during the 1970s. He left the company in 1993. In 1991 the Burpee company was acquired by George J. Ball, Inc. (now Ball Horticultural Company), a diversified horticultural family business. In 1995 the family split up the various holdings, with George Ball Jr. taking control of Burpee. Burpee died on June 24, 1980.

Neck pain, although felt in the neck, can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae. Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back. The head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain. Neck pain affects about 5% of the global population as of 2010. Differential diagnosis Neck pain may come from any of the structures in the neck including: vascular, nerve, airway, digestive, and musculature / skeletal, or be referred from other areas of the body. Major and severe causes of neck pain (roughly in order of severity) include: *Carotid artery dissection *Referred pain from acute coronary syndrome *Head and neck cancer *Infections: retropharyngeal abscess, epiglottitis, etc. *Spinal disc herniation – protruding or bulging discs, or if severe prolapse. *Spondylosis - degenerative arthritis and osteophytes *Spinal stenosis – a narrowing of the spinal canal More common and lesser neck pain causes include: *Stress – physical and emotional stresses *Prolonged postures – many people fall asleep on sofas and chairs and wake up with sore necks. *Minor injuries and falls – car accidents, sporting events, and day to day injuries that are really minor. *Referred pain – mostly from upper back problems *Over-use – muscular strain is one of the most common causes *Whiplash *Pinched nerve Although the causes are numerous, most are easily rectified by either professional help or using self help advice and techniques. More causes can include: poor sleeping posture, torticollis, head injury, rheumatoid arthritis, Carotidynia, congenital cervical rib, mononucleosis, rubella, certain cancers, ankylosing spondylitis, cervical spine fracture, esophageal trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, lymphadenitis, thyroid trauma, and tracheal trauma. Treatment Treatment of neck pain depends on the cause. For the vast majority of people, neck pain can be treated conservatively. Recommendations in which it helps alleviate symptoms include applying heat or cold. Other common treatments could include medication, body mechanics training, ergonomic reform, and physical therapy. Treatments may also include patient education, but existing evidence shows a lack of effectiveness. =Medication= Analgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs are generally recommended for pain. A 2017 review, however found that paracetamol was not efficacious and that NSAIDs are minimally effective. Muscle relaxants may also be recommended. However, one study showed that one muscle relaxant called cyclobenzaprine was not effective for treatment of acute cervical strain (as opposed to neck pain from other etiologies or chronic neck pain). =Surgery= Surgery is usually not indicated for mechanical causes of neck pain. If neck pain is the result of instability, cancer, or other disease process surgery may be necessary. Surgery is usually not indicated for \\"pinched nerves\\" or herniated discs unless there is spinal cord compression or pain and disability have been protracted for many months and refractory to conservative treatment such as physical therapy. =Alternative medicine= Exercise plus joint manipulation has been found to be beneficial in both acute and chronic mechanical neck disorders. In particular, specific strengthening exercise may improve function and pain. Motor control using cranio-cervical flexion exercises has been shown to be effective for non-specific chronic neck pain. Both cervical manipulation and cervical mobilization produce similar immediate-, and short-term changes. Multiple cervical manipulation sessions may provide better pain relief and functional improvement than certain medications at immediate to long-term follow-up. Thoracic manipulation may also improve pain and function. Low level laser therapy has been shown to reduce pain immediately after treatment in acute neck pain and up to 22 weeks after completion of treatment in patients that experience chronic neck pain. Low quality evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioural therapy may be effective at reducing pain in the short-term. Massaging the area may provide immediate and short-lived benefits, but long term effects are unknown. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support the use of mechanical traction, and side effects include headaches, nausea and injury to tissue. Radiofrequency denervation may provide temporary relief for specific affected areas in the neck. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), the noninvasive use of electrical stimulation on the skin, is of unclear benefit in chronic neck pain. Epidemiology Neck pain affects about 330 million people globally as of 2010 (4.9% of the population). It is more common in women (5.7%) than men (3.9%). It is less common than low back pain. Prognosis About one-half of episodes resolve within one year and around 10% become chronic.  Prevention  Prevalence of neck pain in the population suggests it is a common condition. For cervicalgia associated with bad posture the treatment is usually corrective in nature (i.e. ensure shoulders are in one line above the hips) and relating to interventions that provide ergonomic improvement. There is also growing research in how neck pain caused by mobile devices (see iHunch) can be prevented using embedded warning systems.

It begins at a junction with Highway 61 and travels north-west to the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 11 and Highway 17, west of Thunder Bay. Highway 130 is a short connecting highway, and passes entirely through the outskirts of Thunder Bay, connecting several minor communities and providing a shortcut for traffic travelling from the south to the west or vice versa. The speed limit along the highway is ; it is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police. Highway 130 has retained most of its current route since the mid-1970s, but was longer prior to then, when it extended north of Arthur Street to Oliver Road and then along that road into downtown Thunder Bay, ending at what is now Water Street. The route was originally designated in late 1955.  Route description  Highway 130 is situated in the municipality of Oliver Paipoonge, in Thunder Bay District. The short route serves to connect Highway 61 with Highways 11 and 17 west of Thunder Bay, a distance of . Beginning at Highway 61 in the south, the route proceeds straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road to the west and Hanna Road to the east. Surrounded almost entirely by farmland, the highway encounters McCluskey Drive one kilometre (0.62 mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive two kilometres north of that. At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, two kilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the right of way at the intersection. The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the right of way at the intersection. Now surrounded by residences to the west and a farm to the west, the highway travels north a short distance before curving to the southeast to cross the Kaministiquia River. Gradually curving back to the north, the route features residences to the south and woodland to the north. It enters the community of Twin City, acting as the main street and intersecting Rosslyn Road immediately north of a Canadian National Railway crossing and the Paipoonge Museum. At Arthur Street, the highway turns west until it ends at Highway 11 and Highway 17.  History  Highway 130 was first designated in late 1955 and early 1956. At that time the route ended in the midst of McIntyre Township; it began at Algoma Road (now Water Street), then the route of Highway 17, and followed John Street and Oliver Road. The Department of Highways assumed the portion within McIntyre Township on December 7, 1955. Three months later, the route was extended south to Highway 61 when the department assumed the section in Paipoonge Township on March 7, 1956. This route remained in place until the mid-1970s, when Highway 130 was decommissioned north of Arthur Street; the section within the newly formed City of Thunder Bay was transferred to the city on October 1, 1970, while the section within McIntyre Township remained until at least 1973. On August 17, 2007, the highway was extended by when Highway 11 and Highway 17, which until then travelled along Arthur Street, were transferred onto the Shabaqua Bypass to the north. As a result, Highway 130 was extended west along Arthur Street to its current terminus at the bypass.

Cates (20 December 1881– 29 October 1959) was an American mining engineer and businessman. He was president of Phelps Dodge from 1930 to 1947. Biography Louis Shattuck Cates was born in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1902, he received a mining engineering degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology . At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began his career as superintendent of the Boston Consolidated operation in Utah, where he made a successful copper mine for Samuel Newhouse and his Boston backers. In 1910, Boston Con was acquired by the adjacent Utah Copper Company, the gigantic open pit operation at Bingham, Utah. Utah Copper Company's General Manager Daniel C. Jackling (1869–1956), was impressed with Cates and, after a short stint at Bingham Canyon, transferred Cates to manage the Ray Consolidated copper mining operation at Ray, Arizona. Cates introduced the profitable block-caving method at Ray, one of the new porphryr copper mines being opened at a grand scale at the time. His success during the 1910s-20s within the Jackling operations, reorganized under the 1915 formed Kennecott Corporation, proved his worth. Known for his gruff style and limited personal skills, he was a dogged manager whose single-focus made his many operations successful. He led the Phelps Dodge Company from 1930 to 1947. During that time the company acquired the Nichols Copper Company, the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, and the United Verde Copper Company. Under Cates' leadership Phelps-Dodge became an integrated copper industry operation. During his tenure the capital stock of Phelps-Dodge more than quadrupled in value, despite the Great Depression. He expanded Phelps Dodge mining operations at Bisbee, Jerome, Ajo, and especially the opening of the world-class Clay copper ore body at Morenci, Arizona, still one of the world's largest copper producers. He also re-invented Phelps Dodge as a vertical - integrated - copper producer, from mine pit to finished product. Cates resigned as president of Phelps Dodge in 1947. He remained chairman of the board until his death in 1959. Phelps Dodge would remain a copper leader until acquired by Freeport-McMoRan. At the time of its acquisition in 2007, Phelps Dodge Corporation had large copper mining operations in Bagdad, Morenci, Sahuarita, Safford and Miami, Arizona as well as holdings in New Mexico.

The San Francisco Chronicle article by Heretia, however, mistakenly attributes Sparks' birth in 1950 or 1951. Assigned male at birth, Sparks expressed her gender identity at an early age by wearing women's clothing, though she later resisted these impulses in adolescence. Sparks went to Kansas State University and graduated with a degree in engineering. She served in the United States Navy. Later she managed several waste management and recycling companies and patented two recycling techniques. She married her first wife in 1971 and together they had three children: two sons and a daughter. After nine years of marriage, Sparks finally revealed to her wife her desire to live as a woman. They separated shortly after and eventually divorced. Sparks remarried, but that marriage also ended in divorce. Sparks underwent \\"intense therapy and an electric shock treatment\\" to try to suppress her femininity, before deciding at last to embrace her gender identity. \\"It's an unusual condition, but it's not unnatural,\\" she said later. \\"You discover that the only way to live with it is to transition physically so your physical appearance matches how you feel about yourself.\\" Transitioning By 1997, Sparks moved to San Francisco, where she felt she could more easily adjust to life as a woman. But even there, in a city known as one of the most transgender-friendly in the country, Sparks faced challenges as a transgender woman.Gordon, Rachel. Transgender Study Finds Bias: But S.F.

Sparks eventually acquired sporadic work as a cab driver, bank teller, and census taker to avoid becoming homeless. One evening while walking through the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, an area known to be strolled by transgender sex workers, Sparks said she was harassed by a police officer, who demanded to see her identification and questioned what she was doing there. \\"[The police] assume if there's a transgender person walking down the street in the Tenderloin it's probably because they're prostitutes,\\" she later said about the experience.Gordon, Rachel.

Activism Not long after her arrival in San Francisco, Sparks immersed herself in the San Francisco political landscape. Frustrated with the obstacles she and other transgender people were facing such as employment and housing discrimination, anti-transgender violence, police harassment, and a lack of affordable medical treatment, she helped organize a group of transgender activists to lobby the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In 1999 they formed the Transgender Political Caucus (TPC) and campaigned to elect members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who would fight for transgender civil rights. Sparks became the chair of the nascent transgender activist group, TG Rage, and in 1999 organized the very first Transgender Day of Remembrance to memorialize those transgender men and women who lost their lives to transphobic violence.Cassell, Heather.

Ardent was originally laid down as HMS Buffalo (BAM-8), for the Royal Navy on 20 February 1943 at Alameda, California, by the General Engineering & Drydock Co.; rescheduled for delivery to the United States Navy; renamed Ardent and redesignated AM-340 on 24 May 1943; launched on 22 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Bernadette Armes, the daughter-in-law of George A. Armes, President of the General Engineering & Drydock Co., and commissioned on 25 May 1944, Lt. Comdr. Allan D. Curtis in command. World War II Pacific operations During the first seven months of her career, Ardent escorted convoys and ships operating between the west coast of the United States and the Hawaiian Islands, though she also ranged as far as Eniwetok in the Marshalls and Tarawa in the Gilberts.  Sinking of the Japanese submarine I-12  The highlight of her service during this period occurred on 13 November. Ardent and the frigate were escorting a six-ship convoy midway between Honolulu and the United States. At 12:32, Ardent's sonar picked up a submarine contact. Ardent attacked first at 12:41, firing a 24-charge \\"Hedgehog\\" pattern, and again at 12:46 with a second \\"Hedgehog\\" pattern. Rockford left her escort station to assist, and fired her first barrage of rockets from her \\"Hedgehog\\" at 13:08; two explosions followed, before an underwater detonation rocked the ship. Ardent carried out two more attacks and the frigate dropped 13 depth charges to administer the coup de grace. The resulting explosions caused a loss of all contact with the enemy submarine. Wreckage recovered on the scene—deck planks, ground cork covered with diesel oil, a wooden slat from a vegetable crate with Japanese writing and advertisements on it, pieces of varnished mahogany inscribed in Japanese, and a piece of deck planking containing Japanese builders' inscriptions—indicated a definite \\"kill\\". Postwar research revealed the sunken submarine to be the , which had sailed from the Inland Sea on 4 October 1944 to disrupt American shipping between the west coast and the Hawaiian Islands. In sinking I-12, Ardent and USS Rockford unwittingly avenged the atrocity I-12 had perpetrated on 30 October when, after sinking the Liberty ship SS John A. Johnson, the submarine had rammed and sunk the lifeboats and rafts and then machine-gunned the 70 survivors. Among the ten men killed were five enlisted men of the merchantman's Navy armed guard detachment.  Second Pacific deployment  On 1 December 1944, Ardent departed San Francisco, California, and headed for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on the 10th and underwent an intensive training period before sailing for the Marshall Islands on 27 January 1945 with Task Group (TG) 51.11, arriving on 5 February at Eniwetok. Two days later, Ardent sailed for Tinian, and reported for duty with TG 52.3 on the 11th. On 13 February, the ship got underway, in company with , , and , to participate in the Iwo Jima campaign. She conducted mine-sweeping operations off that island during the day from 15 to 18 February, and each night, her group retired to screen . During the sweeps, the ships came under intermittent fire from enemy shore batteries, but sustained no damage. On 19 February, Ardent took bomb-damaged in tow and proceeded to the Marianas as escort for a convoy of damaged LCIs.  Ship shoots down Japanese planes  Upon reaching Saipan on the 25th, the minesweeper embarked 20 marines and loaded 149 sacks of mail for delivery at Iwo Jima. She arrived back at that island on 1 March but shaped a course for Ulithi the next day as escort for Task Unit (TU) 51.29.3. A few weeks later, Ardent got underway with TG 52.4 to take part in the assault on Okinawa. She began mine-sweeping operations on the 24th and continued them through the 31st, the unit to which she was attached destroying 17 mines during this time period. During frequent enemy air attacks, the minesweeper took several Japanese planes under fire. On 26 March, an enemy plane under fire from the nearby fast minelayer started a glide for USS Ardent's stern. The minesweeper opened fire and splashed the plane away. On four occasions on 28 March, Japanese aircraft approached Ardent and her consorts. An adjacent formation shot down the first, from USS Ardent's port beam. Combined fire from Adams and Ardent, as well as other ships in the formation, splashed the second, on the port beam. Ardent opened fire on the third aircraft, and saw it splash, the victim of a barrage put up by a formation of ships on the starboard quarter. USS Adams accounted for the fourth enemy aircraft. Later that same day, the minesweeper struck a mine and sank; Ardent rescued 19 survivors.  Okinawa landings  Following the completion of mine-sweeping operations, Ardent assumed station on a patrol screen. On L-day, the day of the landings at Okinawa, 1 April 1945, a suicider crashed the nearby , causing extensive damage. During this period, Ardent opened fire on several Japanese planes, but scored no hits.  Stateside repair period  Ordered to proceed to Saipan for engine repairs, Ardent sailed for her destination on 4 April, and arrived on 10 April. Since parts necessary for the repairs were not available in the forward areas, she was routed via Pearl Harbor, to Seattle, where she arrived on 30 May. Ardent underwent engine repairs at Seattle, Washington until 7 August. Six days later, on the 13th, the minesweeper sailed for Pearl Harbor, and was at sea, en route to the Hawaiian Islands, when the war with Japan ended.  Post-World War II operations  Departing Pearl Harbor on 20 August in company with and , Ardent called at Saipan from 13 to 17 September, and arrived at Okinawa on the 21st. Pushing on for Japan, Ardent moored at Sasebo, Japan, on 27 September, disembarking passengers, and delivering mail and freight. The ship made a brief trip back to Okinawa, arriving there on 2 October, before she returned to Sasebo on 20 October. During her time at Okinawa, she sortied on 7 October to ride out a typhoon, and conducted sweeps down the island's east coast for survivors of that storm. Joining TU 52.4.1 on 27 October, Ardent proceeded to the \\"Klondike\\" minefield area, located in the East China Sea southwest of Kyūshū. She conducted daily minesweeping operations until 8 November, when she arrived back at Sasebo. Between that time and the end of the year, Ardent operated between Honshū and Kyūshū, escorting ships, transporting minesweeping gear, and observing Japanese minesweeping operations and conducting demolition firing at the mine disposal grounds at Kushikino Ko. She remained thus engaged into March 1946. Routed to Kobe on 4 March 1946, in company with , Ardent sailed for the Hawaiian Islands two days later, on 6 March. Touching at Saipan, Eniwetok, Johnston Island and Pearl Harbor, the minesweeper continued on to the west coast of the United States; parting company from USS Defense on 16 April, Ardent dropped anchor in San Francisco Bay on 19 April.  Stateside inactivity  The minesweeper lay in the San Francisco Naval Shipyard until November 1946. Subsequently, proceeding to San Diego in company with , Ardent then operated in the vicinity of San Clemente Island, Newport Beach, and Oceanside, California, and on air- sea rescue stations off the coast of southern California. Returning to pier 17, Treasure Island (California), on 15 December 1946, to commence preparations for inactivation, Ardent shifted to the San Diego Naval Station on 22 January 1947.  Decommissioning  Placed out of commission, in reserve, on 30 January 1947, Ardent was berthed with the San Diego group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. While she was in reserve, the ship's designation was changed to MSF-340 on 7 February 1955. Struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1972, the ship was subsequently sold to the government of Mexico on 19 September 1972.  Mexican Navy service  On 19 September 1972, the former Ardent was sold to the Mexican Navy, which renamed her ARM Juan N. Álvarez (C77). Her pennant number was later changed to G09, before being changed a final time to P108 in 1993. , Juan N. Álvarez was still in active service for the Mexican Navy.  Awards  Ardent earned four battle stars for her World War II service.

Gonzales Memorial Museum, Gonzales, Texas. The Immortal 32 was a relief force of thirty-two Texian Militia from the Gonzales Ranging Company who reinforced the Texians under siege at the Alamo. They are \\"immortalized\\" as the only unit to answer the To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World letter. Along with the other Alamo defenders, they were all killed and burned after the Battle of the Alamo.  Background  As Santa Anna's army approached the Alamo February 23, 1836, William Travis dispatched John Johnson to Goliad for reinforcement from James Fannin. He also dispatched John Smith and Dr. James Sutherland to Gonzales with a letter for the Alcade Andrew Ponton: > \\"The enemy in large force is in sight. We want men and provisions. Send them > to us. We have 150 men and are determined to defend the Alamo to the last. > Give us assistance.\\" William Barrett Travis Lt. Col. Comdt. That night, Santa Anna sent General Ventura Mora's cavalry to encircle to the North and East corners of the Alamo to prevent the arrival of reinforcements. On February 24, Travis dispatched Albert Martin to Gonzales with a second letter for Andrew Ponton: Ponton received the first letter on February 24. He mobilized George Kimble, commander of the Texian Militia Gonzales Ranging Company, who mustered his unit and waited for Fannin; who also received the first letter on February 24. On February 26, Fannin departed Goliad for the Alamo with 320 men, 4 cannon, and several supply wagons. After repeated disasters, Fannin abandoned the mission and returned to Goliad. On February 27, Kimble departed with his unit for the Alamo. Ponton received the second letter on February 27 and dispatched it to Governor Henry Smith in San Felipe. Smith informed colonists: Travis dispatched his final letter to the President David G. Burnet on March 3:  History  On February 29, 1836, the \\"Immortal 32\\" led by George Kimbell arrived at the Alamo. At 3:00 am on March 1, under the cover of night, they slipped through Santa Anna's lines and entered the fort. They are the only relief force to arrive before the final assault. On March 5, James Allen is the last Texian to leave the Alamo with a final dispatch from William Travis and various letters from the Alamo Defenders. A letter written by one of the thirty-two, Isaac Millsaps, details events inside the Alamo on the night before the final assault; its authenticity is disputed: On March 6, the final assault of the siege, the Battle of the Alamo, commenced at 5:30 am.

Its western terminus is at Highway 41 near Dacre while its eastern terminus is at Highway 60 in Renfrew. The length of Highway 132 is , situated entirely in Renfrew County. It travels through the communities of Shamrock, Dacre and Renfrew. The highway was built in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, providing access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of the highways at either end of the route, the route has remained the same since then.  Route description  Highway 132 between Renfrew and Shamrock Highway 132 is a short connector highway that travels between Dacre and Renfrew, connecting Highway 41 with Highway 17 via Highway 60\\\\. The majority of the route travels through the Canadian Shield, with the exception of the final few kilometres approaching Renfrew, where it descends into the Ottawa Valley. Because of its rugged surroundings, there is relatively little human habitation along the route outside of the communities of Dacre and Shamrock. Beginning at a junction with Highway 41 just west of Dacre, Highway 132 progresses east as the mainline; drivers must turn to remain on Highway 41\\\\. After passing through forests for , the route enters the small community of Dacre, where it intersects former Highway 513 (Scotch Bush Road) north to Hyndford. Leaving Dacre, the highway passes by several farms as it dips south to cross Constant Creek, a tributary of the Madawaska River, before turning east-northeast. It meanders around several large swamps and small lakes that dot the Madawaska Highlands, otherwise passing through thick forests for the next until it enters a clearing and the hamlet of Shamrock. The next of Highway 132 is predominately surrounded by impervious forests, although it encounters Renfrew County Road 34 (Whelan Road) midway through this section, turning northeast at that junction. The route descends gradually into the Ottawa Valley immediately before intersecting Renfrew County Road 5 (Stone Road). Here the forests give way to agricultural fields for the next , before the highway enters Renfrew at Riverview Drive and become urban. Within Renfew, it follows Lisgar Avenue, Lochiel Street North and Munroe Avenue West before ending downtown at an intersection with Highway 60 (Raglan Avenue). Like other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 132 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 2,500 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Renfrew County Road 5 (Stone Road) and Highway 60, while 1,600 vehicles did so each day along the remainder of the route, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.  History  Highway 132 was assumed by the Department of Highways on January 11, 1956. Prior to the designation of Highway 132, no other highways connected with Highway 17 between Pembroke, where it met Highway 62, and Arnprior, where it met Highway 29\\\\. When Highway 132 was assumed, Highway 60 did not extend beyond Highway 41 at Golden Lake, northwest of Eganville. Highway 60 was extended to Highway 17 near Rosebank, north of Renfrew, circa 1961. With the construction of the Renfrew Bypass, which began in June 1974, and was completed in 1977, the section of Highway 17 between O'Brien Road east of Renfrew and Haley Road north of Haley Station was renumbered as an extension of Highway 60; this became the new eastern terminus of Highway 132. Although some minor realignments have occurred over the years, the route has more or less remained unchanged since its designation.

Known for most of its length as Whaleyville Road, the state highway runs from the county-maintained portion of Dale Road near Whaleyville north to U.S. Route 113 (US 113) near Bishop. The first segment of MD 610 was constructed near Whaleyville in the mid-1930s. The highway to Bishop was brought into the state highway system in the 1940s. MD 610, which did not originally reach US 50, was extended south to that highway, now MD 346, in 1955. The state highway reached its current southern terminus after the US 50 divided highway was constructed in the mid-1960s. Route description View west along MD 610 at US 113 in Bishop MD 610 begins at a point on Dale Road south of US 50 (Ocean Gateway) near Whaleyville. The state highway heads north from the intersection with US 50 as two-lane undivided Whaleyville Road. After crossing MD 346 (Old Ocean City Boulevard), MD 610 bypasses the center of Whaleyville on the west and intersects Sheppards Crossing Road. The state highway curves to the northeast and crosses Shavox Church Road and Peerless Road as well as Birch Branch on the way to its eastern terminus at US 113 (Worcester Highway) in Bishop. Hammond Road, which for a short stretch is unsigned MD 575L, continues east on the other side of the intersection toward Bishopville. History The first segment of MD 610 was constructed from Sheppards Crossing Road to Donaway Road north of Whaleyville in 1935. It was connected to US 213 (later US 50 and now MD 346) by Sheppards Crossing Road, which was improved by the Maryland State Roads Commission by 1934. By 1946, state maintenance was extended east to Campbelltown Road near Bishop. The segment between Campbelltown Road and US 113 was brought under state maintenance in 1950. In 1955, MD 610 was extended south along a new alignment from Sheppards Crossing Road to present day MD 346. The state highway was extended south again in 1966 to both connect with the new US 50 divided highway and to access properties on Dale Road, whose original alignment had been interrupted by the relocation of US 50.

A striking diagnostic character is the trochanter IV of male with strong medial prolateral apophysis forming a pincer with the dorso-apical apophysis of coxa IV. Two of these species present neon green stripes on the mesotergum (Kury, 2003b), which is uncommon in this subfamily.  Taxonomic history  This genus was at first called Luederwaldtia Mello-Leitão, 1923, but the name was already preoccupied, being a junior homonym of Luederwaldtia Schmidt, 1922 (Hemiptera). Strand (1942) proposed the valid replacement name Lacronia, which was ignored by most subsequent authors and unearthed only 60 years later (Kury, 2003a).  Species  * Lacronia camboriu Kury, 2003 – Santa Catarina (coast) * Lacronia ceci Kury & Orrico, 2006 – Rio de Janeiro (mountains) * Lacronia ricardoi Kury, 2003 – São Paulo (southern coast) * Lacronia serripes (Mello-Leitão, 1923) – São Paulo (islands in northern coast)  Ecological remarks  Lacronia ceci is the first species of the genus to be found in highlands away from the coast. The other three species of Lacronia are known from coastal environments: Lacronia serripes is known only from small islands. The other two were found in continental \\"restinga\\" biome. Individuals of both sexes of Lacronia ceci were found inside bamboo (Guadua taguara) hollows or in immediately surrounding areas. No individuals were found in other locations during diurnal collectings. Lacronia camboriu and L. ricardoi were found inside bromeliads, suggesting that the species of this genus are related to phytotelmata (Kury & Orrico, 2006).  References  * Kury, A. B., 2003a.

Like Palace, it is derived from the Finnish card game Paskahousu.  Rules  *The deck is split evenly and each player is dealt four face down cards and eight hand cards. Each player chooses four of their hand cards to place face up over the face down cards: one face up card on each face down card. *Now each player has four hand cards. The player with the lowest hand card plays that card in the center. The next person may now play a card equal to or higher in value than the last played. Each player draws one card from the remaining deck each time they play a card. Multiple cards may be played at a time as long as they are the same value. *If someone will not play on the central pile, they must pick up the pile and then play any value of their choosing. *once the deck runs out players may not pick up anymore cards but must utilize the cards in their hands or pick up the deck. *A 2 is a special card; it is not a low card. Instead, a 2 \\"neutralizes\\" the value of the pile, allowing the next person to play any value card they want on the pile. *A 10 is also special; it burns the pile unless the number is greater than 10; the pile is discarded and the last to play may now play what they want. *If someone plays all of their hand cards, they may now play the face up cards they reserved from the beginning instead of their face cards. *When a player plays all their face up cards, they move on to their face down cards. They cannot look at these cards and are forced to play them at random. If the card they play is lower than the value required, they must take up the pile and again use it as their hand cards. *The first to get rid of all hand cards, face up cards, and face down cards wins the round. *Optionally the winner gets to choose which piece of clothing is removed from the opponent, if you are playing a \\"strip\\" version of the game. *Continue until one person has on no clothing. *The Last person with the most clothing on wins.  Variations  *Some variations have it where when a card identical in value to the last is played, the next player in the turn order is skipped. *A very common variation is that when four of the same value card are played in a row, then the pile automatically clears. *Another very common variation is that when someone plays a 2 they can also play another card on top of it. *Some games state that if a seven is played, the next card must be lower than the 7. *Another variation is that instead of starting with four face-down cards and eight hand cards (four of which are put down), players only start with three and six or seven respectively. *In one version called Moonshine each player is dealt three cards face up, three cards face down, and five to be held in their hand. The cards left in the deck are to be draw from keeping five cards in your hand at all times, until the remainder of the deck is gone. The special cards are 2's which neutralizes the pile, 3's which are invisible so the next player must play on whatever card is under the three, 7's which the next player must play under and 7, and 10's which clears the piles and you get to go again. A four-of-a-kind also clears the pile and allows you to go again.  Popcorn  Popcorn is a competitive, multiplayer card game. It is a fixed variant of Moonshine. Popcorn uses a 54 card deck (standard deck of 52 plus jokers). It is named after Marvin Sutton, aka \\"Popcorn\\" Sutton, the most famous moonshiner in Western North Carolina. As a shedding-type card game, the goal is to get rid of all your cards. The first player to do so wins the round. A dealer shuffles a deck of 54 cards. Starting with the player to the dealer’s left and continuing clockwise, a total of three face down cards (“the basement”) are placed in front of each player, side by side. A player may not look at these cards. Next, three face up cards are dealt that cover the face down cards, forming “the porch.” Finally, the dealer deals a five card hand to each player. The remaining cards are placed on the table as the draw deck. =Play= On the first move, the player to the left of the dealer can play any single card or set (two of a kind, three of a kind, etc.) from their hand onto the table. They must then draw as many cards as it takes from the draw deck to return to a five card hand in order to end their turn. Play continues clockwise. The next person may now play a card equal to or higher in value than the last played. Multiple cards may be played at a time as long as they are the same value. If a player is unable to play a card, they must take the entire pile into their hand. Once all cards from a player’s hand and the draw deck are exhausted, a player may use any of the three face up cards on their “porch.” Once the three porch cards are gone, a player may use one of the face down “basement” cards. Special rules are that: * Playing an Ace forces you to send it to another player, leaving them to only be able to block it with a 2, Joker, or 10. * Playing a 2 resets the value of the pile. You can then play another card or set on top. * Playing a 7 forces the next player to play a card or set of lower value. * Playing a 10 clears the pile - all the cards, including the 10, are discarded from play. * A Joker is able to be used as any card. * Four of a Kind, no matter how many players contributed, clears the pile just like a 10. The player who plays their final card instantly wins the round.

It is a variety that has only recently been deemed a major lineage by a few published works. The tail conformation is commonly bred into the telescope eye goldfish, the term \\"butterfly tail\\" is just short for the many names this variety has such as Butterfly Tail Demekin, Butterfly Tail Black Moor and Top view Telescope (TVT), and many other goldfish varieties. Description and production The butterfly telescope goldfish is a variant form of the telescope goldfish with protruding eyes and is best appreciated by viewing it from above. While this tail variation is commonly paired with the telescope eye variation, 'butterfly shaped tails' may be present in other goldfish standard varieties such as ryukins or orandas. The tail spread is preferable 180 degrees but some may droop down at an angle due to the weight of the long tail fins. With the rise in popularity of butterfly tail moors, there have been efforts to distinguish the different butterfly tail types such as the faery butterfly, shuan shu (Chinese comb tail) butterfly, delta and trapezium tail butterfly.

Samtrak was a passenger train operated by the Oregon Pacific Railroad, and named after the owner of the railroad, Dick Samuels. The trains ran a 3.8 mile route from OMSI to the foot of S.E. 11th Avenue, with a stop at Oaks Amusement Park. At the 11th Avenue end of the route, the railroad owned a building used by the former Portland Traction Company railroad and began a small railroad museum with a variety of historic diesel locomotives. While the museum was not built and the building sold, the locomotives are still owned by the Oregon Pacific Railroad; Samuels remains committed to a railroad museum in Portland and has a proposal for such a museum to be located near Oaks Park (itself intended to have been a railroad museum, featuring the three steam locomotives donated to the City of Portland: the Southern Pacific 4449, the Spokane, Portland & Seattle 700, and the Union Pacific 3203). The original cost to ride Samtrak was $3. In 1995, the cost was increased to $4. Samtrak ran Tuesday through Sunday during the summer and for special events and holidays, such as Memorial Day and Holiday Junction at OMSI. The passenger excursion train originally consisted of a 25-ton General Electric diesel locomotive, but was later upgraded to a 45-ton GE locomotive, and an open-air passenger car. In June 1994, the railway purchased an antique 1926 caboose from the Northern Pacific Railway and added it to the train. Riding in the cupola of the caboose cost an extra dollar. After Samtrak stopped running, the original 25-ton diesel locomotive and the open passenger car were stored by the Oregon Pacific Railroad until donated to the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society in May 2005. The open-air passenger car however was returned to the Oregon Pacific Railroad. Although the SamTrak trains no longer run, the Oregon Pacific Railroad has hosted excursions using the Southern Pacific 4449 and Spokane, Portland and Seattle 700 steam locomotives, notably during the \\"Holiday Express\\" excursions for two weekends each December (beginning in 2004), and a weekend of excursions with the SP&S; 700 steam locomotive in June. The Oregon Pacific has been a proud sponsor and participant of these public excursion trains and has made significant improvements to its track to accommodate these heavy steam engines. The 45-ton locomotive was sold in 2009 to the Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad to assist in rebuilding their railroad; however the POTB later chose to abandon that effort and their railroad is now inactive. The locomotive was sold again. It is now possible to charter the former Samtrak train (with one of Oregon Pacific's regular diesel locomotives) for birthday parties or other gatherings.

From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America, including this area. After its defeat in the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, by the Treaty of Fontainebleau. =19th century= In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, much of modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase at a price of 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and the following year Marion County was established, including portions of Elk. Six years later, Kansas was admitted as a state.The History of Marion County and Courthouse =20th century= The community of Elk was founded in the mid 19th century,Shown on this 1893 map and it continued to exist into the 1920s.Shown on this 1921 map The town had a post office from 1874 until December 1924, when it was replaced by rural free delivery.University of Nebraska-Lincoln Center for Great Plains Studies, Great Plains Quarterly, vol. 7-8, p. 253 A post office existed in Elk from August 24, 1874 to December 15, 1924. =21st century= No buildings now remain in Elk, and it is considered a Ghost Town.DeLorme.

He was a Goth, as shown by his Germanic name. History Following Flavius Orestes's coup against the Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos on August 28, 475, Ovida remained loyal to the Emperor and accompanied him on his escape to Dalmatia. The situation in Dalmatia, in contrast to the situation in the rest of the Empire, was fairly stable, to the relief of the civilian population and the legionaries. For the next three years, Nepos ruled in Dalmatia while in the West Orestes's son Romulus Augustus was deposed as Emperor by the Scirian general Odoacer. However, in 479 Nepos began planning an operation to reconquer Italy from the barbarians. The prospect of military adventures in faraway Italy did not sit well with Nepos' primarily Dalmatian troops, as by this point, Dalmatia had been de facto independent for twenty-five years, since 454 and the days of Nepos' uncle and predecessor, Marcellinus. Its archons had no great desire to jeopardize this independence by provoking Odoacer. So by the spring of 480, Julius Nepos was assassinated. Historical sources have left us with three different dates for Nepos death and three different suspects for it. Nepos was killed by disgruntled soldiers seeking to forestall his attack, or by agents of either Glycerius, who preceded Nepos as Western Roman Emperor and who thoroughly loathed him, or Ovida who had taken control of the Dalmatian legions. Nepos was supported by the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno, of whom Odoacer was formally a vassal. Acting out of a supposed duty as Zeno's subordinate in Italy, Odoacer used the news of the assassination as an excuse to invade Dalmatia. Ovida, as the only authority figure left in Dalmatia, was forced to defend Dalmatia against Odoacer's forces in a short war that ended with Ovida's death on December 9, 480. Dalmatia was then annexed to become part of Odoacer's Kingdom of Italy.

Its western terminus is at Highway 400 south of Horseshoe Lake in Seguin Township while its eastern terminus is at Highway 11 near Port Sydney. The route was designated in 1974 when Highway 532 was renumbered and upgraded from a secondary highway to a King's Highway. The route has remained generally unchanged since, though it was extended by several kilometres on October 7, 2003 when Highway 400 was extended north of Mactier.  Route description  Highway 141 in Rosseau Highway 141 is 54.3 km long. It travels through Muskoka District and Parry Sound District, travelling through the communities of Humphrey, Rosseau, Bent River (off-route but nearby), Ullswater, Raymond and Utterson. The road passes several bodies of water including Lake Rosseau, Skeleton Lake, Longs Lake and others. Other lakes are accessible via Highway 141 including Three Mile Lake, Lake Joseph, Horse Lake and others. Highway 141 is the first major highway connection between Highway 400 and Highway 11 north of Barrie and the Muskoka Lakes Region. The highway terminates at Exit 207 on both of these highways, and is the only highway in Ontario to begin and end at the same exit number. On Highway 400, the Highway 141 junction is located near the Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport. Rosseau is the largest community located directly on the route.  History  While Highway 141 was not designated until the mid-1970s, the route it follows was assumed in early 1956 by the Department of Highways. At that time, the route existed as Highway 532 and Highway 516\\\\. These two routes met southeast of Raymond, at what is now the junction with Muskoka District Road 35. On January 1, 1973, the route of Highway 532 was modified so that it continued east along the former Highway 516 instead of curving south through Bracebridge. This routing was short-lived; in 1974 the Ministry of Transportation and Communications redesignated the entirety of Highway 532 as Highway 141. On October 7, 2003, with the extension of Highway 400 between Mactier and Horseshoe Lake, the western terminus of Highway 141 was shifted from Highway 69 at Hayes Corners southwest to Highway 400, adding three kilometres of shared routing with Highway 69 and the access road to the Parry Sound Airport. In the summer of 2012, Highway 69 was decommissioned in the area; the old route is now known as Rankin Lake Road north of the shared segment and Lake Joseph Road south of it.

Based on Saturn's real-life moon of the same name, it is depicted in the Marvel Universe as the home of the Titanian Eternals. It first appeared in Iron Man #55 (Feb 1973) and was conceived by Jim Starlin and Mike Friedrich. The Titanians, also known as Titans, were later retconned as being an offshoot of the Eternals, which had been created separately by Jack Kirby.Origin story told in Marvel Comics, \\"What If?\\", issues 24 - 28. Titan appeared in the 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War and 2019 film Avengers: Endgame as a ruined planet and the former home of Thanos. Fictional history The colony of Titanian Eternals was founded about 750,000 years ago in the aftermath of a devastating civil war among the first generation of Earth's Eternals. The Eternals Uranos and Kronos led opposing factions, which clashed in a conflict of ideals over the Eternals' destiny as a people. Kronos' side prevailed, and Uranos and his surviving followers were exiled into space and landed on the planet Uranus. There, they discovered a supply depot guarded by Kree Sentry #213. When the Eternals destroyed the Sentry and raided the outpost, the Kree armada came to investigate, thinking Earth's solar system to be devoid of intelligent life. The armada destroyed the Eternals’ spacecraft, forcing them to crash on the moon Titan, where they hid from the Kree. There, the small group of survivors formed a colony beneath the surface of the moon, employing artificial life systems. These Eternals eventually fell prey to internal strife, and all of them but Sui-San were killed. Mentor, who had gone into voluntary exile, arrived on Titan, and the two Eternals began to repopulate the Titan colony. These new Titanian Eternals achieved much scientifically and socially, not the least of which was ISAAC, an immense computer system that could monitor and maintain all of the life support functions of the inner world. Under A'lars' leadership, Titan became a haven for peace. Then, A'lars (also known as Mentor) sired the last two of his numerous children: Eros and Thanos. Thanos was born a mutant, and grew up with dark visions of conquest and destruction. Thanos left Titan, recruited an army of mercenaries, and returned to attack. Only a hundred of Titan's thousands of inhabitants survived, and Sui-San perished in the slaughter. Eventually, the Titanians rebuilt the colony and restored it to a place of meditation and the pursuit of knowledge.

Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and the present Guardians of the Galaxy including Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, and Nebula battle Thanos on Titan to protect the Eye of Agamotto, which contains the Time Stone. It is on Titan just prior to their battle when Strange used the Time Stone to go into the future and see millions of possible outcomes from their conflict with Thanos, but only one in which they win. As Iron Man is about to be killed by Thanos, Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing his life.

The canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate's performance of the bravura aria at the opera's 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening. Before the opera's first public performance (in Venice), the song was rehearsed under tight secrecy: a necessary precaution, as \\"\\" proved to be incredibly catchy, and soon after the song's first public performance it became popular to sing among Venetian gondoliers. As the opera progresses, the reprise of the tune in the following scenes contributes to Rigoletto's confusion as he realizes from the sound of the Duke's lively voice coming from the tavern (offstage) that the body in the sack over which he had grimly triumphed was not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke, but Sparafucile had deceived Rigoletto by indiscriminately killing Gilda, Rigoletto's beloved daughter, instead.Rigoletto synopsis, OperaGlass, Stanford University Music {align=right { ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } \\\\clef \\"treble_8\\" \\\\key b \\\\major fis_\\"Range\\" (ais') } } The aria is in the key of B major with a time signature of 3/8 and a tempo mark of allegretto. The vocal range extends from F to A with a tessitura from F to F. Eight bars form the orchestral introduction, followed by a one- bar general rest. Each verse and the refrain covers eight bars; the whole aria is 87 bars long. The almost comical-sounding theme of \\"\\" is introduced immediately. The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two to three minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important—and obvious—omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, ending not on the tonic (B) or dominant (F) but on the submediant (G). Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time it includes the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic of B major. The song is in strophic form with an orchestral ritornello. Libretto La donna è mobile Qual piuma al vento, muta d'accento e di pensiero.

È sempre misero chi a lei s'affida, chi le confida mal cauto il cuore! Pur mai non sentesi felice appieno chi su quel seno non liba amore! Refrain La donna è mobil' Qual piuma al vento, muta d'accento e di pensier'! Woman is flighty. Like a feather in the wind, she changes in voice and in thought. Always a lovely, pretty face, in tears or in laughter, it is untrue. Refrain Woman is fickle. Like a feather in the wind, she changes her words and her thoughts! Always miserable is he who trusts her, he who confides in her his unwary heart! Yet one never feels fully happy who from that bosom does not drink love! Refrain Woman is fickle. Like a feather in the wind, she changes her words, and her thoughts! Poetic adaptation Plume in the summerwind Waywardly playing Ne'er one way swaying Each whim obeying; Thus heart of womankind Ev'ry way bendeth, Woe who dependeth On joy she spendeth! Refrain Yes, heart of woman Ev'ry way bendeth Woe who dependeth On joy she spends. Sorrow and misery Follow her smiling, Fond hearts beguiling, falsehood assoiling! Yet all felicity Is her bestowing, No joy worth knowing Is there but wooing. Refrain Yes, heart of woman Ev'ry way bendeth Woe who dependeth On joy she spends. Popular culture The tune has been used in popular culture for a long time and for many occasions and purposes. Verdi knew that he had written a very popular melody, so he provided the score to the singer at the premiere, Raffaele Mirate, only shortly before the premiere and had him swear not to sing or whistle the tune outside rehearsals. And indeed, people sang the tune the next day in the streets. Early, it became a barrel organ staple, and later was used extensively in television advertisements.\\"From tomato paste to Doritos: Rigoletto aria a popular refrain\\" by Carrie Seidman, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 18 October 2012 Football fans chanted new words on the melody, and it was used in video games and films.

In mathematics, the concept of trace operator plays an important role in studying the existence and uniqueness of solutions to boundary value problems, that is, to partial differential equations with prescribed boundary conditions. The trace operator makes it possible to extend the notion of restriction of a function to the boundary of its domain to \\"generalized\\" functions in a Sobolev space. Informal discussion Let \\\\Omega be a bounded open set in the Euclidean space \\\\mathbb R^n with C1 boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega. If u is a function that is C^1 (or even just continuous) on the closure \\\\bar \\\\Omega of \\\\Omega, its function restriction is well-defined and continuous on \\\\partial \\\\Omega. In other words, it is clear what the values of u on the boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega should be because the function is continuous as we move from the interior to the boundary of the domain. We then call that function g:\\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R} the \\"trace\\" of u that at each point \\\\mathbf x of the boundary has the same values as the limit of u:\\\\Omega \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R} when we move from the interior of \\\\Omega toward \\\\mathbf x. (Remember that \\\\Omega is an open set, so boundary points are not in \\\\Omega and consequently u itself is not defined at boundary points.) If however, u is the solution to some partial differential equation, it is in general a weak solution and only belongs to some Sobolev space. Such functions are in general not continuous, and the operation \\"limit of u:\\\\Omega \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R} when we move from the interior of \\\\Omega toward \\\\mathbf x\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\" that we used above may not be allowed for some \\\\mathbf x because the limit does not yield a unique value for all sequences of points that converge to \\\\mathbf x. It follows that simple function restriction cannot be used to meaningfully define the trace of weak functions. The way out of this difficulty is the observation that while an element u in a Sobolev space may be ill-defined as a function, u can be nevertheless approximated by a sequence (u_n) of C^1 functions defined on the closure of \\\\Omega. Then, the restriction u_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} of u to \\\\partial \\\\Omega is defined as the limit of the sequence of restrictions (u_n _{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}). An alternative approach uses the fact that the elements (distributions) in most Sobolev spaces may be discontinuous at some points, but \\"not too many\\". For example, in 2d, functions in the space H^1 (i.e., the space in which the solution lies for many partial differential equations) can be discontinuous at individual points, but not along lines. Consequently, the limit of a function u \\\\in H^1 may be undefined at individual points on the boundary, but not along the entire boundary, and one can define the trace as that function (or one of those functions) that matches the limit of u \\"almost everywhere\\" on the boundary. Construction of the trace operator To rigorously define the notion of restriction to a function in a Sobolev space, let p\\\\ge 1 be a real number. Consider the linear operator : T:C^1(\\\\bar \\\\Omega)\\\\to L^p(\\\\partial \\\\Omega) defined on the set of all C^1 functions on the closure of \\\\Omega with values in the Lp space L^p(\\\\partial \\\\Omega), given by the formula : T u = u_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}.\\\\, The domain of T is a subset of the Sobolev space W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega). It can be proved that there exists a constant C depending only on \\\\Omega and p, such that : \\\\Tu\\\\_{L^{p}(\\\\partial \\\\Omega)}\\\\le C \\\\u\\\\_{W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega)} for all u in C^1(\\\\bar \\\\Omega). Then, since the C^1 functions on \\\\bar \\\\Omega are dense in W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega), the operator T admits a continuous extension : T:W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega) \\\\to L^p(\\\\partial \\\\Omega)\\\\, defined on the entire space W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega). T is called the trace operator. The restriction (or trace) u_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} of a function u in W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega) is then defined as Tu. This argument can be made more concrete as follows. Given a function u in W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega), consider a sequence of functions (u_n) that are C^1 on \\\\bar \\\\Omega, with u_n converging to u in the norm of W^{1, p}(\\\\Omega). Then, by the above inequality, the sequence u_{n  \\\\partial \\\\Omega} will be convergent in L^p(\\\\partial \\\\Omega). Define : u_{ \\\\partial \\\\Omega} = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} u_{n\\\\,  \\\\partial \\\\Omega}.\\\\, It can be shown that this definition is independent of the sequence (u_n) approximating u. Application Consider the problem of solving Poisson's equation with zero boundary conditions: : \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\Delta u = f \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} = 0. \\\\end{cases} Here, f is a given continuous function on \\\\bar \\\\Omega. With the help of the concept of trace, define the subspace H^1_0(\\\\Omega) to be all functions in the Sobolev space W^{1, 2}(\\\\Omega) (this space is also denoted H^1(\\\\Omega)) whose trace is zero. Then, the problem above can be transformed into its weak formulation : Find u in H^1_0(\\\\Omega) such that : \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\\\\\! abla u(x)\\\\cdot abla v(x)\\\\, dx = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\\\\\! f(x) v(x) \\\\, dx for all v in H^1_0(\\\\Omega). Using the Lax–Milgram theorem one can then prove that this equation has precisely one solution, which implies that the original equation has precisely one weak solution. One can employ similar ideas to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for more complicated partial differential equations and with other boundary conditions (such as Neumann and Robin), with the notion of trace playing an important role in all such problems.

This article refers to traditional prone or kneeling paddleboarding. A derivative of paddleboarding is stand up paddleboarding also called stand up paddle surfing. Paddleboarding is usually performed in the open ocean, with the participant paddling and surfing unbroken swells to cross between islands or journey from one coastal area to another. Champion paddlers can stroke for hours and a race is only a warm-up for well-trained paddlers.  History  = Polynesia = A view of Karakokooa, in Owyhee by John Webber Ships Artist, John Webber, accompanied Captain James Cook to The Sandwich Islands in 1778, and in the lower left foreground of his 1781 engraving is depicted a Paddleboarder/Surfer Rider. = Thomas Edward Blake = Thomas Edward Blake is credited as the pioneer in paddleboard construction in the early 1930s. While restoring historic Hawaiian boards in 1926 for the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Blake built a replica of the previously ignored olo surfboard ridden by ancient Hawaiian alii (kings). He lightened his redwood replica (olo were traditionally made from wiliwili wood) by drilling it full of holes, which he then covered, thus creating the first hollow board, which led to creation of the modern paddleboard. Two years later, using this same , board, Blake won the Pacific Coast Surfriding Championship, first Mainland event integrating both surfing and paddling. Blake then returned to Hawaii to break virtually every established paddling record available, setting and records that stood until 1955. In 1932, using his drastically modified chambered hollow board, now weighing roughly , which over the next decade he would tirelessly promote as a lifeguarding rescue tool, Blake out-paddled top California watermen Pete Peterson and Wally Burton in the first Mainland to Catalina crossing race— in 5 hours, 53 minutes. During the 1930s, Blake-influenced hollow boards (called “cigar boards” by reporters and later “kook boxes” by surfers) would be used in roughly equal proportion to solid plank boards for both paddling and surfing until the new Hot Curl boards led wave-riding in a new direction. For paddleboarding, however, the basic principles of Blake's 1926 design remain relevant even today. =Renaissance= Paddleboarding experienced a renaissance in the early 1980s after Los Angeles County lifeguard Rabbi Norm Shifren's “Waterman Race”— from Point Dume to Malibu—inspired surf journalist Craig Lockwood to begin production on a high quality stock paddleboard—known as the \\"Waterman.\\" Its design, that has arguably won more races than any other stock paddleboard, remains a popular choice today. Shortly after, L.A, surfboard shaper Joe Bark and San Diego shaper Mike Eaton began production, and soon with Brian Szymanski's North County Paddleboards (NCP) became three of the largest U.S. paddleboard makers, eventually producing nearly half of the estimated 3–400 paddleboards made each year in the U.S. today. L.A. lifeguards Gibby Gibson and Buddy Bohn revived the Catalina Classic event in 1982 for a field of 10 competitors. Concurrently in Hawaii, the annual Independence Day Paddleboard Race from Sunset to Waimea was drawing a few hundred competitors, many using surfboards due to lack of proper paddleboards on the Islands. As paddlers began ordering boards from the Mainland, local surfboard shapers like Dennis Pang (now one of Hawaii's largest paddleboard makers) moved quickly to fill the local niche. On both fronts, paddleboarding has been consistently gaining momentum and popularity. In 1996 the sport of paddleboarding was making a comeback. Once the domain of only dedicated watermen and big wave riders in the 1950s and 60s, the sport found a new set of acolytes on the North Shore of Oahu and in Honolulu at the Outrigger Canoe Club. At that time Hawaii's top paddler was Dawson Jones. After completing the Catalina Classic, from Catalina Island to Manhattan Beach, Jones returned to Hawaii inspired to establish a race across the Ka’iwi Channel. In 1997, the race that is now known as the Paddleboard World Championships was born. Today the race sells out with both prone and stand up paddleboarders (SUP) from around the world who compete in solo and team divisions. Olympics Paddleboarding may be added to the Olympics and the Court of Arbitration for Sport will decide whether it is represented by the International Surfing Association or the International Canoe Federation. Equipment Paddleboards are divided by length into three classes: Stock, 14 Foot, and Unlimited. Stock boards are long, and best for paddlers around or less. Stock boards are easy to accelerate and fast in choppy water. But with their short waterline, they lack the calm water top speed of 14 foot or Unlimited boards. 14-foot class boards are arguably the best all-around board. At in length, they combine many of the best characteristics of stock boards with nearly the calm water speed of Unlimited boards. Only about half of all races have a 14-foot class. Unlimited boards are the fastest boards afloat. Their speed comes from their long waterline and this also gives them a longer glide per stroke. Though usually long, the class is defined as \\"anything that floats\\" and boards over have been built. They can be difficult to handle in choppy water and their length makes them harder to transport and store. Modern Unlimited boards have rudders that are steered by a tiller between the paddler's feet. There is an additional board class, the 10' 6\\". These boards are not used in the long ocean races that are run with the Stock, 14 Foot and Unlimited boards, but are used in surf and sprint races. 10' 6\\" class boards are known by several names: Ten-Six, Sprint Board, Surf Racer, or Racing Mal. Paddleboarding can also be done on various pieces of equipment, including surfboards. Paddleboards are made of fiberglass, epoxy, and/or carbon fibre and are generally quite large, ranging from to . An emerging paddleboard technology is an epoxy surfboard, which are stronger and lighter than traditional fiberglass. Cost of new boards range from $1,500 to $3,500 for custom boards. Used boards that have been well kept are in high demand and can be sold fairly easily on paddleboard listing web sites.

Early life Chiriac was born on May 8, 1941,According to his declarations. Other sources indicate May 6, 1942, in which case he would have been born in Uspenca, Romania. in Uspenkova, Bessarabia, Soviet Union. He went to high school in Piteşti and graduated from the University of Bucharest's Faculty of English Language. Chiriac made his radio debut in 1963, with the show Jazz of Yesterday and Today, later Jazz magazin. Beginning on July 10, 1967, he produced for Radio România the most popular music show of its day, Metronom. Together with Geo Limbăşanu, he presented listeners with the latest information from the pop, rock and jazz scenes. Shortly after the August 21, 1968, Invasion of Czechoslovakia (in which Romania did not participate) he played a ballad by Mircea Florian which relates how five small wolves and a bigger one attacked a sheepfold, and later put on The Beatles' \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" According to his nephew, \\"everything came to an end one evening\\" when he played the song, \\"which had escaped the censor, who didn't know English. But the song was heard on the show by the wrong people and was banned in 1969\\", also leading to Metronom's cancellation that year. From adolescence he developed a passion for jazz, gathering all the information he could about jazz musicians and listening to jazz songs wherever he could. In his notebooks he copied books, chronicles, interviews and news from specialty magazines. His aunt later recalled, \\"In high school music was his only preoccupation. He wasted nights writing. In the morning he would wake up with great difficulty to go to school.\\"Hurdubaia. Some of the notebooks ended up in the possessions of important Romanian musicians, such as Radu Maltopol, Cristian Colan and Johnny Răducanu, being the only possible source for ready information about jazz at the time. Founding members of the European Jazz Federation (October 15–16, 1967). Chiriac is second from left. Chiriac wrote press articles as well as liner notes for the Jazz collection. In 1965, he published a study of jazz in the magazine Secolul XX; a year later, he wrote the preface for the Romanian edition of Louis Armstrong's My Life in New Orleans. He was a founding member of the European Jazz Federation in 1967. According to the minutes, he described the difficult conditions of Romanian jazz musicians at the time and accepted the idea of a federation under UNESCO protection. He said the federation should focus on creating a jazz academy, a bureau for international concerts and a centre where audio and TV recordings could be exchanged. A great jazz aficionado, Chiriac would copy entire discs onto tapes and arrange them in the station archive. Aurel Gherghel later said, \\"The station's whole archive was written and arranged by Cornel Chiriac.\\" In 1969, Chiriac organised and advertised the first national jazz festival in Romania, held in Ploieşti. He also arranged for the songs played during the festival to be recorded. As a producer, he especially backed the Timișoara band Phoenix and the Bucharest band Sideral. He completed important recordings with the former in Radio România's studio (1968–69) and promoted them on different occasions. In 1969, took steps to bring them to the Golden Stag Festival, managing to include them in the lineup. Coincidentally, Cliff Richard, who eight years earlier had played in The Young Ones, a film that inspired many Romanian rock bands, was scheduled to sing there. Meanwhile, the Phoenix members were staying at Bucharest's Hotel Nord so the censors could watch them. During the festival, Chiriac returned from Braşov with the bad news that Phoenix' concert had been cancelled, but returned hoping to resolve the problem in extremis. Unable to convince the organisers, in protest, he locked himself in his hotel room and set fire to the curtains. The hotel employees and firemen broke down the door to stop the blaze, while Chiriac disappeared during the commotion, taking with him just the tapes with Phoenix. At Radio Free Europe Cornel Chiriac in the RFE studio A few days later, he managed to leave Romania and arrived in Austria with the help of a falsified invitation (received during the Braşov festival and having as its initial destination Poland). He spent some time at the Traiskirchen refugee camp, where he was discovered by Radio Free Europe director Noël Bernard. After getting his official documents in order, he continued his activity in Munich, in RFE's Romanian-language section. He re-launched Metronom, Jazz magazin and started a third show, Jazz à la carte. At first, Chiriac used his microphone to express the anger he felt against those who had hindered his work at Radio România. Ioana Măgură Bernard later recalled: \\"Often, after doing something without thinking, Cornel had such problems with the German authorities and with the American heads of RFE that he was almost kicked out of Germany and off radio\\". Later, according to Noël Bernard, \\"he realised that not politics but music was his calling\\". Until his death, his musical activity was rich, and included a Romanian translation of the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. On March 4, 1975, near midnight, Chiriac was stabbed near his car, in a Munich parking lot. An hour later, a female student returning home found him. The first suspect to be arrested was 17-year-old Mario Gropp, the last person seen with Chiriac that evening. In Romania, there was talk of a political assassination committed by the Securitate. Chiriac's body was cremated in Munich and his ashes brought back to Romania by his mother. He is buried in Bucharest's Reînvierea Cemetery. Legacy Journalists later recalled that his murder was greeted with sadness in Bucharest. Alexandru Sipa organised a soirée at the Braşov jazz club, in memoriam. In Bucharest, Phoenix was in the Electrecord studio, recording the album Cantofabule. Octavian Ursulescu said in an interview, \\"The news that a good friend to all of us, Cornel Chiriac, had been assassinated, came to us in the Tomis studio; we all cried like children...\\" On February 24, 1995, the Cornel Chiriac Jazz Club opened in Ploieşti.

It was said to depict the death of a Republican Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth (FIJL) soldier, during the Battle of Cerro Muriano in the Spanish Civil War. The soldier in the photograph was later claimed to be the anarchist militiaman Federico Borrell García. The photo appears to capture a Republican soldier at the very moment of his death. The soldier is shown collapsing backward after being fatally shot in the head, with his rifle slipping out of his right hand. The pictured soldier is dressed in civilian clothing, but is wearing a leather cartridge belt. Following its publication, the photograph was acclaimed as one of the greatest ever taken, but since the 1970s, there have been significant doubts about its authenticity due to its location, the identity of its subject, and the discovery of staged photographs taken at the same time and place. One printed edition is now held in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.The Falling Soldier, Metropolitan Museum of Art History \\"Freedom is not Free\\", a sculpture by Yigal Tumarkin, located in Netanya, Israel. Capa described how he took the photograph in a 1947 radio interview: Upon publication of the photograph, there were allegations from the Falange, an extreme nationalist political group in Spain, that the photograph was staged. However, outside of Spain, it remained unquestioned as a legitimate documentary photograph until the 1970s. Authenticity debate While some, including one of Capa's biographers, Richard Whelan, have defended the photograph's authenticity,Whelan, Richard (2002). Proving that Robert Capa's \\"Falling Soldier\\" is genuine: A detective story, American Masters. doubts have been raised since 1975.Knightley, Phillip (1975). The First Casualty: From the Crimea to Vietnam; The War Correspondent as Hero, Propagandist, and Myth Maker. New York: Harcourt, Brace Staging photos was a common occurrence during the Spanish Civil War because of limits imposed upon photojournalists' freedom of movement: unable to go to active fronts, or cordoned off when they were, photographers resorted to pictures of soldiers feigning combat. Capa claimed the photograph was taken at the battle site of Cerro Muriano, but research suggests it was taken in the town of Espejo, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) away. A 2007 documentary, La sombra del iceberg, claims that the picture was staged and that Frederico Borrell García is not the individual in the picture. In José Manuel Susperregui's 2009 book Sombras de la Fotografía (\\"Shadows of Photography\\"), he concludes that the photograph was not taken at Cerro Muriano, but at another location about 30 miles (48 km) away. Susperregui determined the location of the photograph by examining the background of other photographs from the same sequence as the Falling Soldier, in which a range of mountains can be seen. He then e-mailed images to librarians and historians in towns near Córdoba, asking if they recognized the landscape, and received a positive response from the Spanish town of Espejo. Because Espejo was miles away from the battle lines when Capa was there, Susperregui said this meant that the Falling Soldier photograph was staged, as were all the others in the same series, supposedly taken on the front. Susperregui also pointed out more contradictions in the accepted account of the photograph, noting that Capa mentioned in interviews that the militiaman had been killed by a burst of machine-gun fire rather than a sniper's bullet. Capa also gave different accounts of the vantage point and technique he used to obtain the photograph. Spanish newspapers, including a newspaper from Barcelona, El Periódico de Catalunya, sent reporters to Espejo to verify the location of the photograph. The reporters returned with photographs showing a close match between the present day skyline and the background of Capa's photographs. Willis E. Hartshorn, director of the International Center of Photography, argued against the claims that the photograph was staged. He suggested that the soldier in the photograph had been killed by a sniper firing from a distance while posing for the staged photograph. Susperregui dismissed the suggestion, pointing out that the front lines were too widely separated and that there was no documentary evidence for the use of snipers on the Córdoba front. There is also doubt about the identification of the photograph's subject. It was believed that Frederico Borrell García was the subject, but he was actually killed at Cerro Muriano, and was shot while sheltered behind a tree. In addition to a lack of clarity of the location of the photograph, Frederico Borrell García did not greatly resemble the subject of the photograph. \\"The Mexican Suitcase\\" Photographs by Capa, Gerda Taro, and David Seymour, came to light in early 2007, when three cardboard boxes of negatives, also known as the \\"Mexican Suitcase\\", arrived in the mail at the International Center of Photography in New York. The 'suitcase' contained hundreds of Capa's negatives. These films were taken to Mexico at the end of the war. They are now with the Capa archives at the International Center of Photography. However, there was no negative of Capa's Falling Soldier. Despite the lack of a negative, hundreds of images that toured major art galleries in 2008 showed pictures taken at the same location and at the same time. A detailed analysis of the landscape in the series of pictures taken with that of the Falling Soldier has proven that the action, whether genuine or staged, took place near Espejo.

Because of its large and broad tail, the Tosakin is a weak and even clumsy swimmer requiring it be kept in still water without a strong current. The Tosakin has been often and mistakenly reported by as a weak fish due to inbreeding, however in reality is as hardy as most other breeds of fancy, deep-bodied goldfish. Like many other deep-bodied goldfish, the Tosakin is especially prone to swim bladder problems. The Tosakin is considered a \\"top-view\\" fish and is traditionally kept in large shallow bowls or small ponds to be viewed from above. Seen from above, with its pointed head and deep, round trunk, the tail is obviously a flat half circle. Tosakins are metallic red, red and white or \\"uncolored\\" iron-black. Recently calico fish with Tosakin body conformations have been developed, but many purists have yet to recognize this coloration as a true Tosakin. The Tosakin is slow growing compared to most other breeds of fancy goldfish with a maximum attainable length of around eight inches. Origins The Tosakins were first developed by a lower-ranking samurai in the Tosa fief (now Kōchi Prefecture), in Shikoku, Japan and probably did not reach other parts of Japan until the mid- twentieth century. U.S. air attacks on Kōchi during World War II in 1945 and an earthquake in 1946 were believed to have wiped out the Tosakin variety. However, Mr. Hiroe Tamura(田村広衛), a Japanese hobbyist who had lost all of his fish, scoured the area and found six fish (2 breeders and 4 two-year-olds) at a local restaurant called Kyousuirou (鏡水楼). He managed to trade a large bottle of shōchū (焼酎)(Japanese sweet-potato vodka) for the fish, and was able to successfully revive the Tosakins in Kochi. In 1969, the Japanese government declared the Tosakin a Tennen Kinenbutsu(天然記念物) or Natural Treasure of Kōchi Prefecture. In 1971 the breed had reached Tokyo, where a small group of young and avid enthusiasts painstakingly propagated and popularized the variety. The Tosakin Preservation Society (トサキン保存会) was founded a few years later in Aichi prefecture (愛知県）.

It was established in 1917 in accordance with The Workers Compensation Act, which was passed the previous year. It is an injury and disability insurance system for workers and employers, paid for by employers. The board was formed as a result of a compromise: injured workers gave up the right to sue employers in exchange for no-fault insurance in the case of work related injuries or illness, while employers agreed to pay for the system providing they would be protected from lawsuits. One of the problems that workers' compensation was created to solve, namely, the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that, and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers. Individual immunity is the necessary corollary to collective liability. The board is run by a board of directors that consists of 10 members appointed by the Government of Manitoba from nominations submitted by labour, employers and the public. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is a non-voting member of the Board of Directors. The current Chairperson of the Board of Directors is Michael D.

It was released in Japan in 2010 and in North America and Europe in 2011. The game is both the third entry in the Parasite Eve video game series, based on the titular Japanese novel, and a spin-off, having only a loose connection to events from past games. The game features a third-person shooter-based combat system with role-playing mechanics. A key mechanic is the Overdive ability, which allows the player to possess pre-positioned human allies and inflict damage upon enemies. The game takes place in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have appeared from beneath Manhattan and decimated the city. To fight back against the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia two years before the game's events. Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of battles against the Twisted. At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the Twisted and regain her memories. The 3rd Birthday was created as a conceptual rebirth for Aya's character, as well as a means of re-introducing her to the gaming community, with it being over a decade since the last game in the series. Among the staff were Hajime Tabata, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Isamu Kamikokuryo, and Aya's original designer Tetsuya Nomura. Originally announced as an episodic title for mobile phones, the game was later changed into a PSP exclusive. Upon release, the game reached sixth place in Japanese sales charts, and was among the top five games in North American and UK sales charts during its opening months. Reviews have been mixed; critics praised the presentation and several parts of the gameplay, while opinions were mixed about the story, and many cited difficulties with camera control and some of the shooter mechanics. Several reviewers have also made negative comments on Aya's portrayal. Gameplay HUD displays. The 3rd Birthday is a third-person role-playing shooter. The player controls series protagonist Aya Brea through rendered-to- scale environments in from a third-person perspective. The game plays out as a series of missions, between which Aya rests at the Counter Twisted Investigation headquarters, which acts as the game's main hub. In the hub, Aya can receive briefings for missions, view additional documents, buy and customize new weapons. She also has the option to transport back there should she die during a mission. The game can be saved both at the hub and in safe zones within missions. At the end of each mission, Aya is given a grade based on performance, enemies killed, and the number of times she died. Depending on her score, she will earn differing amounts of Bounty Points, a currency used to customize weapons and repair protective gear in the hub area. During missions, players navigate a series of linear linked areas fighting off multiple enemies. Items can be picked up during missions, such as grenades and medical kits. Aya has access to multiple guns for use in combat, including handguns, assault rifles and shotguns. By holding down a button on the controller, Aya automatically aims at an enemy and can fire at will. Taking cover behind objects or shields, or standing idle outside of battle, allows Aya to regenerate health. While in combat, an energy meter is charged and can be activated when full. When activated, Aya entered \\"Liberation Mode\\", a state enabling her to move around the battlefield at high speed for a short period of time. In most battle situations, Aya is accompanied by a group of allied NPC (non-playable character) soldiers that the player can direct around the battle area. Available commands include offering supporting fire, directly attacking enemies, or staying behind cover. They can also all fire at the same enemy in certain situations, dealing high damage. Each NPC has a separate health meter, and is permanently removed from battle upon defeat. Central to combat is Overdive, an ability which enables Aya to transmit herself between bodies. If her health is low, Aya can transport herself into the body of an allied NPC, taking on their health level, position and current weapon in the process. NPCs not controlled by Aya are controlled by the game's AI. Aya can remain in a body for the duration of a level, or until the unit has died. If Aya cannot jump to another body, she dies and the level must either be restarted or exited. Overdive can be activated at any time, enabling Aya to transport around the battlefield to avoid enemy attacks or save herself when her current unit's health is low. Overdive can also be used to attack enemies if Aya maintains a sustained assault. After a time, a triangle icon appears on enemies, allowing her to perform an Overdive attack, dealing high damage to the targeted enemy. During combat, Aya gains experience points and gains experience levels when a certain quantity is achieved. Gaining a level both restores her health and raises her maximum health and energy levels. Weapons also gain levels the more they are used. In addition to leveling up, Aya's stats can be customized using Over Energy (OE) clips found during missions or acquired during Overdive attacks. Using a 3x3 grid accessed in the hub area, certain OE clips grand different stat boosts and abilities. Creating a new grid automatically deletes the effects of the original. Plot The game's story plays out in episodes, similar to a television series, with many events told out of sequence. On Christmas Eve of 2012, monstrous creatures dubbed as \\"Babels\\" appear in New York City. Along with lifeforms spawned by them called the Twisted, they lay waste to the city and consume any human in their path. By the following year, an investigatory team known as the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation) has been formed. One of the CTI members is Aya Brea, who was found outside St. Thomson's Cathedral in 2010, just before the Babels and Twisted began appearing. Dr. Hyde Bohr, Chief of the CTI, finds that Aya is suffering from amnesia, and that her personality has changed. After taking Aya in, the CTI discovered that she was capable of transferring her soul from body to body independent of time, an ability dubbed \\"Overdive\\", which enables her to fight the Twisted. Bohr and the others planned to use this unique ability to travel back through time and prevent the disaster, developing a machine called \\"Overdive System\\" to allow Aya to travel into the past and change events. As she embarks on each mission, she is confronted by powerful, sentient Twisted born from corrupted humans, later dubbed High Ones. One such High One is Kyle Madigan, a man she met and fell in love with during Parasite Eve II. As she defeats each High One, she regains pieces of her memory, most prominently her memories of being engaged to Kyle, and the existence of Eve Brea, her adopted sister. After an incident that saw the CTI HQ and the Overdive device destroyed by the Kyle High One, Aya reunites with Kunihiko Maeda, a man who aided her in Parasite Eve, to resolve the entire mystery behind the appearance of the Babel, Twisted and High Ones. Aya eventually discovers that Bohr is himself a High One. Bohr masterminded the death of other High Ones in order to form the Grand Babel, which functions like a giant Overdive system. Bohr seeks to dive back in the past to Time Zero, the point where events were set in motion, to fulfill his plan for the survival of his own species from a time war cycle between humans, the Twisted, and the High Ones. Aya battles Bohr and is pulled with him into Time Zero, where she discovers the truth. In 2010 at St. Thomson's Cathedral, Aya and Kyle were going to be married. The Cathedral was attacked by a SWAT team and Aya was killed. Eve attempted to save Aya by sending her consciousness into Aya's body, creating the Overdive ability. The event caused Aya's consciousness to separate from her body and fragment through time to create the Twisted, Eve's consciousness became trapped in Aya's body while parts of Eve's body were transplanted into the people close to them creating the High Ones. The \\"Aya\\" of the main story is in fact Eve in Aya's body. After these revelations, Eve returns to her body and is asked by Bohr to assimilate him and trigger the birth of a new species. Eve refuses, and when Bohr tries to force the process, a reborn Aya shoots him to death. Aya then reveals that to avert the birth of the Twisted and High Ones, the sources (Aya and Eve) must be removed. Expressing her regret of not being able to marry Kyle, she tells Eve to shoot her. In a fit of emotion, Eve switches bodies with Aya before shooting her, creating a new timeline where Eve's body and Aya's consciousness do not exist, erasing the game's events. Though Eve offers to marry Kyle, he refuses and hints that he is going to find Aya. In a post-credits sequence four years after the game's events, Eve is walking the streets of New York and is wished a \\"Happy Fourth Birthday\\" by a woman resembling Aya. Development Concepts for a third installment in the Parasite Eve video game series had been around for some time. As work was being finished on Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Nomura voiced his wish to create a new game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA mobile service. In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday at the same time as fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled. The final version of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, a company created by former Capcom staff members. As the new form of The 3rd Birthday had transformed into a third- person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO Yoichi Wada recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter Lost Planet: Extreme Condition, Tabata agreed to the collaboration. While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game as if for the PlayStation 3 home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP. During development, the team sought creative help from the team developing Final Fantasy XIII for the visual design. The team had previously experimented with shooters with Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII, but this time they wanted to create something closer to a third-person shooter. The team was assembled by Tabata based on their development experience with action games. While working inside the control and hardware limitations of the title, the team created firearms and the lock-on mechanic as the fundamental attack action, instead of the free-roaming style of a standard third-person shooter. While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies. During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, to find out which of the planned features were popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy. Nomura was among the first to suggest this feature originally, tying it with increased enemy difficulty to present a dilemma to players who \\"might purposely make her take damage just to see more of her body\\". Nomura worked on the character designs for the main cast. He was originally only going to work on Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved one of the most difficult aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom. While many of the concepts for the final version were present in the original mobile version, such as Overdive and the Twisted, the original story was scrapped when the game came to upgraded platforms. In creating the story for The 3rd Birthday, the team took inspiration from the 10-year gap in the character's in-game and real-time history. This meant that it would be difficult to create a straightforward sequel, so the team instead decided to make the game about Aya's return. Toriyama imagined story concepts such as the snowy New York setting and the image of a bloodstained wedding dress. These two concepts survived the platform upgrade. Over the course of the development, he adjusted the plot numerous times to be more adult-oriented and to include complex narrative twists. The original concept was to make the game feel like a television drama, with multiple cliffhangers and moments of high drama. The game was designed from the outset as having no direct connection to the previous Parasite Eve games. The game's title came from it being Aya's third video game appearance, as well as it being a noticeable change in setting. The game's logo was designed to both look like the letter \\"B\\" and the number \\"3\\". It was originally only going to represent the number, but Nomura added the extra lines to display the game's \\"multi-faceted\\" nature. A notable addition was the option to skip cutscenes, a feature the team regretted leaving out of Crisis Core. Music The music for The 3rd Birthday was composed by Mitsuto Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Sekito, with additional work by original Parasite Eve composer Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was involved from an early stage, when The 3rd Birthday was still a mobile game. When she was originally asked to compose for the title, she was involved with a number of other projects which made handling the entire score difficult. When asked whether she wanted to work with anyone on the composition, she suggested Suzuki and Sekito. The general instruction was to follow the pattern used by the music for Parasite Eve, with Suzuki and Sekito handling the majority of tracks, going so far as referring to the songs from the original Parasite Eve when handling remixes of old themes. In keeping with the game's other development goals, Shimomura wanted to alter some of the established music, although she asked the team to include familiar themes from earlier games for fans. Suzuki was responsible for a large amount of track mixing. Sekito was mostly involved with choosing and helping with instrumentation, in particular whether to include symphonic music. The composers had a relatively high degree of freedom, but they also had problems when composing some tracks that did not fit into selected scenes. Re-orchestrations of two pieces of classical music, \\"Sleepers Wake\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, and \\"Joy to the World\\", a popular Christmas song, were used by Suzuki and Shimomura respectively to represent key moments and motifs within the game. The order of songs in the game was created to reflect the situation in a level. These variations were emphasized during mixing, while they also needed to adjust the mixing and track length based on the game as a whole. For the game's theme song, the company collaborated with Japanese rock band Superfly. The game's theme song Eyes on Me, described as a \\"standard love song\\", was specially composed by the band for the game. It was the band's first video game theme song. The game's soundtrack was released as an album by Square Enix on December 22, 2010. The 3rd Birthday Original Soundtrack contains 66 tracks across 3 discs and has a total length of 2:56:52. Reception During production, Nomura and Tabata stated that the team were aiming to sell 500,000 copies of the game, a sales-goal based strategy they had previously used for Crisis Core. During its first week, The 3rd Birthday debuted at #6 in Japanese gaming charts, selling 140,000 units. By the end of 2011, the game had sold 249,747 units in Japan. The game reached the top of the charts for PSP games in North America by the beginning of April 2011, overtaking fellow Square Enix title Dissidia 012: Final Fantasy and the PSP port of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. Later that month, it had fallen to #3 in US charts, remaining there into June of that year. In the UK during the same initial period, it reached #3, tailing behind Dissidia 012 and Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu praised the title's gameplay, calling Aya \\"deeply customizable\\", finding the Overdive system and its strategic elements exhilarating and saying that those undaunted by the high difficulty would find much enjoyment in repeated playthroughs. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com called it \\"an interesting blend of RPG and shooter\\", praising the working of Overdive. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was less enthusiastic, referring to the conflicts with the Twisted as \\"relentless and ultimately repetitive\\", finding the high difficulty off-putting and Aya's movement speed unsuited for battle. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez enjoyed the control layout and gameplay, but cited difficulties with the camera. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot said that the game sometimes succeeded in creating tension, but that other battles were frustrating and the camera was difficult. IGN's Patrick Kolan was pleased with the effort put into the game, and generally praised the battle and later levels, despite several cases of repetition during the main campaign. Emily Gera of VideoGamer.com found the basic shooter gameplay repetitive, but felt that the gameplay was saved by the Overdive ability and the quality of fights. Parish said the game looked \\"gorgeous\\" and the soundtrack \\"exceptional\\". Petit praised the CGI cutscenes and varied level environments, and said the score \\"shifts adeptly between haunting and thrilling to suit the action.\\" Kolan generally called the game one of the best-looking entries on the platform, and praised the soundtrack, despite it being \\"a little ho-hum\\". Gonzalez also praised the cutscenes, while citing the environments as \\"[ranging] from detailed to drab\\". Famitsu was less positive about the story, saying that the mix of different elements made it \\"a bit hard to follow.\\" Parish positively noted connections to the second game, but found the later story developments either confusing or weak, and disliked the way returning supporting characters had been changed. Petit said that those who wanted a straightforward story would be disappointed, and positively noted its exploration of existence, identity, and memory. Her main criticism was with the dialogue, which she referred to as \\"stilted\\". Kolan also faulted the voice acting and localization, especially when compared to games such as Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. Gonzalez cited the story as intriguing, with \\"plenty of plot twists\\". Parish and Petit were both highly critical of Aya's portrayal: Parish disliked both her outfit, which seemed to conform too much female stereotypes in video games, and the clothes-tearing mechanic, which seemed to be included merely to flaunt her sexuality. Petit shared many points of criticism with Parish, also noting that Aya's portrayal of \\"one-part action hero, one-part submissive sex object\\" was wrong for a lead character, and that Aya's in-combat vocals were not suited to the game's situations. Reed referred to Aya as \\"[a] sighing, whimpering lead character\\".

The flowers bloom from mid-spring to early summer. Description Prairie smoke has pinnately divided leaves with 7–17 primary leaflets; there are also a few smaller secondary leaflets inserted between some of the primary leaflets. They are arranged in a rosette at ground level and are semi-evergreen: some basal leaves remain over the winter and often turn reddish purple. The flowers bloom in spring. They appear on short reddish purple-tinged stems high and are arranged in umbels of 3 to 5 flowers. At the base of the umbel are leaflike green to reddish purple bracts. Sometimes there are also pairs of leaflike bracts on the stem below the umbel or on the stems of individual flowers. While blooming, the flowers nod downwards and remain mostly closed and bud-like, except for a tiny opening at the bottom. The five petals are cream to yellowish, suffused with pink or purple, but are mostly covered by the five red sepals. Between the sepals are five narrow bractlets. Hidden within the flower are a central cluster of pistils and a ring of many stamens around them. Pollinated flowers turn upwards and open up. The pistils in the middle of the flower develop into heads of seeds with long fuzzy hairs that point upwards. The hairs resemble mauve smoke, hence the name prairie smoke. The leaves and flowers grow from a caudex. The plant spreads by short underground rhizomes.  Distribution and habitat  In the United States, Geum triflorum occurs in the west, midwest, and the state of New York. In Canada it is reported as growing in every province west of Ontario as well as the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The species prefers to grow in dry, well-drained soils in full sun in most of its native range. It prefers cool summer climates, but it is intolerant of wet soils during the winter.left Ecology The flowers produce both nectar and pollen. They are visited mainly by bumblebees, which are able to force their way into the mostly closed flowers and reach the nectar. They also buzz- pollinate to dislodge pollen from the stamens and gather it to feed their young. Smaller bees such as sweat bees from the genus Lasioglossum feed on pollen grains from the opening of the flower. Bumblebees are the only effective cross-pollinators. Various insects chew holes in the top of the flower, near the stem, to reach the nectar. Uses Some Native Americans once made a tea from the plant's roots. Some Plateau Indian tribes used three- flowered avens to treat tuberculosis.

It ends shortly afterward at a second intersection with LA 77, the main highway through town. To the north, LA 77 connects with LA 10 to Morganza. The route is classified as a rural local road by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 410 vehicles between Livonia and Lottie, increasing to 1,060 between Lottie and Fordoche. The posted speed limit is in Livonia, in Lottie and Fordoche, generally increasing to between points. LA 81 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 81 was part of two separate state highways. Southern section The southern section running from Livonia west to Lottie was a small part of State Route 7, which was designated in 1921 by an act of the state legislature. Route 7 was originally an important cross- state route known as the Evangeline Highway and generally followed the modern US 190 corridor. The section that is now LA 81 served as part of the main highway between Baton Rouge and Opelousas until it was bypassed by the Airline Highway in 1933. Two years later, the new route became part of US 190, which was extended west into Texas from its original terminus at the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge. Most of the old road running west from Lottie to the Atchafalaya River opposite Krotz Springs was abandoned shortly afterward. As was often the case during this era, the state highway department did not move the Route 7 designation onto the new highway. As a result, Route 7 became discontinuous and served as little more than a local road in the area until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. Northern section The remaining section of the current LA 81, running northward from Lottie to Fordoche, was designated as State Route C-1943 prior to the 1955 renumbering. It was created in the 1940s and, like all routes added after 1930, it was numbered by the state highway department rather than by the state legislature and carried a \\"C-\\" prefix. =Post-1955 route history= The original designation of LA 81 as part of two different highway classes is reflected in this 1960s DOTD milepost map. LA 81 was created in 1955 as a collective renumbering of the surviving portion of former State Route 7 between Lottie and Livonia as well the entirety of former State Route C-1943. With the 1955 renumbering, the state highway department initially categorized all routes into three classes: \\"A\\" (primary), \\"B\\" (secondary), and \\"C\\" (farm-to-market). The northern section of LA 81 was categorized as Class \\"B\\" and the southern section as Class \\"C.\\" This system has since been updated and replaced by a more specific functional classification system that now designates the entire route as a rural local road. However, the route of LA 81 has remained the same to the present day. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the entire route of LA 81 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.

The brand ambassador is meant to embody the corporate identity in appearance, demeanor, values and ethics. The key element of brand ambassadors is their ability to use promotional strategies that will strengthen the customer-product-service relationship and influence a large audience to buy and consume more. Predominantly, a brand ambassador is known as a positive spokesperson, an opinion leader or a community influencer, appointed as an internal or external agent to boost product or service sales and create brand awareness. Today, \\"brand ambassador\\" as a term has expanded beyond celebrity branding to self- branding or personal brand management. Professional figures, such as good-will and non-profit ambassadors, promotional models, testimonials and brand advocates have formed as an extension of the same concept, taking into account the requirements of every company. The term brand ambassador loosely refers to a commodity which covers all types of event staff, varying between trade show hosts, in-store promotional members and street teams. Previously, the job of a brand ambassador was undertaken typically by a celebrity or someone of a well- known presence, who was often paid considerably for their time and effort. Nowadays however, a brand ambassador can be anyone who has knowledge or can identify certain needs a brand is seeking. The fashion industry, however, still solely relies on celebrity clientele in order to remain brand ambassadors. Furthermore, brand ambassadors are considered to be the key salesperson for a product or service on offer. They must remain well-informed when it comes to the brand they are representing, due to their nature of being the go-to person when questions arise from consumers. The brand ambassador's job is to drive results through communication tools either publicly, such as social media, or privately including emails, messaging and further one-to-one channels. History =Rise of brand managers= The concepts of brands and brand marketing have evolved over decades. Traditionally, consumers were familiar with only a few products that were available in the market. Beginning from the 1870s a number of companies began pushing 'branded products,' which familiarized consumers with more brands. From 1915 through the 1920s, manufacturer brands were established and developed further, which increased companies' reliance on brand advertising and marketing. However, the Great Depression led to a severe drawback in brand progress, as companies were left with few ways to increase revenue and get their business back on track. For the sake of their brand and survival in a hopeless market, companies such as Procter and Gamble, General Foods and Unilever developed the discipline of brand management. The \\"brand manager system\\" refers to the type of organizational structure in which brands or products are assigned to managers who are responsible for their performance. =Era of change= From the early- to mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, more firms moved toward adopting brand managers. The sudden boom in the economy, followed by a growing middle class population and birth rate, increased the demand for products within the market. This led to a steady competition among a number of manufacturers who found it hard to get their products noticed amidst the pre-existing brands. By the year 1967, 84% of large consumer packaged goods manufacturers had brand managers. Brand managers were also being referred to as \\"product managers\\" whose sole priority shifted from simply brand building to boosting up the company's sales and profit margin. \\"The product manager is man of the hour in marketing organizations.... Modern marketing needs the product manager,\\" raved one 1960s article. Over the course of several years, brand managers continued to exist as a medium that would help boost company revenue. In the 1990s, Marketing UK highlighted that brand managers are a part of an \\"outdated organizational system\\" while \\"the brand manager system has encouraged brand proliferation, which in turn has led to debilitating cannibalization and resource constraints.\\" =Evolution of brand managers to brand ambassadors= From the 1990s to early 2000s, brand management itself evolved as brand asset management. Davis defined Brand Asset Management Strategy as \\"a balanced investment approach for building the meaning of the brand, communicating it internally and externally, and leveraging it to increase brand profitability, brand asset value, and brand returns over time.\\" =College campus brand ambassadors= Campus ambassadors (also known as “brand representatives” and “brand ambassadors”) are college students who spread the word about the company that they represent. The goal of campus ambassadors is to help the company with marketing programs on campus to target the college demographic. This can be achieved by throwing events, hosting workshops, and utilizing social media to promote the brand or company. = Social media brand ambassadors = Social media brand ambassadors (also known as micro- influencers or nano-influencers) are social media users who spread the word about a company/brand or its products by posting about them on social media and promoting them to their unique social audience. Usually social media brand ambassadors are part of a larger \\"Ambassador program\\" run by a company where the company gives each ambassador a \\"referral code\\" or \\"referral link\\" to promote with. For example, the ambassador would be given a code like \\"ambassador15\\" that would be valid for 15% off on the company's online store. Then, whenever that code is used, the company is able to easily trace it back to that particular ambassador, and can reward that ambassador for helping bring in that sale to the company via a sales commission, free products, or social media exposure. Brand ambassador programs are becoming a huge part of the digital and social media marketing landscape as modern consumers are wanting to become more integral parts of recommending and promoting the brands they love. Contemporary terms =Celebrity branding= Using celebrities as brand ambassadors is not a new concept. Creswell highlights that, \\"film stars in the 1940s posed for cigarette companies, and Bob Hope pitched American Express in the late 1950s. Joe Namath slipped into Hanes pantyhose in the 1970s, and Bill Cosby jiggled for Jell-O for three decades. Sports icons like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods elevated the practice, often scoring more in endorsement and licensing dollars than from their actual sports earnings.\\" Large corporations realized that the overall image of a brand ambassador within society is an integral element in attracting consumer attention. As a result, there was a substantial increase in the role of celebrities as brand ambassadors. It was assumed that integrating a celebrity to a brand would increase chances of it being sold, which made companies value the business ideal of a 'brand ambassador.' The case study of the famous watch brand Omega, illustrates that the brand faced a severe crash in sales in the 1970s due to the Japanese Quartz phenomenon. Michault believes that, \\"by the time Omega had seen the error of its ways, the damage to its reputation was done. From the 1970s to the end of the 1990s, it was no longer seen as a luxury watch company.\\" It was then for the first time in 1995, that Cindy Crawford became the new face of Omega, introducing the age of the celebrity brand ambassador. The man behind this marketing ploy was believed to be Jean-Claude Biver, whose strategy changed the entire landscape for branding. During this time, many companies expanded their annual budgets to meet the financial liabilities that came with celebrity endorsements. Celebrities are popular and followed by many people so it makes sense that marketers benefit from using them in order to get their message across. A celebrity can capture consumers' attention, link the brand with their own personal image, and associate their positive attributes with those of the product concerned. However, in some cases celebrity branding could go wrong and affect product revenue. For example, recent doping charges against Lance Armstrong cost him $30 million in endorsements and he stepped down as the chairman of Livestrong. On the other hand, Nike - who sponsors the Armstrong and U.S cycling team - stated in a press release,\\"due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade, it is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him.\\" =Self- branding= According to Giriharidas,\\"the personal-branding field or self- brand traces its origins to the 1997 essay \\"The Brand Called You,\\" by the management expert Tom Peters.\\" Contemporary theories of branding suggest that brand ambassadors do not need to have a formal relationship with a company in order to promote its products/services. In particular the Web 2.0 allows all individuals to choose a brand and come up with their own strategies to represent it. Biro believes that \\"everyone owns their own personal brand. Companies and leadership must see the value of this concept for a successful social workplace recipe. If a brand ambassador chooses to represent the company and/or its brands, the individual should do so in a transparent way.\\" Self-branding is an effective way to help new businesses save the hassle of hiring brand ambassadors, training them and then realising they are not good enough for the company. In addition, it is an effective tool in order to target a niche audience and allows one to take sole control of their own brand representation. On the other hand, branding one's own product/service creates an instant connection with the audience and helps the brand stand out in comparison to other known brands that use popular celebrities or hire brand ambassadors. Reis propagates her branding mantra, \\"think about other people. Think about the impressions you are making on friends, neighbours, business associates. Think about your brand.\\" Creating a personal branding strategy is an effective way to attract audience attention. She gives the example of Marissa Mayer, CEO Yahoo. According to Laura Ries, Marissa is successful because she has what most people don't – \\"she has a brand.\\" Self-branding or personal branding is a way in which an individual may promote or build their reputation. Wheeler also highlights how sending an email can contribute towards an individuals personal brand and how personal branding has become important over the past few years due to the increase of self-employed individuals.Wheeler, A. (2010). Designing brand identity (3rd ed., pp. 6, 80). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley. The importance of personal branding increasingly rises due to modern audiences often trusting people as opposed to corporations. This falls down to the fact that audience members tend to believe that corporate organisations only have the final sales of product in mind as opposed to the publics interest instead. Furthermore, a personal brand is also a clear indication of who someone is and what best features they can offer, showing employees or clients what they could expect. The promotion of a personal brand is also a key part of creating and building a successful network of contacts, which in itself can lead to more business and future clients. Professional figures =Goodwill ambassador= A Goodwill ambassador is an honorary title and often linked with non-profit causes. Their primary function is to help organizations spread their message. Predominantly, goodwill ambassadors are celebrity advocates or known personalities, who use their fame and talents to secure funding, solicit donations, encourage volunteers to participate and raise awareness of the organization's cause. Celebrities or known personalities are picked according to the organizations' intended audience and if fully invested in the cause they are promoting can greatly influence the process of persuading others. Goodwill ambassadors make widely publicized visits to the world's most troubled regions, and make appeals on behalf of their people and the organization. For example, the United Nations Goodwill Ambassadors include famous celebrities like Angelina Jolie for UNHCR, David Beckham, Shakira for UNICEF, Christina Aguilera for WFP and Nicole Kidman for UN Women. =Promotional model= A promotional model is a type of a spokesmodel, trade show model and convention model. These models carry out functions beyond representation of the company in a positive light. The main difference between a brand ambassador and a promotional model is in the way they represent the product/service. In many cases, unlike brand ambassadors, a promotional model may give the audience an experience that reflects the product or service being branded. Promotional models are required to be present at the venue as per the requirements of the marketing campaign, however brand ambassadors are most often referred to as the 'face of the brand' . Promotional models are most often found in trade shows exhibits (in some cases referred to as \\"booth babes\\"), conventions and in print, digital or selected advertisements for the brand. The use of so-called \\"booth babe\\" models at trade show exhibits and conventions has been criticised by some. =Testimonial= Testimonial is simply a way of conveying assurance, in this case assurance is provided by the testimonial of the company or product/service in question in a written or spoken manner. A testimonial does not advertise the product freely unlike the role of the brand ambassador. A brand ambassador performs the function of a testimonial but a testimonial is not a brand ambassador. By simply providing a testimonial for a product/service, one need not be an ambassador for the same. For example, a customer can be a testimonial, since a testimony could be formal or informal \\"word of mouth\\" advocating the positive facets of the product. On the other hand, a consumer could not always be brand ambassador, since the latter is more commercial and is often considered as a position bound by monetary and professional liabilities. To a certain degree, celebrity endorsements provide testimonials for the product/service they are marketing. However, with the advent of the digital age testimonials have reached an all-time high. A large number of websites feature a \\"go to\\" tab where one can put down reviews or testimonials for the product/service. This has led to an increase in fake reviews, where companies have chosen to pay people to get their positive feedback. According to a study conducted by the research firm Gartner, \\"one in seven reviews/testimonials posted online by the end of next year is likely to be false. Other estimates put the number as high as one in three.\\" =Brand advocate= Fuggetta highlights that a brand advocate is a marketing term for \\"highly satisfied customers and others who go out of their way to actively promote the products they love and care about, they are a different breed altogether. \\" Further, he states that they are 50% more influential than an average customer. Often a positive experience with a brand, successful customer-service relationship motivates a brand advocate to express their positive feelings towards a brand. Traditionally, a brand advocate would sing praises of a brand and this would circulate through 'word of mouth' or other similar channels. However, in the digital age social media tools have allowed brand advocates to express themselves on forums such as Twitter, Facebook by 'tweeting' about a brand experience or 'liking' the brand itself. Rubin believes, \\"when customers seek you out via social media, they're looking for an opportunity to build an emotional connection. So give it to them.\\" See also * Shill * Segmentation * Corporate propaganda * Social media marketing References Category:Brand management Category:Branding terminology Category:Marketing Category:Goodwill ambassador programmes ","title":"Brand ambassador"},{"id":"11199803","text":"Chancellery seal Hitler's Chancellery, officially known as the Kanzlei des Führers der NSDAP (\\"Chancellery of the Führer of the Nazi Party\\"; abbreviated as KdF) was a Nazi Party organization. Also known as the Privatkanzlei des Führers (\\"Private Chancellery of the Führer\\"), the agency served as the private chancellery of Adolf Hitler, handling different issues pertaining to matters such as complaints against party officials, appeals from party courts, official judgments, clemency petitions by NSDAP fellows and Hitler's personal affairs. The Chancellery of the Führer was also a key player in the Nazi euthanasia program.  Organization  Philipp Bouhler, chief of the KdF and Action T4 programme The chancellery was established in November 1934 in Berlin as a separate agency, which was parallel to the German Reich Chancellery under Hans Heinrich Lammers and the Nazi Party Chancellery (until 1941: \\"Staff of the Deputy Führer\\"), led by Martin Bormann. The Kanzlei des Führers was headed by SS-Obergruppenführer Philipp Bouhler, who bore the title of Chef der Kanzlei des Führers der NSDAP. His adjutant was SS-Sturmbannführer Karl Freiherr Michel von Tüßling. Originally the KdF operated out of their Berlin office at Lützow Ufer. As chief of the KdF, Bouhler also held the rank of a Nazi Reichsleiter. He was appointed as chief on 17 November 1934 and held that position until 23 April 1945. Hitler selected Bouhler for this role due to his intense loyalty and deferential nature. Bouhler was also known for his tenacious efficiency and ideological fanaticism. In 1939, the KdF moved its seat close to the New Reich Chancellery building at Voßstraße No. 8. At this time, the KdF had twenty-six employees, which increased \\"five-fold by 1942.\\" Practically speaking, the KdF or \\"Chancellery of the Führer of the NSDAP\\" as Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw terms it, was originally designed to deal with correspondence between the Führer and Party officials, and so he could stay \\"in direct touch with the concerns of the people.\\" Much of the correspondence that came to the KdF consisted of \\"trivial complaints, petty grievances, and minor personal squabbles of Party members.\\" Bouhler's KdF worked in-tandem with the offices of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to \\"check Nazi Party publications for their ideological correctness.\\" The KdF was comprised by the following five main offices (Hauptämter), all subordinate directly to Hitler: *Hauptamt I: Privatkanzlei (Personal Affairs of the Führer); chief: Albert Bormann. *Hauptamt II: Angelegenheiten betr. Staat und Partei (State and Party Affairs); chief: Viktor Brack. IIa: Stellvertretender Leiter des Hauptamtes II (Deputy chief Hauptamt II); head of section: Werner Blankenburg *Hauptamt III: Gnadenamt für Parteiangelegenheiten (Pardon Office for Party Affairs); chief: Hubert Berkenkamp; later from 1941 forward: Kurt Giese. *Hauptamt IV: Sozial- und Wirtschaftsangelegenheiten (Social and Economic Affairs); chief: Heinrich Cnyrim. *Hauptamt V: Internes und Personal (Internal Affairs and Personnel Matters); chief: Herbert Jaensch. After 1941, Bouhler's influence and that of the KdF declined and he was largely disempowered by Martin Bormann. Eventually the KdF was absorbed into the Reich Chancellery headed by Lammers during the war.  Action T4  Hauptamt II officials under Viktor Brack played a vital role in organizing the killing of mentally ill and physically handicapped people in the Action T4 \\"euthanasia\\" programme, especially the child \\"euthanasia\\" from 1939. By a (backdated) decree of 1 September, Hitler appointed Bouhler and his personal physician Karl Brandt to manage the euthanasia program, where they would oversee the murder of physically and/or mentally disabled persons. The implementation of the killing operations were left to subordinates such as Brack and SA-Oberführer Werner Blankenburg. Besides Hitler's Chancellery, only a handful of personnel were privy to the inner workings of the euthanasia program so as to maintain secrecy, which is part of the reason Hitler chose Bouhler, as he knew the KdF \\"could direct the killings without involving too many people and without becoming too visible.\\" In accordance with the Chancellery-directed plan, physicians were required to report any newborn with abnormalities or congenital defects to the local health department; doctors were likewise required to register children under three-years suffering from any such conditions. During the killing phase related to euthanizing children, the KdF chose the cover title, Reich Committee for the Scientific Registration of Severe Hereditary Ailments, which only actually existed on paper; code names were also employed by members of the KdF for matters dealing with euthanasia. To provide some additional semblance of legitimacy to the operation, three doctors or \\"certifiers\\" also had to concur over any diagnosis before a \\"merciful death\\" could be administered, which included the final signature of a psychiatrist—all of which really boiled down to the economic considerations regarding the person's ability to work. To execute the deportations, the Gemeinnützige Krankentransport GmbH camouflage organization was established, residing on Tiergartenstraße No. 4. Just like earlier euthanasia operations, secrecy was again paramount, as Hitler explicitly told Bouhler concerning Aktion T4, \\"the Führer's Chancellery must under no circumstances be seen to be active in this matter.\\" Many KdF employees who participated in T4 later joined Operation Reinhard, the Nazi plan under Odilo Globocnik to exterminate Polish Jews in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland during World War II.

Uses of umbrella titles vary widely in the arts, to a much greater spectrum of use than in other fields of study. Music and dance Umbrella titles are used to demarcate the music field into general trends or styles: classical music, jazz,University of Massachusetts program for Danelo Pérez concert - includes history and terminology of jazz rock music, hip hop, rhythm and blues and other labels which each cover more specialized musical styles. A similar \\"structure\\" can be found in the field of dance. Prior to the sale of the long playing record in 1950, albums containing several 78 revolutions-per-minute records were often sold under umbrella titles (a collection of recordings from Oklahoma, for example). It can be argued that titles of all long-playing records and compact discs are \\"umbrella\\" titles—and several such recordings with a common theme often have an umbrella title (such as Chip Davis' \\"Day Parts\\" series) as well. Television While it can be argued that every title of a televised series, especially those primarily used to designate a time period rather than actual programming (like NBC Monday Night at the Movies) is an umbrella, the term is more appropriately applied to names of anthology series, series that combine together to provide a common theme (such as the three components of 90 Bristol Court), wheel series, and other series under a common heading (such as Crimetime After Primetime and Four in One). While it was common practice in the 1950s and early 1960s for series to alternate or otherwise share a time slot in American broadcast network television (for example, The Jack Benny Show shared a time slot with, first Private Secretary and then The George Gobel Show), umbrella titles were not used by United States' networks until 1964, when NBC presented three half-hour programs on Monday nights as a programming block centered at a southern California apartment complex, 90 Bristol Court.Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present (2003) TV Guide Guide to TV 2006 (2006) While the 1964 programming experiment did not succeed (two of the series were cancelled; the third lasted the broadcast season but was not renewed for the 1965-1966 season), NBC was not dissuaded from further programming experimentation. Within a decade, the network then experimented with wheel series, first with Four in One and The Bold Ones, then with NBC Mystery Movie. Afterwards additional wheel series were presented by American broadcast networks, to varying degrees of success. The experiment was revived in 1979 with Cliffhangers. In the United Kingdom, umbrella titles were used in varying degrees in their programming as well. The long-running Doctor Who used umbrella titles on several levels, first with individual named episodes under the umbrella of the title of an overall story (the first four episodes were commonly called \\"An Unearthly Child\\" even though none of them actually showed it to be the title of the story); even after the naming of individual episodes ceased, umbrella titles were often used to collect stories with a common enemy or theme (Daleks stories, Cybermen stories, UNIT stories, and season-long \\"Key to Time\\" and \\"Trial of a Time Lord\\"). Motion pictures and literature The use of umbrella titles in motion pictures parallels their use in literature. Movie trilogies such as Lord of the Rings and the Three Colors trilogy (a.k.a. \\"Red, White, and Blue trilogy\\") commonly are called by umbrella titles, as was the case for their literary cousins (such as John Dos Passos' U.S.A.). Umbrella titles were often used to cover longer sequences of motion pictures or novels (such as the James Bond and Star Wars films and Marcel Proust's multi-volume Remembrance of Things Past). Often umbrella titles are used to collect motion pictures with common stars (\\"Marx Brothers movies\\") or common characters (\\"Dirty Harry movies\\"), as is the case for novels or comics (\\"Perry Mason novels\\", for example).

She is the first Hispanic woman to graduate from any service academy.An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields. By Lisa Tendrich Frank, P.169 Early years Cubero's father was a United States Air Force officer of Mexican-American descent and her mother of Puerto Rican ancestry. Her father was a very influential factor in her life and she decided to follow in his footsteps and apply for admission to the United States Air Force Academy. Despite the fact that she ranked 25/485 students in her high school class and that she was a member of the National Honor Society, her guidance counselors told her that she “wasn’t good enough” to make it into the USAFA. United States Air Force Academy The United States Air Force Academy,Unlike the United States Military Academy at West Point and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, which are often referred to by their respective city names, the Air Force Academy is not normally referred to as \\"Colorado Springs.\\" located immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County, Colorado, United States, is an institution for the undergraduate education of officers for the United States Air Force. Graduates of the four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree and most are commissioned as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force. On October 7, 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed legislation permitting women to enter the United States service academies. On June 26, 1976, Cubero was among 157 women that entered the Air Force Academy with the Class of 1980. In 1980, Cubero made history when she became a member of the first class of women to graduate from the United States Air Force Academy. There she earned her BS degree in Political Science and her free-fall parachute wings. Upon her graduation she was commissioned a Second Lieutenant.

The onocentaur (, from ) is an animal from Medieval bestiaries.  Description  The onocentaur is similar to the centaur, but part human, part donkey. However, unlike centaur, which is portrayed with four legs, the onocentaur is often portrayed with only two legs. As with many liminal beings, the onocentaur's nature is one of conflict between its human and animal components. The first mention by Pythagoras was in the time of rule of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, as quoted by Claudius Aelianus in De Natura Animalium. Aelian as well uses the term onokentaura for description of the female form. He interpreted the onocentaur as: \\"its body resembles that of an ass, its colour is ashen but inclines to white beneath the flanks. It has a human chest with teats and a human face surrounded by thick hair. It may use its arms to seize and hold things but also to run. It has a violent temper and does not endure capture.\\" The Septuagint translation of the book of Isaiah mentions onocentaurs twice, in verses 13:22: \\"and onocentaurs will settle there and hedgehogs will make nests in their homes. It comes quickly and does not delay,\\" and 34:14: \\"and the spirits will meet with the onocentaurs and howl one to another, and the onocentaurs will stop because they have found rest.\\" The corresponding words in the Hebrew are אִי \\"island-beast, howler, jackal\\" and שָׂעִיר, \\"hairy, he- goat, satyr.\\" Jerome's translation of the Septuagint and Vetus Latina versions into the Late Latin standard version, the Vulgate, preserved this interpretation. John Wycliffe's early English-language translation of the Bible did not use the word \\"onocentaur\\", but instead glossed the term as: \\"wondurful beestis, lijk men in the hiyere part and lijk assis in the nethir part\\". The later King James Version translates the word as \\"satyr\\".

Most have been established in the last 20 years as a result of economic inequalities between rural and metropolitan areas in Guatemala and Uruguay. Guatemala City In 15 of the 23 districts of Guatemala City, there are precarious settlements. In 1984, there were 103 and by 1991 there were 232. In 2016 there were 297. In 1984, 800 families made a land invasion and successfully squatted an area called El Mezquital. The settlement eventually swelled to over 25,000 people. It was the first successful occupation since 1976. These places have been considered \\"red zones\\" inside Guatemala City, because of their high crime rate and some of them are El Caracol, Cañaverales, El Rinconcito. A famous asentamiento in Guatemala is La Limonada. With a population of around 60,000 it is one of the largest slums in Latin America outside Brazil. Montevideo In Montevideo, Uruguay before 1990, there were land occupations known as cantegriles. The land invasions can be split into accretions (gradual, individual actions) and planned (organised, collective actions).

Although it was intended for use as a basic trainer for the Royal Canadian Air Force, it was rejected and the only two completed airframes were sold to Mexico. Design and development In 1937, Canadian Car and Foundry had obtained rights to a training aircraft designed by Leland Stamford Wallace known as the \\"Wallace Trainer.\\" The nearly-complete project was a conventional biplane with two open cockpits, powered by a Kinner B-5 engine. Featuring welded steel-tube fuselage, ailerons and tail with a wing structure utilizing spruce spars and ribs, the entire aircraft was fabric covered, except for aluminium panelled cockpit and engine areas. Canadian Car and Foundry renamed the project the Maple Leaf I. Once the Maple Leaf I was completed, it was tested in 1938 with the Nicaraguan identification GN-3, with the anticipation of an order for ten to twelve production models. The preliminary flight test results were not positive and the project was wound up in 1939, citing unsatisfactory performance. In 1938, the new Chief Designer Elsie McGill began work on the Maple Leaf II, which, except for the use of the fin and rudder from the earlier aircraft, was a new design. A conventional structure based on welded steel tube fuselage and steel-tube tail, aluminium alloy ribs with wooden wings was employed. Designed around British design requirements for strength, the Maple Leaf II was intended to be fully aerobatic. In order to expedite development and to ensure no interruption in the ongoing Hawker Hurricane production lines, a number of components were \\"farmed out\\" to sub- contractors.Molson and Taylor 1982, p. 166. Operational history The Maple Leaf II prototype was ready for flight testing in October 1939; one of the unusual aspects of the program was that the designer accompanied company Sales Manager O.C.S. Wallace who acted as a test pilot on the first flight, 31 October 1939. Tests indicated excellent results with stable and docile flight characteristics, however, the RCAF test pilots felt that a basic trainer had to be more challenging. After evaluation by the RCAF and the Department of Transport in 1940, the Maple Leaf II was exported to Mexico via Port Washington on Long Island, USA. Along with the finished prototype, two semi- complete airframes with blueprints, jigs, tools and all accessories were sold to the Mexican Air Force school (EMA). One of the \\"kit\\" aircraft was assembled and flown as the Ares 2. It differed slightly from the Maple Leaf II in having enlarged vertical tail surfaces and an uncowled engine. In total, 10 examples were built in Mexico during 1940, and were equipped with the Warner Super Scarab 165 hp engine.Ruiz Romero 2004, pp. 100–101. Operators *Mexican Air Force 10 units built.

It was created by Bob Boze Bell. Honkytonk Sue later appeared as a weekly comic strip in the Phoenix New Times from 1978 to 1980. Four comic books culled from these weekly strips were self-published by Bell, the first being published in 1978 and the fourth in 1980. As \\"the Queen of Western Swing\\", the character was idealized as \\"the ultimate image of the liberated Western woman\\", who can \\"out dance, out drink and out think any and all comers\\". In her stories, Honkytonk Sue confronted Yoga Rednecks, alien \\"Lady Killers\\" and Mr. Disco. The character was optioned by Columbia Pictures in 1983. Larry McMurtry, among others, worked on scripts (four were created over a two-year period) for a Goldie Hawn vehicle, which was never made. The film was in development for more than six years before it was officially dropped. The Arizona Republic wrote, \\"Sue has gone through more rewrites than the New Testament, including one by Terms of Endearment sob sister Larry McMurtry, which changed Sue from a contemporary woman of the West to a superfeminist Native American activist. One of the last rewrites came from the pens of Peggy Sue Got Married scripters Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner\\". Honkytonk Sue had a revival on the pages of True West Magazine (which is edited by Bell) in 2002 and ran for several years.

It originally aired on December 19, 2005.  Plot  Trying to avoid the usual letdown of New Year's Eve, Ted rents a limo for his friends so that they can party together. Robin has plans with her rich boyfriend, Derek, but Ted, Lily, Marshall, and Barney plan to attend five parties in the three hours before midnight to find the best party to be at to begin the new year. With Ranjit as their limo driver and Barney's \\"Get Psyched\\" mix CD to psych them up, the group goes to the first party where they pick up Ted's coworker Marybeth (Kathleen Rose Perkins), who has been flirting with him at the office. Barney also finds a date, a woman with a Russian-like accent named Natalya. Lily complains that her shoes are hurting her feet, but Ted asks that she power through the pain and they head to party number two. Disappointed with party number two, the gang heads to party number three, leaving Natalya behind because no one except Barney liked her. Robin calls Ted asking if they could pick her up because Derek had to work late and canceled their plans. Even though the extra stop jeopardizes the schedule, Ted cannot refuse to pick up Robin. Robin joins the group and her disappointment caused by her canceled date brings down the mood. Ted tries to lift Robin's spirits by saying that he will kiss her at midnight and suggests that they go to Gray's Papaya. Lily returns to the apartment to change her shoes, intending to catch up with the group at party number three, while everyone else gets hot dogs. Lily tries to wish Marshall a happy new year in case she can't rejoin the group, but Marshall says that they will find each other. The limo heads to party number three when Marshall sees Moby (J. P. Manoux) out the window of the parked limo. Ted asks Moby if he wants a ride to the party that he's going to and once inside the limo the group wangles an invitation to Moby's party. Worried that Lily won't find them and unable to reach her on her cell phone, Marshall leaves the limo to find Lily. The group heads to Moby's party, but discover that he is not Moby (nor 'Tony', but Eric) when he brandishes a gun and rants crazily. As they drop off Not Moby at his party, Marshall's cell phone, that he accidentally left in the limo, rings. Barney answers the call from Lily and tells her that Marshall is looking for her at party number three. Lily doesn't see Marshall but she does see Not Moby walking into the party. Ted tells her to leave the party quickly and when she rejoins the group they realize that Lily accidentally went to party number four, which coincidentally is Not Moby's party. The group heads to party number three to find Marshall. Barney realizes that Not Moby took his \\"Get Psyched\\" mix just as the limo gets a flat tire. While Ranjit fixes the tire, Barney laments the loss of his CD. To cheer up everyone, Ted and Robin begin singing the first song from the \\"Get Psyched\\" mix. Recognizing that Ted is in love with Robin, Marybeth decides to leave the group. Still stuck with a flat tire and only 15 minutes until midnight, Ted suggests that the group begin walking so that they can get to party number three by 12:45 and celebrate the New Year in central time. As Lily tries to find Marshall by yelling his name, Barney tells Ted to stop trying so hard-—he can't keep New Year's Eve from being what it is, the biggest letdown of the year. Just as Ted is about to give up, they hear Marshall yelling Lily's name. Marshall runs up to the limo and tells the group that when he couldn't find Lily at party number three he walked to party number four (Not Moby's party) where he heard Barney's mix CD playing and he swiped it, and got his shirt signed by \\"not Moby\\" as \\"Eric\\". Marshall then went to party number five, which was awesome, and says that they need to be at party number five at midnight. With eight minutes until midnight, everyone climbs in the limo—-where they find Natalya who had been sleeping in the front seat—-and they head to party number five. With three minutes until midnight, the limo is stuck in traffic. Accepting that the group won't make it to party number five, Ted opens a bottle of champagne and pours everyone a glass, saying that they have a great party in the limo. Derek appears at the limo's window, having left his business meeting early to be with Robin at midnight. As the countdown to midnight begins with everyone in the limo paired off except for Ted, he leaves the limo. To Ted's surprise, Robin follows him, saying that she hadn't forgotten their deal to kiss each other at midnight, and they share a kiss.

Background  It is not known when Yang Shidao was born. He was a son of Yang Xiong (楊雄), a distant nephew of Sui Dynasty and one of the four most powerful officials at one point early in Sui, with Gao Jiong, Yu Qingze (虞慶則), and Su Wei and who was created an imperial prince with various titles, eventually the title of Prince of Guan. His older brother Yang Gongren served as an official during both Sui and Tang Dynasty and who briefly served as chancellor during the reign of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  At the end of Sui Dynasty, when the state was engulfed in uprisings against Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang, Yang Shidao was at the eastern capital Luoyang, and was subsequently detained by the general Wang Shichong, who deposed Sui's final emperor Yang Tong (Emperor Yang's grandson) in 619 and established a new state of Zheng as its emperor, but Yang Shidao was eventually able to go to Chang'an, where another general, Li Yuan had established Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu in 618. (It is not completely clear whether Yang's travel to Chang'an was before or after Zheng's fall to Tang in 621, but likely before.) Late in 621, when Eastern Tujue forces attacked Ling Prefecture (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), Yang Shidao was referred to as the commandant at Ling Prefecture, and he was able to repel the Eastern Tujue attack; he would again be involved in a campaign resisting Eastern Tujue attacks in 622. Yang Shidao's older brother Yang Gongren was an old friend of Emperor Gaozu's, and, at some point, Yang Shidao was made a guard commander for Emperor Gaozu's guards. Emperor Gaozu gave Yang Shidao his daughter Princess Guiyang in marriage. Yang Shidao later served as the deputy minister of civil service affairs, and then the minister of rites. He was also created the Duke of Ande—a title that his father had held at one point. In 624, when the crown prince Li Jiancheng's guard commander Yang Wen'gan (楊文幹) rebelled, Yang Shidao was one of the generals whose forces were involved in defeating Yang Wen'gan.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 636, after Emperor Gaozu had succeeded by his son Li Shimin in 626 (after Li Shimin ambushed and killed Li Jiancheng and another brother Li Yuanji and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him), Yang Shidao was made Shizhong (侍中) – the head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. He was considered careful in his actions, not leaking any words on the important matters of state. He once said, \\"When I was young, I read the Book of Han, and I saw that Kong Guang [(孔光, a prime minister during the reigns of Emperor Cheng of Han and Emperor Ai of Han)] was not even willing to speak about the trees in the greenhouses inside the palace. I admired that, and I want to be like that.\\" Whenever he left imperial gatherings, he would invite talented people to meet at his mansion to discuss literature, and the gatherings at his house were considered important literary events. He was also said to be talented at calligraphy. In 639, he became Zhongshu Ling (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau and also considered a post for a chancellor. In 643, a plot centering the crown prince Li Chengqian was discovered where Li Chengqian considered overthrowing his father. Yang's stepson Zhao Jie (趙節), a son of Princess Guiyang (now titled Princess Changguang) by her deceased husband Zhao Cijing (趙慈景)) was one of the co- conspirators. When Yang was involved in the investigation of the case, he tried to intercede on Zhao Jie's behalf with Emperor Taizong, and this displeased Emperor Taizong. Yang was therefore demoted to the post of minister of civil service affairs, no longer a chancellor. Zhao Jie was executed. (Emperor Taizong later personally visited Princess Changguang to apologize for the fact that he could not spare Zhao Jie, but stated that he did so because he had to be fair in governing the state.) Because Yang was born out of a very honored lineage, he was well-acquainted with the nobles. However, because of this, he did not promote people that he knew well to avoid appearance of conflict of interest. This, in turn, however, brought criticism that he was not in fact being fair, as he was not promoting that he knew to be capable. In 644, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, stated to his key officials their strengths and weaknesses, he spoke, with regard to Yang: :Yang Shidao is pure and mild in his actions, and he will not make mistakes or offenses. But because he is weak and timid in personality, I cannot receive his help in times of urgency. In 645, when Emperor Taizong attacked Goguryeo, Yang followed him and was made acting Zhongshu Ling, but was said to perform poorly, and after the end of the campaign, he was demoted to the post of minister of labor, and then minister of rites. He died in 647 and was buried near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, where Emperor Taizong would eventually be buried himself.

The PC-8001 model was also sold in the United States and Canada as the PC-8001A. Original models of the NEC PC-8001B (or sometimes the NEC PC-8000) was also sold in some European countries like in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands and in Australia and New Zealand as well.  PC-8001  The first member of the PC-8000 series, the PC-8001 was first introduced on May 9, 1979, and went on sale September 1979 for ¥168,000. Its design combined the keyboard and the mainboard into a single unit. At a time when most micro- computers were sold as \\"semi-kits\\" requiring end user assembly, the fully assembled PC-8001 was a rarity in the market. Peripherals included a printer, a cassette tape storage unit, and a CRT interface. Although it is often believed to be the first domestically produced personal computer for the Japanese market, in reality it was preceded by the Hitachi Basic Master. The character set of the PC-8001 The PC-8001A was released in the United States in August 1981, and was priced at (32 KB of RAM). It was modified to reduce electromagnetic interference in order to comply with FCC regulations.

American personal computers were expensive for personal use (Initial list price of the Apple II was 358,000 yen, and the TRS-80 was 248,000 yen). In addition, computer manufacturers had not developed personal computers because they assumed that the microprocessors of the time were not suitable for computing due to their lack of performance and reliability. In 1978, the Hitachi Basic Master and Sharp MZ-80K, both developed by consumer electronics companies, were released as personal computers targeted for hobbyists, not for business use. In the summer of 1978, NEC started the development of the PC-8001, codenamed \\"PCX-1\\". The development team consisted of 10 engineers including section manager and chief designer . They had already planned to release a version of the TK-80BS within a plastic case as a personal computer. It was released as the COMPO BS/80, but it failed in the market due to its poor built-in BASIC and slow clock speed. The PC-8001 was intended to be a high- performance and inexpensive computer for personal use. When Goto visited Silicon Valley to survey the application of microprocessors, he ran across Kazuhiko Nishi at a computer store. They only exchanged business cards, but Nishi introduced Microsoft to him after he returned to Japan. Goto thought of visiting Microsoft, but he worried that the trip wouldn't be accepted by his boss because Microsoft was a small company. Instead, he attended the fall 1978 West Coast Computer Faire during its first day. The next day, he met Bill Gates at the airport in Albuquerque. After lunch, they went to Microsoft's office, and then Gates told him the importance of having a de facto standard. Goto agreed. The team had already been developing a BASIC interpreter, but Watanabe decided to adopt Microsoft BASIC because it was widely used in the North American market. At that time, Microsoft and ASCII (the main Microsoft dealer in Japan) intended to expand OEM business in Japan, so N-BASIC was provided for NEC with a very low licence fee. It had been developed at Microsoft's office in Seattle, and NEC provided a wirewrapped prototype, known as the PC-8001g. The system unit, displays and storage devices were all developed by NEC, and manufactured by New Nippon Electric (NEC Home Electroncs) beginning in January 1980. Printers were provided from Tokyo Electric (Toshiba TEC) because NEC had only developed expensive printers for mainframes. = Success in Japan = ASCII June 1979. \\"A dramatic story with the computer will begin. The Personal Computer comes out from NEC.\\" The PC-8001 was introduced on May 9, 1979, and the prototype was presented to the public at the held from May 16-19 at the Tokyo Ryūtsū Center. Soon after the exposition, NEC received thousands of orders. It took half a year to ship about 10,000 backorders after shipment began on September 20, 1979. By 1981, it dominated 40% of the Japanese personal computer market. About 250,000 units were shipped until production stopped in January 1983. NEC also succeeded in expanding their personal computer chain in Japan. The chain owned 7 stores in 1979, 15 stores in 1980, more than 100 stores in 1981, and reached 200 stores by 1983. The PC-8001 sold well in the educational market because NEC advertised that the PC-8001 used the industrial standard of Microsoft BASIC. Kanagawa Prefectural Chigasaki Nishihama High School was the first futsu-ka school (upper secondary schools with a focus on a common course) to purchase PC-8001 computers (buying 17 units) and started teaching programming as an elective subject in 1981. In April 1982, NHK Educational TV started the television program \\"\\" using the PC-8001. Its textbook \\"\\" sold 700,000 copies.  PC-8001mkII  A higher-performance, more graphically capable revision of the PC-8001, the Mark II debuted in March 1983 for a price of 123,000 yen. While its most obvious improvement was in its graphical capabilities, the Mark II also included an internal 5.25\\" floppy disk interface as well as two internal expansion slots, doing away with the need for an \\"expansion box\\" to permit upgrades. The internal BASIC was changed as well, from the 24KB N-BASIC to a 32KB \\"N80-BASIC\\" that added new conditional statements as well as graphics commands. While the price of the PC-8001mkII was comparable with other 8-bit computer offerings at the time, its graphics were notably worse than its competitors (most likely an attempt on NEC's part to avoid competing with their own, higher-powered PC-8800 series). This led to a relative dearth of software produced for it, particularly games.  PC-8001mkIISR  A games- oriented revision of the PC-8001mkII with significantly better graphics and sound, making its debut in January 1985 for 108,000 yen. The mkIISR increased the frame-buffer memory from 16KB to 48KB, allowing for 640×200-pixel graphics or 320×200-pixel double-buffered graphics modes. Additionally, the primitive PC speaker was replaced by an FM synthesis audio system. Its internal BASIC was also updated to allow usage of this new hardware, as well as providing mkII and PC-8001 compatibility modes (although a significant proportion of older software would not run properly under these modes). Other changes included the change of one general-purpose expansion slot to a Kanji character ROM expansion slot, a PC-8800 series keyboard connector, and an Atari-style joystick connector. Reception The Japanese personal computer magazine ASCII concluded in 1979 that \\"Although some problems remain, at present, we can guarantee it is the strongest machine for both software and hardware.\\" , the division manager of NEC's Electronic Device Sales division, recalled why the PC-8001 became a long seller that \\"The biggest factor is the price setting of 168,000 yen. The major opinion insisted 220,000 to 230,000 yen was appropriate for value of the product, but Kazuya Watanabe never withdrew 168,000 yen. After all, Watanabe's proposal was accepted by the executive director Ouchi's decision, but his stubbornness was admirable.\\" Although handicapped by the lack of English documentation, BYTEs American reviewers concluded in January 1981 after evaluating a unit purchased in Japan that \\"the PC-8001 appears to be an attractive, well-planned, and well-made personal computer ... Most people who have seen our PC-8001 feel that, if it were sold in our country, it would provide strong competition for any of the color-based home computers currently being sold\\".

It was illustrated by Elizabeth Honey. Plot introduction It follows a young boy, separated from his elder brother whilst attempting to flee the terror of the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It provides an insight into the general plight of refugees using the specific instance of this horrible experience as a backdrop. Muong Vithy is the main character of Little Brother. Vithy has worked for a year in the Big Paddy, with his big brother Mang. Their sister, Sorei, and their mother and father are gone. They run away, trying to escape from the soldiers, the Khmer Rouge. They manage to get away, but not for long. Mang has advice for getting away: \\"Follow the lines... to the border.\\" Vithy is puzzled about the advice. What lines? Which border? Suddenly they are separated as they run for their life and Vithy is left alone in the forest. The soldiers leave him, no doubt pursuing Mang. Vithy forages for food that night and starts traveling to Cambodia's border. As he is traveling beside the road he sees soldiers - not the Khmer Rouge. He finds himself on the outskirts of the now deserted Phnom Penh, finds a little gold leaf and meets a boy (real name Ang), the King. Vithy stays in the King's City and fixes a motor for him. When they are working for their meals the King hides Vithy in a truck, and gives him the gold leaf as payment for the motor and some water. The truck travels very near Angkor. Vithy jumps off and walks for a few hours. Then, he finds himself face to face with a young boy, though much older than himself, on a bicycle and bribes the boy with the gold leaf the King gives him. The boy says it is too little but lets him build a bicycle in his graveyard of bicycles. Will Vithy make it to the border on his struggle to find his older brother? Reception Reviews of Little Brother were mostly positive. Although Kirkus Reviews found \\"The atrocities and privations that make ... other refugee stories so searing are kept offstage here; this is a milder narrative\\", they also found that \\"Baillie keeps the plot moving and his characters are deftly drawn and believable.\\" Publishers Weekly stated that \\"Baillie sensitively expresses the depth of Vithy's loneliness while exploring the boy's growing independence and gradual rebuilding of trust.\\" and \\"Offering insight into the Vietnamese/Cambodian experience, this haunting tale confirms the universality of human instincts and emotions.\\" Valerie Bierman, writing for Books for Keeps, believed it \\"a gem which deserves to become a classic, it(sic) only to demonstrate to children the futility and cruelty of war.\\" Awards and nominations *The Children's Book Council of Australia - Children's Book of the Year Awards 1986 - Highly commended (i.e. Runner up) References Category:1985 novels Category:Australian children's novels Category:Novels set in Cambodia Category:1985 children's books ","title":"Little Brother (Baillie novel)"},{"id":"11200229","text":"Cen Wenben (595 – May 10, 645兩千年中西曆轉換), courtesy name Jingren, posthumously known as Viscount Xian of Jiangling, was a Chinese official who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong in the Tang dynasty. He was an assistant editor of the Book of Zhou, the official history of the Northern Zhou dynasty.  Background  Cen Wenben was born in 595 during the reign of Emperor Wen in the Sui dynasty. His grandfather, Cen Shanfang (岑善方), served under Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, a vassal of the Northern Zhou state who claimed to be the legitimate emperor of the Liang dynasty. His father, Cen Zhixiang (岑之象), served as a magistrate of Handan County late in the Sui dynasty. In 608, Cen Zhixiang was falsely accused of crimes. Cen Wenben, who was already talented in writing and was calm and dexterious in his actions, went to the ministry of justice to proclaim his father's innocence and, when questioned, was able to answer and explain clearly. The officials were surprised by his ability to do so despite his young age, and, to test his writing ability, asked him to write an ode to lotus. Cen was able to write it well quickly. Subsequently, he was able to convince the officials that his father was falsely accused, allowing his father to be exculpated. He became famous from the incident. He was subsequently recommended for the imperial examination by the local government of his home commandery, but as by that time, most of Sui territory was engulfed in agrarian rebellions against Emperor Yang, Cen Wenben did not report for the examination.  Service under Xiao Xi and Li Xiaogong  In 617, Xiao Xi, a great-grandson of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, whom Cen Wenben's grandfather Cen Shanfang had served, rose in rebellion, claiming to restore the Liang dynasty. Xiao Xi established his capital at Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and he summoned Cen Wenben to serve as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Cen was in charge of writing the imperial edicts. In 621, when the Tang dynasty general Li Xiaogong (a nephew of Emperor Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty) attacked Liang and put Jiangling under siege, Cen suggested to Xiao Xi that he surrendered, and Xiao Xi did so. After Xiao Xi's surrender, however, Li Xiaogong's subordinates wanted to pillage the city. Cen persuaded Li Xiaogong that it would be wrong to do so, and Li Xiaogong subsequently ordered against pillaging. As Li Xiaogong was then put in charge of the former Liang capital, he invited Cen to serve on his staff. In 623, when Emperor Gaozu sent Li Xiaogong to attack the rebel leader Fu Gongshi, Cen followed Li Xiaogong and was in charge of his military correspondences. After Li Xiaogong defeated and killed Fu Gongshi and was put in charge of Fu's capital Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), Cen continued to serve on Li Xiaogong's staff.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Cen Wenben's activities for the several following years were not recorded in history. By 627, when Emperor Gaozu's son, Emperor Taizong, was emperor, he was a lowly-ranked secretary at the Palace Library but also served as a junior official at the legislative bureau. On one occasion when Emperor Taizong carried out a field-tilling ceremony (to show ceremonial attention to farming), Cen wrote an ode to field-tilling, and on one New Year's Day when Emperor Taizong summoned the imperial officials to a feast, Cen wrote an ode to New Year's Day. The odes were considered beautifully written, and Cen became famous from them. The general Li Jing (who had at one point served as Li Xiaogong's assistant) also recommended him. He was promoted to a mid-level post in the legislative bureau and became more well regarded by Emperor Taizong. After Yan Shigu, the official who was largely responsible for drafting imperial edicts during the reign of Emperor Gaozu, was dismissed around that time, the chancellor Wen Yanbo, the head of the legislative bureau, stated to Emperor Taizong that no one was capable as drafting imperial edicts as Yan and sought to have Yan reinstated. Emperor Taizong instead responded, \\"I have someone else in mind; you, Duke, need not worry.\\" He then made Cen the deputy head of the legislative bureau and made Cen in charge of drafting imperial edicts. At that time, Cen was also assisting Linghu Defen in compiling the official history of the Northern Zhou state, the Book of Zhou. It was said that most of the commentaries on the biographies were written by Cen. After the work was completed in 636, Emperor Taizong created Cen the Viscount of Jiangling. In 637, when Emperor Taizong visited the eastern capital Luoyang, there were heavy floods of rivers near Luoyang, and Cen took this opportunity to submit a secret petition urging Emperor Taizong to reduce his travel out of the capital. He also pointed out that too many construction projects were being carried out on behalf of Emperor Taizong's favorite son, Li Tai (the Prince of Wei) — that such expenditures will breed further expenditures. Emperor Taizong was pleased with Cen's petitions and awarded him with silk. In 642, Cen was given the additional designation of Zhuanzhang Jimi (專掌機密) — considered a chancellor de facto designation. It was said that Cen was humble and, despite his honorable status, he always greeted those who had known, no matter how minor that person's position was. In 643, when Emperor Taizong's crown prince, Li Chengqian, was deposed after he was discovered to have plotted to overthrow his father, Cen and Liu Ji suggested that Emperor Taizong create Li Tai crown prince, but Emperor Taizong subsequently created another son, Li Zhi (the Prince of Jin) crown prince, believing that Li Tai's machinations was responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall. Emperor Taizong made many high-level officials carry additional titles as Li Zhi's staff members, but when he tried to bestow such a title on Cen, Cen declined, stating that he wanted to concentrate on serving the emperor, although Emperor Taizong still had the crown prince meet with Cen every five days and treat him as a friend, not as a subordinate. In 644, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, stated to his key officials their strengths and weaknesses, he spoke, with regard to Cen: :Cen Wenben is kind-hearted, and writes exquisitely. His logic and analysis are also enduring ones, and he will not fail my expectations. Later that year, he was made the head of the legislative bureau, but he rejected all attempts to congratulate him, stating \\"I will only receive condolences, not congratulations.\\" When his mother asked why, he stated, \\"I did not have accomplishments and was not an old acquaintance of the emperor. I have, however, received great favors from the emperor, and my position is high and important. That is why I am afraid.\\" When people suggested to him that he spend more time managing his properties, Cen responded: He instead put his younger brother, Cen Wenzhao (岑文昭), to be in charge of his properties. At that time, Cen Wenzhao was spending time associating with people, and Emperor Taizong was not pleased. He considered demoting Cen Wenzhao out of the capital, but Cen Wenben interceded on his brother's behalf, stating that his mother favored Cen Wenzhao the most, and not having his brother around would cause his mother much distress. Emperor Taizong thus changed his mind, keeping Cen Wenzhao in the capital after summoning him and rebuking him. In 645, Emperor Taizong was attacking Goguryeo. Cen followed him on the campaign and was deeply involved in the logistics—so much so that his energy was drained. Emperor Taizong saw that he was speaking in ways that were unusual for him, and became worried, stating, \\"Cen Wenben came on this campaign with me, but I am afraid he will not return with me.\\" Cen soon grew ill and died in You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing). He was buried near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife, Empress Zhangsun, where Emperor Taizong would eventually buried himself. His nephew Cen Changqian and grandson Cen Xi later also served as chancellors.

This particular story arc lasts 19 strips long. In 1994, the story arc was reprinted in PB5, the fifth book compilation of the comic strip series. Synopsis The story arc begins with Polgas using a slingshot to light the Olympig flame. Brosia and Tiny serve as commentators, though only the former does all the work since the latter does nothing but eat during the whole event. They proudly announce the composition of the teams participating in the games: * The Lomo Team, from Lumo street - Senator Cabalfin, Mao, Pao and Ka Noli. * The Pata Team, from Pata street - Sgt. Tomas and his wife, Barbie, Bab and Doc Sebo. * The Scream Team, from Liempo street - Polgas, Dagul, Tata Mads and Joboy. =The Patintero event= The Lumo team square off against the Scream Team which is ahead by a point. Mao uses his special Ngyaopao siopao to distract Joboy; Ka Noli is able to get through the opposing team's defense. This ties the score. The Lumo team continues employing distracting techniques to score against their opponents. Pao eats camias in front of Doc Sebo, who lets Ka Noli score a point. The Pata team then employs intimidation techniques to counter the strategy being used by Lumo team. Tomas tells Mao to let him pass if he wants his business license renewed. He even hints that he might report Mao as an illegal alien to the Bureau of Immigration. However, Mao reminds him that Senator Cabalfin is his team-mate. Tomas gives up. Results: Patintero event * Gold - Lomo Team * Silver - Pata Team * Bronze - Scream Team =The Gagamba match= Ka Noli, Barbie and Joboy represent their respective teams in the Spider fighting event. They showcase the different spider breeds in their possession, including a ninja spider, complete with ninja suit, mask and katana. In one of the matches, Noli and Joboy's spiders grappled into a ball characteristic of fighting spiders locked in combat. However, both spiders suddenly fell off the stick, totally spent. This surprises the contestants and the Olympig Committee scrutinizes the arachnids. It was discovered that one of the spiders was female - the spiders had not been fighting, they had been mating. Lumo Team's spider seemed to be the gold medal winner, but it was disqualified after testing positive for performance- enhancing drugs. Results: Gagamba match * Gold - Scream Team * Silver - Pata Team * Bronze - none (Lumo Team disqualified) =The Tex tournament= The teams show off their ace cards in the Tex tournament: Scream Team has a Bitch Na Bitch Kita: Ang Utol Kong Doberman Part 2 card, a spoof of the Philippine film Miss Na Miss Kita: Ang Utol Kong Hoodlum Part 2, released in 1992. Lumo Team displays a Tuta Ni Baby Aso card, spoofing another Philippine film - Anak Ni Baby Ama, released in 1990. Pata Team has a Barkman Returns card, a spoof of the Hollywood film Batman Returns. The contestants then try to employ all sorts of strategies to win the tournament, including blowing at the cards while these are in mid-air after the toss. Results: Tex tournament * Gold - Pata Team =The Holen tournament= The holen tournament sees the continued use of intimidation techniques by the contestants, especially Tomas and Ka Noli, who openly display their firearms while playing with marbles. To counter this, Dagul uses a different strategy - he sticks adhesive labels proclaiming gun ownership to the rear windshield of his car, to appear as if he also owned guns when in fact, he didn't. A special attraction in the holen tournament was the \\"Slam-dyols Competition\\", where contestants performed a series of athletic and acrobatic maneuvers before slamming home a marble into the hole in the ground. Pao's routine consists of an out-of-water tumble turn, a 360° spin, and what seems to be a reverse pike or split. Bab's routine begins with an all-out rush accelerating him to full speed. He then performs a high leap but Senator Cabalfin trips him up. The resulting triple somersault ends with Bab's face buried in the dirt. Polgas takes his turn. His routine begins in a similar manner to Bab's - a full gallop. He then performs a double somersault with a full twist. Upon landing on the ground, he burrows under for some distance, explosively emerges and slams home the marble. The judges extremely liked his routine; it appeared that he would take gold. However, as Tomas and Barbie were arguing in the stands, Barbie gave Tomas an uppercut that almost sent him into orbit. Upon reaching the apex of his flight, Tomas came crashing back down to earth, ending with half his torso buried head-first in the dirt. This was considered as Lumo Team's second slam-dyols routine called the Skywalk Dyols - and Pata Team took the gold medal. Results: Holen tournament and Slam-dyols competition * Gold - Pata Team Epilogue At the conclusion of the holen tournament, someone threw a marble at Senator Cabalfin, hitting him in the head. The good Senator retaliated - at an innocent Tomas. This precipitated a melee of marble-throwing that had the entire Boarselona Stadium thundering with applause. The Olympig Committee thus decided to include marble-throwing as an event in the next Olympig games. As the games wrapped up, Tomas and Noli were in-charge of the fireworks - using their firearms, of course. All the teams had their share of gold, silver and bronze medals. In addition, Scream Team was also handed throat pastilles by the Olympig Committee, as the members were all hoarse from screaming during the games.

(2010) Een Amsterdammer in Hamburg, een Noord-Duitser in Amsterdam, p. 163-169. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, 79-4 Theodor Kerckring or Dirk Kerckring (sometimes Kerckeringh or Kerckerinck) (baptized 22 July 1638 – 2 November 1693) was a Dutch anatomist and chemical physician.Baptismal record Kerckring was born as the son of the Amsterdam merchant and VOC captain Dirck Kerckring and Margaretha Bas (daughter of Dirck Bas, a former mayor of Amsterdam).Margaret Gullan-Whur, Jabic Veenbaas Spinoza: een leven volgens de rede, Lemniscaat Publishers 2000, p. 100 In the second half of the 1650s he was a pupil at the Latin School in Amsterdam of Franciscus van den Enden (at the same time as the philosopher Benedictus de Spinoza), before studying medicine at Leiden University under Franciscus Sylvius. Around 1660 he was painted by Jurgen Ovens. In 1667 he was visited by Cosimo III de' Medici, interested in new developments in science and curious to see his collection of anatomical objects. Several sources reveal that Kerckring remained on good terms with Van den Enden, whose daughter Clara Maria he married in 1671. In order to marry the 27-year-old woman, who had a limp, Kerckring became a Roman Catholic.Kooymans, L. (2007) Gevaarlijke kennis, p. 325-326. She helped her father teach Latin; there is a famous but unsubstantiated story that Spinoza loved her unreciprocatedly. Although further details of his early life are sketchy, it is known that he spent much of his medical career prior to 1675 in Amsterdam at Singel. Afterwards he travelled throughout continental Europe, settling in Hamburg in 1678.He owned a few houses and a private chapel in the Dutch quarter, which does not exist anymore, since 1100 houses were torn down and the Hauptzollamt was built there. In 1683 he invited his old friend Niels Stensen, once one of the leading anatomists but converted to Catholicism. Stensen, becoming a priest in Florence and bishop in Münster, needed new position. Kerckring helped Stensen with an appointment in Hamburg and Stensen asked the Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III de' Medici to help Kerckring with a post. Then both men were able to share experiences and ideas. Spicilegium Kerckring is remembered for his Spicilegium anatomicum, which is an anatomical atlas of clinical observations, medical curiosities, autopsy discoveries along with general anatomical information. He is credited with describing \\"Kerckring's ossicles\\", which is an occasional ossification centre in the occipital bone that appears around the 16th week of gestation. He also provided a comprehensive description of the folds of the mucous membrane of the small intestine. These anatomical folds go by several different names, including the \\"valves of Kerckring\\", \\"Kerckring's folds\\", plicae circulares and valvulae conniventes. Kerckring used a microscope made by Spinoza. Works * Theodori Kerckringii ...

The treaty's key provisions granted extraterritoriality and most favored nation status to Britain. Background In order to conclude the First Opium War, imperial commissioner Qiying and Henry Pottinger concluded the Treaty of Nanjing aboard the British warship HMS Cornwallis in 1842 in Nanjing on the behalf of Britain and the Chinese Qing dynasty. The treaty became the first of a series of commercial treaties, often referred to as \\"unequal treaties\\", which China concluded against its wishes with Western powers. Terms During the negotiations in Nanjing, China and Britain had agreed that a supplementary treaty be concluded, and on 22July 1843 the two parties promulgated the \\"General Regulations of Trade with Britain and China\\" in Guangzhou. These regulations were included in the \\"Treaty of the Bogue,\\" which Qiying and Pottinger signed on 8October 1843 on the Bogue outside Guangzhou. The treaty laid down detailed regulations for Sino-British trade and specified terms under which Britons could reside in the newly opened ports of Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Guangzhou. While Britons were allowed to buy property in the treaty ports and reside there with their families, they were not allowed to travel to the interior of China or trade there. The treaty also granted extraterritorial privileges to British subjects and most Favored Nation status to Great Britain, which meant that the latter would enjoy any privilege granted to other powers. Aftermath In China, the treaty is widely regarded as an imperialist one, which paved the way for the subjugation of China to Western imperialism. The treaty consolidated the \\"opening\\" of China to foreign trade in the wake of the First Opium War and allowed Britons to reside in parts of China, which had not been opened to foreigners before. In 1845, local Qing authorities and the British authorities promulgated the Shanghai Land regulations, which paved the way for the foundation of the Shanghai International Settlement. Similar agreements were concluded in other treaty ports, which created a social divide between the Europeans and Chinese citizens in the cities.

Levinson's family received $2.5 million annuity from the CIA in order to stop a lawsuit revealing details of his work in Iran and to forestall any revelation of details regarding the arrangement between Levinson and the agency. He is believed to have been held captive by the government of Iran, while Iran does not acknowledge his arrest. In 2017, Levinson became the longest held American hostage in history, surpassing Floyd James Thompson. According to his family, he suffered from type 1 diabetes, gout, and hypertension. His passport has never shown up in any other country. On March 25, 2020, Levinson's family announced his death, and although the date is unknown, it is assumed that he died while in Iranian custody. Disappearance U.S. officials believed Levinson had been arrested by Iranian intelligence officials to be interrogated and used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Washington, but as every lead fizzled out and Iran repeatedly denied any involvement in his disappearance, many in the U.S. government believed Levinson was probably dead. He was last seen alive in photographs from April 2011, wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding signs, apparently written by his captors, asking for help in broken English. On December 12, 2013, the Associated Press (AP) reported that their investigations revealed that Levinson indeed had been working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), contradicting the U.S. government's statement that he was not an employee of the government at the time of his capture, U.S. officials had publicly insisted that Levinson went to Iran as a private investigator, working a cigarette smuggling case. AP had first confirmed Levinson's CIA ties in 2010. He was on an unauthorized intelligence-gathering mission about the Iranian government for the U.S. government. When his case came to light inside the U.S. government, it produced a serious scandal. Levinson's travel was planned by three CIA officials who did not follow the proper vetting process or seek the necessary approval for the mission from their supervisors. Kish Island in the Persian Gulf is a free-trade zone, meaning Americans do not need a visa to enter, a tourist destination and stronghold of international organized crime. In 2008 the CIA forced the CIA officials to turn in early resignations and disciplined seven others after an internal investigation determined they were responsible for sending Levinson on the mission to Iran. Levinson's source on Kish was Dawud Salahuddin, an American fugitive accused of the killing of the prominent former Iranian diplomat Ali Akbar Tabatabaei in 1980. The exiled Tabatabaei was holding meetings of a counter-revolutionary group at his US home at the time. What Levinson wanted in that mission remains altogether unclear. Levinson had retired from the FBI in 1998 and had become self-employed as a private investigator; his specialty was Russian organized crime gangs, and he was even interviewed numerous times for television documentaries to discuss the topic. Both Levinson and the CIA analyst who hired him, Anne Jablonski, specialized in Russian organized crime and not Iranian issues. In an interview, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of cooperation regarding Levinson's case. \\"We are willing to help, and all the intelligence services in the region can come together to gather information about him to find his whereabouts.\\"  Alleged Iranian involvement  Robert \\"Bob\\" Levinson in a 2011 hostage photo. On April 4, 2007, a little over three weeks after Levinson was arrested, an article by Iranian state-run PressTV stated that he \\"has been in the hands of Iranian security forces since the early hours of March 9\\" and \\"authorities are well on the way to finishing the procedural arrangements that could see him freed in a matter of days\\". The same article explained that it was established that Levinson's trip to Kish \\"was purely that of a private businessman looking to make contact with persons who could help him make representations to official Iranian bodies responsible for suppressing trade in pirated products which is a major concern of his company\\". On January 8, 2013, the Associated Press reported that \\"the consensus now among some U.S. officials involved in the case is that despite years of denials, Iran's intelligence service was almost certainly behind the 54-second video and five photographs of Levinson that were emailed anonymously to his family. 'The tradecraft used to send those items was too good, indicating professional spies were behind them', the officials said ... While everything dealing with Iran is murky, their conclusion is based on the U.S. government's best intelligence analysis.\\"  Family investigation  Media reported in August 2007 that Christine Levinson, wife of Robert, was planning a trip to Iran with their oldest son, Dan. The United States Department of State stressed that there was a travel warning to that country and they would be doing so at their own risk. Iran announced on September 23, 2007, that they would be allowed to visit the country. In December 2007, Christine and Dan traveled to Iran to attempt to learn more about Levinson's disappearance. They met with Iranian officials in Tehran and traveled to Robert's hotel on Kish, the Hotel Maryam. Airport officials allowed Christine and Dan to view the flight manifests for all flights leaving Kish during the time Robert was due to leave, but his name did not appear on any of the lists provided. They were also able to view Robert's signature from the hotel check-out bill on March 9. Iranian officials promised to provide an investigative report to the family, but have yet to do so. In July 2008 and subsequent interviews, Christine and Dan said they wanted to travel to Iran again soon.  President Ahmadinejad's statements  Pressed by Charlie Rose in an interview for CBS This Morning in September 2012, then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \\"did not deny Iran still has Levinson in its custody, and hinted that there had been talks about a prisoner exchange\\". Rose asked, \\"Is there anything that could happen, a trade or something, that could allow him to come back to the United States?\\" Ahmadinejad responded: > I remember that last year Iranian and American intelligence groups had a > meeting, but I haven't followed up on it. I thought they'd come to some kind > of an agreement. CBS' John Miller says that \\"tacit admission that he's in their custody and that there have been talks\\", in and of itself, \\"is a big step\\". In a 2008 interview with NBC's Brian Williams, Ahmadinejad was questioned regarding Levinson's case and its status. He responded: > There was a claim made some time ago, some people came over, the gentleman's > family came over. They talked and met with our officials and were given our > responses. I see no reason for a person who was given an Iranian visa and — > came into Iran, arrived in Iran through official channels, to have problems > here. Our security officials and agents have expressed their willingness to > assist the FBI, if the FBI has any information about his travels around the > world. We have said that we are ready to help, to assist with that matter. > There are certain informations that only the FBI at the moment has. I am not > an expert in that field, as you might appreciate, so I'm not going to make a > judgment here whether that information, as they say, is true and only held > by the FBI or other parties for that matter.  U.S. government investigation  President Barack Obama meets with Christine Levinson in the Oval Office on March 6, 2012 In June 2007, President George W. Bush released a statement on Levinson's case, saying: \\"I am ... disturbed by the Iranian regime's refusal so far to provide any information on Robert Levinson, despite repeated U.S. requests. I call on Iran's leaders to tell us what they know about his whereabouts.\\" On January 13, 2009, U.S. Senator Bill Nelson revealed during Hillary Clinton's confirmation hearing that he believes Robert Levinson is being held in a secret prison in Iran. \\"The door has been closed at every turn,\\" Nelson said during Clinton's confirmation hearing. \\"We think he is being held by the government of Iran in a secret prison.\\" According to The New York Times, Levinson had been meeting with Dawud Salahuddin, (an American convert to Islam wanted for the 1980 murder of an Iranian dissident in the US) \\"just before he went missing\\". On March 8, 2013, the Obama administration released a statement to mark the sixth anniversary of Levinson's disappearance. Press Secretary Jay Carney said, > Finding him remains a high priority for the United States, and we will > continue to do all that we can to bring him home safely to his friends and > family, so they may begin to heal after so many years of extraordinary grief > and uncertainty. The Iranian Government previously offered assistance in > locating Mr. Levinson and we look forward to receiving this assistance, even > as we disagree on other key issues. Secretary of State John Kerry also met with Levinson's wife and son \\"to reiterate that the U.S. government remains committed to locating Mr. Levinson and reuniting him safely with his family\\".  Reward  $20 million reward poster to help find Robert Levinson. On March 6, 2012, approaching the fifth anniversary of Robert Levinson's captivity, the Federal Bureau of Investigation offered a $1-million reward for information leading to his safe recovery and return. In addition, a campaign was launched, using billboards, radio messages, flyers, and a telephone hotline to publicize this reward and obtain information of his whereabouts. In conjunction with this announced reward, the Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it was giving the two youngest Levinson children $5,000 each to help with their college costs. On March 9, 2015, the FBI increased the reward to up to $5 million for information regarding Levinson's whereabouts. On November 4, 2019, the United States Department of State Rewards for Justice Program offered a $20-million reward for information leading to Levinson's whereabouts.  Proof of life  According to the Associated Press, Levinson's family received \\"irrefutable proof\\" of life late in 2010. On December 9, 2011, the family released a hostage video they received in November 2010. In the video, Robert appears to have lost considerable weight, and repeatedly pleads for help in returning home. On January 8, 2013, Levinson's family released photos to the media showing the former agent in an orange jumpsuit with overgrown and unkempt hair. A family spokesman told CNN the photographs were received in April 2011. CNN reported: \\"Asked why the family is releasing the images now, more than 18 months later, the spokesman said: 'The family is anxious that not enough is being done. There is frustration with the lack of progress on the case.'\\"  President Rouhani's statements  In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour during her trip to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2013, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of cooperation regarding Levinson's case. \\"We are willing to help, and all the intelligence services in the region can come together to gather information about him to find his whereabouts\\", Rouhani told Amanpour, \\"and we're willing to cooperate on that\\". In a subsequent interview with Charlie Rose, Rouhani said, \\"As to where his whereabouts when he disappeared, I personally have no information on those details, but naturally when someone disappears their family is suffering in specific. Everyone must help. It's natural that everyone must help\\".  President Obama's discussion of case with Rouhani  During the Obama–Rouhani phone call on September 27, 2013, the first communication between the presidents of the two countries in 34 years, President Obama noted his concern about Levinson's disappearance to Rouhani, and expressed his interest in seeing him reunited with his family.  United States Senate resolution  On May 11, 2015, the United States Senate voted on concurrent resolution 16 for the release of Robert Levinson, which passed in a unanimous decision without amendment. This resolution states that it is U.S. policy that: (1) the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran should immediately release Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian, and cooperate with the U.S. government to locate and return Robert Levinson; and (2) the U.S. government should undertake every effort using every diplomatic tool at its disposal to secure their release.  Reported death  In March 2020, it was reported that Levinson's family and the United States government had concluded that it was likely that Levinson had died in Iranian custody before 2020. On 5 October 2020, a US Court ordered the government of Iran to pay more than $1.4 billion in punitive and compensatory damages to Levinson's family.https://www.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN26Q2YH?__twitter_impression=true  See also  *List of people who disappeared mysteriously  References  External links *Help Bob Levinson on Facebook *Help Bob Levinson *Bob Levinson wanted poster FBI web site, retrieved November 2019.

Manufacturing Engineering is a branch of professional engineering that shares many common concepts and ideas with other fields of engineering such as mechanical, chemical, electrical, and industrial engineering. Manufacturing engineering requires the ability to plan the practices of manufacturing; to research and to develop tools, processes, machines and equipment; and to integrate the facilities and systems for producing quality products with the optimum expenditure of capital. The manufacturing or production engineer's primary focus is to turn raw material into an updated or new product in the most effective, efficient & economic way possible. Overview Manufacturing Engineering is based on core industrial engineering and mechanical engineering skills, adding important elements from mechatronics, commerce, economics and business management. This field also deals with the integration of different facilities and systems for producing quality products (with optimal expenditure) by applying the principles of physics and the results of manufacturing systems studies, such as the following: * Craft * Putting-out system * British factory system * American system of manufacturing * Soviet ctivism in manufacturing * Mass production * Computer integrated manufacturing * Computer-aided technologies in manufacturing * Just in time manufacturing * Lean manufacturing * Flexible manufacturing * Mass customization * Agile manufacturing * Rapid manufacturing * Prefabrication * Ownership * Fabrication * Publication A set of six-axis robots used for welding. Manufacturing engineers develop and create physical artifacts, production processes, and technology. It is a very broad area which includes the design and development of products. Manufacturing engineering is considered to be a subdiscipline of industrial engineering/systems engineering and has very strong overlaps with mechanical engineering. Manufacturing engineers' success or failure directly impacts the advancement of technology and the spread of innovation. This field of manufacturing engineering emerged from tool and die discipline in the early 20th century. It expanded greatly from the 1960s when industrialized countries introduced factories with: 1\\\\. Numerical control machine tools and automated systems of production. 2\\\\. Advanced statistical methods of quality control: These factories were pioneered by the American electrical engineer William Edwards Deming, who was initially ignored by his home country. The same methods of quality control later turned Japanese factories into world leaders in cost-effectiveness and production quality. 3\\\\. Industrial robots on the factory floor, introduced in the late 1970s: These computer-controlled welding arms and grippers could perform simple tasks such as attaching a car door quickly and flawlessly 24 hours a day. This cut costs and improved production speed.  History  The history of manufacturing engineering can be traced to factories in the mid 19th century USA and 18th century UK. Although large home production sites and workshops were established in China, ancient Rome and the Middle East, the Venice Arsenal provides one of the first examples of a factory in the modern sense of the word. Founded in 1104 in the Republic of Venice several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution, this factory mass-produced ships on assembly lines using manufactured parts. The Venice Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day and, at its height, employed 16,000 people. Many historians regard Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory (established in 1761 in Birmingham) as the first modern factory. Similar claims can be made for John Lombe's silk mill in Derby (1721), or Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill (1771). The Cromford Mill was purpose-built to accommodate the equipment it held and to take the material through the various manufacturing processes.Ford assembly line, 1913. One historian, Jack Weatherford, contends that the first factory was in Potosí. The Potosi factory took advantage of the abundant silver that was mined nearby and processed silver ingot slugs into coins. British colonies in the 19th century built factories simply as buildings where a large number of workers gathered to perform hand labor, usually in textile production. This proved more efficient for the administration and distribution of materials to individual workers than earlier methods of manufacturing, such as cottage industries or the putting-out system. Cotton mills used inventions such as the steam engine and the power loom to pioneer the industrial factories of the 19th century, where precision machine tools and replaceable parts allowed greater efficiency and less waste. This experience formed the basis for the later studies of manufacturing engineering. Between 1820 and 1850, non-mechanized factories supplanted traditional artisan shops as the predominant form of manufacturing institution. Henry Ford further revolutionized the factory concept and thus manufacturing engineering in the early 20th century with the innovation of mass production. Highly specialized workers situated alongside a series of rolling ramps would build up a product such as (in Ford's case) an automobile. This concept dramatically decreased production costs for virtually all manufactured goods and brought about the age of consumerism. =Modern developments= Modern manufacturing engineering studies include all intermediate processes required for the production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term \\"fabrication\\" for these processes. thumb300pxrightKUKA industrial robots being used at a bakery for food production Automation is used in different processes of manufacturing such as machining and welding. Automated manufacturing refers to the application of automation to produce goods in a factory. The main advantages of automated manufacturing for the manufacturing process are realized with effective implementation of automation and include: higher consistency and quality, reduction of lead times, simplification of production, reduced handling, improved work flow, and improved worker morale. Robotics is the application of mechatronics and automation to create robots, which are often used in manufacturing to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot). Robots are used extensively in manufacturing engineering. Robots allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications. Education =Manufacturing Engineers= Manufacturing Engineers focus on the design, development and operation of integrated systems of production to obtain high quality & economically competitive products. These systems may include material handling equipment, machine tools, robots or even computers or networks of computers. =Certification Programs= Manufacturing engineers possess an associate's or bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in manufacturing engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually two to five years followed by five more years of professional practice to qualify as a professional engineer. Working as a manufacturing engineering technologist involves a more applications-oriented qualification path. Academic degrees for manufacturing engineers are usually the Associate or Bachelor of Engineering, [BE] or [BEng], and the Associate or Bachelor of Science, [BS] or [BSc]. For manufacturing technologists the required degrees are Associate or Bachelor of Technology [B.TECH] or Associate or Bachelor of Applied Science [BASc] in Manufacturing, depending upon the university. Master's degrees in engineering manufacturing include Master of Engineering [ME] or [MEng] in Manufacturing, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Manufacturing Management, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Industrial and Production Management, and Master of Science [M.Sc] as well as Master of Engineering [ME] in Design, which is a subdiscipline of manufacturing. Doctoral [PhD] or [DEng] level courses in manufacturing are also available depending on the university. The undergraduate degree curriculum generally includes courses in physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and specific topics in mechanical and manufacturing engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of manufacturing engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their degree work. =Syllabus= The Foundational Curriculum for a Bachelor's Degree of Manufacturing Engineering or Production Engineering includes below mentioned syllabus. This syllabus is closely related to Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, but it differs by placing more emphasis on Manufacturing Science or Production Science. It includes the following areas: * Mathematics (Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics and Linear Algebra) * Mechanics (Statics & Dynamics) * Solid Mechanics * Fluid Mechanics * Materials Science * Strength of Materials * Fluid Dynamics * Hydraulics * Pneumatics * HVAC (Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning) * Heat Transfer * Applied Thermodynamics * Energy Conversion * Instrumentation and Measurement * Engineering Drawing (Drafting) & Engineering Design * Engineering Graphics * Mechanism Design including Kinematics and Dynamics * Manufacturing Processes * Mechatronics * Circuit Analysis * Lean Manufacturing * Automation * Reverse Engineering * Quality Control * CAD(Computer aided Design which includes Solid Modelling) and CAM (Computer aided Manufacturing) A degree in Manufacturing Engineering typically differs from Mechanical Engineering in only a few specialized classes. Mechanical Engineering degrees focus more on the product design process and on complex products which requires more mathematical expertise. Manufacturing engineering certification Certification and licensure: In some countries, \\"professional engineer\\" is the term for registered or licensed engineers who are permitted to offer their professional services directly to the public. Professional Engineer, abbreviated (PE - USA) or (PEng - Canada), is the designation for licensure in North America. In order to qualify for this license, a candidate needs a bachelor's degree from an ABET recognized university in the USA, a passing score on a state examination, and four years of work experience usually gained via a structured internship. In the USA, more recent graduates have the option of dividing this licensure process into two segments. The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam is often taken immediately after graduation and the Principles and Practice of Engineering exam is taken after four years of working in a chosen engineering field. Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) certification (USA): The SME administers qualifications specifically for the manufacturing industry. These are not degree level qualifications and are not recognized at the professional engineering level. The following discussion deals with qualifications in the USA only. Qualified candidates for the Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) must pass a three-hour, 130-question multiple-choice exam. The exam covers math, manufacturing processes, manufacturing management, automation, and related subjects. Additionally, a candidate must have at least four years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience. Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) is an engineering qualification administered by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Dearborn, Michigan, USA. Candidates qualifying for a Certified Manufacturing Engineer credential must pass a four-hour, 180 question multiple-choice exam which covers more in- depth topics than does the CMfgT exam. CMfgE candidates must also have eight years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience, with a minimum of four years of work experience. Certified Engineering Manager (CEM). The Certified Engineering Manager Certificate is also designed for engineers with eight years of combined education and manufacturing experience. The test is four hours long and has 160 multiple-choice questions. The CEM certification exam covers business processes, teamwork, responsibility, and other management-related categories. Modern tools CAD model and CNC machined part Many manufacturing companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate computer-aided engineering (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances. Other CAE programs commonly used by product manufacturers include product life cycle management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of relatively few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows. Just as manufacturing engineering is linked with other disciplines, such as mechatronics, multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is also being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process. MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems. Manufacturing Engineering around the world Manufacturing engineering is an extremely important discipline worldwide. It goes by different names in different countries. In the United States and the continental European Union it is commonly known as Industrial Engineering and in the United Kingdom and Australia it is called Manufacturing Engineering Subdisciplines =Mechanics= Mohr's circle, a common tool to study stresses in a mechanical element Mechanics, in the most general sense, is the study of forces and their effects on matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include: * Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads * Dynamics (or kinetics), the study of how forces affect moving bodies * Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress * Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces * Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) If the engineering project were to design a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the manufacture of the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle or to design the intake system for the engine. =Kinematics= Kinematics is the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. The movement of a crane and the oscillations of a piston in an engine are both simple kinematic systems. The crane is a type of open kinematic chain, while the piston is part of a closed four-bar linkage. Engineers typically use kinematics in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Kinematics can be used to find the possible range of motion for a given mechanism, or, working in reverse, can be used to design a mechanism that has a desired range of motion. =Drafting= mechanical double seal Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which manufacturers create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions. Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings, but this is becoming an increasing rarity with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing. Engineers primarily manufacture parts manually in the areas of applied spray coatings, finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine. Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical and manufacturing engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). =Machine Tools and Metal Fabrication= Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping. All machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine. Metal fabrication is the building of metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling processes. =Computer Integrated Manufacturing= Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process. Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries. =Mechatronics= SCORBOT-ER 4u, workbench CNC mill and CNC lathe Mechatronics is an engineering discipline that deals with the convergence of electrical, mechanical and manufacturing systems. Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and are widespread. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various aircraft and automobile subsystems. The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems, but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), are used in automobiles to initiate the deployment of airbags, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high-definition printing. In future it is hoped that such devices will be used in tiny implantable medical devices and to improve optical communication. =Textile engineering= Textile engineering courses deal with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the design and control of all aspects of fiber, textile, and apparel processes, products, and machinery. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation, and waste and pollution control. Additionally, students are given experience in plant design and layout, machine and wet process design and improvement, and designing and creating textile products. Throughout the textile engineering curriculum, students take classes from other engineering and disciplines including: mechanical, chemical, materials and industrial engineering. =Advanced composite materials= Advanced composite materials (engineering) (ACMs) are also known as advanced polymer matrix composites. These are generally characterized or determined by unusually high strength fibres with unusually high stiffness, or modulus of elasticity characteristics, compared to other materials, while bound together by weaker matrices. Advanced composite materials have broad, proven applications, in the aircraft, aerospace, and sports equipment sectors. Even more specifically ACMs are very attractive for aircraft and aerospace structural parts. Manufacturing ACMs is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. Composite products range from skateboards to components of the space shuttle. The industry can be generally divided into two basic segments, industrial composites and advanced composites. Employment Manufacturing engineering is just one facet of the engineering manufacturing industry. Manufacturing engineers enjoy improving the production process from start to finish. They have the ability to keep the whole production process in mind as they focus on a particular portion of the process. Successful students in manufacturing engineering degree programs are inspired by the notion of starting with a natural resource, such as a block of wood, and ending with a usable, valuable product, such as a desk, produced efficiently and economically. Manufacturing engineers are closely connected with engineering and industrial design efforts. Examples of major companies that employ manufacturing engineers in the United States include General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, Boeing, Gates Corporation and Pfizer. Examples in Europe include Airbus, Daimler, BMW, Fiat, Navistar International, and Michelin Tyre. Industries where manufacturing engineers are generally employed include: * Aerospace industry * Automotive industry * Chemical industry * Computer industry * Engineering management * Food processing industry * Garment industry * Industrial engineering * Management engineering * Mechanical engineering * Pharmaceutical industry * Process engineering * Pulp and paper industry * Systems engineering * Toy industry Frontiers of research =Flexible manufacturing systems= A typical FMS system A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a manufacturing system in which there is some amount of flexibility that allows the system to react to changes, whether predicted or unpredicted. This flexibility is generally considered to fall into two categories, both of which have numerous subcategories. The first category, machine flexibility, covers the system's ability to be changed to produce new product types and the ability to change the order of operations executed on a part. The second category, called routing flexibility, consists of the ability to use multiple machines to perform the same operation on a part, as well as the system's ability to absorb large-scale changes, such as in volume, capacity, or capability. Most FMS systems comprise three main systems. The work machines, which are often automated CNC machines, are connected by a material handling system to optimize parts flow, and to a central control computer, which controls material movements and machine flow. The main advantages of an FMS is its high flexibility in managing manufacturing resources like time and effort in order to manufacture a new product. The best application of an FMS is found in the production of small sets of products from a mass production. =Computer integrated manufacturing= Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) in engineering is a method of manufacturing in which the entire production process is controlled by computer. Traditionally separated process methods are joined through a computer by CIM. This integration allows the processes to exchange information and to initiate actions. Through this integration, manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone, although the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Typically CIM relies on closed-loop control processes based on real-time input from sensors. It is also known as flexible design and manufacturing. =Friction stir welding= Close-up view of a friction stir weld tack tool Friction stir welding was discovered in 1991 by The Welding Institute (TWI). This innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins previously un-weldable materials, including several aluminum alloys. It may play an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include: welding the seams of the aluminum main space shuttle external tank, the Orion Crew Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket; armor plating for amphibious assault ships; and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation, among an increasingly growing range of uses. Other areas of research are Product Design, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), Lean Manufacturing, Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, Green Manufacturing, Precision Engineering, Smart Materials, etc. See also *Industrial engineering *Mechanical engineering *Automation *Computer-aided design *Manufacturing *Industrial revolution *Mechatronics *Robotics ;Associations * Society of Manufacturing Engineers * INFORMS * Institute of Industrial Engineers  Notes   External links  * Institute of Manufacturing - UK * Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute Category:Industrial engineering de:Fertigungstechnik fi:Tuotantotekniikka ","title":"Manufacturing engineering"},{"id":"11200533","text":"Back to You may refer to: Television * Back to You (TV series), a short- lived American situation comedy series September 2007 to May 2008 Music Albums: * Back to You (album), a 1997 album by Anita Cochran Songs: * \\"Back to You\\" (Rock Goddess song), 1983 * \\"Back to You\\" (Riverdales song), 1995 * \\"Back to You\\" (Bryan Adams song), 1997 * \\"Back to You\\" (John Mayer song), 2001 * \\"Back to You\\" (Brett Anderson song), 2007 * \\"Back to You\\" (Thenewno2 song), 2008 * \\"Back to You\\" (Mandisa song), 2014 * \\"Back to You\\" (Mary Mary song), 2016 * \\"Back to You\\" (Mollie King song), 2016 * \\"Back to You\\" (Louis Tomlinson song), 2017 * \\"Back to You\\" (Selena Gomez song), 2018 * \\"Back to You\\" (Shane Filan song), 2018 * \\"Back 2 You / Still Grey\\", a 2004 song by Pendulum * \\"Back 2 U\\", a 2016 song by Steve Aoki and Boehm ","title":"Back to You"},{"id":"11200557","text":"An atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a rare tumor usually diagnosed in childhood. Although usually a brain tumor, AT/RT can occur anywhere in the central nervous system (CNS), including the spinal cord. About 60% will be in the posterior cranial fossa (particularly the cerebellum). One review estimated 52% in the posterior fossa, 39% are supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (sPNET), 5% are in the pineal, 2% are spinal, and 2% are multifocal. In the United States, three children per 1,000,000 or around 30 new AT/RT cases are diagnosed each year. AT/RT represents around 3% of pediatric cancers of the CNS.Measure D6: Types of Childhood Cancer – 2006 Tables D6a & D6b. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved on 2008-04-17. Around 17% of all pediatric cancers involve the CNS, making these cancers the most common childhood solid tumor. The survival rate for CNS tumors is around 60%. Pediatric brain cancer is the second-leading cause of childhood cancer death, just after leukemia. Recent trends suggest that the rate of overall CNS tumor diagnosis is increasing by about 2.7% per year. As diagnostic techniques using genetic markers improve and are used more often, the proportion of AT/RT diagnoses is expected to increase. AT/RT was only recognized as an entity in 1996 and added to the World Health Organization Brain Tumor Classification in 2000 (Grade IV). The relatively recent classification and rarity has contributed to initial misdiagnosis and nonoptimal therapy. This has led to a historically poor prognosis. See Figure 1. Current research is focusing on using chemotherapy protocols that are effective against rhabdomyosarcoma in combination with surgery and radiation therapy. Recent studies using multimodal therapy have shown significantly improved survival data. In 2008, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston reported two-year overall survival of 53% and event-free survival of 70% (median age at diagnosis of 26 months). In 2013, the Medical University of Vienna reported five-year overall survival of 100%, and event-free survival of 89% (median age at diagnosis of 24 months). Survival rates can be significantly improved when the correct genetic diagnosis is made at the outset, followed with specific multimodal treatment. Signs and symptoms Clinical signs and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. Since many of the tumors occur in the posterior fossa, they present like other posterior fossa tumors, often with headache, vomiting, lethargy, and ataxia (unsteady gait). A case of a seven-month-old child with a primarily spinal tumor that presented with progressive paraplegia and abnormal feeling in the legs was reported. Genetics Genetic similarities have been found within rhabdoid tumors. In particular, the chromosomal 22 deletion is very common in AT/RTs. The chromosome 22 area contains the hSNF5/INI1 gene that appears to function as a classic tumor suppressor gene. Most rhabdoid tumors have INI1 deletions whether they occur in the CNS, kidney, or elsewhere. This mutation is viewed as the \\"first hit\\" which predisposes children to malignancies. INI1/hSNF5, a component of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex, is a critical tumor suppressor biallelically inactivated in rhabdoid tumors. Identification of INI1 as a tumor suppressor has facilitated accurate diagnosis of rhabdoid tumors. The rate of transcription for SWI/SNF and HDAC complexes seem to be regulated by the INI1 gene. The SWI/SNF complex plays a role in chromatin remodeling. AT/RT is the first pediatric brain tumor for which a candidate tumor suppressor gene has been identified. A mutation or deletion in the INI1/hSNF5 gene occurs in the majority of AT/RT tumors. Up to 90% of AT/RT cases involve chromosome 22 deletion. This is mainly point mutations in the hSNF5/INI1 gene (i.e., one can diagnosis AT/RT without a chromosome 22 deletion elsewhere). The hSNF5/INI1 gene regulates 15 or so proteins in the chromatin structure. In addition, the OPN gene has a higher expression in AT/RT tumors. All of the AT/RT cancers are believed to be not associated with the hSNF5/INI1 gene, as 14 additional proteins in the chromatin structure are controlled by other genes. There are also some emerging mouse models of the AT/RT cancer as well as experimental cell lines derived from tumors. Despite these advances, the function of the gene is not yet understood. There is not enough known about the function of INI1, either as an independent modulator of gene expression or through its association with the SWI/SNF complex, to be able to use specific targeted biological agents for treatment. Prospective clinical and biologic trials are greatly needed to understand the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, as well as the role of the gene. = Risk for siblings and other members of the family= Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors are very rare, and absolute risk to siblings is not reported in the literature. However, some reports exist of AT/RTs presenting in two members of the same family, or one family member with an AT/RT and another with a renal rhabdoid tumor or other CNS tumor. These are suspected to arise from germline genetic mutations in a parent shared by affected siblings. *A three-generation family is known in which two half-brothers were diagnosed with CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). The two boys, diagnosed at 2 months and 17 months of age, had a germline insertion mutation in exon 4 of the INI1 gene that was inherited from their healthy mother. A maternal uncle died in childhood from a brain tumor and a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney. The identification of two unaffected carriers in a family segregating a germline mutation and rhabdoid tumor supports the hypothesis that variable risks of development of rhabdoid tumor in the context of a germline mutation may exist. Most rhabdoid tumors may occur in a developmental window. This family highlights the importance of mutation analysis in all patients with a suspected rhabdoid tumor. *In the first case report of monozygotic twins, both with brain tumors having similar genetic alterations, authors suggest a common genetic pathway. *A case was reported of an infant who developed both AT/RT and renal rhabdoid tumors that were identical in gross and immunologic histology. * A family has had multiple generations of posterior fossa tumors including rhabdoid tumors and choroid plexus carcinoma. A germline mutation (SMARCB1) was found in both affected and some unaffected family members. *Two sisters were diagnosed with AT/RTs 15 days apart. A case report stated no karyotypic anomalies were noted. *Three siblings had a mutation of the SMARCB1 gene and one had a choroid plexus carcinoma and two had an AT/RT. Although the mother had a normal somatic DNA, the mutation apparently was inherited from the mother's germline due to a mutation during oogenesis. *Izycka-Swieszewska et al. describe a five-month-old child with an AT/RT, whose father was diagnosed with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the spinal canal. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed significant genetic differences in the specimens which suggest that the occurrence of these virulent CNS malignancies within a single family was coincidental. Pathology AT/RT and rhabdoid tumor share the term \\"rhabdoid\\" because under a microscope, both tumors resemble rhabdomyosarcoma.AT/RT Histology with numerous rhabdoid tumor cellsRhabdoid Tumor Cell - 400X Magnification =Histology= The tumor histopathology is jumbled small and large cells. The tissue of this tumor contains many different types of cells including the rhabdoid cells, large spindled cells, epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and areas resembling primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). As much as 70% of the tumor may be made up of PNET-like cells. Ultrastructure characteristic whorls of intermediate filaments are seen in the rhabdoid tumors (as with rhabdoid tumors in any area of the body). Ho and associates found sickle-shaped embracing cells, previously unreported, in all of 11 cases of AT/RT. =Immunohistochemistry= Immunohistochemistry for INI1, the product of the SMARCB1 gene typically defective in AT/RT: Note the loss of brown staining in the nuclei of tumor cells with defective SMARCB1 as compared to retained staining of nuclei of vascular cells (internal positive control). Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specific molecular markers are characteristic of particular cancer types. Immunohistochemistry is also widely used in basic research to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers in different parts of a tissue. Proteins found in an ATeratoid/RT are: *Vimentin-positive *Cytokeratin-positive *Neuron specific enolase-positive *Epitelial membrane antigen-positive *Glial fibrillary acidic protein- positive *Synaptophysin *Chromogranin *Smooth muscle actin *Desmin *Carcinoembrionary antigen *CD99 antigen; *S-100 *neurofilaments *AFP – not found *HCG – negative Cytogenetic studies Cytogenetics is the study of a tumor’s genetic make-up. Fluorescent in situ hybridization may be able to help locate a mutation or abnormality that may be allowing tumor growth. This technique has been shown to be useful in identifying some tumors and distinguishing two histologically similar tumors from each other (such as AT/RTs and PNETs). In particular, medulloblastmas/PNETs may possibly be differentiated cytogenetically from AT/RTs, as chromosomal deletions of 17p are relatively common with medulloblastoma and abnormalities of 22q11.2 are not seen. However, chromosomal 22 deletions are very common in AT/RTs. In importance of the hSNF5/INI1 gene located on chromosomal band 22q11.2 is highlighted, as the mutation’s presence is sufficient to change the diagnosis from a medulloblastoma or PNET to the more aggressive AT/RT classification. However, this mutation is not present in 100% of cases. Therefore, if the mutation is not present in an otherwise classic AT/RT immunohistochemical and morphologic pattern then the diagnosis remains an AT/RT. Diagnosis The standard work- up for AT/RT includes: * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine * Lumbar puncture to look for M1 disease * Computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen to check for a tumor * Bone marrow aspiration to check for bone tumors. Sometimes the physician will perform a stem cell transplant * Bone marrow biopsy * Bone scan The initial diagnosis of a tumor is made with a radiographic study (MRI or CT-). If CT was performed first, an MRI is usually performed as the images are often more detailed and may reveal previously undetected metastatic tumors in other locations of the brain. In addition, an MRI of the spine is usually performed. The AT/RT tumor often spreads to the spine. AT/RT is difficult to diagnose only from radiographic study; usually, a pathologist must perform a cytological or genetic analysis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is important (CSF), as one-third of patients will have intracranial dissemination with involvement of the CSF. Large tumor cells, eccentricity of the nuclei, and prominent nucleoli are consistent findings. Usually only a minority of AT/RT biopsies have rhabdoid cells, making diagnosis more difficult. Increasingly it is recommended that a genetic analysis be performed on the brain tumor, especially to find if a deletion in the INI1/hSNF5 gene is involved (appears to account for over 80% of the cases). The correct diagnosis of the tumor is critical to any protocol. Studies have shown that 8% to over 50% of AT/RT tumors are diagnosed incorrectly. =Classification= AT/RT may be related to malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), which occurs outside the CNS, usually in the kidney. The finding that AT/RT and MRT both have deletions of the INI1 gene indicates that rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and brain are at least closely related. AT/RT and MRT also have similar histology and similar clinical and demographic features. Moreover, 10–15% of MRT patients have simultaneous or subsequent brain tumors, many of which are secondary or primary MRT. =Differential diagnosis= The critical step in treatment planning is to determine the correct histology of the tumor. Misidentification of the tumor histology can lead to errors in treatment and prognosis. Atypical teratoid/rhaboid tumor closely resembles medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, choroid plexus carcinoma, and some kinds of germ cell tumor. Because rhabdoid characteristics are not the only component of AT/RT, some sections of an AT/RT may resemble other tumors. These characteristics may be present only in focal areas or may be less pronounced. Consideration of AT/RT when a medulloblastoma or PNET is suspected is important, particularly in a child under the age of one. Cytogenetic studies can assist in differentiating MB/PNETs from AT/RTs. Some kinds of germ cell tumors secrete tumor markers AFP or bHCG; AT/RTs do not. =Appearance on radiologic exam= AT/RTs can occur at any sites within the CNS; however, about 60% are located in the posterior fossa or cerebellar area. The ASCO study showed 52% posterior fossa; 39% sPNET; 5% pineal; 2% spinal, and 2% multifocal. The tumors' appearance on CT and MRI are not specific, tending towards large size, calcifications, necrosis (tissue death), and hemorrhage (bleeding). Radiological studies alone cannot identify AT/RT; a pathologist almost always has to evaluate a brain tissue sample. The increased cellularity of the tumor may make the appearance on an uncontrasted CT to have increased attenuation. Solid parts of the tumor often enhance with contrast MRI finding on T1 and T2 weighted images are variable. Precontrast T2 weighted images may show an isosignal or slightly hypersignal. Solid components of the tumor may enhance with contrast, but not always. MRI studies appear to be more able to pick up metastatic foci in other intracranial locations, as well as intraspinal locations. Preoperative and follow-up studies are needed to detect metastatic disease. Treatment =Surgery= Surgery plays a critical role in obtaining tissue to make an accurate diagnosis. Surgery alone is not curative. In addition, 30% of the AT/RTs are located supratentorially and a predilection exists for the cerebellopontine angle, which makes surgical resection difficult. One-third or more children will have disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis. Total or near-total resections are often not possible. =Chemotherapy= Around 50% of the AT/RTs will transiently respond, but chemotherapy by itself is rarely curative. No standard treatment for AT/RT is known. Various chemotherapeutic agents have been used against AT/RTs, which are also used against other CNS tumors including cisplatinum, carboplatinum, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and etoposide. Some chemotherapy regimens are listed below: * CCG clinical trial CCG-9921 was activated in 1993 and published its results in 2005. The proposed treatments did not have different outcomes and were not an improvement on prior treatments. Geyer published a review of chemotherapy on 299 infants with CNS tumors that evaluated response rate, event-free survival (EFS), and toxicity of two chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of children younger than 36 months with malignant brain tumors. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two regimens of induction chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide v vincristine, carboplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide). Intensified induction chemotherapy resulted in a high response rate of malignant brain tumors in infants. Survival was comparable to that of previous studies, and most patients who survived did not receive radiation therapy. *Sarcoma protocols. There has been at least one report in the literature of malignant rhabdoid tumors of the CNS being treated as a high-grade intracranial sarcoma. These three cases were treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and triple intrathecal chemotherapy similar to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study III guidelines. * Intrathecal protocols. One of the difficulties with brain and spinal tumors is that the blood brain barrier needs to be crossed so that the drug can get to the tumor. One mechanism to deliver the drug is through a device called an Ommaya reservoir. This is a device which shares some characteristics with a shunt in which a tube a surgically placed in the fluid surrounding the brain and a bulb shaped reservoir attached to the tubing is placed under the skin of the scalp. When the child is to receive intrathecal chemotherapy, the drug is administered into this bulb reservoir. At other times intrathecal chemotherapeutic agents are delivered through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). A current Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium Protocol uses intrathecal mafosfamide, a pre-activated cyclophosphamide derivative, in addition to other modalities to try to effect this tumor. * High dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. This therapy uses chemotherapy at doses high enough to completely suppress the bone marrow. Prior to instituting this therapy, the child has a central line placed and stem cells are gathered. After therapy these cells are given back to the child to regrow the bone marrow. Stem cell rescue or autologous bone marrow transplantation, was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, but has declined over the history of chemotherapy protocols. =Radiation therapy= The traditional practice for childhood brain tumors has been to use chemotherapy and to defer radiation therapy until a child is older than three years. This strategy is based upon observations that children under three have significant long-term complications as a result of brain irradiation. However, the long-term outcomes of AT/RT are so poor that some protocols call for upfront radiation therapy, often in spite of young age. The dose and volume of radiation had not been standardized, but radiation does appear to improve survival. The use of radiation has been limited in children younger than three because of the risk of severe neurocognitive deficits. Protocols using conformal, local radiation in the young child are used to try to cure this tumor. External beam (conformal) radiation uses several beams that intersect at the tumor location; the normal brain tissue receives less radiation and cognitive function is thereby less affected. Proton beam radiation was only offered at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and at Loma Linda, California, as of 2002. Since 2003, three or four more proton therapy centers have opened in the United States. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is in the process of building one at their Memphis, Tennessee, location. Some centers have since opened in Europe. (Germany, Switzerland, and France).Proton Beam Therapy Article Loma Linda Medical Center Proton Treatment Center - Overview Loma Linda overview of Childhood Brain Tumors =Chromatin remodeling agents= This protocol is still in preclinical evaluation. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are a new class of anticancer agents targeted directly at chromatin remodeling. These agents have been used in acute promyelocytic leukemia and have been found to affect the HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression. Understanding of the INI1 deficiency is insufficient to predict whether HDAC inhibitors will be effective against AT/RTs. Some laboratory results indicate it is effective against certain AT/RT cell lines. Prognosis The prognosis for AT/RT has been very poor, although some indications exist that an IRSIII-based therapy can produce long-term survival (60 to 72 months). Two-year survival is less than 20%, average survival postoperatively is 11 months, and doctors often recommend palliative care, especially with younger children because of the poor outcomes. Recently, a protocol used by a multicenter trial reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology resulted in a 70% survival rate at 2–3 years, with most relapses occurring within months, leading to hope that a point exists beyond which patients can be considered cured. Patients with metastasis (disseminated tumor), larger tumors, tumors that could not be fully removed, or tumor recurrence, and who were younger than 36 months had the worst outcomes (i.e., shorter survival times). A retrospective survey from 36 AT/RT cases at St. Jude Children's Hospital from 1984 to 2003 showed that the two-year event-free survival (EFS) for children under three was 11%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 17%. For children aged 3 years or older, the EFS was 78% and the OS 89%. A retrospective register at the Cleveland Children's hospital on 42 AT/RT patients found median survival time is 16.25 months and a survival rate around 33%. One-quarter of these cases did not show the mutation in the INI1/hSNF5 gene. The longest-term survivals reported in the literature are: * (a) Hilden and associates reported a child who was still free from disease at 46 months from diagnosis. * (b) Olson and associates reported a child who was disease free at five years from diagnosis based on the IRS III protocol. * (c) In 2003, Hirth reported a patient who had been disease-free over six years. * (d) Zimmerman in 2005 reported 50-to-72 month survival rates on four patients using an IRS III-based protocol. Two of these long-term survivors had been treated after an AT/RT recurrence. * (e) A NYU study (Gardner 2004) has four of 12 longer-term AT/RT survivors; the oldest was alive at 46 months after diagnosis. * (f) Medical University of Vienna, 2013, reported a 16-year survivor, among other long-term survivors Cancer treatments in long-term survivors who are children usually cause a series of negative effects on physical well being, fertility, cognition, and learning. = Metastasis = Metastatic spread is noted in roughly one-third of the AT/RT cases at the time of diagnosis, and tumors can occur anywhere throughout the CNS. The ASCO study of the 188 documented AT/RT cases prior to 2004 found 30% of the cases had metastasis at diagnosis. Metastatic spread to the meninges (leptomenigeal spread sometimes referred to as sugar coating) is common both initially and with relapse. Average survival times decline with the presence of metastasis. Primary CNS tumors generally metastasize only within the CNS. One case of metastatic disease to the abdomen via ventriculoperitoneal shunt has been reported with AT/RT . Metastatic dissemination via this mechanism has been reported with other brain tumors, including germinomas, medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, glioblastomas, ependymomas, and endodermal sinus tumors. Guler and Sugita separately reported cases of lung metastasis without a shunt. Epidemiology An estimated 3% of pediatric brain tumors are AT/RTs, although this percentage may increase with better differentiation between PNET/medulloblastoma tumors and AT/RTs. As with other CNS tumors, more males are affected than females (ratio 1.6:1). The ASCO study showed a 1.4:1 male to female ratio. History Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor was first described as a distinct entity in 1987. Before 1978, when rhabdoid tumor was described, AT/RT likely was misdiagnosed as medulloblastoma. In some early reports the tumor was known also as malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) of the CNS. Between 1978 and 1987, AT/RT was usually misdiagnosed as rhabdoid tumor. However, both AT/RT and non-CNS MRT have a worse prognosis than medulloblastoma and are resistant to the standard treatment protocols for medulloblastoma. By 1995, AT/RT had become regarded as a newly defined aggressive, biologically unique class of primarily brain and spinal tumors, usually affecting infants and young children. In January 2001, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and Office of Rare Diseases hosted a Workshop on Childhood Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors of the Central Nervous System. Twenty-two participants from 14 institutions came together to discuss the biology, treatments, and new strategies for these tumors. The consensus paper on the biology of the tumor was published in Clinical Research. The workshop's recognition that CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) have deletions of the INI1 gene indicates that rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and brain are identical or closely related entities. This observation is not surprising because rhabdoid tumors at both locations possess similar histologic, clinical, and demographic features.  Research directions  Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor is rare, and no therapy has been proven to deliver long-term survival, nor a set of protocols made standard. Thus, most children with AT/RT are enrolled in clinical trials to attempt to find an effective cure. A clinical trial is not a treatment standard; it is research. Some clinical trials compare an experimental treatment to a standard treatment, but only if such a standard treatment exists. Research into stem cell transplant surgeries is ongoing.  Culture  In 2011, The New Yorker published an article by Aleksandar Hemon, about the author's daughter's battle with AT/RT. In August 2011, a 6-year-old named Avalanna Routh who was battling AT/RT at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute was given a pretend wedding with her idol Justin Bieber, with doctors and nurses providing a cardboard life-sized cutout of Bieber, a guitarist, flowers, and a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \\"Future Mrs. Bieber\\". In February 2012, she spent the day in person with Justin Bieber, her pretend husband, after a Facebook campaign to meet her idol. On September 26, 2012, she died after battling AT/RT for five and a half years. The video game That Dragon, Cancer is based on the experiences of Ryan and Amy Green raising their son Joel after he was diagnosed with an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor at 12 months and given only about four months to live. Joel continued to survive for four more years after suffering from seven additional tumors and eventually succumbing to cancer on March 13, 2014. Ryan Green wanted to provide the experiences of raising Joel in the form of a video game to help the player to understand the difficulties and realities with which they had to deal during this time. After Joel's death, the game was reworked to instead act as a tribute to Ryan and Amy's five short years with their third child. The Green family's experiences are also documented in the film Thank You For Playing.

Rotylenchulus reniformis. Nemaplex. Department of Nematology. University of California, Davis. 2012. Taxonomy This nematode has a wide host range, infecting many species of plants around the world. It was first observed on the roots of cowpea in Hawaii, and was described as new species and new genus in 1940.Robinson, A. F., et al. 1997. Rotylenchulus species: identification, distribution, host ranges, and crop plant resistance. Nematropica 27(2), 127-80. Its specific epithet, reniformis, was inspired by the kidney shape of the adult female. There are now ten species classified in the genus, but R. reniformis is the only species of major economic importance to agriculture.  Distribution and host range  R. reniformis has been reported from thousands of localities in the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia.Wang, K. Reniform Nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis Linford and Oliveira (Nematoda: Tylenchida: Tylenchoidea: Hoplolaimidae: Rotylenchulinae). EENY-210 (IN367). Entomology and Nematology. Florida Cooperative Extension Service. University of Florida IFAS. Published 2001, revised 2007. It has a wide host range that includes fruit trees, lentil, cotton, pigeon pea, tea, tobacco, soybean, pineapple, banana, okra, coconut, cabbage, sweet potato, alfalfa, corn, asparagus, palm, cucumber, tomato, squash, cassava, radish, eggplant, guava, melon, and ginger.MacGowan, J. B. The Reniform Nematode. Nematology Circular No. 32. Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 1977. Certain plants are considered to be non-hosts of the nematode, such as little barley, common barnyard grass, pangola grass, peppers, and some cultivars of black mustard, oat, spinach, and sugarcane. Morphology The reniform nematode has esophageal glands overlapping the intestine and a short stylet. The dorsal esophageal gland orifice is located posterior to the stylet knobs.Shurtleff, M. C. and C. W. Averre. Diagnosing Plant Diseases Caused by Nematodes. St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society Press. 2000. The immature female is slender and may be spiral- or C-shaped in death.Dropkin, V. Introduction to Plant Nematology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1980. 293p. It is about 0.3 to 0.5 millimeters long.Reniform Nematode. Sweetpotato DiagNotes. Centre for Biological Information Technology. University of Queensland. The mature female has a swollen, kidney-shaped body with a short tail, a short, thin stylet with rounded stylet knobs, a three-part esophagus, a long and narrow isthmus, and a well-developed metacarpus. The vulva is just behind the middle of the body. The male is vermiform: with a wormlike appearance. It has a weak stylet, curved spicules, and a pointed tail. The esophagus is reduced.  Life cycle  R. reniformis is sedentary semi-endoparasite on the roots of plants. The female penetrates the root and remains in one position at a permanent feeding site with its posterior end projecting from the root. The immature female is the infective agent, attacking the root and growing to maturity at its feeding site.Luc, M., et al. (Eds.) Plant Parasitic Nematodes in Subtropical and Tropical Agriculture. 2nd Edition. CABI Publishing. 2005. pp 38, 39, 709-20. Males and juveniles live in the soil; males are not parasites and do not feed. Under drought conditions the nematode can persist up to two years outside a host by entering an anhydrobiotic state. The life cycle is 17 to 29 days long. The juvenile molts once while still inside the egg.Lawrence, G. W. and K. S. Reniform Nematodes. In: Kirkpatrick, T. L. and C. S. Rothrock. (Eds.) Compendium of Cotton Diseases. 2nd edition. St. Paul, Minnesota: The American Phytopathological Society Press. 2001. pp. 42–44. The eggs hatch in 8 to 10 days. The juvenile molts three times to reach the immature stage. The immature female parasitizes the root for one to two weeks. During this time the male deposits sperm, which the female stores until her gonads mature. The nematode can also reproduce via parthenogenesis, without fertilization. Upon maturity the female exits the root and lays up to 200 eggs in a gelatinous matrix. Host-parasite relationship When the immature female penetrates the root, a feeding tube forms from stylet secretions. Nematode infestation can cause symptoms in the plant that resemble those of moisture and nutrient deficiencies. It causes hypertrophy in the pericycle cells of seedling roots and in the periderm cells of the roots of older plants.Oteifa, B. A. (1970). The reniform nematode problem of Egyptian cotton production. Journal of Parasitology 56, 255. Root growth slows and secondary root development is limited. Root necrosis has been observed in pineapple and banana. Shoot growth suppression and reduction of fruit quality has been observed in crops such as pineapple. Infested plants can become stunted and chlorotic. Wilt disease can follow when opportunistic fungi such as Fusarium and Verticillium infect the plants, a process observed in cotton. Secondary fungal infection can also cause root decay. Damage from R. reniformis is directly related to the number of nematodes present when the crop is planted. Variation among nematode populations, hosts, environmental conditions, and soil types may alter the threshold or economic injury level across the geographic distribution of the nematode.  Management  Some plants are resistant to this nematode. In susceptible taxa, chemical control is one of the most common management practices. Nematicides before and after planting can be effective. Intercropping and crop rotation, especially with resistant or non-host plants, is used as cultural control to improve soil, increase antagonistic microorganisms, and reduce nematode populations. French marigold (Tagetes patula) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) are recommended for these uses. The fungus Purpureocillium lilacinum has been used as an agent of biological pest control against the nematode in chickpea.Ashraf, M. S. and T. A. Khan. (2008). Biomanagement of reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis by fruit wastes and Paecilomyces lilacinus on chickpea. World Journal of Agricultural Sciences 4(4), 492-94.

Life  Lipsius was born as daughter of the later director of the Leipzig Thomasschule Karl Heinrich Adelbert Lipsius and grew up at Leipzig where she was given a profound musical training, thus by the Saxon composer Richard Müller. Her three brothers were the theologian Richard Adelbert Lipsius, the architect Constantin Lipsius and the classical scholar Justus Hermann Lipsius. In 1856, at nineteen, she met Franz Liszt at a concert to whose closer friends she should belong from henceforth. During the ending 19th and starting 20th century, she played an influent role in the German music business, especially at the grand-ducal Weimarian court and in the Richard Wagner circle at Bayreuth. An intimate friend to Liszt's long-time life partner, the princess Carolyne zu Sayn- Wittgenstein, she was distinguished with the title of professor in honor of her eightieth birthday in 1917.  Work  La Mara's signature Besides several early written travel sketches, under her alias \\"La Mara\\", Marie published a lot of musician biographies, concerning dead as well as contemporaries of hers, which, beginning from 1867, first were printed in the Westermanns Monatshefte before being edited in the then popular series Musikalische Studienköpfe (Musical study portraits) by the house Breitkopf & Härtel. Her well-nuanced, empathetically written portraits often were inspired by her personal acquaintance to many of whom she described and also may be characterized as authentic testimonies of a female contemporary involved in the German music society of her epoch – a character in which their importance for today music history mostly consists. Marie Lipsius was the first musicologist to conduct systematic research to identify Beethoven's mysterious \\"Immortal Beloved\\": In 1909, she published Therese Brunsvik's Memoirs, and she interpreted her glowing admiration of the composer as a secret love. This was revised after the World War I, when letters and other documents were discovered in the Brunsvik estate, which pointed to Therese's sister Josephine Brunsvik.\\"Es drängte sich mir die Überzeugung auf, daß ... Josephine verwitwete Gräfin Deym die 'unsterbliche Geliebte' Beethovens ... sei.\\" [I became convinced that Josephine, widowed Countess Deym, was Beethoven's \\"Immortal Beloved\\".](La Mara 1920, p. 1.) A part from her original writings, Marie also took care of an edition of the correspondence of Franz Liszt. In 1917, her autobiography was published.

He played for the St. Michael's College School Monarchs as a 155-pound, fast-skating left winger, in 1951. He worked out with Toronto for the first time in February 1949, along with Tim Horton. The two college players were allowed to play in the NHL but not in the Ontario Hockey Association, because of a strange rule. The OHA refused to permit Hannigan and Horton to play for the Toronto Marlboros, a Maple Leafs affiliate. Leafs' President Conn Smythe did not like the ruling but granted the junior players a trial after four of his team's forwards were injured. In October 1953 Hannigan sustained a rib injury in practice and was out of the Maple Leafs lineup for three weeks. He was purchased by Edmonton from Toronto in October 1957. He played the previous season for the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League. Hannigan's first game for the Flyers was against the Saskatoon/St. Paul Regals. He replaced Johnny Utendale, a rookie who had a sprained ankle. Jack Perrin, President of the Winnipeg Warriors (1955–1961), made overtures to buy Hannigan from the Maple Leafs in September 1957. However, Hannigan told him that he would only consider an offer from Edmonton, if he could not play for Toronto. His younger brother, Pat Hannigan, played for Winnipeg in (1956–1957), the New Westminster Royals (1957–1959), the Maple Leafs (1959–1960) and the New York Rangers (1960–1962). Gord is also the brother of Ray Hannigan. Gord Hannigan was a partner in a successful Edmonton ice cream business at the time of his acquisition by the Flyers. He also had other interests in the Alberta city. He married Ann Mary Conboy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in August 1953.

During his lifetime, he rose to the junior third rank in the Imperial court, and held the titular office of Gon-Chūnagon (acting middle councilor). He was posthumously awarded the junior second rank and the office of Gon-Dainagon (acting great councilor). Among his brothers were Tokugawa Yoshimichi and Tokugawa Tsugutomo (the fourth and sixth lords of Owari), and Matsudaira Yoshitaka (second lord of the Mino Takasu Domain). A sister, Matsuhime, married Maeda Yoshinori, lord of the Kaga Domain, which was the richest domain in Japan outside the Tokugawa's own holdings. Muneharu did not marry, but had numerous concubines. His fourth daughter married the kampaku Konoe Uchisaki. = Loss of power = Given to personal luxury, in 1731, Muneharu published a book, Onchiseiyō (温知政要), which criticized ruling shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune for his policy of excessive frugality. In 1739, following a long dispute with Yoshimune, Muneharu was forced into retirement and confined within the grounds of Nagoya Castle. A relative succeeded him as lord of Owari, taking the name Tokugawa Munekatsu. After the death of Yoshimune, Muneharu moved outside the palace grounds. He died in 1764, but was not forgiven, and a metal net was placed over his grave to indicate his status. When a later shōgun installed his own son as lord of Owari, 75 years after the death of Muneharu, he had the net removed as a gesture of pardon.

Description The Levaillant's cisticola is a small, 12–15 cm long, dull-coloured bird with a longish tail and a reddish cap. The upperparts of the breeding adult are grey, heavily streaked with black, and with a rufous panel in the folded wing The supercilium, face and underparts are buffy white and the tail is russet brown. The short straight bill is blackish-brown with a pinkish base, and the feet and legs are pinkish-brown. The eye is light brown. Non-breeding adults are browner-backed, and juvenile birds have yellower underparts. The calls include a musical ', a wailing ' and harsh alarm notes. Distribution and habitat Singing from a fence in marshland, South Africa The cisticola is a resident breeder in eastern Africa from Kenya to eastern South Africa. It is common in reedbeds, sedges, rank grass, and similar wet habitats usually near rivers or dams. Behaviour Levaillant's cisticola is usually seen in pairs, singly, or in small family parties. Flitting through the grass as it forages for small insects. It is vocal and conspicuous, perching on the top of tall grass stems and reeds and making its alarm call. =Breeding= The cisticola builds a ball-shaped nest with a side entrance from dry grass, cobwebs and felted plant down. It is usually placed in a tuft of grass or weeds, which are standing in, or hanging over water. Nesting occurs from August to October. Conservation status This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 1,400,000 km². The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern.

The vehicles were distributed among infantry and cavalry divisions for use as support weapons. The Belgian Army viewed their combat vehicles as defensive weapons. The practice of spreading out combat vehicles in so called \\"penny packets\\" (also used in the French Army at the same time) left them at a disadvantage against the German invaders, who concentrated their armour into organic units that could act on their own and that outnumbered the opposing vehicles even if units of the same type met. The Belgian Army had started to motorised its cavalry in 1936, spending 200 million Belgian Francs in the process. Tanks =T15 light tank= Leopold III in 1940 The T15 was a version of the British Carden Loyd tankette (Char Léger de Reconnaissance Vickers-Carden-Loyd Mod.1934 T.15). They had a two-man crew and were armed with a French 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun in the turret. A total of 42 of these tanks were assigned to Belgian units. =T13 (tank destroyer, models B1, B2 and B3)= Two German soldiers looking at a captured T13 B3 The T13 series was similar to the T15, with a main armament of a 47 mm anti-tank gun instead of a machine gun and of armour. They were regarded as tank destroyers and except the first model (B1) had rotating turrets. Total production for the T13: * T13 B1, 35 produced as self-propelled guns, with a 47 mm gun at the rear behind a shield, with limited traverse. * T13 B2, 21 produced. These started their life as unarmed Carden Loyd tankettes which were modified and equipped with a turret with a 47 mm gun in 1936. * T13 B3, 150 produced, entered service in 1937 with a rotating turret and a revised suspension based on the Vickers Light Dragon Mark IIB. The Wehrmacht operated some captured T13s during the first years of the war, as the T13 had a more powerful main gun than the Panzer I and Panzer II, common German tanks in the early war years. There is a T13 B2 on display at Brussels Tank Museum. =ACG-1 tank= Knocked-out ACG1 The Renault AMC 35 tank, known locally as the ACG-1, was armed with a 47 mm gun and a coaxial machine gun; 25 tanks were ordered, although only 10 were accepted into the Belgian army due to production delays. The Belgian ACG-1 and the AMC 35 had different turrets. Instead of waiting for the other tanks to arrive the Belgian army created the T-13 B3, also armed with a 47 mm C.47 gun. A squadron of ACG-1 was mobilised in 1939 but only 8 could be made operational of those in storage. The 47 mm main gun in the ACG1 was the same anti-tank gun then in service with the Belgian Army. =Renault FT tank= Renault FT at the Brussels Royal Army Museum The Belgian army had 75 Renault FT tanks (of World War I vintage) at the start of World War II. The Belgian Army had two types of FT tanks, the Char canon armed with a short 37 mm Puteaux SA-18 gun and the Char mitrailleuse armed with a machine gun. Unlike the French Army, the Belgian Army had withdrawn all FT tanks from front line service before World War II. They remained in storage depots during the 1940 campaign. Post-1944 After the Belgian liberation in late 1944, the Belgian army used American and British equipment until the end of the war.

It was commissioned by the Ditson Fund of Columbia University for Martha Graham and was premiered on 10 May 1946, at Columbia University's McMillin Theater, New York City. It was originally called Serpent Heart, but the work was revised in 1947 and retitled Cave of the Heart. Costumes were designed by Edythe Gilfond and the set was created by Isamu Noguchi. The original cast list included Graham, Erick Hawkins, Yuriko, May O'Donnell, and other members of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Neither Barber nor Graham desired to use the legend literally in the ballet. Instead, these mythical figures served rather to project psychological states of jealousy and vengeance which are timeless. The choreography and music were conceived, as it were, on two time levels, the ancient mythical and the contemporary. Medea and Jason first appear as godlike, super-human figures of the Greek tragedy. As the tension and conflict between them increases, they step out of their legendary roles from time to time and become the modern man and woman, caught in the nets of jealousy and destructive love; and at the end resume their mythical quality. In both the dancing and music, archaic and contemporary idioms are used. Medea, in her final scene after the denouement, becomes once more the descendant of the sun. Beside Medea and Jason there are two other characters in the ballet, the Young Princess whom Jason marries out of ambition and for whom he betrays Medea, and an attendant who assumes the part of the onlooking chorus of the Greek tragedy, sympathizing, consoling and interpreting the actions of the major characters.  Medea Suite for Orchestra, Op. 23 (1947)  Early in 1947 Barber extracted from the ballet a seven-movement suite for full orchestra. Graham used the titles Serpent Heart and Cave of the Heart for her ballet, but the composer preferred to use the original source of the idea, the Medea-Jason legend, as the title for his suite. Movements: # Parodos # Choros. Medea and Jason # The Young Princess. Jason # Choros #Medea #Kantikos Agonias #Exodos The Suite was first performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy on 5 December 1947.Heyman, Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music, 1999, p. 268.

Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of flooding (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to glaciers in their accumulation zone.

Stroffolino attended Albright College, Temple University and Bard College, The University of Massachusetts Amherst, before receiving a PhD at Suny-Albany with a dissertation on William Shakespeare in 1998. Poetry =Early performance poetry= After moving to Philadelphia in 1986, Stroffolino auditioned for Lamont Steptoe of the Painted Bride Art Center, and became a part of Philadelphia's spoken word scene, alongside writers such as C.A. Conrad, Linh Dinh, Candace Kaucher and Jerome Robinson. Stroffolino's first book of poems, Incidents (At The Corner of Desire & Disgust) was published by David Roskos's Vendatta Books (Iniquity Press) in 1990. Stroffolino co-edited The Painted Bride Quarterly from 1988–1990, worked on the local anarchist zine, Talk Is Cheap, and co-founded the underground punk warehouse, KillTime Place in 1989 while organizing reading series at The Schmidt-Dean Gallery and Borders Books. Stroffolino's next book, \\"Oops\\" (published by Boulder Colorado's backyard press in 1991, republished by Pavement Saw Press in 1994) consisted of poems published in magazines but seldom performed at readings, and reached a wider audience across the country. =New York years= In the early 90s, Stroffolino left Philadelphia to attend the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and SUNY-Albany, receiving a PhD in 1998 with a dissertation on Shakespeare's middle-comedies. In the meantime, he published Cusps (Edge Books, 1995), Light As A Fetter (1997) and Stealer's Wheel (1999), performing his work from the Lollapalooza tour alongside Jeffrey McDaniel and David Baratier to SUNY-Buffalo's New Coast Conference. Stealer's Wheel was praised by John Ashbery and James Tate, and Graham Foust wrote that \\"there's more of what's great in Ashbery and Tate in [Stealer's Wheel] than there is in most Ashbery and Tate.\\" Stroffolino's early mentor was John Yau. In the 21st century, Stroffolino published Scratch Vocals (2002), Speculative Primitive (2004), and An Anti-Emeryvillification Manifesto (2007).

With the band Volumen he contributing to the soundtrack of Esther Bell's Goddass. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, he returned to the style of his first book with his controversial piece, \\"You Haven't Done Nuthin'\\", a rant-like poem often performed backed by a loud improvising rock band. In 2005, he toured the United States and Canada with Continuous Peasant and rejoined Silver Jews on stage in 2006 and 2008. Stroffolino's one-off topical songs have appeared in Raw Story and The Thom Hartmann Show. In 2010, Stroffolino released his first solo album, Single- Sided Doubles, on Pop Snob Records, as a vinyl/CD hybrid. In 2013, his piano playing and singing caught the attention of American film director and screenwriter Jeff Feuerzeig, who began videotaping Stroffolino on the piano during \\"street sessions\\" while Stroffolino performed out of a van that he lives in. Feuerzeig also decided to make an \\"instant record\\" of Stroffolino performing, resulting in a 12-track album, The Piano Van Sessions. Feuerzeig's agent has heard Stroffolino's record and story, and began representing him. Cultural and literary criticism After co-editing, with Lisa Jarnot and Leonard Schwartz, An Anthology of New (American) Poets for Talisman House in 1998, Stroffolino published a critical edition of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with Daniel Rosenthal (2000); the next year saw a collection of literary criticism entitled Spin Cycle. Critic Charles Altieri admired the populism of Spin Cycle's essay \\"Radical Dogberry\\" essay, while the American Book Review praised this collection for holding out an olive branch between the various warring factions in the literary world, especially in the essay \\"Against Lineage\\" essay, adding \\"but sometimes that branch seems to be on fire\\". More recently, Stroffolino has published music and culture criticism in The Big Takeover, Kitchen Sink, Viz, and Caught in the Carousel. In 2011, Self Portrait As Silver Jew was released as an e-book (45RPM). A recipient of a 2001 NYFA Grant, and a 2008 grant from the Fund For Poetry, Stroffolino was Visiting Distinguished Poet at St Mary's College in Moraga, California from 2001 to 2005. He is the subject of a Contemporary Authors monograph. Although Stroffolino has curtailed activities after a bike accident left him permanently disabled in 2004, he has done stints at Mills College, San Francisco Art Institute, University of California, Berkeley and Laney College.

It occupies the second floor of the Cloth Hall (Lakenhalle) on the market square in the city centre. The building was largely destroyed by artillery during the war, but was afterwards reconstructed. In 1998 the original Ypres Salient Memorial Museum was refurbished and renamed In Flanders Fields Museum after the famous poem by Canadian John McCrae. Following a period of closure, the museum reopened on 11 June 2012. The curator, Piet Chielens, is a World War I historian. The museum does not set out to glorify war, but to suggest its futility, particularly as seen in the West Flanders front region in World War I. Programming Cloth Hall, Ypres Banner outside the museum. A range of activities are available, including walking itineraries and workshops. On entry to the museum each visitor receives a \\"Poppy Bracelet\\" containing a microchip, which activates the chosen language for the visitor. It also activates the personal story of four individuals as the visitor makes his or her way around the exhibitions. The exhibit tells the story of the invasion of Belgium, the first months of the mobilisation, the four years trench war in the Westhoek (from the beach of Nieuwpoort to the Leie in Armentieres), the end of the war, and the permanent remembrance ever since. The Bell Tower (Belfry) at the Cloth Hall, offers a view over the city, Saint George's Memorial Church, St Martin's Cathedral, the market place, the surrounding battlefields, and the Menin Gate. The museum presents a general introduction to World War I in Flanders with reference to other Allied museums and sites, such as Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62, Museum Godshuis Belle, and Canadian Hill 62 Memorial; whereas the Lange Max Museum focuses on the occupied German side. The museum is intended to encourage the visitor to view the actual sites for themselves. The personal stories of how the First World War affected the lives of individuals of many nationalities are told through the many objects on display, interactive installations and lifelike characters within the larger picture of the Great War. The displays include medical equipment, gas masks, and a mule and munitions wagon exhibit. Themes of the consequences of war, how we look into our past, and how and why we remember are explored. Museum shop The museum shop sells First World War related books and guides, maps, postcards, CDs and gift items. Research The museum includes a new World War I research centre. The Names List Project is a project to compile a list of all those who died in the Westhoek region as a result of the First World War.Belgian Red Cross References * Tobias Arand: Zwischen Emotion und Distanz – Zwei museale Wege der Annäherung an den Ersten Welt-krieg.

Mordecai was the son of Moses and Esther Mordecai, observant Jews who in 1760 emigrated from Germany to Philadelphia. He attended private schools, receiving a classical education. At age 13, Mordecai served as a rifleman when the Continental Congress was resident in Philadelphia and later helped supply the Continental Army as a clerk to David Franks, the Jewish quartermaster to General George Washington. After the war, Mordecai moved to New York City and married Judith Myers. In 1792, Judith and Jacob moved to Warrenton, North Carolina, a small town well situated on the roads linking Richmond, Charleston and Savannah. It is worth noting that despite the fact that the Mordecais were the only Jewish family in and around this small town, they remained observant Jews, keeping a strictly kosher home where Shabbos was observed. His wife, Judith, was a woman of delicate constitution who died at the time of the birth of her seventh child. Subsequently, Mordecai married Rebecca Myers, the younger half-sister of his first wife. Mordecai first made his mark as a tobacco merchant in Warrenton. He was not, however, particularly interested in his business pursuits. He managed to obtain an excellent knowledge of Hebrew language and literature and studiously devoted himself to literary pursuits, especially biblical research, and wrote many scholarly articles. Reversal of fortune made it necessary for him to give up his business, leaving him with the dilemma of how to support his large family. In the summer of 1808, some of the locals met with Jacob and offered to help support the establishment of an “academy” for girls, on the condition that he would become its headmaster. The influential town leaders regarded him highly for his learning and wisdom and were sure that he had the skills and temperament to be an effective teacher. In 1809, the school opened with 30 students and quickly became a family project. In the beginning, Jacob and Rebecca taught all the classes. Soon they were joined in the classroom by their daughter Rachael and in later years by two of their sons. The younger Mordecai children helped with the cooking and care of the dormitories. The only instructor in the academy who was not a member of the family was the music teacher. The school’s curriculum was not limited to academics; it also stressed proper manners and demeanor. Students were subject to considerable personal discipline and a highly structured day. High standards of behavior and performance were the norm for both students and faculty. The goal was to properly mold both the character and intellectual development of the students. The girls were required to wash their own utensils and maintain a high level of personal hygiene. Since the overwhelming majority of girls who attended the academy came from well-to-do homes in which they were pampered, some of them must have had trouble adjusting to the school’s regimen. Mordecai made sure that students attended the church of their choice. He was careful to avoid all doctrinal and sectarian discussions in school activities. At the same time he provided opportunities for all of his students to discuss philosophical and ethical issues. Mordecai stressed that piety in any religious tradition was an important part of character development. The Mordecais included the observance of Jewish holidays in the academy’s educational program. Since all of the Mordecai children, male and female, attended and/or worked in the school, as well as several cousins, there was a critical mass of Jewish students to observe holidays. Mordecai encouraged the Christian students at the academy to observe their own religious holidays. To him it mattered little what religious practices his students observed, just so long as they were respectful of the religious preferences of others. There were discussions of philosophical texts that raised moral and ethical issues that all students could deal with regardless of their religious differences. Given the above it is no wonder that within a few years the academy’s excellent reputation had spread so quickly that by 1814 Mordecai was forced to cap enrollment at 110 students. In 1819, at age 56, ten years after opening his Female Academy, Jacob Mordecai chose to sell the highly successful enterprise and move his family to Richmond, Virginia. He purchased a farm and lived as an active member of Richmond’s Jewish community, serving as president of its Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome.

It is a Purple Heart national registry of military personnel that have been injured or killed during combat. In 1782, at his headquarters, George Washington created the Badge of Military Merit to be given to enlisted men and non-commissioned officers for meritorious action. The museum is located at the New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site, the last encampment of the Continental Army. Establishment of museum On May 12, 1995, an article appeared in the Newburgh, N.Y., Sentinel newspaper about the intent to build a Purple Heart museum in Enfield, CT. The article prompted Cornwall, N.Y. resident Patric Morrison to write a letter-to-the-editor, explaining why the museum should be located in the Newburgh area. Morrison contended that events at historic Washington's Headquarters/New Windsor Cantonment justified development of a Purple Heart facility at that site. Everett Smith, Publisher of the Sentinel newspaper, agreed and became an advocate for the project. On August 7, 1782 while at his Newburgh headquarters, Gen. George Washington created the Badge of Military Merit. This award was to recognize \\"singularly meritorious action\\" by enlisted soldiers, marking the first time that soldiers below the rank of officer were so honored. Sergeant Elijah Churchill of the 2nd Continental Dragoons, Sergeant William Brown of the 5th Connecticut Continental Line Infantry, and Sergeant Daniel Bissel of the 2nd Connecticut Line Infantry were summoned to Washington's Headquarters in the spring of 1783 to be awarded the Badge. After the Revolutionary War, the Badge fell into disuse until 1932 when it was revived, redesigned, and renamed the Purple Heart by Gen. Douglas MacArthur to honor the memory of George Washington on his 200th birthday. On May 28th 1932, one-hundred-thirty-seven World War I Army veterans who had served meritoriously received the first Purple Hearts at the New Windsor Cantonment, the final encampment of the Continental Army. In 1942, by Executive Order, President Franklin Roosevelt expanded award of the Purple Heart to include all branches of military service, and approved posthumous award for any military service member killed in combat on or after December 6, 1941. The Purple Heart now honors any member of U. S. military forces wounded, killed, or who died of wounds will serving under competent military authority in any capacity, retroactive to April 5, 1917. Mr. Morrison's letter, and the Sentinel newspaper article, caused the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC) to pursue development of an appropriate facility at New Windsor Cantonment to commemorate the history of the Purple Heart and to recognize all recipients. The name, Purple Heart Hall of Honor, was chosen. The Commission's Deputy Director, Kenneth Krieser, who had been awarded a Purple Heart as a result of combat duty in Vietnam, presented the PIPC plan at an annual conference of the Military Order of the Purple Heart in Norfolk, VA, winning support of its members and affirming that the name would become the \\"National\\" Purple Heart Hall of Honor. Sentinel newspaper Publisher Everett Smith, Lt. Gen. James D. Hughes, USAF (ret.), New York State Senator William Larkin, and Veterans advocate Joseph Farina formed The Genesis Group in support of developing the Hall of Honor. Together, they worked for eleven years to help achieve this worthy goal. On May 24, 2002, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton (New York) announced that she had introduced a resolution (S. Con. Res. 113) to support efforts to create a National Purple Heart Hall of Honor. New York State committed $4.1 million toward the planning, design, and construction of the Hall of Honor. Other financial support included $500,000 from the Military Order of the Purple Heart, $402,000 in federal HUD/VA funds, and many donations from veterans and their families. The Hall of Honor was dedicated by NY Governor George Pataki on November 10, 2006. Subsequently, additional funds have been provided to improve and expand the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, including $17 million authorized in 2019 by NY Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mission The mission of the Hall of Honor is to collect and preserve the stories of Purple Heart recipients from all branches of service and across generations in an attempt to ensure that all recipients are represented. Their stories are preserved and shared through a series of exhibits, live and videotaped interviews with veterans themselves, and the Roll of Honor, an interactive computer program detailing the stories of each individual.

It is used in diagnosing the source of hypoxemia. The A–a gradient helps to assess the integrity of the alveolar capillary unit. For example, in high altitude, the arterial oxygen PaO2 is low but only because the alveolar oxygen (PAO2) is also low. However, in states of ventilation perfusion mismatch, such as pulmonary embolism or right-to-left shunt, oxygen is not effectively transferred from the alveoli to the blood which results in an elevated A-a gradient. In a perfect system, no A-a gradient would exist: oxygen would diffuse and equalize across the capillary membrane, and the pressures in the arterial system and alveoli would be equal (resulting in an A-a gradient of zero).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ However even though the partial pressure of oxygen is about equilibrated between the pulmonary capillaries and the alveolar gas, this equilibrium is not maintained as blood travels further through pulmonary circulation. As a rule, PAO2 is always higher than PaO2 by at least 5–10 mmHg, even in a healthy person with normal ventilation and perfusion. This gradient exists due to both physiological right-to-left shunting and a physiological V/Q mismatch caused by gravity- dependent differences in perfusion to various zones of the lungs. The bronchial vessels deliver nutrients and oxygen to certain lung tissues, and some of this spent, deoxygenated venous blood drains into the highly oxygenated pulmonary veins, causing a right-to-left shunt. Further, the effects of gravity alter the flow of both blood and air through various heights of the lung. In the upright lung, both perfusion and ventilation are greatest at the base, but the gradient of perfusion is steeper than that of ventilation so V/Q ratio is higher at the apex than at the base. This means that blood flowing through capillaries at the base of the lung is not fully oxygenated.Pulmonary Physiology. In: Kibble JD, Halsey CR. eds. Medical Physiology: The Big Picture New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2014.  Equation  The equation for calculating the A–a gradient is: :\\\\text{A–a Gradient}=P_A\\\\ce{O2}-P_a\\\\ce{O2} Where: * PAO2 = alveolar PO2 (calculated from the alveolar gas equation) ::P_A\\\\ce{O2}=F_i\\\\ce{O2}(P_\\\\ce{atm}-P_\\\\ce{H2O})-\\\\frac{P_a\\\\ce{CO2}}{0.8} * PaO2 = arterial PO2 (measured in arterial blood) In its expanded form, the A–a gradient can be calculated by: :\\\\text{A–a Gradient}=\\\\left(F_i\\\\ce{O2}(P_\\\\text{atm}-P_\\\\ce{H2O})-\\\\frac{P_a\\\\ce{CO2}}{0.8}\\\\right)-P_a\\\\ce{O2} On room air ( FiO2 = 0.21, or 21% ), at sea level ( Patm = 760 mmHg ) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli (PH2O = 47 mmHg), a simplified version of the equation is: :\\\\text{A–a Gradient}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\left(150\\\\text{ mm}\\\\ce{Hg}-\\\\frac{5}{4}(P_a\\\\ce{CO2})\\\\right)-P_a\\\\ce{O2}\\\\quad\\\\text{or}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(20\\\\text{ kPa}-\\\\frac{5}{4}(P_a\\\\ce{CO2})\\\\right)-P_a\\\\ce{O2} \\\\end{cases}  Values and Clinical Significance  The A–a gradient is useful in determining the source of hypoxemia. The measurement helps isolate the location of the problem as either intrapulmonary (within the lungs) or extrapulmonary (elsewhere in the body). A normal A–a gradient for a young adult non-smoker breathing air, is between 5–10 mmHg. Normally, the A–a gradient increases with age. For every decade a person has lived, their A–a gradient is expected to increase by 1 mmHg. A conservative estimate of normal A–a gradient is [age in years + 10]/ 4. Thus, a 40-year-old should have an A–a gradient around 12.5 mmHg.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ The value calculated for a patient's A-a gradient can assess if their hypoxia is due to the dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary unit, for which it will elevate, or due to another reason, in which the A-a gradient will be at or lower than the calculated value using the above equation. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ An abnormally increased A–a gradient suggests a defect in diffusion, V/Q mismatch, or right-to-left shunt. The A-a gradient has clinical utility in patients with hypoxemia of undetermined etiology. The A-a gradient can be broken down categorically as either elevated or normal. Causes of hypoxemia will fall into either category. To better understand which etiologies of hypoxemia falls in either category, we can use a simple analogy. Think of the oxygen's journey through the body like a river. The respiratory system will serve as the first part of the river. Then imagine a waterfall from that point leading to the second part of the river. The waterfall represents the alveolar and capillary walls, and the second part of the river represents the arterial system. The river empties into a lake, which can represent end-organ perfusion. The A-a gradient helps to determine where there is flow obstruction. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ For example, consider hypoventilation. Patients can exhibit hypoventilation for a variety of reasons; some include CNS depression, neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis, poor chest elasticity as seen in kyphoscoliosis or patients with vertebral fractures, and many others. Patients with poor ventilation lack oxygen tension throughout their arterial system in addition to the respiratory system. Thus, the river will have decreased flow throughout both parts. Since both the \\"A\\" and the \\"a\\" decrease in concert, the gradient between the two will remain in normal limits (even though both values will decrease). Thus patients with hypoxemia due to hypoventilation will have an A-a gradient within normal limits. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ Now let us consider pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia have a physical barrier within the alveoli, which limits the diffusion of oxygen into the capillaries. However, these patients can ventilate (unlike the patient with hypoventilation), which will result in a well-oxygenated respiratory tract (A) with poor diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar-capillary unit and thus lower oxygen levels in the arterial blood (a). The obstruction, in this case, would occur at the waterfall in our example, limiting the flow of water only through the second part of the river. Thus patients with hypoxemia due to pneumonia will have an inappropriately elevated A-a gradient (due to normal \\"A\\" and low \\"a\\"). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ Applying this analogy to different causes of hypoxemia should help reason out whether to expect an elevated or normal A-a gradient. As a general rule of thumb, any pathology of the alveolar-capillary unit will result in a high A-a gradient. The table below has the different disease states that cause hypoxemia. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/ Because A–a gradient is approximated as: (150 − 5/4(PCO2)) – PaO2 at sea level and on room air (0.21x(760-47) = 149.7 mmHg for the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, after accounting for the water vapor), the direct mathematical cause of a large value is that the blood has a low PaO2, a low PaCO2, or both. CO2 is very easily exchanged in the lungs and low PaCO2 directly correlates with high minute ventilation; therefore a low arterial PaCO2 indicates that extra respiratory effort is being used to oxygenate the blood. A low PaO2 indicates that the patient's current minute ventilation (whether high or normal) is not enough to allow adequate oxygen diffusion into the blood. Therefore, the A–a gradient essentially demonstrates a high respiratory effort (low arterial PaCO2) relative to the achieved level of oxygenation (arterial PaO2). A high A–a gradient could indicate a patient breathing hard to achieve normal oxygenation, a patient breathing normally and attaining low oxygenation, or a patient breathing hard and still failing to achieve normal oxygenation. If lack of oxygenation is proportional to low respiratory effort, then the A–a gradient is not increased; a healthy person who hypoventilates would have hypoxia, but a normal A–a gradient. At an extreme, high CO2 levels from hypoventilation can mask an existing high A–a gradient. This mathematical artifact makes A–a gradient more clinically useful in the setting of hyperventilation.

She became a famous example of existential analysis who died by suicide at age 33 by poisoning herself. Life Ellen West was born to a Jewish family in 1888. When Ellen was 10 years old, she and her family immigrated to Europe. As a young woman, she was stubborn, disobedient, intelligent, and obsessive compulsive. But while in school, she proved to be an ambitious and passionate student. She also enjoyed reading and writing poetry.The Enigma Ellen West (2010). McGill University. http://www.slideshare.net/PhiloShrink/the-enigma-ellen-west-mcgill- university-151210 As a young adult, Ellen had fluctuations with her weight and that was when her fear of becoming fat began. In her writings, she expressed her strong cravings for food, yet she had an extreme fear of gaining weight. These thoughts eventually led to the development of depression. In order to stay thin, Ellen started to take laxatives; sometimes taking as many as sixty to seventy packs a day.Dr. C. George Boeree. Ludwig Binswanger (2006) http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/binswanger.html Ellen was given permission to marry her cousin at the age of 28. She became obsessed with wanting a child; however, she would not adjust her poor eating habits, which resulted in a miscarriage. Ellen decided to discontinue her use of laxatives in order to get pregnant, but her fears of weight gain overpowered her and she began using them again. She became so frail and unhealthy that she no longer menstruated. When Ellen turned 30, she decided to become a vegetarian in hopes to maintain her thin figure. It wasn't until after three years of marriage, when Ellen was 31 years old and weighing 92 pounds, that she informed her husband of her severe eating disorder and depression. Death Ellen West’s life was marred by thoughts related to death anxiety. Towards the end of her life, it could be said that she had a death obsession. West was given a great variety of diagnoses including melancholia, severe obsessive neurosis, and schizophrenia. While her major problem dealt with food, as what started out as a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa morphed into bulimia nervosa with the fear of becoming fat through eating. This fixation caused her great depression, as her focus day in and out was on eating or not eating. This \\"obsession with death\\" became \\"life's only goal\\" and that the \\"symbolization of life and death took place around the act of eating.\\" West’s fear of becoming fat caused her to welcome death as an acceptable outcome, as then she wouldn’t have to worry anymore. She was often quoted by her psychiatrist, Ludwig Binswanger, explaining how her life felt like a prison that could be only made better by dying. To West, her life felt empty and dull, and filling her body with food only made her feel worse. Filling herself with food actually made her feel empty. It was even suggested that suicide by starvation became her life’s purpose, whereas continuing to feed herself would be equal to committing murder on someone.Jackson, C., Davidson, G., Russell, J., & Vandereycken, W. (1990). Ellen West Revisited: The Theme of Death in Eating Disorders. International Journal of Eating Disorders, 9(5), 529-536. This underlying issue of death obsession can be exemplified by other harmful behaviors that she engaged in. West reportedly did several dangerous things to invite illness and death, including riding horse dangerously, kissing children with scarlet fever, and standing outside naked after bathing. Her eventual death came after taking a lethal dose of poison. West’s psychiatrist Binswanger was quoted as saying, “She looked as she had never looked in life - calm and happy and peaceful.” He thought of her illness as a defense against anxieties which were heightened and overbalanced, but anxieties nonetheless. Existential psychology and humanistic psychology Ludwig Binswanger first diagnosed Ellen West using existential analysis. Using this school of thought showed that Ellen suffered from bulimia nervosa and dreaded gaining weight.Garner, D. M., & Garfinkel, P. E. (1997). Handbook of treatment for eating disorders (ed.). New York: The Guilford Press. . Existential analysis suggested that it is necessary to understand people in a deeper, more philosophical way rather than a strictly scientific way. The psychologist Rollo May exemplified this notion when he said that “Man is the being who can be conscious of, and therefore responsible for, his existence.” May, Rollo., Angel, Ernst., & Ellenberger, H. F. (1958). Existence: A new dimension in psychiatry and psychology. New York: Basic Books. . In the arena of existential psychology, Binswanger concluded that her bulimia was the expression of an existential vacuum to fill up her needs. Binswanger thought that the initial diagnosis of manic-depressive psychosis was wrong because of a lack of manic phases. Also, her symptoms could be explained as normal rather than pathological, and Ellen West could be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Finally, in the view of therapeutic nihilism, Binswanger let her leave the Kreuzlingen clinic, and she later died because of drug overdose. Carl Rogers, humanistic psychologist, felt upset that Ellen West was regarded as an object and suggested that she would be better if treated with client-centered therapy.Rogers, C. (1980). A Way of Being. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. . Rogers also thought that her history was not pathological and she was an active girl. After breaking off her engagement because of disagreement with her parents, Ellen West experienced the estrangement of man from herself. It led her to lose a sense of belief about her experiences. To fit herself to other people’s opinion, she lost weight and developed a dread of gaining weight. Binswanger diagnosed her with schizophrenia and he was pessimistic about her condition, fearing she would die by suicide after leaving the clinic; Rogers thought that this kind of thought made Ellen think herself disordered. Rogers suggested that if she opened her mind to her own experiences and accepted them, she could communicate with herself and it would lead her to developing better relationships with others. In popular culture Ellen West's life influenced poet Frank Bidart to write a Persona poem entitled \\"Ellen West.\\"Bidart, Frank. \\"Ellen West.\\" Accessible at http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177900 Decades later, Bidart also wrote a follow up poem entitled \\"Writing \\"Ellen West,\\"\\" which, in contrast to the first poem, speaks directly on the poets experiences with West's story and its impact on him. Alternative rock band Throwing Muses recorded a song called \\"Ellen West\\" on their 1991 album The Real Ramona.

The community formed a population of 21,406 , according to South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, making them the world's 18th-largest Korean diaspora community. Their population has grown by about 60% since 2007. Many South Koreans living in Singapore are usually expatriates, consisting of 40-45% of the community, self-employed or Korean business owners consisting of 30% and students consisting of 20%. History There is evidence of Koreans living in Singapore as early as the 1930s, when their homeland was under Japanese rule. A few Koreans are buried in the pre-World War II cemetery of Singapore's Japanese community. In the early 2000s, a variety of factors attracted South Korean migration to Singapore, including education, low taxes, and the ease of obtaining permanent residency status. In 2006, the number of Koreans purchasing Singapore real estate jumped by 132% compared to 2005, with many purchasing as owner-occupiers as well as for investment purposes. Following the increase in the Korean population, the number of restaurants and retailers aimed at the community is on the rise, with a majority of these establishments setting up in Tanjong Pagar, within the Central Region of Singapore. This resulted in locals dubbing the Tanjong Pagar area as Korea Town or Little Korea. The increasing popularity of South Korean culture has also led to an increase in South Korean cosmetic brands, food chains and other consumer brands opening stores in Singapore. Food products from South Korea are also increasingly common in local supermarkets, such as NTUC FairPrice, and are no longer found only in specialised Korean supermarkets. In the late 2010s, the new wave of Korean migration to Singapore consisted mostly of office workers, whom are usually expatriates working in South Korean companies based in the country, business owners and students. Other reasons includes working in the service sector - for positions such as waiters, shop assistants and other service positions. Reasons citied for working in the service line includes the chance to master English, being able to work in a multiracial environment and also Singapore being a safe country. Intermarriages with Singaporeans has also increased, due to the growing Korean population in the country. South Korea's Andong General Hospital and Singapore's Gleneagles Hospital established a clinic aimed at Koreans in Singapore as well as those living in Malaysia; initially staffed by a single Andong doctor assisted by a number of Korean- speaking attendants, the clinic cost S$200,000 to set up. =North Koreans= Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, moved to Singapore in 2012 after fleeing Macau, and other high ranking North Koreans visit Singapore frequently to receive health care or to purchase luxury goods unavailable in their home country. North Korean defectors state that this relationship is the reason why the official Korean Central News Agency referred to Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew as an \\"intimate friend\\" of North Korea. The Singaporean organisation Choson Exchange has also arranged for North Korean university students to obtain business internships in Singapore; under their auspices, two men and three women between the ages of 25 and 39 spent a month working at a business incubator in Singapore in 2013. Education Singapore's only school for Korean nationals, the Singapore Korean School, was established on 17 February 1993; , it had 15 teachers and enrolled 100 students at the elementary school level. It conducts roughly two- thirds of its class hours in Korean, and one-third in English. Its associated weekend school, opened at the same time, enrolled a total of 261 students at the elementary and middle school levels. Despite the challenge they face from the local school system, the Singapore Korean International School still projects rising student numbers, and in 2010 the school moved to a new campus with room for 500 students. Many Korean students bypass the Korean International School entirely in order to take advantage of English-medium education at government or non-Korean international schools. Singapore has become a popular destination for South Korean students and their parents, who see it as an ideal place to learn both English and Chinese, the two most popular foreign languages in South Korea. The Singapore Tourism Board began actively marketing Singaporean education to South Koreans in 2005; they form one of the larger sources of international students, along with other Asian countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. By 2008, Singaporean schools enrolled an estimated 6,500 Korean students. In many cases, mothers come to Singapore with their young school-age children, while the bread-winning father remains behind in South Korea and sends money to support them.

According to the group's web site, its sole purpose is \\"to obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting for the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our nation during the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia.\\" The League's most prominent symbol is its famous POW/MIA flag. History =Founding= The League's origins date to groups created by Sybil Stockdale and a group of POW/MIA wives in 1966 in Coronado, California. Sybil Stockdale's husband, Navy Commander James Stockdale, was shot down in 1965 and she was determined to make the American people aware of the mistreatment of U.S. POWs. Years later Evelyn Grubb became involved because she was frustrated with the lack of information from federal officials. It was these groups that finally convinced the U.S. government to change their official stance on the POW/MIA issue in 1969. The National League of Families was incorporated nationally in 1967 and later in Washington, D.C., on May 28, 1970.Grubb and Jose, You Are Not Forgotten, . Another notable member of the league during the war was Joe McCain, brother of imprisoned U.S. Navy pilot and future U.S. Senator and presidential candidate John McCain.McCain and Salter, Faith of My Fathers, pp. 290–291. =Increased national attention after 1972 Life magazine article= The league gained increased international attention in 1972 when Life Magazine ran a feature article on the organization. The article started with a full page photograph of Major Wilmer Newlin Grubb of the United States Air Force, the husband of National League of Families President Evelyn Grubb, from after he had been shot down in 1966 and taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese Army. Evelyn Grubb by then was also serving as the League's representative to the White House, the United Nations and the Paris Peace Talks, pressing for better accountability, treatment and the speedy return of American MIA and POW soldiers, pilots, airmen, and sailors in the Vietnam War, as well as better policies related to their families. Grubb did not find out until after the war was over that her husband had died shortly after being shot down. =Creation and adoption of \\"You Are Not Forgotten, POW/MIA\\" flag= Then League President and POW wife Evelyn Grubb oversaw the development of the now-famous National League of Families' POW/MIA flag in the early 1970s. The flag's original design by military wife Haydn Anthony, was passed on to an ad agency and slightly modified by employee Newt Heisley, to represent America's missing men. The original design showed a POW crouched in a cage rather than the head of a POW now shown. Evelyn Grubb was then also a driving force in gaining the flags adoption by the military, the U.S. Postal Service and other federal service agencies. Eventually the flag became widely popular and adoption of its use began to spread on its own, as the flag became a national symbol of Vietnam war remembrance. The flag, with the now widely recognized \\"You Are Not Forgotten, POW/MIA\\" logo is still flown in front of all U.S. post offices, all major U.S. military installations, and most fire stations, police stations, many state level agencies and also most veterans organizations chapters across the United States today, and is almost always present at most local and national veterans events in the United States. The flag is consequently still visible to millions of Americans on a daily basis. =1980s: Split and founding of alternate group= In the 1980s a different group, the National Alliance Of Families For the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, was formed as a split-off by National League of Families members over a disagreement with then League President Ann Mills Griffith over tactics the organization should employ in pursuing its goals, and disagreements about the status of missing servicemen by the 1980s.Keating, Prisoners of Hope, p. 52. Compared to the league, the National Alliance takes a more activist, radical stance, especially with regards towards the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue and belief in the existence of \\"live prisoners\\" in Southeast Asia.McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 390. =Current status of organization= The League's national office, based in Arlington, Virginia, is still run by one full-time employee and various volunteers. To date, more than sixteen hundred U.S. servicemen are still listed as Missing in Action in the Vietnam War and efforts continue by certain departments of the U.S. government and the National League of Families to ascertain the fate of these missing service members. Debate continues as to whether or not the efforts by the U.S. government, the Vietnamese government in Hanoi and other governments historically involved in the war have been, or continue to be, sufficient regarding the effort to find these missing soldiers, pilots, airmen and sailors. The National League of Families continues to work at keeping the pressure on both Washington and Hanoi to bring complete resolution to this issue on behalf of each family with a loved one still missing in Vietnam.

The council-backed scheme hoped to interest investors to fund part of the regeneration projects around Croydon, and help to establish Croydon as \\"London's Third City\\" (Croydon has applied for city status twice but failed. If it had succeeded, the borough would have become the City of Croydon, like the City of Westminster.) The expo took place from the 9th to the 12th of May in the Whitgift Centre and Centrale Shopping Centre. It was also displayed in the Croydon Clocktower on the 17th of May. Projects The projects included all areas of Croydon that were expected to be redeveloped between 2007 and 2012. These included Purley, where the current swimming pool on the High Street was set to close. This would allow scope for a more comprehensive High Street regeneration scheme that would help to bring new community investment to the district centre. A new \\"Super Library\\", which would offer learning and training, was planned to open after the pool closure, as was a new swimming complex in Coulsdon. At the time, the facility was being considered by Croydon Council as part of its contribution to the Olympics. Exp07 considered another leisure facility being opened in Waddon, and the old New Addington Pool being redeveloped to coincide with the opening of South Norwood Leisure Centre as part of the \\"new New Addington\\". The New Addington regeneration was planned for the town centre on Central Parade and would include a brand new Tesco, along with a new larger library and leisure facility. Other new facilities to be provided will be a Joint Services Centre, community centre, changing village, exercise gym and dance studio along with treatment room and a multi-purpose room. Plans covered a new café and a car park, a health centre, kiosk, maisonettes, and 300 residential units.Microsoft PowerPoint - NAF NP 20070207M App 2 Regeneration of New Addington District Centre Project Park Place The Expo presented other notable developments such as Park Place Shopping Centre. On 6 March 2007 the Secretary of State confirmed the use of a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) to acquire the remaining land for the development. This was a major milestone for the scheme and allowed Minerva and Lend Lease to gain vacant possession, in readiness for the start of demolition and main construction works. Park Place has been granted detailed planning permission by the London Borough of Croydon. When completed it will provide of accommodation, comprising mainly retail space and restaurants. A key component of the retail space is the provision of a new full-range department store. John Lewis has previously confirmed a requirement for for Croydon and a regional store of this size can only be accommodated on the Park Place site. Other places with interest include Gap, Habitat and Borders. Designed by architects RTKL, the scheme will provide both the large retail units and the necessary mall environment needed to establish Croydon as a Top 10 retail destination within the UK, and the largest and most efficient centre within South London.Park Place  Minerva Plc Croydon Gateway The second main feature of the Expo, the Croydon Gateway (later Ruskin Square]), proved the most expensive.

Biography of Velma Middleton, AllMusic.com. Retrieved 15 November 2016 When Armstrong's orchestra disbanded in 1947, Middleton joined his All-Stars, a smaller group. She was often used for comic relief, such as for duets with Armstrong on \\"That's My Desire\\" and \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\", and she did occasional features. She also recorded eight tracks as a solo singer for Dootone Records in 1948 and 1951. Although she was not widely praised for her voice, described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"average but reasonably pleasing and good-humored\\", Armstrong regarded her as an important and integral part of his show. Middleton performed on June 7, 1953 with Louis Armstrong and his All Stars for the famed ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also featured that day were Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, Roy Brown and his Orchestra, Shorty Rogers, Earl Bostic, and Nat \\"King\\" Cole.“Jazz Cavalcade will be greatest Sunday, June 7th” The California Eagle May 21, 1953.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 14, 2007. For the second time in the series, Marge helps a prison assailant.The Simpsons: I Don't Wanna Know Why The Caged Bird Sings - TV Squad Marge meets Dwight (Steve Buscemi), a man who attempts to rob the bank the two are in. Marge promises that she would visit him in prison, should he turn himself in, but too frightened to go into the prison, she breaks her promise. It was written by Dana Gould and directed by Bob Anderson. Steve Buscemi makes his second guest appearance on the show, (originally appearing as himself in \\"Brake My Wife, Please\\")The Simpsons episode: \\"Brake My Wife, Please\\" though this time he voiced a character, Dwight. Ted Nugent has a voice cameo. Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes a surprise guest return as Snake's girlfriend Gloria, who originally appeared in \\"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\\". During its first airing, the episode originally garnered 8.8 million viewers, higher than the previous episode. Plot Lisa is named \\"Student of the Millennium\\", so Marge stresses that Homer has to attend her ceremony due to past absences at most of the kids' events. Homer then wakes up early and takes Maggie to the school auditorium. Meanwhile, Marge gets impatient waiting in line at the bank, so she strikes up a conversation with an apparently charming man named Dwight (Steve Buscemi). While talking, Dwight tells Marge to hold on. He then pulls out a gun and tells everyone to get down on the floor, just as another man walks into the bank and pulls out a rifle. Gil Gunderson then arrives, prepared for his new job as a security guard, however he is repeatedly shot by Dwight's accomplice, who then flees in a panic. Homer is smugly waiting for Marge at the ceremony. Marge privately calls Homer, informing him she is a hostage at a bank robbery. Dwight notices Marge on the phone and cuts off the call. He then makes a compromise; he will promise to turn himself in as long as Marge promises to visit him in prison, to which she reluctantly agrees. A nervous Marge returns home. Homer attempts to convince Marge not to visit Dwight in the prison, but Marge wishes to honor her promise and visit him. However, while going to the prison, she makes continuous stops to avoid going to the prison, and misses visiting hours. At the prison, Dwight expectantly waits for Marge. While watching Snake Jailbird chatting with his girlfriend, Gloria, Dwight becomes depressed and then angry, and Marge's guilt begins to get to her while watching a depressing movie about a prisoner who was to be electrocuted. At the same moment, Dwight is breaking out of Springfield Penitentiary. He finds Marge's address in a newspaper, and sets out to find her. While watching television at home, Marge sees a news report by Kent Brockman on Dwight's escape from prison. Dwight begins stalking her in various places, and successfully catches up to Marge and keeps her as his hostage. Dwight takes her to the same amusement park where he was abandoned by his mother, with the intention to have Marge help him repay the time he had lost, and promises to let her go afterwards, to which Marge, out of sympathy, agrees. He and Marge then ride the Viking ship ride together. Chief Wiggum arrives attempting to save Marge, but he is caught in the ride. Dwight jams the ride's gears by throwing in his own body to save Wiggum (referencing The Brave Little Toaster). He survives, fortunately, and returns to prison after being hospitalized and making a full recovery. Back at the prison, Marge finally visits Dwight, who gives her a flattened dandelion encased in a bar of soap he had carved for her with a message on the back intending to recruit her in helping him attempt another prison break. Marge does not agree to the escape attempt and Dwight, although saddened, says she can keep the token. Production American musician and political activist Ted Nugent, who is an advocate of hunting and gun ownership rights, guest starred in the episode as himself. His voice is heard during a phone call urging voters to vote no on a proposition that would make crossbows illegal in public schools. He adds: \\"If we outlaw crossbows, who's gonna protect our children from charging elk?\\" Cultural references The title of this episode is take-off of the 1969 autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou. Dwight's buggy eyes is a reference to his guest voice actor's Steve Buscemi's eyes. Homer reveals he works on a Superman novel. Agnes quotes that Dwight and his partner are \\"Johnny and Clyde\\", a take on Bonnie and Clyde. Chief Wiggum watches The Negotiator on a portable DVD player to learn how to deal with a hostage situation. The Itchy & Scratchy episode \\"The Un-Natural\\" parodies the baseball steroids scandal, and the title references the book and film The Natural. Dwight escapes from jail like Andy Dufresne did in The Shawshank Redemption. After the escape it looks like Dwight steps on the camera, which is a reference to Robert De Niro who steps to the camera after his release from jail in the film Cape Fear. Dr. Hibbert and Krusty, who meet up at the end, reference the earlier hostage scene, off-hand implying The Nine. \\"Dilbert's Flying Cubicle\\" (with the theme music from the Dilbert animated series), \\"Tilt N' Spew\\", \\"Mr. Frog's Mild Ride\\", \\"FedEx Presents: The Bathroom\\" and \\"It's a Long Line\\" are seen at the amusement park, references to famous and well known rides, comics, companies, and chains. Dwight's partner in the robbery is based on John Cazale and his character in the movie Dog Day Afternoon which also involved a hostage situation. When Marge visited Dwight in prison Homer was among three Aryan Brotherhood members and called them the three amigos. The song \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" by the Australian group Men at Work plays when Dwight stalks Marge. Reception The episode had 8.8 million viewers. Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed Buscemi's appearance, and he particularly enjoyed the scene where the fun house mirror ballooned Buscemi's eyes to a \\"hilarious extreme\\"; he also felt Buscemi's voice was the first guest voice of the season to have been used to its fullest potential. Despite the humour of the episode, he also stated the ending of the episode did indeed falter a bit at the end, and felt it could not deliver as many laughs as everything that came before it. This episode was also one of two episodes he enjoyed this season, the other being \\"Midnight Towboy\\".

She was the daughter of Queen Joan III and King Anthony of Navarre. She ruled the principality of Béarn in the name of her brother, King Henry III of Navarre, from 1576 until 1596. Early life Catherine was born on 7 February 1559 to Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre and her co-ruler, Antoine de Bourbon. She was named after her godmother, the French queen Catherine de' Medici. Jeanne converted to Calvinism a year after Catherine's birth and declared it the official religion of the Kingdom of Navarre. Antoine, conversely, remained a Catholic and turned against his wife and threatened to divorce her. He died fighting for the Catholic cause on 17 November 1562. Catherine was with her mother and elder brother, Henry, as they fought for the Protestant cause. The Queen died on 9 June 1572, and Catherine's custody was assigned to Catherine de' Medici and Charles IX. During the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, Catherine and her brother were forced to convert to Catholicism. After the death of Charles IX in 1574, the new king, Henry III, considered marrying Catherine. She almost married James VI of Scotland, and her brother sent ambassadors to Edinburgh to advocate the marriage, including Claude de l'Isle and François de Civille. Political service Catherine's brother, successor of Queen Joan III, was generally absent in France. After his escape from captivity in 1576, he entrusted Catherine with the government of Béarn. She served almost continuously as regent until 1596, where among her other responsibilities, she, a staunch Protestant, hosted Antonio Perez, a famous Spanish Catholic refugee from King Philip II. After the accession of her brother to the French throne, in 1589, she was created Duchess of Albret and Countess of Armagnac. Appointed by her brother to sit on his Council as a representative of French Protestant interests in 1598, she set about persuading the Huguenots to agree to the Edict of Nantes. Marriage As part of the treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye between Henry IV and Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, it was agreed that Catherine should marry Charles' elder son, Henry (1563-1624). The marriage agreement was signed on 13 July 1598. However, Catherine was a confirmed Calvinist, who refused to convert to Roman Catholicism, whilst her husband was a devout Catholic, and a former member of the Holy League. Thus, a papal dispensation was required to allow the two to marry, but on 29 December 1598, Pope Clement VIII declared himself opposed to the marriage. Dissatisfied, Henry IV intimidated the Archbishop of Reims into granting an authorisation of marriage. This was made at Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 31 January 1599. Henry eventually secured Papal agreement. Until the birth of her nephew on 27 September 1601, she was heiress presumptive to the Navarrese crown. However, Catherine was not married long before she died, childless. Her husband remarried to Margherita Gonzaga, a niece of Marie de Medici (Henry IV's second wife). Writings Catherine de Bourbon was also a writer. Her works consist principally of sonnets and correspondence.

History  The POW/MIA flag was created for the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia and officially recognized by the United States Congress in conjunction with the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, \\"as the symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation.\\" The original design for the flag was created by Newt Heisley in 1972 The National League of Families then-national coordinator, Evelyn Grubb, wife of a POW, oversaw its development and also campaigned to gain its widespread acceptance and use by the United States government and also local governments and civilian organizations across the United States.Jose, Carol and Grubb, Evelyn; You Are Not Forgotten: A Family's Quest for Truth and the Founding of the National League of Families; Vandamere Press (New York); 2008. . In 1971, while the Vietnam War was still being fought, Mary Helen Hoff, the wife of a service member missing in action (Commander Michael G. Hoff) and member of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for a reference symbol about U.S. POW/MIAs, some of whom had been held in captivity for as many as seven years. The flag is black, and bears in the center, in black and white, the emblem of the league. The emblem was designed by Newton F. Heisley, and features a white disk bearing in black silhouette the bust of a man (Jeffery Heisley), watch tower with a guard on patrol, and a strand of barbed wire; above the disk are the white letters POW and MIA framing a white 5-pointed star; below the disk is a black and white wreath above the white motto: \\"You are not Forgotten.\\"\\"Newt Heisley, 1920-2009: WWII veteran designed POW/MIA flag\\", Associated Press, Chicago Tribune, May 19, 2009. The POW/MIA was flown over the White House for the first time in September 1982. The flag has been altered many times; the colors have been switched from black with white – to red, white and blue – to white with black; the POW/MIA has at times been revised to MIA/POW. On March 9, 1989, a league flag that had flown over the White House on the 1988 National POW/MIA Recognition Day was installed in the U.S. Capitol rotunda as a result of legislation passed by the 100th Congress. The leadership of both houses of Congress hosted the installation ceremony in a demonstration of bipartisan congressional support. On August 10, 1990, the 101st Congress passed U.S. Public Law 101-355, recognizing the National League of Families POW/MIA flag and designating it \\"as a symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation.\\" Beyond Southeast Asia, it has been a symbol for POW/MIAs from all U.S. wars. The flag is ambiguous as it implies that personnel listed as MIA may in fact be held captive. The official, bipartisan, U.S. government position is that there is \\"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia\\". The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) provides centralized management of prisoner of war/missing personnel (POW/MP) affairs within the United States Department of Defense and is responsible for investigating the status of POW/MIA issues. As of 29 March 2017, 1,611 Americans remained unaccounted for, of which 1,023 were classified as further pursuit, 497 as no further pursuit and 91 as deferred. In October 2017, state government buildings in Maryland began flying the POW/MIA flag outside. On November 7, 2019, the National POW/MIA Flag Act was signed into law, requiring the POW/MIA flag to be flown on certain federal properties, including the US Capitol Building, on all days the flag of the United States is flown. Previously, the flag was only flown on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and Veterans Day.  Flag protocol  Plaque using the symbol With the passage of Section 1082 of the 1998 Defense Authorization Act during the first term of the 105th Congress, the POW/MIA flag was specified to fly each year on: * Armed Forces Day—Third Saturday in May * Memorial Day—Last Monday in May * Flag Day—June 14 * Independence Day—July 4 * National POW/MIA Recognition Day—Third Friday in September * Veterans Day—November 11 The POW/MIA flag will be flown on the grounds or the public lobbies of major military installations as designated by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, all Federal National Cemeteries, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the White House, the United States Post Offices and at official offices of the Secretaries of State, Defense and Veterans Affairs, and Director of the Selective Service System. Civilians are free to fly the POW/MIA flag whenever they wish. In the U.S. Armed Forces, the dining halls, mess halls and chow halls display a single table and chair in a corner draped with the POW-MIA flag as a symbol for the missing, thus reserving a chair in hopes of their return. Other color patterns exist: the orange and black pattern was run by Outpost Flags at the time of Harley Davidson's 100th anniversary, so that the bikers would help keep the issue alive and in the forefront of American politics. There are red and white versions, which some say are to cover more recent military actions, but this is not official policy. There are black and red versions available as well.  Display  POW/MIA flag flying below the US flag. When displayed from a single flagpole, the POW/MIA flag should fly directly below, and be no larger than, the United States flag (Civilian or on congressionally designated days). For U.S. government agencies under a Chain of Command the U.S. Flag Code has a complete order of precedence that mirrors Army Regulations 840-10 specifically 840-10 2-2.c. If on separate poles, the U.S. flag should always be placed to the right of other flags (the viewer's left; the flag's own right). On the six national observances for which Congress has ordered display of the POW/MIA flag, it is generally flown immediately below or adjacent to the United States flag as second in order of precedence.

It is equivalent to tetrameter verse in trochees in languages with a stress accent. Its first occurrence is in a 10th-century Old French saint's legend, the Vie de Saint Leger; another early use is in the early 12th-century Anglo-Norman Voyage de saint Brendan. It is often used in French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese poetry. While commonly used in couplets, typical stanzas using octosyllables are: décima, some quatrains, redondilla. In Spanish verse, an octosyllable is a line that has its seventh syllable stressed, on the principle that this would normally be the penultimate syllable of a word (Lengua Castellana y Literatura, ed. Grazalema Santillana. El Verso y su Medida, p. 46). If the final word of a line does not fit this pattern, the line could have eight or seven or nine syllables (as normally counted), thus - :1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / Gra/NA/da :1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / Ma/DRID :1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / MA/(la)/ga In Medieval French literature, the octosyllable rhymed couplet was the most common verse form used in verse chronicles, romances (the romans), lais and dits. The meter reached Spain in the 14th century, although commonly with a more varied rhyme scheme than the couplet. The Anglo-Norman poets from the 12th-13th centuries brought the French octosyllablic verse to England and influenced the 4 stress tetrameter verse used in narration (as in Chaucer).

He is best known as the prolific writer of The Spider pulp magazine novels (1933-1943).https://www.vintagelibrary.com/pulpfiction/authors/WhoWroteTheSpider.php He was born in Virginia, the son of Charles Wordsworth Page (1880 – 1947) and Estlie Isabelle Bethel Page (1880 – 1946). The name Norvell came from his maternal grandmother Elvira Russell Norvell Page. Career Page spent 12 years as a newspaperman, doing many dirty jobs and seeing many corpses in the morgues. When he did start writing, it was western stories, a subject he knew nothing about, but they sold. Finally the editor who bought the stories suggested he write about something he knew, like gangsters. He wrote a backup story in the first issue of The Spider pulp, \\"Murder Undercover\\", and by the third issue was writing the main Spider stories. This continued with great success till he seemed to have a nervous breakdown while writing the Living Pharaoh serial and took a nine-month break from writing before returning to writing relatively tame stories about G-Men (in Ace G-Man Stories) and detective stories. He is best known as the author of the majority of the adventures of that ruthless vigilante hero The Spider, which he and a handful of other writers wrote under the house name of Grant Stockbridge. He also contributed to other pulp series, including The Black Bat and The Phantom Detective, and supplied scripts for the radio programs based on the characters he wrote, science fiction and two early sword and sorcery fantasy novels under forms of his real name, Norvel Page and Norvell W. Page. His 1940 Unknown novel But Without Horns is considered an early classic explication of the superman theme. Under the pen name of N. Wooten Poge, Page wrote the adventures of Bill Carter for Spicy Detective Stories. His works only saw magazine publication during his lifetime, but his fantasies and some of the Spider novels were later reprinted as paperbacks. The Spider was a crime- fighter in the tradition of The Shadow, wanted by the law for executing his criminal antagonists, and prefigured later comic book superheroes like Batman. Page's innovations to the series included a hideous disguise for the hero and a succession of super-scientific menaces for him to combat. One of these, involving an invasion of giant robots, was copied by an early Superman story and helped inspire the movie Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.Norvell Page, The Spider: Robot Titans of Gotham, Baen Books, 2007; back cover blurb. The setting of Page's sword and sorcery novels is central Asia in the first century A.D., when the legendary Prester John supposedly established a Christian kingdom there. In Page's conception, the man behind the legend was hard-bitten Mediterranean adventurer Hurricane John, or Wan Tengri, a hero in the mold of Robert E. Howard's Conan, though more humorous, verbose, and exaggeratedly omnicompetent as a warrior. He comes close to taking over two cities in the course of his travels, but the series concludes before he establishes his empire. He was featured two stories Flame Winds and Sons of the Bear God.

In practice, the principles are used as a test to verify the validity of conditions to be imposed by a planning authority. Specifically, the decision of the House of Lords in Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment,Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment [1981] AC 578. contains the following three principles when considering the reasonableness of imposing conditions on consents: # It must be imposed for a planning purpose. # It must fairly and reasonably relate to the development for which permission is being given. # It must be reasonable.  Application in Australian Planning Decisions  The Newbury principles are applied in Australia, and have been cited by courts in New South Wales and Western Australia.LawCite records.For example:  *. The Newbury test also remains in general application in the courts of New Zealand.For example: = NSW Environmental Planning & Assessment Act 1979 (EP & A Act 1979) = The power to impose conditions on development consent in NSW derives from the heads of consideration under S.4.15 of the EP & A Act 1979 (formerly S.79C) and S.4.17 of this Act. The purpose of these provisions is to provide for the various effects of a development consent which commonly arise in the assessment of development applications. In specific instances it will be for conditions to be explicitly worded by assessment staff to deal with specific issues of impact or ongoing management. To satisfy the Newbury Principles in all such conditions must: * serve a planning purposes; * be clear, concise and measurable; * must relate to the development; and * must be reasonable having regard for the scope of development and must be enforceable (the Wednesbury Principle). It remains the responsibility of Councils to ensure that conditions are imposed having appropriate regard for key planning principles, as contained within relevant planning policies and which do not unreasonably burden the consent holder. In all instances the assessment officers must have regard for the contents of the development application at hand and the requirements of the EP&A; Act and the Regulations to ensure that the development will meet legislative requirements.

Alfred Hopkins announcing his new offices at 101 Park Avenue, New York City. Early in his career, Hopkins specialized in the design of farming complexes for the American capitalist during the Gilded Age. By 1900, he was designing a new farm group for Frederick W. Vanderbilt in Hyde Park, New York in association with Edward Burnett (1849-1925), an agricultural specialist who earlier developed and managed the farming operations for other members of the Vanderbilt family.Frank Futral, \\"The Hyde Park Farm Group, Historic Resource Assessment,\\" Roosevelt-Vanderbilt National Historic Sites, National Park Service, 2006. Hopkins and Burnett maintained an office at 11 East 24th Street in New York City.Taya Dixon, 1998. Edward Burnett: An Agricultural Designer on Gentlemen's Estates. M.A. thesis, University of Pennsylvania. Together they designed some of the country's most extraordinary farms, including Foxhollow, the Tracy Dows estate in Rhinebeck, New York, and a farm for Harry J. Fisher in Greenwich, Connecticut. Their collaboration, though not firmly documented during this time, probably resulted in several other farm projects associated with Hopkins New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Their work, particularly Hopkins architectural style, established the standard for farm architecture and influenced an entire generation of architects. In 1913, he severed his association with Burnett and established himself as Alfred Hopkins & Associates located in the Architects Building at 101 Park Avenue in New York City. Hopkins continued specializing in gentlemen's farms, quickly establishing himself as the \\"dean of farm group architecture,\\"Robert B. Mackay, Anthony K. Baker and Carol A. Graynor.

He designed no fewer than fifteen farm groups on Long Island, including the farm at Laurelton Hall for Louis Comfort Tiffany. An article on farm groupings published in Architectural Record in 1915John J. Klaber. \\"The Grouping of Farm Buildings: Examples from the Work of Alfred Hopkins\\" Architectural Record 37 April, 1915. notes that Hopkins was often called upon to design the farm groups on estates where the residences were the work of other architects, such as Bertram Goodhue, John Russell Pope and Charles A. Platt. Hopkins was among the contributors to Stables and Farm Buildings: A Special Number of the Architectural Review produced by the staff of Architectural Review in 1902.

Hopkins' book went into a third edition. Hopkins laid out his farm buildings around paved courts or grassed paddocks, keeping rooflines and eaves low to blend with the landscape, and carefully separating the necessary farming functions. He preferred to remove hay storage from its traditional loft over the stables to eliminate dust infiltration and ammonia pollution. Open-sided sheds housed farm vehicles. The spatial routes of cows and horses were kept separate. Farmhands' quarters were integrated with the buildings. An outstanding late survival of Hopkins' Cotswolds-inspired vernacular manner is the stable court at Hartwood, near Pittsburgh (1929). The same year he published a brochure distributed among architects, Two Cotswolds Villages, describing the vernacular architecture and stone-tiled roofs of two picturesque English villages: Bibury, Gloucestershire and Castle Combe, Wiltshire.Hopkins, Two Cotswold Villages (The Tuileries Brochures: A Series of Monographs on European Architecture with Special Reference to Roofs of Tile) Volume 1, Number 4, July 1929). Photographs by F.R. Yerbury Hopkins is less known for his Prisons and Prison Building (New York: Architectural Book Publishing 1930), where rational planning met other ends, in a progressive and humane program based on the classification of prisoners and their segregation by groups in small units; proposals that argued against walled prisons and for the uplifting effect of good architecture. His practical experience was founded on his work at Westchester County Penitentiary, Berks County Prison, and his proposed designs for a federal prison to be built at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, completed in 1934. Hopkins was also among the architects who published plans for inexpensive carpenter-built housing in Carpentry and Building.Jan Jennings, \\"Cheap and Tasteful Dwellings in Popular Architecture\\" Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture 5 (1995), p 151, note 49. and his small book Planning for sunshine and fresh air: Being sundry discourses & excursions in the pleasant art of building homes, set forth in a manner and upon a theory ... how best to effect their proper economies appeared in 1931. He also published The Fundamentals of Good Bank Building (1929).

History South Africa had considered importing labourers from Korea as early as 1903 to control rising mining wages, but eventually decided on Chinese workers instead. The Immigration Act of 1913 classified all Asians as \\"prohibited immigrants\\", thus preventing them from settling in the country or conducting commercial activities there. In 1930, when then-Minister of the Interior D. F. Malan made the decision to exclude Japanese from the \\"prohibited immigrants\\" category as defined by the 1913 Act, Koreans remained prohibited immigrants, though Jan Smuts angrily protested that the exemption represented a precedent for opening the door to Koreans and Chinese as well. In fact, it came to pass as Smuts predicted: Koreans were removed from the \\"prohibited immigrants\\" category in the 1960s. However, the Korean community in South Africa only really began to take shape after the 1992 establishment of relations between South Korea and South Africa. South Korean companies began sending expatriate employees and their families to the country, and international students found themselves able to enroll in South African universities. A number of independent migrants came as well; they typically set up small businesses in the import/export, hospitality, car repair, and photography sectors. They are mainly found in the suburbs of Johannesburg. Demography From 658 people in 1997—19% of all Koreans on the continent and little larger than the Korean community of 589 people in Ghana—their numbers doubled to 1,356 by 2001 and grew again by 155% to 3,452 in 2005, making then 44% of all Koreans in Africa and nearly five times the size of the next-largest community. Most are located in Johannesburg, with a smaller community in Cape Town. South Korean tourists generally choose Cape Town as their primary destination, due to Table Mountain and other famous natural attractions. By 2011, the Korean population of South Africa had grown another 9% to 4,186. Of South Korean nationals or former nationals in the country, 126 had South African nationality, 1,227 were permanent residents, 954 were international students, and the remaining 1,879 had other types of visas. Most resided in or Gauteng (2,240 people, 54% of all Koreans in the country) or Western Cape (1,800, or 43%). The Korean communities in those two provinces exhibit differing demographic characteristics: the community in Western Cape has a higher proportion of international students, and a sex ratio of 0.75 men for every woman; the community in Gauteng has a higher proportion of permanent residents, and a sex ratio of 1.77 men for every woman. In 2010, South Korean news reports quoted South Korea's Ministry of Unification as claiming that as many as 1,000 North Korean guestworkers were in South Africa to assist in the construction of stadiums for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, including FNB Stadium (Soccer City). However, in interviews with South African media, project managers at the sites in question denied the reports. Education Since the 1990s, many South Koreans have chosen South Africa as a destination for English as a Foreign Language courses. As of 2011, there were 954 South Koreans in South Africa on international student visas, among them 590 in Western Cape province, and 360 in Gauteng province. Not all have just gone to the major cities; for example, Potchefstroom is also one of their major destinations, due to the presence of the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University, and in some cases even whole families have moved there for their children's education. There are several universities with more than 50 Korean students. Aside from English, inexpensive golf lessons are another attraction for Korean international students; a 2004 Yonhap News Agency report estimated that there were roughly 50 South Korean golf students in the country. In total, more than a quarter of the Korean population in South Africa may consist of students or family members who moved to the country primarily to give their children the opportunity for an English- language education. Basic school costs are higher than those in South Korea, but conversely South Korean expatriates in South Africa can spend less on private cram schools, instead allowing their children to take advantage of a broader range of after-school activities. However, South Korean children who have gone through the more relaxed South African educational system sometimes find it difficult to adjust to the fast pace and high demands of schooling once they return to their native country. Koreans in South Africa have also established three weekend schools to educate their children in Korean language and culture. The Johannesburg Hangul School was the earliest; it was founded in March 1992 by Jeong Eun-il, who continues to serve as principal. It employed 14 teachers and enrolled 14 kindergarteners, 55 elementary school students, and 13 middle school students. The next school was the Pretoria Hangul School, founded in February 1995 by Choe Jong-o; it shares facilities with the Lynnwood Dutch Reformed Church. It has 8 teachers, 13 kindergarteners, 26 elementary school students, and 7 middle school students. Finally, the Cape Town Hangul School was founded in 2001 by the Mariners' Church (외항선교회). It is the smallest of the three Korean schools, but also the only one with a high school division; it enrols 9 kindergarteners, 12 elementary school students, 3 middle school students, and 6 high school students. There are also some Koreans studying in Rhodes University. Religion There are eight Korean churches in South Africa, staffed by pastors sent from parent churches in South Korea. Aside from their religious functions, they often serve as community centres for Korean migrants and expatriates. Most are Protestant, but a Korean Catholic church also opened in Glenferness, Johannesburg in 2009. At the end of 2006, there were 79 South Korean Christian missionary families and 16 individual South Korean missionaries in South Africa totalling 174 people, making up nearly 70% of all South Korean missionaries in southern Africa. Most South Korean churches and organisations began their activities in South Africa in the 1980s and 1990s. There are also six Korean Buddhist temples in the country. Community relations Crime in South Africa has not left the Korean community untouched; one widely reported case was the 1999 murder of Kwon Yong-koo, the president of Daewoo Motor South Africa, in the driveway of his home in Johannesburg. He was found there in his car the following morning. However, this was suspected to be a targeted killing rather than a random carjacking attempt. At one point, prosecutors even claimed to have evidence implicating a Zimbabwean businessman with close ties to Robert Mugabe in the killing. In 2007, a Korean woman was found dead in her Cape Town home with her hands and feet bound with rope. No Koreans were victimised during the May 2008 anti-immigrant violence. References =Sources=   *.

Ausente 7 anos das galerias de arte portuguesas, Luís Geraldes mostrou recentemente seu trabalho\\" He is more widely known for his oil painting although he has produced a vast amount of sculpture, drawings and large ceramic murals. His art can be labelled as metaphysical, mystic symbolism or spiritual. He has also produced many ceramic murals in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, some of which are on public display at Trafalgar Street metro station in the suburb of Petersham, and Audley Street in Marrickville, Sydney. Biography Geraldes was born in 1957 and went to the African country of Angola when he was about 3 years of age. He spent most of his childhood and adolescent years there but in 1975 had to flee the country as a refugee because of the civil war. His long stay in Angola seems to have affected his style of art and he did indeed start painting when he was a boy. He migrated to Australia in 1985. He became an Australian citizen in 1987 and has taught art and design at the Footscray Institute of TAFE from 1988 to 1990 and at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) from 1991 to 1995. From 1995, he was a lecturer at the Central Gippsland Institute Art Department. He now paints full-time and regularly travels between Europe and Australia. His paintings have been selling throughout the world and auction houses, particularly at Christie's Art Auctions in London. Oil on canvas Geraldes is best known for his oil painting. His style has dramatically changed over the years, showing how Australian art has influenced his style. His early interest in western and eastern esotericism and spirituality can also be seen as a prime factor in his subject matter, in which he often paints geometric patterns involving cosmic imagery and symbolism of universal significance. In some of his works the use of the chakra colours can be seen as well as a diagrammatic language of cosmic journeys. In his book Visions of the Esoteric Power he asserts his belief that \\"art, science, and the spiritual do not exist in isolation\\". He explores the third dimension of human beings in relation to the spiritual universe. There are five levels of movement in Geraldes' works: EARTH, AIR, WATER, FIRE and SPIRIT. All of them relate back to the beginning of mankind. Luis follows a two-dimensional path to the inner self by stating in his works the two levels of AIR, and EARTH, which are the most basic levels of man's existence. He then proceeds to lay over the emotions, which men carry within themselves. He uses the blues and greens of water and the warm colours for fire to create a feeling of completeness or as an ordered whole. Superimposed on that, Geraldes states the mystical or esoteric forms from the past and present. By this last statement he puts men in a total form of relationship to the five signs of water, air, fire, earth and spirit. Geraldes is able to put down his innermost involvement in life Later Geraldes has been developing an awareness of the relationship of art with its surroundings, developing art works that are concerned with natural disasters, and the shock of the unknown that affects the human condition in relation to all beings. His colours have dramatically changed into reds, oranges and black. Geraldes' works are represented in the Haifa Museum of Art, Israel; the Chiado (National Museum of Contemporary Art), the Art Museum of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos and the Ismaeli Art Collection of the Aga Khan Foundation, all in Lisbon; the Madeira Island Modern Art Museum; Guarda City Art Museum; and other important private and government art collections.

During his lifetime, he wrote several books and texts, and discovered and described many species of flora and fungi. He also spent a considerable amount of time (around fifteen years, from 1871 to 1886) serving as a military doctor, particularly in the Franco-Prussian War, in places such as Spandau, Rastatt and Breslau, and rising to the rank of colonel.  Life  Not much is known about Joseph Schröter's childhood and youth, except that he probably spent those years in or close to Breslau, for that is where he was schooled. Similarly, not much is known about his relatives and family. In 1855 Schröter chose to study medicine in Breslau, Lower Silesia (Wrocław, Poland since 1945) , but in 1856, he transferred to the Friedrich-Wilhelm Academy in Berlin, Prussia (Germany did not unite into a single nation state until 1871). In 1859 he earned his Doctor of Medicine degree. In the same year, he enlisted in the Prussian army, serving as a doctor in the Franco-Prussian war. He occupied this post to the end of the war, in 1871, before being stationed at Spandau, and later Rastatt. For his efforts as a doctor, as well as the various other contributions he made to the military (particularly during the Franco-Prussian War), Schröter was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1880. He was then stationed at Breslau, where he had been schooled. His career at the University of Breslau began six years later, in 1886, when he was appointed as a lecturer. He stayed at the university teaching for several years, and became a professor in 1890. He died in 1894, after returning from a scientific expedition to Turkey.

The duties of the office involved waiting on the King when he ate in private, helping him to dress, guarding the bedchamber and water closet, and providing companionship. From 1660 the office of first gentleman of the bedchamber was invariably combined with that of Groom of the Stool. On average the number of Gentlemen varied around 12 but fluctuated from time to time. During the reign of James II there were only eight and none was appointed during the reign of Queen Anne.

Founded in 1885, the party was officially disbanded in 1940 and superseded by the Belgian Socialist Party in 1945. History The De Zwaan café in Brussels, where the POB-BWP was founded in 1885. In April 1885, a meeting of 112 workers took place in a room of the café De Zwaan on the Grand Place in Brussels, at the same place where the First International had convened, and where Karl Marx had written The Communist Manifesto. At this meeting the Belgian Labour Party (POB or BWP) was created. Several groups had been represented at this meeting, including the BSP of Edward Anseele. The members were mainly craftsmen and not workers from industrial centres (with the exception of Ghent). When drafting a programme for the new party, it was feared that a radical programme would deter workers. On that basis it was decided that the word socialism would not be mentioned in the name of the party, a point of view which was also defended by Cesar De Paepe (1841–1890). The Charter of Quaregnon (located in this municipality and not in Mons because of the Garde Civique's 'fusillade of Mons'), of 1894 provided the doctrinal basis for the Belgian socialists from 1894 until 1979. Before 1919, the district system in Belgian elections made it almost impossible for the Labour Party to get parliamentary seats in Flanders, and the Ghent socialist leader, Edward Anseele, was elected in Liège. After 1919, universal male suffrage and proportional representation greatly enhanced the party's parliamentary strength and it participated in several governments. In the 1919 election, the Belgian Labour Party won 36.6% of the vote and increased their parliamentary representation from 26 to 70 seats. This was enough to deny the Catholic Party the majority it had enjoyed since 1884, which led the Catholic Party to form a coalition with Labour, forming a cabinet that contained Labour members. The Belgian Labour Party used this opportunity to demand and to have passed reforms such as the repeal of a law that prohibited picketing, an eight-hour workday, old-age pensions, inheritance taxes, and a graduated income tax.Donald F.

He has competed for several North American independent promotions and has competed in several wrestling tours in Asia. He also had a brief stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2000. Juggernaut is known both for his brawling and aerial abilities as well as his martial arts skills. He has competed against some of the most famous wrestlers in the business. His greatest success came in Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling (ECCW), where he had a long rivalry with Kurrgan and won the NWA/ECCW Heavyweight Championship on six occasions. Juggernaut announced his retirement in 2007, as he wanted to quit wrestling while he was still healthy. Career =Early career= Renney grew up in Cranbrook, British Columbia and became interested in wrestling at age seven while watching a televised match between Bruno Sammartino and Gorilla Monsoon. He gained combat sport experience by earning black belts in both judo and jujutsu, and he moved to Edmonton, Alberta to train as a wrestler. He made his debut in Edmonton and wrestled in several matches there before moving to Tampa, Florida. Starting out, he wrestled for Independent Pro Wrestling, making $30 per match or less and sometimes competing in exchange for food and drinks. Juggernaut became known for his hardcore wrestling abilities, but he also impressed observers with his ability to perform a moonsault. =Independent circuit= The following year, he wrestled against Jimmy Snuka at the Washington State Fair in Vancouver, Washington. He continued to compete in various independent promotions, facing such veterans as Greg Valentine, Jim Neidhart, and The Bushwhackers. At an event in Montana, he worked in a booked loss to The Honky Tonk Man. Juggernaut began competing regularly with Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling in 1999 and formed a tag team with Biohazard known as Toxic Insanity. They won the NWA/ECCW Tag Team Championship on March 26, 1999 by defeating Michelle Starr and Johnny Canuck. Two months later, they also won the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship. They defended both belts until they dropped the Canadian Tag Team Championship on July 22. They regained the title two days later but were stripped of all of their belts that August. Juggernaut held the NWA/ECCW Tag Team Championship once more, winning the belts with Dr. Luther on March 31, 2000 but losing them the same night. During this time, Juggernaut also competed as a singles wrestler. On September 12, 1999, he defeated Michelle Starr to win the NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. The following month, he dropped the belt to Johnny Canuck in a three-way match. He regained the belt in a rematch but was stripped of the title in December. A tournament was held for the vacant championship, which Juggernaut won to regain the title. He then became involved in a feud with Kurrgan, and the two traded the belt back and forth. Kurrgan beat Juggernaut for the title on February 25, 2000, but Juggernaut won it back two months later. He held the belt for a day before dropping it back to Kurrgan. When Kurrgan was stripped of the title for being unable to compete at a show in July, Juggernaut won the vacant championship by defeating Leatherface (Rick Patterson). At Juggernaut's request, the match was a two out of three falls tables match. During the match, he was legitimately unable to move for several minutes and suffered memory loss after Leatherface hit him with a chair. =Wrestling overseas and return to North America= In 2000, Juggernaut began touring Asia as a wrestler. He competed in Korea for the World Wrestling Association. Two weeks after returning to Canada, he accepted an invitation from the International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan). While in Japan, he achieved his dream of wrestling in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Three months later, World Championship Wrestling was taping WCW Thunder in Kamloops, British Columbia and recruited Juggernaut and three other local wrestlers for a match. They faced KroniK in a handicap match with a two-minute time limit. KroniK won the match in one minute and forty-nine seconds, pinning Juggernaut after performing the High Times. Returning to ECCW, Juggernaut defeated Moondog Manson on February 9, 2001 to win the ECCW Hardcore Championship. He held the title for almost four months before dropping it to Lumberjack Bubba. He began competing for several other independent promotions, including Calgary, Alberta-based Stampede Wrestling. In 2002, he defeated former Extreme Championship Wrestling World Heavyweight Champion Tommy Dreamer. In 2005, he won his sixth and final NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship by defeating Scotty Mac. He held the belt until January 27, 2006, when he dropped it to Sweet Daddy Devastation. Later that year, he teamed with TJ Wilson to win the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship. They did not lose the belts, but they were forced to vacate the title when Wilson left the promotion to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment. Meanwhile, he continued to wrestle overseas, competing in such countries as India, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. =Retirement and semi-retirement= In 2007, Juggernaut announced his intention to retire from professional wrestling after nearly 1500 matches. Although he was healthy, he decided to retire before he suffered any injuries that would hurt him in his future life outside the ring. On his website, he posted a list of the ten wrestlers he wished to face before retiring. The list included such wrestlers as Samoa Joe, Aaron Idol, Bryan Danielson, and Steve Corino. Juggernaut has since returned to wrestling on a limited basis. He appeared at an ECCW show in November 2009, attacking Azeem The Dream. On January 29, 2010, he competed in his first match since retirement. He wrestled a triple threat match against Sid Sylum and Scotty Mac in which Scotty Mac retained the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship.

Superstorm originally aired on BBC One for a period of three weeks, totaling three 59 minute episodes, from to . Each episode was followed by a half-hour documentary on BBC Two on extreme weather monitoring and forecasting, called The Science of Superstorms. The series was also aired (after being edited for content) on the Discovery Channel in the U.S. and Canada during the summer of 2007. Superstorm is a co-production of BBC Worldwide, Discovery Channel and ProSieben, in association with M6 and NHK. Ailsa Orr and Michael Mosley, who made also Supervolcano, are the executive producers for BBC, while Jack E. Smith is the executive producer for the Discovery Channel. The miniseries was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2007.Superstorm DVD at Amazon UK (region 2) Plot The movie begins with a team of scientists working on a US government project, known as Stormshield, whose goal is to control and manage storms, particularly hurricanes. Hurricane Grace, a Category 3 hurricane which is slowly climbing to a Category 5, is up to hit the United States. Using a predictive technology named Tempest and developed by Lance Resznick, they are able to simulate the effects of seeding the storm in order to collapse the eye of the storm and then decrease its intensity. Lance is openly skeptical towards the theories of Sara Hughes, an English scientist who is convinced about the effectiveness of cloud seeding. An experiment is done on a smaller hurricane, Agatha. A plane and several UAV carrying the seeds (in this case, supercooled liquid) fly into the storm. At first, the experiment is a success but then the storm intensifies during the seeding and the plane crashes. Weeks go by and Grace has now become a category 5 hurricane, headed straight for Miami. At the urgings of Katzenberg, the fund seeker of the project, the team formulates a plan of distant atmospheric perturbation to deflect Grace out into the Atlantic Ocean by creating a low pressure system on the Pacific coast and allowing it to be carried across the nation towards the hurricane. While the team leader Abrams and mathematician Munish Loomba try to model the weather perturbation that will safely deflect Grace, Lance tells Sara that her attempt to change Agatha's course after the seeding was actually successful. Discussing such results with her grandfather, who was head of a similar, discredited project in the 1970s, Sara discovers that he and his team knew they could make hurricanes change course but made their efforts appear fruitless because they realized the military were behind the project, looking for ways to use weather as a weapon. The same turns out to be true for Stormshield, even if Katzenberg had previously assured that there was no military involvement. Meanwhile, the low pressure system approach has been finalized, with B-52 bombers ready to release trails of carbon over the West Coast. Just before proceeding with the operation, Lance states that the attempt must be stopped as another storm is moving up and could deflect Grace back into the USA. Unimpressed, Katzenberg fires the whole team, who refuses to take such a high risk. The team soon learns that the operation went on even if they did not provide the necessary data to the flying squad. The mole in the team turns out to be Bengali-born Munish, who lost his family in a hurricane while still a child and now desperate to make the theory of hurricane deflection work. The other storm did deflect Grace, now headed right for New York City. After realizing that in the first experiment the course of Agatha was altered by the supercooling of the areas of the storm, the team decides to apply the same method. They manage to slightly deviate the storm away from New York City, thus causing smaller damage, but cannot avoid that Long Island, where the Stormshield headquarters are located, is hit. Sara is the only member of the team who survives without severe injuries and the series finishes with her about to either admit the terrible tragedy caused by their research or, as Katzenberg would want, lie to cover it up and suggest to the American people and to the whole world that the technology did work and is to be expanded.

Following a disappointing season in 2002, which was mostly dominated by Ferrari's F2002, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis decided a radical approach was needed to get back to the front. However, due to several problems during tests, the car was never raced, in favour of the McLaren MP4-17D, a highly developed version of the 2002 contender. The new car crashed several times with very obscure reasons, failed the FIA side impact crash tests twice, and there was a severe problem cooling the engine down, since the sidepods were made very narrow. During 2002, it became clear that the new car would have to be a big step forward, and not a simple evolution.

In its heyday, Donald was a divisional point on the Canadian Pacific Railway. But, in 1897, when the CPR abandoned Donald in favor of Revelstoke, Donald disappeared into obscurity and is now a small sawmilling community. History Donald 1886 In its glory years, Donald was home to several memorable characters. * Reverend Henry Irwin who was the local Anglican priest during rail construction. Affectionately called \\"Father Pat\\", he was also well known throughout the Rossland mining camps. * Pioneer newspaperman John Houston, who would later become the first mayor of Nelson started his first newspaper in Donald in 1888. Other, less law-abiding but still colorful people called Donald home. * Card sharks: \\"One Armed Roxy\\" and John Houts, also known as \\"Keno Jack\\". * Madam Florence Mackenzie, also known as \\"Mother\\" Mackenzie, who saved \\"Keno Jack\\"'s life by administering first aid when the man had been lung shot by CPR conductor, Jack Selkirk, when Selkik had caught him \\"springing a cold deck\\" during a game of poker. =The Stolen Church and the Stolen Bell= Windermere's St. Peter's Church Despite the roguish nature of some these local characters, it would be one of Donald's leading citizens, Rufus Kimpton, who would commit its most notorious crime. When the CPR announced the move to Revelstoke in 1897, the company also offered to move free of charge any buildings to anywhere along its line. Rufus Kimpton, knowing that Donald would soon be a ghost town moved with his family to Windermere. His wife missed the church at Donald so much that Rufus went back and got it for her, moving it by wagon and barge to its new location in Windermere. However, the church had already been promised to the town of Revelstoke and when a group of Revelstokians arrived in Donald ready to move the church, they found that it had mysteriously disappeared. When they learned that the church had been taken to Windermere, they wrote letters demanding its return. Windermere didn't respond to the correspondence, and they too had been victims of a theft. While the church had been en route to Windermere, someone at Golden had stolen the bell out of it. Windermere had no better luck getting its bell back than Revelstoke had getting the church back. Golden's St. Paul's Church Therefore, at Windermere, there was St. Peter's, the \\"Stolen Church\\" and at Golden, there was St. Paul's, the church of the \\"Stolen Bell\\". Resentment simmered between Windermere and Golden for more than half a century over the bell, until one night in 1957, a group from Windermere, sneaked into Golden and stole back the bell, even going so far as to hold a parade in honor of their achievement. However the church officials at Windermere didn't believe that two wrongs made a right and the bell was soon returned to Golden.

Memmi's famed artwork, La Madonna della Febbre was the first venerated image of the Blessed Virgin Mary granted with a Canonical coronation by a Pope on 27 May 1631. The image has long been since held miraculous and is enshrined at the Sacristy chapel of the Blessed Sacrament inside Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. Style canonically crowned by Pope Urban VIII on 27 May 1631. The surrounding marble frame is a ciborium by Donatello di Bardi, Sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome Memmi's figures retain the static and generally frontal view found in the earlier generation of late Duecento masters such as Guido da Siena. Common features of his documented and attributed work are the sophisticated compositional arrangements, figures rendered with a striking facial roundness, narrow eyes, graceful brow lines, and elongated noses. Memmi's figures are considered less innovative than those of his Trecento contemporaries, the sensibility of the lines used in the face and the eyes harken back to the conventions of the Byzantine tradition. Though they demonstrate Memmi's adherence to earlier conventions of emphasizing the spiritual function of Medieval art, there are also indications of the forward looking stylistic developments of his fellow Sienese masters. A description of his St. Agnes panel (1300–50) shows how Memmi's pictorial style was less severe and angular than the Duecento works his imagery recalled: “...has softer qualities and its spirit is tranquil”.Henniker-Heaton 23 Indeed, his depiction of emotion and realism is also subdued by this 'soft tranquility', leaving figures to read as somewhat archaic, yet projecting a dreamy quality. Memmi is remembered for distinctive stamped tin halos with ray patterns in gold leaf. This interest in design carries over to Memmi's observation of fabric patterns and their placement. He is also known as an effective miniaturist, using sgraffito to delicately render garments as depicted in the Griggs Madonna and Child (1350) at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Assumption of the Virgin (1340) at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.Polzer 1981 577 Memmi's interest in detail is evident in his innovative compositional devices using simple geometric shapes such as the circular arrangement of the angels in the Assumption of the Virgin. The term “Lippesque', coined by Joseph Polzer, describes the overall effect of Memmi's visual devices found in several Madonna and Christ images. “The seated Christ Child in the central image, and especially his head which is axially and frontally ordered ... heads close to spheroid in shape and share a dominating large forehead crowned by an identical centrally located whirl of hair”. These Lippesque elements are on display in the Sienese panel S. Maria dei Servi, which Polzer uses to demonstrate Memmi's authorship of the Madonna and Child and the Coronation of the Virgin at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, rather than Simone Martini.Polzer 1999 39 Attribution and artistic legacy Memmi's Maestà in the Sala di Dante of the Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano A considerable amount of ongoing research on unsigned panels and altarpieces of early to mid-Trecento Sienese art has revealed the plausible influence of Memmi on various artists in the generation following the outbreak of the Black Death in 1348. Thus, a more complete understanding of his style and artistic achievements continues to emerge. His status as an artist of personal expression, rather than simply a craftsman and “Fratello in Arte” of his brother-in-law Simone Martini is gaining acceptance.Freuler 94 Research in the 1920s began to separate the works of Lippo Memmi from those of Guido da Siena. It was also accepted that an artist bearing the name Barna was a fellow student under Simone Martini and an artistic collaborator with Memmi. In attributing the panel of St. Agnes to Memmi, Heaton states that it is “...a panel endowed with unity of design and characteristics rarely found in the works of an artist not possessing a more independent, creative personality than is usually predicated of Lippo Memmi”. The New Testament cycle of frescos in the Collegiate Church of San Gimignano, though to date from the 1340s, are now generally attributed to Lippo Memmi. Traditionally they were attributed to Barna of Siena, but it is thought now that this artist never existed, even though the attribution dates from the writing of the Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari. Vasari took the name from an earlier work by Ghiberti, but it is thought that \\"Barna\\" might have been wrongly transcribed from \\"Bartolo\\", and referred to Bartolo di Fredi who painted the Old Testament cycle in the opposite aisle of the church. This suggests that other works attributed to Barna could be works of Memmi and thus his stylistic adherence to Simone Martini is less binding.Freuler 93 - 94 Judas receives the thirty pieces of silver, fresco, San Gimignano. =The Memmi workshop= The Memmi workshop began with Lippo's father, Memmo di Filippucci. Its early works, such as the 1317 San Gimignano Maestà in the Palazzo Comunale, are a collaboration of the two.Wieruszowski 19 In the 1330s the shop produced the Orvieto Polyptych panels.Mallory 193 Lippo's brother Federigo Memmi belonged to the shop before 1343, during the time the New Testament cycle and other works attributed to \\"Barna of Siena\\" were produced.Freuler 100 Simone Martini was the brother-in-law of Lippo. After Lippo returned to Siena from Avignon there is little evidence of interaction with Simone Martini. The influence of Memmi's Assumption on Naddo Ceccarelli in his Rebel Angels (another term for fallen angels) suggests a more direct stylistic connection between the ideas emerging from Lippo's shop and the younger generation of Sienese artists apprenticing under him.Polzer 1981 582-583 =Collaboration with Simone Martini= The 1333 Annunciation at the Uffizi in Florence is signed by both Lippo and Simone. Memmi's definite contribution to the panel are the halos for, and columnar renderings of St. Margaret and St. Ansanus that bookend the panel. The scribe work in the Arch Angel Michael's halo and arguably the gold leaf background were also Memmi contributions.Polzer 1981 579 Stamp work with gold leaf and tin Memmi and Martini most likely settled into a familiar style in gilding patterns with the Monaldeschi altarpiece in Orvieto from about 1320 consisting of a “composite punch design of a quatrefoil set about a central rosette”.Polzer 1981 573 His most identifiable device is found in the alternating long and short lines depicting light emanating from the halos of saints and angels, most famously recognized in the Annunciation, yet we see this in works throughout his career such as the Virgin and Child in New York, the Virgin of Humility in Berlin, and his small Maesta in the San Domenico cloister in Siena. Memmi's Maestà at San Gimignano is striking in the various methods of pastiglia and gilding work used. Golden tin on the throne cusps, laminated tin with gold foil for the halos which are carefully rendered with intricate punchwork, his application of these materials described as “a neat perfection rarely encountered elsewhere”.Tintori 95 Examination of the motifs and degree of complexity in the punchwork has allowed historians to recognize the hand of Lippo Memmi and gives a clearer idea of his place in collaborations with Simone Martini. Stamp designs, gilding and the execution of rayed halos are similar, yet show that Lippo Memmi's mature gild and scribe work patterns in the 1317 San Gimignano Maestà are rooted in the simpler patterns and less developed line he applied to Martini's Maestà of 1315 at the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena.

Compatible with both the controller and GunCon, the title is non-violent and aimed at younger players, but more forgiving of poor accuracy than others in the genre. Players watch over the game's hero, Bo, as he absentmindedly makes his way through each location, dealing with enemies and manoeuvering him past dangers. Gameplay Players assume the role of a mysterious power caused by the dream fragment protecting Bo, a harmless rabbit who has lost his memory after falling from a cliff due to the mischievous Bully Brothers, a group of five colored bats. Bo travels to the end of each level to a given world, oblivious to danger, searching the other four dream fragments he needs to restore it granting a wish. Bo also meets three secondary characters: Hunter (a fox rookie detective and also his friend), Trixie (a dishonest blonde girl), and Earl Grey (a famous thief sought by Hunter). Enemies and bosses attack Bo throughout the game, the player must repel them. Obstacles and traps must be destroyed by being shot or bypassed by shooting Bo in the head or rump, neither of which harms him. Shooting Bo in the head causes him to fall over, avoiding any head-height attacks or obstacles and stopping him from moving for a few seconds. Shooting instead Bo in the rump causes him to leap forwards, potentially leaping over traps and obstacles. Standard rounds of ammunition are infinite, while stronger ones represented by acorns act as explosives but are in limited supply. Bo's life gauge is reduced by one point every time he is attacked or damaged (six initial notches are available), but if it's allowed to empty, the game will over. Bo restores his own life points by eating any fruit he comes across on his way, though a poisonous mushroom can harm him, requiring the player to destroy it by shooting it before Bo has a chance to eat it. An extra notch is also obtained by picking ten dream fragments, which are two kinds, small and big (the latter being worth five); the player can raise the gauge up to twenty notches. Rescue Shot comprises four areas and a total of ten levels, covering fantasy locations such as a magic kingdom, a castle and a mineshaft with trolleys, alongside a futuristic city with clockwork robots. Bonus targets are spread throughout the game's stages, allowing players to increase their score, as well as acorn bullets and dream fragments which are collected by the player shooting them. After each level, the player's result is broken down for: scores gained along its course, firing accurance, shooting apart enemies and bonus targets, and completing it quickly. Reception The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's reviewer awarded the game 2 out of 5, citing the brevity of the game and lack of replay value since the game has no unlockable extras and progression is linear. GameSpot's James Mielke stated that the game was more like the Point Blank series rather than Time Crisis due to \\"focusing more on the crazy game dynamics of its unique gameworld\\", in GameSpot's preview.

Publication history The philosophical Preface with Hobbes's reply to Davenant appeared, along with a few stanzas of the poem, in an edition published during Davenant's exile in Paris in 1650. There were two editions of the partially completed text in London in 1651. A 1652 edition contains the first two books and part of the third. This version is also prefaced by commendatory poems written by Edmund Waller and Abraham Cowley.Vivian de Sola Pinto, The English Renaissance, 1510-1688, Cresset Press, London, 1938, p.332 Some additional material was included in an edition published after Davenant's death. Plot The plot of the poem is loosely based on episodes of Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards.Nicholas Birns, Barbarian Memory, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, p. 33. The poem tells the story of an early medieval Lombard Duke called Gondibert and his love for the beautiful and innocent Birtha. His love for Birtha means he cannot return the affections of princess Rhodalind, the king's daughter, even though he would be made ruler of Verona if he married her. Rhodalind, in turn, is loved by Oswald. These various conflicts of desire and devotion occasion philosophical reflections on the nature of love, duty and loyalty. The story is never resolved, since the poet gave up on the work before completing his design. Interpretations The poem has been interpreted as an allegory of the power struggles of the English Civil War, during which Davenant was a prominent Royalist. Gondibert himself has been identified with Charles II and Rhodalind with Henrietta Maria. According to Kevin Sharpe, the allegorical aspects can be overstated, but \\"certain passages seem clearly to allegorise specific events. The hunting of the stag in the second canto of book one strongly suggests the pursuit of Charles I. Suggestions of this sort are undoubtedly convincing in general, even if they don't work out so well in particular.\\"Kevin Sharpe, Criticism and Compliment: The Politics of Literature in the England of Charles I, Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp.102-3 The poem adopts the view that the chivalric ideal of love represents the sublimation of desire into duty, and that this personal model of devoted love stands for the political ideal of aristocratic government by the finest and best educated of persons in society, whose sensibilities are refined by courtly life and culture. Victoria Kahn argues that the politics of love is central to Davenant's argument \\"that poetry could instill political obedience by inspiring the reader with love. Romance was not simply a powerful generic influence on Gondibert, it was also Davenant's model for the poet's relation to the reader.\\"Victoria Kahn, Wayward Contracts: The Crisis of Political Obligation in England, 1640-1674, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2004, p.144. Influence The poem introduced the \\"Gondibert stanza\\", a decasyllabic quatrain in pentameters rhyming abab. It was adopted by Waller in A panegyrick to my Lord Protector (1655) and by John Dryden in Heroic Stanzas on the Death of Oliver Cromwell and Annus Mirabilis. John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester uses it satirically in The Disabled Debauchee. According to the Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature \\"Dryden revives this measure to make his peace with the 1650s and advertise his bid to continue Davenant's Laureate project, but it would soon be wickedly parodied in Rochester's 'Disabled Debauchee'.\\"The Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature. David Loewenstein, Janel Mueller (eds) Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.823. Andrew Marvell's poem Upon Appleton House is often interpreted as a republican reply to the royalist message of Gondibert, which contrasts the fantasy world of Davenant's poem with the real domestic haven created by the retired Parliamentarian commander Thomas Fairfax. William Thompson's play Gondibert And Birtha: A Tragedy (1751) was based on the poem. Alexander Chalmers wrote of the play that \\"although it is not without individual passages of poetical beauty, it has not dramatic form and consistency to entitle it to higher praise.\\"Chalmers, Alexander, \\"Life of William Thompson\\", Works of the English Poets, London , 1819, p.4 Hannah Cowley's play Albina (1779) is much more loosely derived from it. The character of Sir Gondibert also made a brief reappearance in English literature in \\"Calidore: A Fragment,\\" an early unfinished poem by John Keats heavily influenced by Edmund Spenser. In the \\"Former Inhabitants; and Winter Visitors\\" chapter of Walden, American author and naturalist Henry David Thoreau tells a story of once being interrupted of reading Davenant's \\"Gondibert\\" by a fire that broke out in his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts. He had been working his way through Alexander Chalmers' 21-volume set, The Works of the English Poets, From Chaucer to Cowper, which he checked out of the Harvard College library. The text of \\"Gondibert\\" appears in the sixth volume.

Backlund\\" giving age of 70 as of August 14, 2019 is an American former professional wrestler with an in-ring career spanning over 30 years, best known for his tenures in the World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (WWWF/WWF, later known as World Wrestling Entertainment and currently simply known as WWE), where he is a two-time WWWF/WWF Heavyweight Champion/WWF World Heavyweight Champion (Backlund's first reign is the second-longest reign in the title history, behind Bruno Sammartino's first), as well as being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. Backlund was an accomplished amateur wrestler for the North Dakota State University Bison from the late 1960s to early 1970s. In 2000, he unsuccessfully ran for a Connecticut seat in Congress on a Republican ticket.  Early life  Backlund was born in Princeton, Minnesota, in 1949. He is a graduate of Princeton High School, where he was a state finalist in wrestling. During his freshman year while at Waldorf Junior College in Forest City, Iowa, Backlund was an All- American in both football and wrestling (, finishing third). During his sophomore campaign, Backlund focused on wrestling and once again earned All American Honors ( and national runner-up). Backlund was an amateur wrestler at North Dakota State University, winning the Division II NCAA Championship at 190 pounds in 1971. In 1972 Backlund moved up to the heavyweight class and finished fifth at the NCAA DII Nationals. He graduated from North Dakota State University with a degree in physical education.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1973−1977) = Backlund was trained for professional wrestling by renowned trainer Eddie Sharkey and made his debut for the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1973. Backlund's clean cut look and technical approach made him a natural face, and he quickly got over with the fans. After leaving the AWA, Backlund traveled the United States, working for the National Wrestling Alliance in its various territories. In 1974, Backlund wrestled in Texas, for Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk's Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion. In March, he defeated Terry Funk for the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship (the promotion's top title). Backlund held it for two months, before losing it to Karl Von Steiger in May. In mid-1975, Backlund started working for Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW). He teamed with Jerry Brisco to win the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship from Toru Tanaka and Mr. Fuji in October 1975. They held the championship belts for two months before losing to Les Thornton and Tony Charles. In 1976, Backlund left Georgia for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF, NWA Florida). Here he teamed with Steve Keirn to defeat Bob Orton, Jr. and Bob Roop for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. Backlund and Keirn lost the title to The Hollywood Blonds (Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown) in October 1976. While working for NWA Florida, Backlund also wrestled in St. Louis, Missouri, for Sam Muchnick's St. Louis Wrestling Club. He defeated Harley Race to win the NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship on April 23, 1976, and he lost the title to Jack Brisco on November 26. = World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (1976 - 1984)=  Road to the title and early successes (1976−1978)  In late 1976, Backlund joined Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation. He was managed by \\"The Golden Boy\\" Arnold Skaaland. Less than four months into his WWWF run, Backlund received his first shot at the WWWF Heavyweight Championship against Superstar Billy Graham, but he lost by countout. Through 1977, Backlund received additional title shots at the champion, and his fortunes started to change; the two went to a double countout in one match, then Backlund defeated Graham, but by countout (the title can only change hands via pinfall or submission). On February 20, 1978, at Madison Square Garden, Backlund finally scored a pinfall victory over Graham and won the title, despite Graham's leg being on the rope during the pinfall. Backlund's early challengers for the title included Spiros Arion, Mr. Fuji, Ivan Koloff, George \\"the Animal\\" Steele, and Ken Patera, and had his first high-profile title match in Japan, defending against Antonio Inoki. He also won a series of rematches against Graham, including an April 1978 steel cage match at Madison Square Garden. Three days after winning the WWWF Heavyweight Championship, Backlund clashed with the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race in a rare \\"WWWF vs. NWA\\" title match. Both titles were on the line, but neither changed hands as the two fought to a 60-minute time limit draw. Defending against other champions became a recurring theme in Backlund's run with the title. He faced the AWA World Heavyweight Champion (Nick Bockwinkel) and two NWA World Heavyweight Champions (Harley Race four times and Ric Flair once) He defeated the NWA Florida Heavyweight Champion Don Muraco. In 1982, he battled \\"International Champion\\" Billy Robinson to a 63-minute curfew draw in Montreal. Early in his run, Backlund and Peter Maivia formed a successful tag team and challenged for the WWWF World Tag Team Championship, then held by The Yukon Lumberjacks. During a television taping in October 1978, Maivia turned on and attacked him and Skaaland. In the immediate aftermath, fans for the first time got to see another side of Backlund's personality: that of a raving, ranting maniac when angered or pushed hard enough; in the post-match interview, Backlund screamed to interviewer Vince McMahon that he was going to \\"kill that son of a bitch!\\" Backlund eventually won a series of matches against Maivia, including a steel cage match in January 1979 at Madison Square Garden. In 1979, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) became the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). On November 30, 1979, NWF Heavyweight Champion Antonio Inoki defeated Backlund in Tokushima, Japan to win the WWF title. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president Hisashi Shinma declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from Tiger Jeet Singh, and Inoki remained Champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated Bobby Duncum in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 17. Inoki's reign is not recognized by WWE in its WWF/WWE title history. On August 9, 1980, Backlund teamed with Pedro Morales to capture the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Wild Samoans at Showdown at Shea. Backlund and Morales were forced to vacate the title due to a then-extant WWF rule stating that no one can hold two championships at the same time. Backlund had more tag team success when he (along with Antonio Inoki) won the \\"1980 MSG Tag Team League Tournament\\", last defeating Hulk Hogan and Stan Hansen on December 10 in Osaka, Japan. Backlund and Inoki finished the tournament with seven wins and two double-countout decisions. Also during 1980, Backlund and Hogan met in a series of highly publicized matches; although he scored several countout victories over Hogan, Backlund never was able to score a decisive victory over his charismatic young challenger, and Hogan – showing flashes of his future superstardom – proved to be one of Backlund's toughest opponents. Backlund was also able to overcome a challenge from Ken Patera, with whom he feuded on-and- off from 1978 until early 1981, including during Patera's reign as WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion.  Early 1980s: continued success  Backlund's WWF Heavyweight Championship was held up after a match in New York City against Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine on October 19, 1981, after a dazed referee \\"accidentally\\" gave the championship belt to Valentine as part of the storyline, it constituted an interruption of Backlund's title reign. However, Backlund was billed as the WWF Heavyweight Champion in other cities in the days following the controversy. In the early part of the 1980s, when no promotion held nationally televised events, it was not uncommon practice to \\"hold up\\" the title in one area (to build interest in a rematch the \\"former\\" champion would win) while ignoring the situation in other parts of the territory. On November 23, Backlund pinned Valentine for the \\"Vacant in New York Only\\" WWF Heavyweight Championship. A rematch for the title, held inside a steel cage at the Philadelphia Spectrum in January 1982, also saw Backlund emerge the winner, securing the victory when he hit a piledriver on Valentine into the mat. Even with the title being held up against Antonio Inoki and Greg Valentine, Bob Backlund is recognized by WWE as having one continuous title reign from 1978 to 1983 as WWE Champion. Backlund continued to be successful into 1982 and 1983, successfully defending against a variety of contenders, ranging from Adrian Adonis, \\"Cowboy\\" Bob Orton, Big John Studd, Ivan Koloff, Magnificent Muraco and Sgt. Slaughter. One of his most memorable encounters came in mid-1982, when he won a steel cage match against \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka; in that match, at Madison Square Garden, Snuka scaled the top of the cage, intending to perform his \\"Superfly\\" splash onto a prone Backlund to incapacitate him, but Backlund moved after Snuka began to fly through the air and went on to escape the cage. He also turned back a challenge from Superstar Billy Graham, who returned to the WWF in late 1982 wanting to reclaim the championship.  End of an era  After having been popular with the fans from early on, in the final months of his title reign, Backlund changed his image, cutting his mop hair into a crew cut, wearing amateur wrestling singlets and losing muscle mass and definition. Fans seemingly grew weary of this \\"Howdy Doody\\" character (as The Grand Wizard had dubbed him). In 1983, he was voted the Wrestling Observer Newsletter's Most Overrated Wrestler. Vince McMahon, who had bought the WWF from his father, wanted to put the title on the more charismatic and muscular Hulk Hogan. McMahon initially suggested Backlund to turn heel and lose to Hogan, but when Backlund refused, a transitional champion became necessary between Backlund and Hogan. Backlund sustained a (kayfabe) arm injury when The Iron Sheik assaulted him with his Persian clubs and on December 26, 1983, Backlund lost the title to Sheik when Backlund's manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw in the towel while Backlund was locked in the camel clutch. Due to Backlund's injury, Hogan took over Backlund's rematch and became the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. The injury was a television story only; Backlund wrestled The Iron Sheik at least three times for the title at house shows (including once at the Boston Garden, winning by disqualification), and also wrestled The Magnificent Muraco for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, also at a non-televised house show. Backlund continued to work for the WWF for a while after the title change, but did not receive another title shot for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after Hogan's victory. On August 4, 1984, Backlund defeated Salvatore Bellomo in his last WWF match for eight years. = After the WWF and semi-retirement (1984–1992) = After leaving the WWF, Backlund had a run in the short-lived Pro Wrestling USA, a joint promotion of the NWA and the AWA, meant to combat the national expansion of the WWF. In Pro Wrestling USA, Backlund unsuccessfully challenged AWA World Heavyweight Champion Rick Martel. He soon dropped out of the pro wrestling scene in 1985, but he made a surprise return in 1991 for Herb Abrams' short-lived Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). At Beach Brawl (the UWF's only pay-per-view event), he defeated Ivan Koloff. Backlund also wrestled for Newborn UWF and UWF International in Japan, in a series of matches with Nobuhiko Takada in 1988 and 1989. During his time away from the ring, he coached amateur wrestling at Bacon Academy and Rocky Hill High School in Connecticut. = Return to WWF (1992–1997, 2000) = In 1992, Backlund returned to the WWF. During his absence, the WWF had expanded into an international wrestling promotion, due in part to the colorful characters of the \\"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection Era\\", which Hulk Hogan helped to kickstart eight years prior. Backlund, whose persona remained the same as it was in his heyday, seemed to be out of step with the evolution of the WWF. Many fans did not remember him, as he had left just prior to Vince McMahon's national expansion. His initial return to the WWF was largely uneventful and he mainly wrestled mid-card matches. However, at the 1993 Royal Rumble, Backlund, the number two entrant lasted sixty-one minutes and ten seconds, a duration record that stood until 2004, when Chris Benoit broke it. Backlund's first WrestleMania appearance was at WrestleMania IX, where he was quickly pinned by Razor Ramon. Backlund also received several shots at the Intercontinental Championship, then held by Shawn Michaels. On the July 30, 1994, episode of Superstars, Backlund wrestled what was billed as an \\"Old Generation vs. New Generation\\" match with Bret Hart, with Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship on the line. Over the preceding weeks, the WWF aired vignettes of Backlund training for this match. Hart won the match, capitalizing after Backlund mistakenly believed he had won and helped Hart to his feet. Backlund \\"snapped\\" after Hart repeatedly tried to offer a sportsmanlike handshake following the match. He slapped Hart in the face and locked him in the crossface chickenwing submission hold, while screaming hysterically. After finally releasing the hold, Backlund stared at his hands in apparent shock. Backlund then started to regularly \\"snap\\" in similar fashion during his matches, viciously attacking his opponent with the crossface chickenwing and refusing to release it after the opponent submitted. He would then seemingly snap back to normal and appear horrified by what he had done. On an episode of Monday Night Raw, shortly after his match with Hart, Backlund claimed that he should still be considered the legitimate WWF World Heavyweight Champion, as he had not been pinned by The Iron Sheik, nor submitted to the camel clutch. Backlund continued wrestling under the new gimmick of an out of touch and highly volatile eccentric, out to teach \\"The New Generation\\" a lesson. He dressed in business suits (complete with a bow tie), had a hyperactive personality and used (and often misused, for comic effect) large words during his interviews. He demanded that he be addressed as Mr. Backlund, and he would only sign autographs for wrestling fans if they could recite the names of all of the United States Presidents in chronological order. On several instances, he assaulted wrestlers and other WWF employees and placed them in the crossface chickenwing. These victims include Jim Ross, Duke \\"The Dumpster\\" Droese, WWF Magazine writer Lou Gianfriddo, and his former manager Arnold Skaaland, who he blamed for costing him the WWF Heavyweight Championship in 1983. On November 23, 1994, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view in San Antonio, Texas, Backlund faced Bret Hart in a special submission match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship where the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the opponent's valet, like Arnold Skaaland did for Backlund over a decade earlier, stop the match by throwing a towel into the ring. Backlund began displaying a white towel that he claimed was the same one that was thrown into the ring the night he lost to The Iron Sheik. To serve as his second for the match, Backlund paired up with Owen Hart, the brother and chief rival of the reigning champion who had tried and failed multiple times that year to wrest the belt from Bret. Late in the match, as Backlund was locked in Hart's trademark Sharpshooter submission, Owen entered the ring and attacked Bret from behind to cause him to break the hold. Bret's cornerman for the match, Davey Boy Smith, chased Owen around the ring only to collide head first with the ring stairs. When Bret turned around to argue with his brother, Backlund took advantage and locked the crossface chickenwing on the champion. Hart fought the hold for an unprecedented eight-and-a-half minutes, but refused to give up. Since Smith was unconscious on the floor, he was unable to save Hart. Owen took advantage by picking up the pink and black towel Smith carried and, feigning concern for the well being of his brother, approached his father Stu and his mother Helen who were seated at ringside. As Backlund continued to cinch in the crossface chickenwing in the ring, Owen pleaded for his parents to stop the match. Stu refused, not trusting Owen's motives. Helen, however, did not want to see Bret risk further injury and she grabbed the towel and threw it into the ring. Backlund was awarded the championship and celebrated in the ring while Owen rejoiced in finally having cost his brother the championship. After the match, Backlund conducted a brief interview which he concluded by screaming how he felt \\"like God\\". Backlund's second reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion was brief, as he lost the title three days later to Diesel at a non-televised show in Madison Square Garden, the site of many of Backlund's victories in the 1970s and 1980s. Diesel kicked Backlund in the stomach, hit him with a Jackknife Powerbomb and pinned him in eight seconds. For weeks afterwards, fans jeered Backlund with chants of \\"Eight seconds! Eight seconds!\\". In a 2005 interview for the Pro Wrestling Torch, Kevin Nash (a.k.a. Diesel) recalled how Backlund sold his Jackknife Powerbomb by crawling up the aisleway, back to the dressing room area of the Garden. Nash said, \\"He couldn't have put me over any stronger\\". This match was the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship changed hands at a non- televised event, and aside from Money in the Bank cash-ins, this match remains the shortest WWF title match ever; in fact, it would be tied by Randy Orton cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on Daniel Bryan at the 2013 SummerSlam. After the title loss, Backlund wrestled progressively less often, never again reaching main event status. One of his final WWF matches was an \\"I Quit\\" match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania XI on April 2, 1995 which Backlund lost, even though he never actually said \\"I quit\\", instead screaming unintelligibly into the microphone, which special guest referee Roddy Piper seemed to interpret as \\"I quit\\". Following WrestleMania, the WWF ran an angle in which Backlund declared his candidacy for President of the United States. Several vignettes aired, featuring Backlund preaching socially conservative values, and one showed him campaigning at a beach. Backlund also confronted a Bill Clinton impersonator who was seated at ringside at the 1995 Survivor Series. This angle was quietly dropped before it reached a conclusion. From 1995 to 1996, Backlund went to mid to low card status. He lost to Bret Hart by disqualification on Monday Night Raw on November 21. That would be his last TV appearance. He continued to appear in house shows. He lost to Savio Vega in a dark match at In Your House 5 and competed in the Royal Rumble getting eliminated by Yokozuna. This would be his last Pay-Per-View appearance. His last match was a lost to Savio Vega on May 19 at Madison Square Garden. From late 1996 to early 1997, Backlund joined forces with his old nemesis, The Iron Sheik, to manage The Sultan in the WWF. He left the WWF shortly after In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker on April 20, where he managed The Sultan in his win over Flash Funk. Backlund in September 1998 In 1999, Backlund appeared on an episode of Sunday Night Heat in a skit in which himself, The Iron Sheik, and Dominic Denucci gave comedic advice to Mankind before his WWF Championship match with The Rock. Backlund returned to the WWF in the 2000 Royal Rumble. After that, he briefly managed Intercontinental and European Champion Kurt Angle, and he taught his crossface chickenwing submission hold to Angle. Later on, Angle fired Backlund and locked him in that move, after discovering Backlund had booked him in a two-fall triple threat match against Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho (with both of his titles on the line) at WrestleMania 2000, where he ultimately lost both titles. Backlund teamed with Angle on SmackDown as they lost to Jericho and Tazz by disqualification on March 14. = Japan and Independent circuit (1994-2001) = In 1994, Backlund while under contract with WWF worked for Genichiro Tenryu's Wrestle Association R in Japan. He won the WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship with Scott Putski and former WWF wrestler The Warlord defeating Fuyuki-Gun members Hiromichi Fuyuki, Gedo and Jado on August 26. They dropped the titles back to Fuyuki, Gedo, and Jado a few days later. In 1995, while still working for the WWF, Backlund started wrestling on the independent circuit. He mainly wrestled for Windy City Wrestling from 1995-1998. He lost to Jimmy Snuka on February 27, 1996 at Trans World Wrestling Federation event. After leaving WWF in 1997, Backlund continued in the indies. On November 11, 1998 he lost to Lance Diamond at NWA New Jersey event. From 1998 to 1999, he wrestled for Battlarts in Japan. In October 2001 he returned to New Japan Pro Wrestling teaming with Tatsumi Fujinami for a few matches. He once again retired from wrestling. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007) = After many references to Bob Backlund were made by Kevin Nash, he officially debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in January 2007, at the Final Resolution pay-per-view, judging the finals of the Paparazzi Championship Series (PCS) between Alex Shelley and Austin Starr. Given the tie breaking vote, Backlund launched a long explanation before declaring his decision a draw, and the match was restarted by PCS director Kevin Nash. After Shelley won the match, Starr pie-faced Backlund because he believed Backlund had cost him the match, at which Backlund responded by putting Starr in the crossface chickenwing. At Against All Odds after Senshi defeated Austin Starr, Backlund came out and put his own chickenwing on Starr before dragging him to the back. Backlund then began to make regular appearances on Impact!. During this time, he was described as crazy and weird by commentators Don West and Mike Tenay, somewhat similar to the \\"Mr. Backlund\\" gimmick of his second WWF tenure. At Destination X, Backlund was in the corner of Austin Starr who lost to Senshi in a Crossface Chickenwing match. At Lockdown, Backlund was the special guest referee in a Six Sides of Steel match where Senshi defeated Austin Starr. Backlund made his in-ring return at Slammiversary, where he defeated Alex Shelley. He then teamed with Jerry Lynn to lose to Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin (managed by Kevin Nash) at Victory Road. When TNA redesigned their website, Backlund's profile was removed, signaling the end of his run with the company. = Second return to WWE (2007–2017) = On the 15th Anniversary episode of Raw on December 10, 2007, Backlund participated in the 15th Anniversary battle royal, along with 14 other wrestlers from Raw's 15-year history. Backlund was eliminated from the match by Skinner. On the July 9, 2012, episode of Raw, after Heath Slater's match with Sin Cara, Slater issued a challenge to any \\"past champion\\" as part of a weekly series of Legend appearances. Backlund emerged from backstage to answer this challenge and, as Backlund entertained the crowd, Slater kicked him in the stomach and mocked him; Backlund responded by putting Slater in the crossface chickenwing, which he refused to break for 20 seconds after Slater had tapped out. He later appeared on Raw 1000 with all of the other Legends who had faced Slater over prior weeks, helping Lita chase Slater back into the ring when he tried to run away from Lita and the APA.

John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg615 Y Cymro was founded in Wrexham, and succeeded other newspapers of the same name that had existed during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is the only Welsh language national newspaper for Wales and was previously published weekly. In 2017, the owners and publishers, Tindle Newspapers Group announced that they would stop publishing the paper and that they were looking for new owners to publish the paper. In March 2018, after negotiations between the two companies, new owners Cyfryngau Cymru Cyf started publishing Y Cymro as a monthly newspaper. The new company also set up a new Y Cymro website. Earlier newspaper of the same name The first newspaper under the name Y Cymro was published in 1845; this was ecclesiastical in nature with a small quantity of English-language content. This newspaper was published in Bangor by the printer Edward Williams, but it closed two years later due to financial difficulties. It was based in London for a year, with John Ames (Ioan Meirion) as editor. It moved to Holywell between 1851 and 1860, published by William Morris, then to Denbigh for six years. After a gap of four years, it was restarted by Isaac Clarke of Liverpool, formerly of \\"Granny's Shop\\", Ruthin, on 22 May 1890 under the editorship of Isaac Foulkes (\\"Bookworm\\"). During this period, Daniel Owen published chapters of his novel in the paper. In 1907 the paper moved to Mold with the poet T. Gwynn Jones as editor, but it closed again between 1909 and 1914 before finding a home in Dolgellau. This was a religiously themed newspaper with editor Evan Williams Evans; it closed in 1931.Gweler 'Rhwydwaith Archifau Cymru' It was relaunched in Dolgellau in 1920 by William Evans. Modern history Y Cymro, 1954 St David's Day edition Y Cymro was relaunched in Wrexham in 1932, when the title was purchased by Rowland Williams of Woodall, Minshall, Thomas & Co., Oswestry (the owners of Hughes & Son publishers of Wrexham). Although he did not speak Welsh, Thomas' dream was to establish a new Welsh language newspaper. The first number was published on 4 December 1932, with John Eilian as editor. The paper was not entirely successful to begin with, but by 1939 there was some hope of making a profit. The office moved to Oswestry, where the paper went from strength to strength under the editorship of John Roberts Williams. The paper moved again to Mold when it became part of the company Papurau Newydd Gogledd Cymru (\\"North Wales Newspapers\\").Y Cymro, 5 January 2007 In 1945, John Roberts Williams became editor. Williams re-employed Geoff Charles as a photographer and he built up an archive whilst working for the paper which is now in the National Library of Wales. Williams' 17 years in the post saw the paper increase its circulation to a peak of 28,000 and introduced a new, more \\"professional\\" journalistic style.Obituary: John Roberts Williams, The Independent, 30 October 2004 In 2004 it was sold by North Wales Newspapers to entrepreneur Sir Ray Tindle. Before that, the publication day was Saturday. As of 2003, circulation was about 4,100 printed copies. , Mercator Media, 2006 In 2003 a digital version was published, which was available via the NewsStand company. Then in 2004, the paper was purchased by the Cambrian News, part of the Tindle newspaper group, and the office moved to Porthmadog. The paper was relaunched in a new form in November 2004. A new website was launched in 2011, with a selection of stories from the paper and a full digital version by subscription. In April 2010, the weekly editions of Y Cymro became available to view as an on-line digital newspaper. In March 2017 Tindle Newspapers announced that the paper was for sale and would cease publication in June if no buyer was found. The publishers Y Lolfa stated that they were not in a position to buy it. By June, four groups had expressed interest in buying the paper, although negotiations continued between them and Tindle and the Welsh Books Council. Thus it was expected that the 30 June edition [would be] the last to be published for the time being. In June 2017, the owners of Y Cymro could not find a buyer, and the paper closed along with its website. In November 2017 it was announced that a campaign group had received funding from the Welsh Books Council to assist a relaunch of Y Cymro as a monthly newspaper which was launched by Cyfryngau Cymru Cyf in March 2018.

Mark Achler joined the company in 1994 to serve as president. Along with Director of Technology, Andrew Glaister, Sills developed the concept which became known as Exodus, a video-game development environment for Windows 95. Andrew Glaister took this concept and developed it. Exodus caught the attention of IBM, Intel, Sega, and Microsoft. Microsoft then used the basic concepts and their relationship with Kinesoft to develop a new set of technologies called DirectX which now forms the basis of all gaming under Windows. Subsequently, Kinesoft's port of Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure was the first commercial game release for Windows 95 and was touted by Bill Gates at that year's COMDEX tradeshow as the launch of the new DirectX technologies for Windows 95, but the game itself does not use DirectX technology. Other Exodus platform games included Windows ports of Earthworm Jim and Gex. In 1995-05-25, Kinesoft and Softbank entered into the \\"Game Porting Agreement\\". Under the terms of that agreement, Softbank was to provide Kinesoft with a certain number of console games to be \\"ported\\" to a PC platform; the \\"porting\\" involves translating pre-existing video games from the console platform to the personal computer platform. The games were to be published by GAMEBANK Corporation, a joint venture company established by SoftBank and Microsoft to bring console titles to Windows 95 for the Japanese marketplace by using its unique talents and tool-sets to convert existing Sega Genesis titles. In the US, some of these ports were published by Interplay. These ports were later expanded to include Nintendo and some early Sony PlayStation titles as well. In 1999-11-17, Kinesoft Development filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division against its SoftBank Holdings Inc. and SoftBank Corporation for breach of SoftBank's obligations under a previous settlement agreement,Kinesoft Sues SoftBank for \\"Breach of Obligations\\" Under Previous Settlement Agreement which alleged violation of the 1997 Agreement where Softbank was required to pay $10 million between 1997-06-12 and 1998-10-01, which had been made after Kinesoft had sued Softbank for breach of the Game Porting Agreement, which Softbank had admitted that it had not provided Kinesoft with the agreed upon number of games that had led to the 1997 Agreement where Kinesoft released all claims against Softbank Corporation under the Game Porting Agreement. KINESOFT DEVELOPMENT CORP. v. SOFTBANK HOLDINGSNo. 99 C 7428. - 139 F.Supp.2d 869 (2001) KINESOFT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, Plaintiff, v. SOFTBANK HOLDINGS INC. and Ronald D. Fisher, Defendants. The case was to go forward in a trial set in 2001-06-01.Court date set in Kinesoft case Eventually it dissolved soon after the trial in 2001. Products In addition to games development, Kinesoft also released WinCD, a software CD player, and the film It's a Wonderful Life on CD-ROM for Windows 3.1.
