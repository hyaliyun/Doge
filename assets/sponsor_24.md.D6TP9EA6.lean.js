Venture capital in Poland is a segment of the private equity market that finances early-stage high-risk companies based in Poland, with the potential for fast growth. As of March 2019, there is a total of 130 active VC firms in Poland, including local offices of international VC firms, and VC firms with mainly Polish management teams. Between 2009–2019, these entities have invested locally in over 750 companies, which gives an average of around 9 companies per portfolio. The Polish venture market accounts for 3% of the entire European ecosystem of VC investments, mainly in the digital space. Since 2016, the institutions of an Alternative Investment Company, and a Closed-End Investment Fund have been established for entities implementing investments in enterprises in the seed or startup phase. In 2018, venture capital funds invested in Polish startups (0.033% of GDP). According to Startup Poland, as of March 2019, total assets managed by VC companies operating in Poland are estimated at . The total value of investments of the Polish VC market is worth .  History of VC funds in Poland  = Early 90s = As a form of financing enterprises, first venture capital funds appeared in Poland at the beginning of the 1990s. As Polish terminology lacks an adequate equivalent for the concept of venture capital, the English version is widely used, next to the terms “speculative capital”, and “capital engaged in risky transactions,” to determine this form of financing. First capital investors appeared on the Polish market as funds financed from public aid funds, with the mission of developing the private sector (e.g. the Polish-American Entrepreneurship Fund, with capital of ), or private funds (e.g. Invesco). In 1990, the investment activity was also undertaken by the Danish Fund for Central and Eastern Europe, which would support investments in Poland using government capital. In 1991, the Society for Social and Economic Initiatives started its activities, and in 1992 further key institutions including the Care Small Business Assistance Corporation, the Cooperation Fund, the Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In the second half of the 1990s, there was an increase in interest from investors. In 1992, the Polish Private Equity Fund I and II () began operations, and in 1994, the Poland Partners fund () have also appeared on the market, along with the Poland Investment Fund (with the participation of EBRD and IFC), the Renaissance Capital, the White Eagle Industries, the Poland Growth Fund, and the National Investment Funds, created from the universal privatization program. The first attempts of private entities with venture capital on the Polish market were made by Roman Kluska, creator of the Polish tech precursor Optimus, whose shares were sold to Zbigniew Jakubas and BRE Bank in April 2000 for PLN 261M (today's ). Kluska would take high investment risk investing his own stock money in promising technological projects. In addition to the manufacturing of computers, cash registers, and developing integration systems, Optimus Pascal, the founder of today's major Polish news portal Onet, was established. And during the same period, Tomasz Czechowicz, the founder of personal computer producer JTT Computer, introduced the first Polish venture capital fund MCI Management. In November 2000, the fund began trade on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2000, around 102 investments worth over PLN 800M () were completed (supplying 92 companies), with telecommunications and media being the most popular industries (46% of investments). In 2002, VC funds invested PLN 529M () in Poland, which was a 37% yearly growth, by both locally based funds (PLN 422M, ), and foreign fund management companies (PLN 107M, ). In 2002, investments of VC funds were mainly focused on FMCG companies (35% of investments). In 2003, the number of companies covered by investments decreased to 48, while VC investments increased significantly and amounted to PLN 779M (), while the market was considerably interested in the telecommunications, media, and financial services sectors. = Currently = Since 2014, the National Center for Research and Development () has been implementing the subsidy-and-investment instrument BRIdge Alfa, financed from the European Regional Development Fund, under the Intelligent Development Operational Program 2014–2020. The aim of the BRIdge Alfa is to increase the innovativeness of the Polish economy by strengthening the synergy between entrepreneurs and scientists. Since 2017, the National Centre for Research and Development, has signed contracts under the subsidy and investment instrument Bridge Alfa with 33 firms that conduct venture transactions, and in 2018 another state agency, the Polish Development Fund () signed additional 26. According to the March 2019 report by Startup Poland, the total assets under management in VC firms active in Poland estimates at . With average assets under management at . Over half of the firms declared that their fundraising was ongoing. The research was based on the self-report of 70 VC firms, including extrapolated and publicly available data.  Legal basis  Until 2016, operating in Poland as a private equity and venture capital fund that implements investment projects among enterprises in the seed or startup phase was associated with small formal and legal, or capital requirements. Most frequently, PE/VC funds were small, simple limited liability companies or partnerships in which people with capital were willing to co-finance and then gain from prospective projects of young entrepreneurs. The Polish law did not provide for additional requirements for such entities over those resulting from the provisions of the commercial law. The situation changed on June 4, 2016, when as a result of the implementation of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive into Polish law, greater fortifications were introduced by appointing two new financial institutions, supervised by Poland's Financial Supervision Authority (, KNF). = Alternative investment company = It is a collective investment institution, legally available in Poland since 2016, other than specialized open-end and closed-end investment funds. AICs () may be carried out in the form of a limited company (joint- stock or limited liability company), and a limited partnership or limited joint-stock partnership. An AIC's activity requires an authorization or entry into the register kept by the KNF, which entails a number of capital, infrastructure or personal requirements. That is why it is intended for large asset managers over . In January 2019, due to the high costs of running a closed-end investment fund and numerous statutory regulations that restricted VC investors, AICs were exempted from double taxation. Revenues obtained from the sale of shares were exempt from corporate income tax, with the condition that they held 10 percent of shares in the company for two years. = Closed investment fund = Registering an AIC involves lower operating costs. However, an alternative to larger entities is establishing of own closed investment fund (), which can be created only by a selected licensed investment fund company, responsible for the quality of asset management and cooperation with third parties. CIFs have a wide range of investment opportunities (including asset placement in shares of non-public companies), which is associated with a greater limitation of participation in the fund. Due to the high investment risk, the CIF offer is addressed mainly to experienced investors—financial institutions and entrepreneurs aware of investment goals and risks. The amount of entry for natural persons is regulated in the act, at the level of .  Characteristic of Polish VC  Venture capital firms in Poland typically fall into one of three types: standard commonly defined VC firms, public-private partnerships, including VC firms set up with grants or other capital instruments from state agencies, and family office-led firms, with high-net-worth individuals as a majority LP. = Market size = 130 venture capital funds currently operate in Poland, 40 per cent more than in 2017, and the number is still growing. The estimated total volume of all venture capital investments in Poland in 2016 was . In 2017, it dropped to , and in 2018 venture capital funds invested in Polish start-ups (0.033 percent of GDP), which is 0.847% of 2018's value of the VC market in Europe, amounting to . As of March 2019, the total value of the investment of the Polish VC market is already worth . In the first quarter of 2019, Polish startups carried out 21 transactions for a total amount of PLN 103.3M (). VC funds in Poland manage assets of , which gives an average of per fund. However, the funds above this amount have only 23% of funds. However, in recent years, the Polish industry has focused the most on obtaining state funds for innovation. Since 2017, 59 contracts with funds have been signed as part of the Bridge Alfa program of the National Center for Research and Development and the Polish Development Fund. However, the Polish VC industry is slowly becoming independent from state and EU funds. For the first time, there were funds that carried out the second or third round of financing, but without the participation of state funds. Still, however, 52 percent. funds available on the market comes from the state. In addition, 56 percent Polish VCs are debutantes in the industry, mostly using government support. = Cooperation of Polish startups and investors = Venture capital is an example of the so-called smart money, a form of investment that apart from capital also includes mentoring and consulting. An investor paying to become a shareholder of the enterprise, supports it with his knowledge and experience, and helps it develop, which itself is sometimes much more desirable than financing itself. According to the Startup Poland study, aside from the help in the preparation of subsequent funding rounds, startups most often need the investors to introduce them to industry contacts and business mentoring. However, due to the inexperience of fund managers in the most important areas for startups, the offer of Polish investors is far from expected. The funds’ competences, both in terms of assistance in obtaining new investors, and opening contacts in the industry, are derivatives of a dense network of contacts and a solid reputation. A workable strategy for building smart money capital can be specialization in specific sectors. The more companies in a given industry pass through the fund's portfolio, the more experience and industry relationships the manager will be able to acquire. Investors in Poland enable startups to network with other companies in their portfolios. The average portfolio of a Polish venture investor is only 9 companies, so it's not an added value of a large scale, but very much appreciated by local startups. = New funds = In 2018, new VC initiatives were introduced in Poland, including TDJ Pitango Ventures, a joint initiative of the Polish family enterprise TDJ and the Israeli fund Pitango; Manta Ray VC created by Sebastian Kulczyk; and Fidiasz led by Krzysztof Domarecki. Other new funds were capitalized by the European Investment Fund, including Market One Capital and Innovation Nest. The third group are international funds that have not invested in the early stages, so far: the Dutch fund Finch Capital (supported by the Polish Development Fund), which invests throughout Europe, and the Austrian fund Speedinvest. Further funds were created ready to support companies at later stages, including Inovo Venture Partners and Cogito Capital, as well as many smaller funds created with the help of the PFR. Subsequent funds of this type are just being created. In March 2019, Sunfish Partners launched its PLN 65M (€15M) venture capital fund to invest in Polish deep tech startups. PFR Ventures is among the Limited Partners of Sunfish Partners. In May 2019, the creators of the Polish pre-accelerate program ReactorX, launched the fund SMOK Ventures, with the support of American entrepreneurs and PFR Ventures (80 percent of capital). The fund for investment in seed rounds will allocate PLN 46M ().  State agencies and funds of funds  = Origin of capital = Prior to 2018, approximately 81% of investment transactions in Poland over the last decade have had some public capital involved, including the National Capital Fund, the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development, the National Center for Research and Development, and European Union funds. Only less than one fifth of investments financing Polish startups took place completely with no public support. Financing in these cases usually amounted to PLN 0.5–1M (). According to the 2019 report by Startup Poland, 52% of all the venture capital available on the Polish market today, around , is capital raised from public sources, Polish state agencies or the European Investment Fund. And around in VC funds in Poland was invested by private Polish LPs. Non-Polish LPs have invested only around , while fund managers themselves typically contribute 4% of the fund size. = The National Capital Fund = The NCF (, KFK) was created by the Polish government in 2005. Until January 2017, it managed from the targeted subsidy of the former Ministry of Economy, the EU Structural Funds (Operational Program \\"Innovative Economy\\") and until December 2017, from the Swiss-Polish Cooperation Program. As a fund of funds, the NCF itself had invested in VC funds which financed the development of companies seeking capital for their innovative projects. In an open competition of offers, it had selected micro, small and medium enterprises based in Poland, with particular emphasis on entrepreneurs who conducted research and development activities. In 2017, funds from the National Capital Fund were included in 37% of rounds of transactions examined by Startup Poland. The result of NCF support is as much as half of the previous rounds over PLN 1M. = The Polish Agency for Enterprise Development = The Agency (, PARP) is involved in the implementation of domestic and international projects, financed from the structural funds, the state budget, and long-term programs of the European Commission. It participates in the creation and effective implementation of state policy in the field of entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability of personnel, seeking to transform into a key institution responsible for creating an environment that supports entrepreneurs. The Agency's capital was involved in nearly a quarter of transactions concerning Polish startups. Since 2007, the Agency has invested PLN 890M () in Polish startups. The first public VC support program launched by PARP was the financial perspective of EU funds, in which 6 VC early stage funds received a total of PLN 56.5M () in 2007–2008. However, in 2008–2015, as part of the Operational Program \\"Innovative Economy\\", for a pre- incubation and recapitalization of over 1,200 startups, a total of more than PLN 830M was allocated at the earliest stages of development. PARP specializes in rounds of up to PLN 1M (). = The National Center for Research and Development = Established in 2007 as an executive agency of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Center (, NCBR) supports risky investments through three major venture capital projects: BRIdge Alfa, NCBR CVC and TDJ Pitango Venture fund, through which the Center creates an ecosystem of developing high-tech ideas. It insures bold decisions of investors, in the BRIdge Alfa program at the level of 80% of investments, and through the exchange of experience, it educates professional management teams. Since its inception, the National Center for Research and Development has spent almost PLN 250M on venture development, which is less than a tenth of the funds planned by the Center to stimulate the development of the VC market. Every tenth examined in the Startup Poland report, the investment was leveraged with funds from the NCBR. = The Polish Development Fund = Operating since 2016, the Fund (, PFR) deals with subsidizing innovation and stimulating venture investments. Through PFR Ventures, under the fund-of-funds formula, it offers repayable financing to innovative companies from the SME sector through financial intermediaries: VC funds or business angels. PFR Ventures manages five funds: PFR Starter, PFR Biznest, PFR Open Innovations (OI), PFR KOFFI and PFR NCBR CVC. The offer of each of them is dedicated to companies at various stages of development: from the pre-seed stage to the growth and expansion phase, and provides for a different amount of financing.

He currently lives in Paris.  Biography  Venetian photographer and architect by training, Antonio Martinelli graduated from Università Iuav di Venezia (Istituto Universitario di Architettura Venezia). Established in Paris since the late 1980s, he has earned an international reputation for his long and extensive photographic experience in the fields of architecture and heritage. From an early age he frequented the Venice Circolo Fotografico La Gondola. During his Venetian years, he became friend with Hugo Pratt for whom he made the introductory photographs of the book: Corto Maltese - Fable de Venise. In 1979, Domus magazine commissioned to the photographer a report on the construction and installation of the Teatro del Mondo in Venice, a work by architect Aldo Rossi sponsored by the Venice Biennale.(http://www.abitare.it/it/architettura/2012/06/29/aldo-rossi- teatri/?refresh_ce-cp Antonio Martinelli followed the evolution of the work, from the laying of the structure's first pole on the barge to the introduction into the waters of the Teatro, through to the maiden voyage in the mist of the Venetian lagoon towards the Punta della Dogana, at the entrance of the Grand Canal. After that, he accompanied the Teatro on his journey to the Adriatic Sea until Dubrovnik. The collaboration with Domus and the Biennale opened for Martinelli the doors of the Venice Arsenal, for a work documenting the first exhibition of the Venice Biennale of Architecture: La Strada Novissima, installed in 1980 in the long Corderie building. The first photographer to have documented the Arsenal interiors, he continued this exploration for the book of Giorgio Bellavitis L’Arsenale di Venezia Storia di una grande struttura urbana (Marsilio Edition, 1983). His friendship with Aldo Rossi and other renowned architects and historians, among which Francesco Dal Co, Manfredo Tafuri, Mario Botta, Jean-Louis Cohen, Claude Vasconi, Henri Gaudin, Massimiliano Fuksas and Peter Zumthor, led to other collaborations and projects on Venice, Italy, France and Japan. In 1972, Martinelli set out to discover the Indian subcontinent. This trip marked the beginning of a long and passionate frequentation of India that will lead to multiple photographic projects for many publications and exhibitions throughout Europe, in New York and in India. The photographer's interest for architecture and landscapes also led him to work for the Italian Touring Club and the publisher Franco Maria Ricci (FMR and AD Architectural Digest). From 1980, he began his collaboration with Japanese architecture magazine A + U Architecture & Urbanism, for which he carried out numerous reports and monographs on global architecture. = 1995-2005: The Daniell/Martinelli Project = Between 1995 and 2005, Antonio Martinelli worked on the Daniell/Martinelli project under the patronage of UNESCO. The project and its related exhibitions led to books published internationally under the names: Oriental Scenery: Yesterday & Today; Travels to India, Yesterday and Today; and Passaggi in India: Ieri e Oggi. After reading Mildred Archer's Early Views India, Antonio Martinelli discovers the artistic work and adventures of English artists Thomas and William Daniell (respectively uncle and nephew), who began at the end of the 19th century a trip through the Indian subcontinent. During their travels they produced many drawings and watercolors (of cities, palaces, fortresses, temples and Indian natural wonders), helped by a camera . Upon their return to England they created, from their drawings, a long series of aquatints. These were published in six volumes (for a total of 144 aquatints) under the title Oriental Scenery. From the end of 1995 and after extensive research work, Antonio Martinelli undertook to follow the same route as the Daniell through four trips to India. Thanks to the Daniell diaries, he identified with certainty the places visited by the two artists two hundred years before. He then positioned his camera in the same place where the artists had installed their own camera obscura, so as to obtain the same point of view and be able to show next to each other the old views and contemporary photos. The extraordinary results led to the publication of books in France, UK and India,6https://www.amazon.co.uk/India-Yesterday-Today-Thomas- Daniell/dp/18403707181840370718https://www.jaypore.com/oriental-scenery-two- hundred-years-of-indias-artistic-architectural-heritage-by-antonio-martinelli- george-michell-paper-p9764 and to several exhibitions: Victoria Memorial Hall in Calcutta in 2000, Paris in 2005, and Rome and New Delhi in 2011. = 2010-2011: The Lucknow Project = Between 2010 and 2011, in the wake of his previous work based on the Daniell engravings, he suggested to the Paris Guimet Museum a similar project for an exhibition called \\"Lucknow at the Mirror of Time\\" about the mythical city of Lucknow, in the North of India.

The Anthology is an online work in progress in the English language. The platform offers the editors the opportunity to update, refine and expand introductory texts and to gradually extend it to areas of law not yet covered. Purpose and goals of the Anthology  The Anthology of Swiss legal culture brings together a collection of seminal texts made available either in the original language or in English translation and to link them to an introduction and a biography of the author in English. The very purpose of the project is to make these texts available online to a wider community of interested legal and other scholars and practicing lawyers. Swiss law is mainly dealt with in German, French and Italian, and much of it thus remains inaccessible to the world at large. Many do not have access to the rich legal tradition of federalist Switzerland and its legal institutions strongly embedded in the continental European tradition, but also with its succinct institutions rooted in direct democracy and a long standing communitarian tradition of decentralised powers. The collection will facilitate access for all persons taking an interest in Switzerland and the legal culture and particularities of the legal traditions of the country beyond black letter law and court rulings. It is thus also of interest in particular to historians and political scientists. The collection offers insights into contributions written by Swiss authors on various aspects of general legal developments. This angle is predominant up to World War II as there was a remarkable influence on the foundations of public international law at that time originating in Switzerland and Geneva in particular. The first multilingual federacy and democracy largely modelled upon the US Constitution and given its geographical location in the middle of Europe, Switzerland was strongly exposed to international relations and was able to develop an active role in the early days of the Republic, offering a model for European integration. At the same time, Switzerland has been exposed to foreign legal cultures, in particular German, French and Italian ones, based upon shared principles rooted of Roman law, which have had a strong influence on Swiss law and legal culture. Subsequently, in particular after World War II, foreign influences on Swiss law increased. The collection thus offers insights into the reception of developments and trends originating abroad, both in Europe and in the United States in the process of Europeanization and Globalization. It has a predominant angle in post-World War II developments. It informs a majority of texts.  Basic structure of the Anthology  The Anthology is conceived in a manner that allows scholars, students and lawyers to easily find relevant texts, a concise background and interlinked information on the authors. Introductory texts facilitate access and understanding, and summaries are available for the readers not familiar with the full text which is attached as a PDF.  Initiators of the project and partnership cooperation  The initiators, Dr Thomas Cottier, emeritus professor of law, LL.M, attorney-at-law, senior research fellow, World Trade Institute, University of Berne, adjunct professor of law, University of Ottawa, and Dr Jens Drolshammer, emeritus professor of law, MCL, attorney- at law, University of St. Gallen, and faculty associate, Berkman Klein Center for internet & society Harvard University, initiated the project „The Anthology of Swiss Legal Culture” in 2008. They subsequently initiated the association „LEGALANTHOLOGY.CH” together with a small group of colleagues in October 2015 in support of the project. The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society Harvard University, with support from the Harvard Law School Library, has developed a Web-based platform H2O for creating, editing, organizing, consuming, and sharing course materials. Some clusters of the Anthology are part onto the H2O platform.  The association – LEGALANTHOLOGY.CH  The association is a non-profit organization (scientific research and communications project) located in Zurich. Its aims are the exploration and presentation of the global dissemination and continuing internationalization of Swiss legal culture with particular emphasis on the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. The association aims to promote interest in the influence and significance of the internationalization and globalization of Swiss law and Swiss legal culture by means of its online open source collection website and a new series of English language publications. Furthermore, it aims to emphasize how Swiss law, Swiss legal process and Swiss legal culture meet longstanding challenges in an international context.

This is the first page of its very first issue in 1906, showing an advertisement for the Ulster Literary Theatre's production of plays by Mayne and Purcell (Parkhill). Ulster Minor Hall was another name for St Mary's Minor Hall. This copy is in the collection of the Ulster Museum. The Ulster Literary Theatre was a theatre company in Ulster (Ireland, now also Northern Ireland) from 1904 to 1934. It had a differently named precursor in 1902, and by 1915 it was named just the Ulster Theatre. It was founded by Bulmer Hobson and David Parkhill with patronage from Francis Joseph Bigger, who was also its first president.  History  = Precursor: The Ulster Branch of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1902 = Originally, Hobson and Parkhill envisaged an \\"Ulster branch\\" of W. B. Yeats' Irish Literary Theatre in Dublin, the pair having travelled to Dublin to see it in early 1902. They put on two plays as the \\"Ulster branch\\" in 1902 in St Mary's Minor Hall in Ulster. Yeats was not involved in these productions, nor (according to Hobson) gave them any encouragement; and the involvement of the Irish Literary Theatre was largely limited to two of its performers, Dudley Diggs and Maire T. Quinn, travelling from Dublin to perform in Yeats' Cathleen ni Houlihan and James Cousins' The Racing Lug. Hobson and Parkhill actually put on Yeats' play without direct permission from Yeats, instead obtaining it from Maud Gonne who assured them that \\"He wrote that play for me and he gave it to me. It is mine and you can put it on whenever you want to.\\" The lack of encouragement from Yeats, according to anecdote, caused Hobson to remark upon the return journey from Dublin to Belfast after having visited him \\"Damn Yeats! We'll write our own plays!\\". This first production did not translate well to Ulster audiences, and the original plan of an eventual federation across the country linked back to the Irish Literary Theatre, failed. Gerald McNamara, later a playwright for the theatre, observed in particular about the central character of Yeats' play that \\"Ninety-nine percent of the population had never heard of the lady – and cared less.\\". There were, moreover, complaints from the secretary of the Irish Literary Theatre, George Roberts, about the unauthorized use of its name, accompanied by requests for royalties to be paid on Yeats' play. = Foundation in 1904 = So Hobson and Parkhill founded the Ulster Literary Theatre in 1904, with plays from others including several by Parkhill, who wrote under the pseudonym Lewis Purcell, and with the goal of having its own distinct identity rather than being an offshoot of the Irish Literary Theatre. The Irish News described the goal of art that was \\"neither Dublin nor Munster nor English in its character and essentials, but Ulster in heart and soul\\". Hobson was later to describe their goal as that of \\"writing and producing distinctively Ulster plays, which would be a commentary on the political and social conditions in the North of Ireland\\". Their 1904 production included George Russell's Deirdre at first, and towards the end of the year Hobson's Brian of Banba and Parkhill's/Purcell's The Reformers. The first issue of the theatre's journal Uladh (the word for Ulster in Irish, in the genitive), financed by Bigger, was published the same year. = Later = Later plays included Gerald McNamara's The Mist that Does Be on the Bog, first performed in 1909, and Rutherford Mayne's The Drone, first performed in 1908 and a staple of the company thereafter. The Drone and McNamara's Thompson in Tir-na- nOg were to prove widely popular with audiences. The latter resonated with Ulster audiences because of its use of language and cultural references that were specific to Ulster and current events of the time. Parkhill's/Purcell' further plays included The Enthusiast (1905), The Pagan (1906), and Suzanne and the Sovereigns (1907 in collaboration with McNamara). McNamara's further plays included The Throwbacks (1917), No Surrender (1928), and Who Fears to Speak (1929). In all, over the course of its lifetime the Theatre produced 47 original plays. Reflecting Hobson's originally stated goal, most of these were satirical in nature (some straight political satire, others satirical comedies), and only six were mythological. By 1909 the company gained a permanent home in the Grand Opera House in Belfast, and by 1915 the company was simply named the Ulster Theatre. Uladh did not last long. Financial difficulties caused the closure of the whole Theatre in 1934.

Fiberworks Entry  Overview  Founded in 1973 by Hungarian-born artist Gyöngy Laky, Fiberworks included a wide range of contemporary and experimental approaches based in the textile arts medium. The Fiberworks gallery showcased textile art in the early 1970s, a time when most other commercial galleries and museums gave textile medium scant exposure. Foremost was the year-round Community School, the Special Studies program and the Bachelor and Master of Fine Arts accredited programs in conjunction with Lone Mountain College of San Francisco. Many of the school's faculty, lecturers, exhibitors and students were, or would go on to become, influential leaders in the arts including Joanne Segal Brandford, Lia Cook, Mildred Howard, David Ireland, Gyöngy Laky, Jack Lenor Larsen, Nance O’Banion and Morgan O’Hara, Ed Rossbach, Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada, and Katherine Westphal, to mention only a few. The international impact of the Center became evident when it hosted the Symposium on Contemporary Textile Art, 1978, which attracted notable presenters, faculty, lecturers and participants from around the world. From Tapestry to Fiber Art, published 2017, recognized this Symposium as one of the two important conferences of the decade. Magdalena Abakanowicz and Sheila Hicks, internationally renowned artists, were keynote speakers. Fiberworks flourished for 15 years, but, due to funding issues, it closed in December, 1987.

In de la Mora's post-military career, he served as an educator and bandmaster of YMCAs and Shriners of several cities. In particular, he organized (i) the amateur military band at the Salt Lake City YMCA in 1913, (ii) the Kem Shrine and YMCA of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and (iii) the Hamasa Temple Shrine Band of Meridian, Mississippi.  Career highlights  De la Mora grew up in Tepic. He studied music at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, completing in five years the regular eight years, graduating with distinction. * 1895: Played solo cornet with a touring Mexican opera company under the direction of Assali. * 1900: Cananea, the great copper camp, where he took charge of a music academy and organized a band. * 1900: San Dimos, Durango, where he organized a band composed of native Mexicans and Indians. = Mexican Army = * 19??: Enlisted in the 6th Infantry of the Mexican Army and, right-away, was assigned as Bandmaster, a position he held for two years. = United States Army = * 1907: December 16, 1907, de la Mora enlisted in the 21st U.S. Infantry, initially at Jefferson Barracks Military Post near St. Louis as a musician at the rank of private. = 1908, Fort Logan, Colorado = In 1908, De la Mora was with the 21st Infantry Band stationed at Fort Logan – near Denver. The 21st Infantry Band, 4 years earlier based at Fort Snelling, under the direction of Charles W. Graves (born about 1864 Kenton, Ohio), was one of seven military bands selected to perform at the Saint Louis World Fair of 1904. February 4, 1908, he was promoted to Sergeant. On March 21, 1909, he was appointed Acting Chief Musician. On May 5, 1909, he was appointed Chief Musician and left the service December 16, 1909, at that position. He re-enlisted that same day, December 16, 1909, in the 20th Infantry at Fort Douglas, Utah — just a few miles east of Salt Lake City. He was appointed Principal Musician, pending the discharge of then Bandmaster. = Around 1910, Philippines = Around 1910, while serving as Vice Head Musician, he was with the 21st U.S. Infantry in the Philippines, on the island of Mindanáo at Ludlow Barracks.

While in the Philippines, De la Mora was on the \\"Sick List\\" of enlisted personnel: Admitted February 10, 1910, Return to duty March 25, 1911, in Manilla. (note: When admitted, De La Mora was listed as being in the 20th Infantry) = Honolulu, Hawaii = September 4, 1911, de la Mora arrived in Honolulu from the Philippines aboard the U.S. Army Transport Sherman with his 19-piece military band. As Head Musician of the 20th Infantry Band, they performed in Hawaii as late as October 1911. He was discharged December 25, 1911. = Salt Lake City = De a Mora Organized an amateur military band at the Salt Lake City Y.M.C.A. in 1913. = 1914, El Paso, Texas = Beginning towards the end of 1913, and throughout 1914, De la Mora and the 20th Infantry Band, with the 20th Regiment from Fort Douglas, was stationed at Camp Cotton, a sub-post of Fort Bliss in El Paso. The 20th Infantry Band was on patrol duty on the Mexican border.  Other units at Camp Cotton  * Camp Cotton – named for its locale in the Cotton subdivision in the southeastern part of El Paso – was, in 1913, a newly established military camp that, initially, hosted the 20th Infantry, the 12th Cavalry squadron of 4 troops and C troop of the 13th Cavalry. * In July 1912, the 16th Infantry returned from its second tour in the Philippines for duty at the Presidio in San Francisco. Two years later, the regiment was transferred with the 8th Brigade, commanded by General \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, to the Mexican border to help secure it from by Mexican bandits and paramilitary forces commanded by Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa. Upon arrival in April 1914, the regiment was posted to Camp Cotton. In response to Pancho Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico, March 1916 – about 80 miles west of El Paso – President Woodrow Wilson ordered Pershing conduct a punitive expedition into Mexico to hunt, find, and punish Pancho Villa (see Pancho Villa Expedition). = Conservatory of Mérida = * The School of Music of the State of Yucatan was inaugurated November 30, 1911, in Mérida. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed Conservatorio de Mérida. Francisco Quevedo was its first director. Antonio de la Mora, one of the founding music professors, taught counterpoint and instrumentation. = Canadian Expeditionary Force = Before the United States entered World War I, the Canadian Expeditionary Force recruited Americans to fill ranks of the 97th Battalion, one of five American Legion battalions that had greatly deteriorated. The other four battalions were the 212th, the 211th, the 213th, and the 237th. * April 10, 1916, de la Mora enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force at Windsor, and, on the same day received a medical examination. * April 26, 1916, de la Mora was promoted to Sergeant in the 97th Overseas Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, at Toronto, and was appointed Bandmaster. * May 12, 1916, de la Mora was transferred to the 212th Battalion at Toronto * May 19, 1916, de la Mora was promoted to Band Sergeant 212th and assigned to Winnipeg, where he served as Bandmaster. * January 3, 1917, de la Mora received a Medical Discharge. = Grand Forks, North Dakota = * De la Mora became a member of the Kem Shrine of Grand Forks. * 1916–1917: Grand Forks, North Dakota, Professor de la Mora, Bandmaster of: :: The YMCA Boys Band :: Kem Temple Shriners Band :: Elks Saxophone Band :: East Grand Forks Band = Meridian, Mississippi = De la Mora resided in Meridian, Mississippi, for a few months during 1918. While there, he published his book, Cornetist Alphabet, and organized the Hamasa Temple Shrine Band. He remained in Meridian until about late-November-early-December when he married Susan May Stennis (maiden; 1899–1973) in Meridian and, with her, moved to New Orleans for his work as a musician. When he signed his World War I Draft Registration on September 12, 1818, he provided the name of his wife, Amanda de la Mora, and his address at 817 24th Avenue (between 8th and 9th Streets), Meridian, Mississippi, an address that corresponds to the site upon which the Hamasa Temple was built in 1924. The Meridian Shriners contracted the Saenger organization to design, build, and operate the auditorium in their building. The Saenger organization was the same organization that designed, built, owned, and operated the Strand in New Orleans, where de la Mora began working in 1918. = Strand Theatre Orchestra, New Orleans = Beginning late- November-early-December 1918, De la Mora worked as a musician in New Orleans in the Concert Orchestra under the direction of Don Philippini (né Salvatore Philippini; 1870–1950) of the recently built Strand Theater. The Strand, no longer in existence, was at the corner of Baronne and Gravier Streets for about 53 years. On February 9, 1919, de la Mora seemingly tried to commit suicide by leaping eighteen feet to the street from the second-story window of the newspaper editorial room of the New Orleans States building at 619 Canal Street. News accounts attributed de la Mora's distress to a prior nervous breakdown from overwork and marital unhappiness relating to disagreements with in-laws. De la Mora, about two months earlier, had married Susan May Stennis (maiden; 1899–1973) in Meridian, Mississippi. Soon after marrying, they moved to New Orleans and resided at 611 St. Charles Street (at Lafayette Square). = Wichita Kansas = In 1925, Antonio de la Mora was living in Wichita, Kansas, at 1665 North Waco Avenue with his wife, Martha, and two sons, Antonio, Jr., and Adolphus. He was working there as a music teacher. He resided with his family at 2239 North Laurel Street. = Kansas City, Missouri = De la Mora moved to Kansas City, Missouri, around December 1925 to organize the Mexican Band of the Unión Cultural Mexicana (U.C.M.) in Kansas City's Westside at 1017 West 24th Street. He trained a 45-piece band composed mostly of youth from the community. De la Mora, with Martha (1903–1983), Antonio, Jr. (1922–1985), and Adolfo (born 1934) – his wife and two sons – resided at 2322 Monitor Place. The Mexican communities in Wichita and Kansas City were viewed somewhat as colonies for Mexican exiles.  Death in Kansas City, Missouri  Antonio de la Mora died May 9, 1926. Dr. Nicolás Jaime (1885–1965) (surname pronounced \\"high-me\\" with the accent evenly divided) was the attending physician who signed the death certificate. He and Dr. Othoniel de Rivas y Jaén (1890–1973), a Granada, Nicaragua-born chiropractor, held a funeral vigil for Antonio de la Mora May 22, 1926, at the U.C.M. Dr. Jaime, a co-founder of the U.C.M., days earlier had signed a US$2,500 bail bond () for Jorge Prieto Laurens (1895–1990), who was elected and served as interim governor of San Luis Potosí in 1923 for one year, was indicted in San Antonio and arrested on February 28, 1926, in Kansas City, on a charge by the Mexican government that he had, as part of the Huerta faction, participated in a plot to overthrow (another revolution) the then present Mexican regime, a government for which, diplomatically, the United States was on friendly terms. Dr. Jaime, himself, was a 1915 Mexican exile.

History A small clay church had been established by French priest Father Dupuy prior to 1900. At the start of the century the missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette arrived in Antsirabe and in 1908 built a church that was 22 meters long, 16 meters wide, 8 meters high, with a bell tower 14 meters high. In 1921 with the establishment of the Diocese of Antsirabé, Monsignor François Dantin ordered that a new church would be built, as the previous one was too small for the growing Catholic population in Madagascar. Dantin also ordered that this church would be the cathedral for the new diocese. Father Joseph Michaud was the master builder and the architect of the new church. Monsignor Jean-Baptiste Raharijaona was the director of the project. The corner stone, imported from France, was laid in 1924. On 5 January 1925 work began on the new building. On 19 September 1931 the cathedral was officially dedicated, although the building was not yet completed. On 22 September 1931 the official benediction took place, conducted by Monsignor François Dantin in the presence of Bishop Charles Givelet, then Vicar Apostolic of Fianarantsoa, and Bishop Etienne Fourcadier, then Vicar Apostolic of Tananarive. The present day church stands 60 meters long, 16.77 meters wide, 14 meters high. Its bell tower has a height of 45 meters. In 2005 the parish celebrated its 75th anniversary.

The game is based on a popular Dota 2 community created game mode called Dota Auto Chess, which was released in January 2019. Dota Underlords was first released free-to-play in early access in June 2019 before officially releasing on February 25, 2020. Gameplay Dota Underlords is an auto battler, a chess-inspired competitive strategy game, where players place characters, known as heroes, on an 8x8 grid-shaped battlefield. After a preparation phase, a team's heroes then automatically fight the opposing team without any further direct input from the player. A match features up to eight players online who take turns playing against each other in a one-on-one format, with the winner being the final player standing after eliminating all of the opposing heroes. In addition to the online matchmaking, single-player matches against bots is also featured, as well as a \\"freestyle\\" practice mode that puts no limits on hero combinations. Over the course of a match, players earn gold and experience points, which are used to upgrade heroes and other playable units to make them stronger. Players also make use of items, which give stat bonuses to units. The game also features a \\"duos\\" mode, allowing two players on separate boards, but sharing health and levels, to perform as a team, with the winning duo having the best combined damage totals by the end. Development and release Dota Underlords was developed and published by Valve for Android, iOS, macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. It is based on Dota Auto Chess, a popular community created game mode within Dota 2, a game they also developed. Following Dota Auto Chess release in January 2019, it quickly become a phenomenon, having over seven million players by April 2019, Valve had met with the mod's developers, the Chinese-based Drodo Studio, to discuss directly collaborating on a standalone version. However, the two companies were unable to come to an agreement, with them both stating that it was in their best interest to develop their own separate games, with Dota Underlords being Valve's project. The game was built using Valve's Source 2 game engine, making it the first game using that engine to be released on mobile platforms. Valve announced Dota Underlords in May 2019, with it releasing in early access as a free-to-play game on June 20, 2019. where it saw over 1.5 million downloads and held a concurrent player count on Steam of over 200,000 within a few days. Features such as a replay system, ranked matchmaking, daily challenges and rewards, and a battle pass were added over time during its early access phase before it officially released on February 25, 2020. It features full cross- platform play between its PC and mobile versions, with players able to freely start games on one and finish it on another. Reception Polygon called it a clone of Dota Auto Chess, stating that while they thought Underlords was more appealing to new players, the many similarities to the original mod could make it hard for veterans of the genre to see a reason to play Underlords over it, adding that games need to be more \\"unique in order to survive\\" in a niche genre. Critics also compared and contrasted it with Artifact, another Valve- developed Dota spinoff game released around the same time that was seen as unsuccessful, as well as Teamfight Tactics, the League of Legends take on the genre. IGN considered Underlords to be the easiest auto battler to get into as a novice due in part to its user interface.

Ideation or suicidal thoughts are categorized as: considering, seriously considering, planning, or attempting suicide and youth is typically categorized as individuals below the age of 25. Various research studies show an increased likelihood of suicide ideation in youth in the LGBT community. Factors involved in this propensity are peer victimization, parental disapproval, and bullying, as well as overall sentiments of undesirability due to LGBT identity. South Korea has the 10th highest rate of suicide in the world and the second in the OECD. Within these rates, suicide is the primary cause of death for South Korean youth, ages 10–19. While these rates are elevated, suicide ideation additionally increases with the introduction of LGBT identity.  Stigmatization  Stigmatization of LGBT identities results in negative self-feelings for the individual and increases their risk for self-harm and substance abuse. Studies done to measure the tolerance of homosexuality among South Korean University students found that of approximately 800 students surveyed, \\"68% would not be comfortable with having LGBT family members\\", \\"26.5% disagreed homosexuals could be good people\\", and \\"17.3% agreed homosexuality was shameful\\". The indicators of a disapproving or even repulsive opinion of LGBT individuals was gender, with men being more prone to disapprove than women. A second indicator of negative feelings towards LGBT individuals is religion, primarily in the realms of recognizing or approving of LGBT marriages.ANDERSON, C., & LEE, M. (2011). Tolerance of homosexuality among Korean university students. Autumn Academic Conference Papers of Korean Administrative Association,1–23.  Harassment  According to Rainbow Action, an South Korean Organization aimed at improving LGBT rights in South Korea, 80% of LGBT youth reported being the subjects of homophobic slurs from their peers and also approximate 80% reported hearing slurs from teachers.Rainbow Action. (2017). Human Rights Violations on the Basis of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and HIV Status in the Republic of Korea.Retrieved from https://ilga.org/downloads/stakeholders_report_Republic_of_Korea_UPR28.pdf The harassment suffered by LGBT youth extends beyond merely verbal abuse. Studies show that there is a strong link between experience of violence for youth who have same-sex attraction, specifically in women who sleep with both men and women. Some studies suggest the main reason for suicidal ideation in youth is their exposure to violence in school.  Effects of societal disapproval  According to Joiner's Interpersonal Theory, feelings of isolation and perceived burdensomeness contribute greatly to an individual's propensity toward suicide ideation. Studies have found that in gay and lesbian South Korean youth, these two main factors are present at higher rates than in their heterosexual counterparts. Isolation is in reference to the continuous exposure to anti-LGBT rhetoric which creates a hostile atmosphere to navigate. Similarly, the hostility decreases the likelihood of other LGBT people being available for connection, which increases the feelings of alienation. Perceived burdensomeness is in reference to feeling like an individual is a burden to their friends and/or family. These factors combined create feelings of hopelessness which then lead to suicide ideation. = Statistics of Suicide Ideation = According to one study, the analysis of cross-sectional data from 146,621 students aged 12–17 years for the years 2012 and 2013 showed that the prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher among youths with same-sex intercourse experience (45.9% for females, 33.7% for males) than among youths with opposite-sex intercourse experience (42.2% for females, 23.8% for males) and those with no experience in intercourse (21.0% for females, 12.7% for males). (The study defined lesbian, gay, or bisexual youth as youths who engaged in a type of sexual intercourse (same-sex or both-sex intercourse).) Other study conducted with 105 adolescent LB youth found that: * 70% experienced suicide ideation and * 45.7% attempted suicide at least once  Solutions  Most publications suggest an introduction of strict anti- discrimination policies would greatly alleviate the distress of the youth. These policies would be aimed at decreasing and eventually stopping school violence towards LGBT youth. Additionally, implementation of supportive policies and strategies enacted by schools and their personal and staff would create environments wherein the youth would feel more comfortable since \\"recent research has shown that higher levels of protectiveness and supportive school climates for LGB youths reduced suicidal thoughts\\".

It supports bidirectional inflow operation using radial blades that rotate around a horizontal axis. The water wall turbine is suitable for energy extraction from tidal and freshwater currents. For tidal power installations, the turbine operates in both directions as the tide ebbs and flows. Water wall turbine hydrostatic pressure converter principle  Development  Water wheels have been used throughout history in a wide variety of configurations. Most designs capture the water's kinetic energy, i.e. energy stored in the water's motion. Between 2004 and 2010, Lodewyk Botha and Marek Sredzki developed an inflow turbine that captures water's potential energy in addition to its kinetic energy. Principal patents for the technology were registered and published between 2005 and 2011. The first full-scale water wall turbine project was completed in 2016 by Water Wall Turbine Inc. It features a 1MW power plant and a microgrid system. In this deployment, the water wall turbine features a straight flow-to-drive turbine mounted on a self-floating platform. The vessel is 28-meters long and 17-meters wide and weighs roughly 550 metric tons. The project serves Dent Island Lodge in BC, Canada. The deployment demonstrates the technology's ability to power remote communities. In 2015, a study regarding the modeling and optimization of water wall turbines was conducted by the Canadian Hydraulics Centre of the National Research Council Canada. Independent studies regarding the efficiency and theory of a water wall turbine's operation have also been published. Water wall turbine self-floating power plant  Theory of operation  The turbine's bidirectional rotation operates inline with the free current flow. Both potential and kinetic energy are harvested, providing higher energy extraction efficiency than a kinetic energy only approach. This is the principal difference between traditional water wheels and the water wall turbine design. It is this difference that allows a water wall turbine to operate effectively in low head environments. A water wall turbine's large rotating blade structure moves slower than the current, “blocking” the flow. In doing so, it causes head pressure to build up across the turbine, hydraulically propagated over the total vertical submerged blade. The turbine's catamaran-style floats use the Venturi effect to channel and accelerate the useable current. Studies in laboratory conditions have demonstrated that water wall turbines can achieve an efficiency of up to 90%. Water wall turbine power curve and efficiency  Applications  A water wall turbine may be designed for a wide range of marine and freshwater installations including tidal zones, rivers, and canals, with its own flotation or on pylons. In contrast to other types of turbines such as Pelton, Francis, and Kaplan, it does not need a high water head or penstock. This makes it applicable in low head environments such as coastal passageways, where tidal currents are strongest. Water wall turbines do not require barrages or catchment ponds and thus have minimal impact on the tidal effect in estuaries, making them suitable for sensitive environments. All of the electrical and mechanical components of a water wall turbine are in closed- containment above the waterline, mitigating the environmental impact to the waterway. The blades are arranged along the horizontal axis and turn slower than the speed of the current which results in a minimal risk to fish, sea mammals, or their habitats.

Wyoming, No. 17-532, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that Wyoming's statehood did not void the Crow Tribe's right to hunt on \\"unoccupied lands of the United States\\" under an 1868 treaty, and that the Bighorn National Forest did not automatically become \\"occupied\\" when the forest was created..  Background  Elk meat In January 2014 Clayvin Herrera, a member of the Crow Tribe of Indians, along with several other members of his tribe, followed a group of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni) from the Crow reservation in Montana into Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming. There, they shot three elks, taking them home for food. Wyoming officials cited Herrera and his companions for hunting out of season, a violation of state law. Herrera's two companions both plead guilty to the poaching charges and paid the fines that Wyoming imposed. Herrera, however, argued that their hunt was lawful, citing the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which allowed them to hunt on \\"unoccupied lands\\". Wyoming disagreed, arguing that Herrera's claim had been invalidated by the Supreme Court 120 years prior, in Ward v. Race Horse. There, the Court held that Wyoming's admission into the Union had superseded the rights of Indians to hunt there,. because it had joined the Union \\"on the same footing\\" as the other states, giving it control over the natural resources within its border.  Case  The Supreme Court accepted the case to answer the question: In a 5 to 4 decision, the split Court ruled that Wyoming's admission did not abrogate the Indians' rights. The majority opinion was authored by Sotomayor, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Gorsuch. The dissenters were Roberts, Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh.

Within the U.S, Korean- Americans have become associated as a \\"model minority\\", meaning that their lives are stable and problem-free. However, the rise of concern for domestic violence within Korean-American immigrants came to light during the 1980s in which several reports of physical abuse by Korean-American husbands to their wives were reported. According to the National Violence Against Women study, 60% of Korean-American women reported physical abuse or to be living in domestically violent households. The U.S Department of Justice defines domestic violence as violent crimes acted out by current or former spouses. In order to find out why statistics in domestic violence were so high in Korean- immigrant families, several studies have been conducted to discover contributing factors that have led to domestic violence. Many researchers have developed a theoretical framework surrounding the problem of wife abuse in Korean immigrant families through recognizing the ways in which patriarchy shapes gender roles and expectations. Similar to other male-dominated societies, Korean society is a society in which women are expected to be caretakers, submissive to their husbands, and subordinate to men in general. Traditional and conservative perspectives on a woman's role in society are threatened by the rise of feminism and the increasing number of women partaking in roles that fall outside of the patriarchal paradigm.  Predicators of domestic violence  Korean-American immigrant women in more conservative families are more likely to experience domestic violence within their lives than in less conservative families. Income, religion, acculturation, alcohol abuse, and physical assault are all predicators to domestic violence. Through several studies, results have showed that Korean immigrants who experienced physical assault as children were more likely to tolerate acts of violence from their spouse in adulthood. It has been noted that 80.2 percent of Korean immigrant batterers were also exposed to parental abuse in their childhood which was a commonality found in many of the incidences involving Korean-American men who had assaulted their wives. Assimilation to American society can become a trigger for stress and tension within the household, in which these negative feelings are taken out by men onto their wives. Attitudes of Korean immigrant men who were less acculturated and less educated than other more acculturated Korean immigrant men were more likely to tolerate pro-violent perspectives. In addition, first and second generation Korean immigrants often come into conflict with one another based on explicit and implicit cultural differences within the United States. Korean-American families experience difficulties surrounding immigration from Korea as they face the challenge of two cultural worlds, both that embody patriarchal societies. Adjusting to American life as first generation immigrants places Korean-American immigrants in more vulnerable positions, especially in terms of a language barrier between Korean-immigrants and Americans. Due to the lack of resources for recent generations of Korean immigrants, language has influenced the availability of opportunities for jobs and economic growth. Korean immigrant men, who traditionally are to be the providers of the family, are not only feeling incompetent in the United States' work force, but are also having to rely on their wives involvement in the workforce as well, a role that is uncommon for women in patriarchy. Traditionally, the family dynamic in Korean families have marital roles similar to other patriarchal societies in which a husband earns the living, and his wife serves a domestic role. Although Korean immigrants are amongst the most highly educated immigrants within the U.S, many families have found themselves to be in work revolving liquor stores, dry cleaning, and gas stations. These family-owned small businesses require lots of hard work which researchers believe lead to an increased amount of stress and tension within the household. The extended work hours, menial employment capability, lack of translated resources, and the lack of self-esteem are highly correlated to emotional stress. Furthermore, due to the economic problems that Korean immigrant families face, women are partaking in the labor force, improving their status as women and therefore threatening the traditional outlook on how they should be performing their gender role. The new confrontation of marital roles in Korean immigrant families has significantly weakened the power imbalance between husband and wife, creating a bigger risk for built up anger lashed out on wives through physical and verbal abuse. Although Korean immigrant women have greater potential for new independence, many Korean men, who like other men benefit from the structure of a male-dominated society, still hold traditional attitudes of power relations between men and women. There is strong empirical support for the correlation between domestic violence and the pressure of assimilating to a new country such as seen within studies on Korean immigrant families. For example, Shin (1995) found that Korean batterers experienced higher levels of immigration stress such as under employment than nonbatterers. Another researcher, Song (1992) found that there was a significant relationship between wife abuse and discrepancy in the pre- immigration and post-immigration employment status of Korean immigrant men. Another predicator of domestic violence that was found common amongst Korean immigrant relationships is heavy alcohol intake by Korean immigrant men. In a 1998 study, Chi found that unlike other Asian American groups, dependence on alcohol and alcohol abuse were strikingly high among Korean-American males in Los Angeles. In addition, among Asian Americans, Koreans held the greatest number of arrests for driving under the influence in the Los Angeles county. In the same study it was found that alcohol abuse was amongst the most significant correlations to divorce due to husband battering. Shin (1995)'s study believed that the high levels of consumption of alcohol by Korean men were due to related levels of stress previously discussed such as marital satisfaction, financial struggles, and issues with acculturation. The study showed that 70.6% of women reported that their male partners had consumed alcohol and 41.2% stated that their male partners had an abnormal dependence on alcohol as well. Alcohol consumption becomes a problematic correlation in domestic violent relationships due to the fact that victims will forgive the abusers under the impression that their actions are excused by being intoxicated. It therefore becomes dangerous to use alcohol as an excuse for violent acts occurring to women at the hands of their husbands.  Under- reporting of domestic violence  American society views Asian Americans as a \\"model minority\\" discouraging research and help-seeking behavior in domestic violence. Asian immigrants are heavily overlooked by social services because of the stereotype of the \\"model minority\\" and therefore are not granted as much access to helpful resources to overcome verbal and physical violence within the household. In addition, language barriers becomes another factor for Korean-American immigrant women. There are not enough translators or those familiar with alternative approaches to helping Korean-American women come out of their abusive relationships. Korean immigrant women receive less opportunity to find help due to the scarcity of organizations that are both culturally appropriate and language-specific. In addition, Korean culture emphasizes the importance of keeping what occurs in the family private. According to research, most of the police reports concerning domestic violence in the Korean-immigrant community is not from the victims themselves, but rather from neighbors or relatives of the victims. Seeking help from outside resources instills a fear of stigmatization and shame in Korean immigrant women, discouraging them to talk to anyone about their abuse. Due to a traditional belief in family privacy, disclosing problems in their relationship to others is seen as weak and deteriorating to the family name. This practice has negative consequences on Korean-immigrant women as social services and other outlets that help women in these kinds of situations are not aware of the high numbers of abuse within Korean immigrant relationships. Isolation has been a huge influential factor in the small number of reports made for domestic violence. Most Korean-American women are isolated as immigrants, living far away from their families but close to their husband's family. This ensures a greater reliance on their husbands for economic necessity. Due to this, the likelihood of leaving the relationship is decreased. The role of in laws also can contribute to intimate partner violence as social science literature discusses immigration abuse from the husband's family including threats of deportation and losing custody of children. Although women have increased opportunity in participating in the workforce, the shift of their gender role causes greater conflict by changing the power dynamic between her and her husband. This tension then further creates an isolated environment for Korean immigrant women in which they are rejected from both their country of origin's practices and their \\"new\\" country's practices. The alienation from both Korean and American societal expectations places Korean-immigrant women in vulnerable positions and further encourages them not to speak out on their experiences as victims of domestic abuse.  Activism  Shelters for victims of domestic violence has been proven to help combat intimate partner violence. Thus far, shelters lack the necessary resources to accommodate for immigrant abuse due to lack of sufficient language and knowledge about Korean culture. However, several shelters work specifically towards helping Asian American women find shelter and safety in leaving domestic violent relationships. In 1982, the New York Asian Women's Center was established and works with individual Asian American immigrants to help them out of their abusive relationships. Their services include providing safe homes for victims, as well as opening their own homes to family members wanting to escape their violent households. The National Korean American Coalition to End Domestic Abuse is another organization that works together with other organizations to prevent and put an end to the domestic abuse in Korean-immigrant families. The NKACEDA was created in 2014 and hopes to expand national network of Korean American domestic violence organizations, share the best ways to serve the Korean American community members who are in abusive relationships, and identify the ways in which all members can be culturally responsive to the Korean-immigrant community. It is common for social service agencies to help survivors with leaving their abusive relationships, as well as finding asylum for victims of domestic abuse. However, the approach of social services is the same process for all victims, which leaves many Korean-immigrants without the proper help that they need. It is essential for future organizations to become more educated in how patriarchal societies can influence responses to domestic violence and therefore recognize the ways it affects women's ability to receive help. Though shelters are helping women find a place to go once they leave their husbands, it does not suppress domestic violence itself, which is heavily weighed on traditional and conservative attitudes on male and female gender roles. With the rise of feminism and women's independence both in Korea and the United States, it is likely that there will be changes to how social services and organizations work to serve Korean-immigrant women facing domestic violence.

The husband of Aletta Jacobs, he was a proponent of open government, fair wages and birth control. He helped found many radical organisations in the Netherlands including the (Neo-Malthusian League), (Radical League) and (Free-thinking Democratic League). Early life Gerritsen was born on 2 February 1850 in Amersfoort, the second son of Hendrik Aloijsius Gerritsen and Elisabeth Brasser Gerritsen (née Rijss). His father was a successful grain trader and the family pious members of the Dutch Reformed Church. After attending primary school, he went to Amsterdam to study at the (Institution for Education in Commerce and Industry), with the intention of returning to help run his father's successful grain trading business. However, before returning to Amersfoort, he decided to travel to Groningen in 1866 to widen his experience. At that time, Groningen was a hotbed for radicalism. At the same time as gaining business skills, Gerritsen also developed his radicalism. Although Gerritsen probably never met Eduard Douwes Dekker, who visited the city in 1868, he was influenced by his ideas. When he returned to Amersfoort, he formally broke with the church in 1869 and joined the freemasons, becoming master of the Haarlem Masonic lodge Vicit Vim Virtus in 1871. Soon after, he moved to London. While there, he met Annie Besant, Charles Bradlaugh and Charles Vickery Drysdale, and gained acquaintance with other radicals. His thought increasingly combined Dekker's thinking, as an atheist, feminist and freemason, with the philosophy of the English clergyman Thomas Robert Malthus and he came to be identified with Neo- Malthusianism. Return to Amersfoort When his father fell ill, Gerritsen returned to Amersfoort in 1874 to run the family business with his brother. He continued to be involved in freemasonry and between 1875 and 1878 was active as a master of ceremonies, treasurer and court master in the Amersfoort lodge named after Jacob van Campen. In 1875, he also started collecting the library for which he became famous. He joined (The Dawn), rising to be treasurer in 1880, and became a member of the editorial staff of the society journal, also named De Dageraad, in 1882. On 20 September 1881, Gerritsen was elected to the Amersfoort council. From the beginning, he was noted for his radicalism. Like Bradlaugh, he objected to taking the customary oath when taking office. He took it under protest but was subsequently instrumental in getting the obligation removed in 1895. Once in office, he pushed for council minutes to be published and meetings to take place in the evening so that local people could attend. His criticism of the council led to resignations of a mayor and an alderman. It was while at Amersfoort that Gerritsen first met Paul Kruger, the President of the South African Republic, in 1884. Political career in Amsterdam In August 1885, Gerretsen moved to Amsterdam, then a centre for European radicalism. He joined a group of young radicals called (Young Amsterdam) under the pseudonym Hack van Oudheusden and quickly gained prominence for his writing. The group produced a radical manifesto including calls for universal suffrage, free primary education, separation of church and state, and the development of self-government in the colonies. On 11 July 1888, he was elected to the Amsterdam council. He collaborated with both liberals and church representatives who shared his goals. He was an advocate of municipal ownership of utilities, the vetting of companies for public contract on the basis of the payment of fair wages, and corporate responsibility for pensions. He helped form the (Radical League) in 6 November 1892 to represent these views in parliament. On 28 February 1893, he was elected a member of the Second Chamber of the States General for the Leeuwarden electoral district, and was re-elected on 16 May 1894. He served until 21 September 1897. On 6 September 1899, Gerretsen was appointed an alderman in Amsterdam with responsibility for the care for the poor, trade institutions and the pension agency. As an alderman, he came to be known primarily for his work reforming the local medical service. His reorganisation brought all medical, surgical and obstetric into public control, meaning doctors would now be permanent employees of the municipality. This brought him into conflict with the medical profession. In 1901, Gerretsen helped found the (Free-thinking Democratic League), which duly selected him to run for office. He was elected as member of the States of North Holland from 3 July 1901 to 5 July 1905 for the Amsterdam IX constituency. He was subsequently elected by the Den Helder district but died before he could take up the responsibility. Neo-Malthusianism and feminism right Gerritsen believed that unchecked population growth was at the root of many of society's problems. However, unlike Malthus, he believed that technology, particularly contraception, should be the main check to this growth. In 1880, he met Aletta Jacobs, the first female doctor in the Netherlands since the enlightenment, who helped him understand the biology of birth control. With Bernardus Hermanus Heldt and Jan Martinus Smit, he co-founded the (Neo-Malthusian League or NMB) on 2 November 1881. The society's aim was to reduce poverty by balancing family size with the available means for subsistence, with information on contraception a means to this end. He travelled extensively with his wife to promote these values, attending the 1904 International Council of Women and subsequently touring the United States shortly before his death. Personal life Gerritsen was a believer in free marriage and for many years declined marrying his life companion Aletta Jacobs. When they did marry in 1892 to legitimise their future children, she took the then radical step of retaining her maiden name. Their only child, born on 9 September 1893, died only one day old. Gerritsen died on 5 July 1905 from cancer. As it was at the time illegal in the Netherlands, he was cremated in Hamburg. Legacy Gerritsen's legacy has largely been overshadowed by his more famous wife. Originally intended for Amsterdam University Library, in 1903 his library of over 18,000 books and 13,000 pamphlets was sold to the John Crerar Library and shipped to Chicago for an undisclosed sum. Along with his wife's collection, it was subsequently expanded and purchased by the University of Kansas in 1954. It has become an important resource for feminist researchers.

Sometimes, during these massacres, the Muslim Kurds tried to force the Yazidis to convert to Islam. Almost the whole Yazidi population were nearly wiped out by massacres carried out by the Kurds in the 19th century. While modern persecution describes a takeover of Yazidi settlement areas with simultaneous assimilation of the Yazidis by the Kurdistan Region. The Geli Ali Beg Waterfall in Iraqi Kurdistan is named after the Yazidi leader Ali Beg who was killed there in 1832 by the Kurdish prince Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz.  History  Historically, there were many massacres of Yazidis committed by Kurds. In the 10th century the Kurds started persecuting the Yazidis in the Hakkari mountains. The Kurds persecuted the Yazidis with particular brutality. In the year 1832, about 70,000 Yazidis were killed by the Kurdish leaders Bedir Khan Beg and Muhammad Pasha Rawanduz. During his research trips in 1843, the Russian traveller and orientalist Ilya Berezin mentioned that 7,000 Yazidis were killed by Kurds on the hills of Nineveh near Mosul, shortly before his arrival. According to many historical reports, these massacres can today be classified as \\"genocide\\". In 1414, the Kurds killed the Yazidis in the mountains of Hakkari. Then the Kurds destroyed the holy temple Lalish of the Yazidis and desecrated the tomb of Sheikh Adi. Later, the Yazidis rebuilt their temple and the tomb of Sheikh Adi. In 1831, the Kurdish emir Muhammad Pasha Rawanduz (Mire Kor, the blind prince) moved with his army to the village of Kellek and had putting the inhabitants of this Yazidi village to the sword. Then he went northward and attacked the entire Yazidi-inhabited foothill country east of Mosul. Thousands of Yazidi men, women and children were killed by his army. Some Yazidis managed to take refuge in the neighboring forests and mountain fastnesses, and a few managed to escape to distant places. Many Yazidis from Sheikhan, who had fled from the Kurds and could not cross the Tigris river, had gathered on the great mound of Kouyunjik, where they were persecuted and killed by the Kurds. In 1832, the Kurdish emir Muhammad Pasha Rawanduz with his troops committed a massacre on the Yazidis in Khatarah. Subsequently, the Kurds attacked the Yazidis in Shekhan and killed many of them. In another attempt he and his troops occupied over 300 Yazidi villages. The Kurds kidnapped over 10,000 Yazidis to Rawandiz. Then they gave them the option to convert to Islam or to be killed. Most of them converted to Islam and the rest who refused were killed. In 1832, the Kurdish emir Bedir Khan Beg (Mire Botan, the prince of Bohtan) with his troops committed a massacre on the Yazidis in Shekhan. The Kurds have killed almost the whole Yazidi population of Shekhan. Some Yazidis tried to escape to Sinjar. By the attempt to escape to Sinjar, many Yazidis have going into the Tigris river. Those Yazidis who could not swim were killed by the Kurds. About 12,000 Yazidis were killed on the bank of the Tigris river by the Kurds. Kurds also kidnapped many Yazidi women and children. In 1833, the Yazidis were attacked in the Aqrah region again by the Kurdish emir Muhammad Pasha Rawanduz and his soldiers. The Kurds killed 500 Yazidis in the upper Zab. After that, the Kurds attacked the Yazidis in Sinjar and killed many of them. In 1844, the Kurdish emir Bedir Khan Beg committed a repeated massacre on the Yazidis in the Tur Abdin region. Many Yazidis were killed by the Kurds. The Kurds have also captured many Yazidis to force them to convert to Islam. Seven Yazidi villages have been forced to Islam and have converted. In 1915–1923, Yazidis were killed alongside Armenians during the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Kurds. More than 300,000 Yazidis were killed. Many Yazidis have also fled to Transcaucasia.  Modern times  Since 2003, when the Kurds occupied the settlements of the Yazidis in the disputed territories of Northern Iraq, the Yazidis were undergoing a process of Kurdification by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Kurdish authorities have used heavy-handed tactics against the Yazidis and some Yazidis were kidnapped and beaten by the KRG. There have also been some demographic changes in Yazidi-majority areas after the fall of Saddam. In the Sheikhan area, which is considered a historic Yazidi stronghold, the Kurdish authorities have settled Sunni Kurds to strengthen their claim that it should be a Kurdish area.  Resistance of the Yazidis  Some years ago, the Yazidis were a very powerful tribe. The most powerful tribe of the Yazidis inhabits the mountain of Sinjar. In the picture in the middle you can see Ali Beg II. (the grandson of the Yazidi leader Ali Beg and the grandfather of Tahseen Said) Many Yazidis also defended themselves against the Kurdish attacks. So did Ali Beg, the Yazidi leader in Sheikhan. Yazidi leader Ali Beg used his forces to oppose Kurdish leader Muhammad Pasha Rawanduz, who mobilized the Kurdish tribes of the surrounding mountains to attack the Yazidis. Ali Beg's troops were outnumbered and Ali Beg was captured and killed by the Bey of Rawandiz.  Kurdish view  The relations between the Yazidis and the Kurds were often tense. Most Kurds view the Yazidis as so- called \\"unbelievers\\". In the past, this view of the Kurds often led to massacres and forced conversions on the Yazidis. Kurdish muftis have given the persecution of Yazidis by Kurds a religious character and legalized it. Also Kurdish mullahs such as Mahmud Bayazidi viewed the Yazidis as unbelievers.

The series' title comes from the album title No More Heroes, which was released by the British punk band The Stranglers. The games follows Travis Touchdown, a fan of video games and anime who wins a beam katana in an auction, from which he inadvertently becomes involved in the United Assassins Association and forced to kill assassins higher in rank to prevent other assassins from targeting him. Four No More Heroes titles have been released worldwide with a fifth scheduled to be released in 2021. Gameplay Throughout the game, the player controls the character Travis Touchdown. The first game has a free roaming world, allowing Travis to move around on foot or on his modified scooter, the \\"Schpeltiger\\". Gameplay is open-ended, with the condition that the player must kill the top ten assassins to make the storyline progress. There are numerous part-time job side quests to earn money which can be spent on weapons, training sessions, clothes and video tapes. Money is also required to compete in a Ranking fight. In No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle. the minigames that Travis can do to gain money and become stronger are 8-bit style games, in genres including action, puzzle, and racing. Control is handled through the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment, with the Remote controlling his weapon, the beam katana, and the Nunchuk moving Travis. Most attacks are performed using the \\"A\\" button, with certain other moves, including the \\"death blow\\" and sword lock struggles, executed by following on-screen instructions. Further, since the beam katanas run on batteries, they must be charged from time to time by pressing the \\"1\\" button on the remote and shaking it. Travis's beam katana can also be upgraded and replaced throughout the game by visiting Dr. Naomi. While the katana does not follow the exact position of the remote, it is able to distinguish between a \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" position which varies the character stance and the attacks done. In addition to attacks with the beam katana Travis can kick and punch, and when enemies are stunned he can throw them with a number of professional wrestling maneuvers, done by manipulating both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Introduced in Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, is the ability to equip \\"Skill Chips\\" (named after Gundam models) that allow the player to utilize an array of special attacks, ranging from a scattergun-type blast to an orbital laser. Games =Main series= No More Heroes (2007) Released on Wii in 2007, the story follows Travis Touchdown, who is a stereotypical otaku – his motel room decorated with professional wrestling and anime collectibles – living in near poverty in the No More Heroes motel of the fictional town of Santa Destroy, California. After winning a beam katana in an internet auction, he runs out of money to buy video games and wrestling videos. After meeting with Sylvia Christel, he accepts a job to kill Helter Skelter, also known as \\"the Drifter\\", which earns him rank 11 by the United Assassins Association, a governing body of assassins. Realizing that he has the opportunity to make it to the top, he sets out to secure himself the coveted position of number one assassin in the UAA. An enhanced port, No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise, was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2010. No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle (2010) Released on Wii in 2010, set three years after Travis Touchdown became the top assassin in the United Assassins Association (UAA) and walked away. Travis has returned to Santa Destroy and fights Skelter Helter, who seeks revenge on Travis for killing his older brother Helter Skelter prior to the first game. After winning the battle, he meets Sylvia Christel, who informs him he is ranked as the 51st best assassin. The nearly- dead Skelter Helter interrupts them and warns Travis that he and his co- conspirators will still have their revenge. Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes (2019) Released on Nintendo Switch in 2019, the game is primarily viewed from a top-down perspective as opposed to the third person view of main series. Travis Touchdown fights Badman, the father of Bad Girl, an assassin Travis previously killed. The two are drawn into a possessed video game console, and must fight through its various games. As the first title Suda has directed since the first No More Heroes, Suda has collaborated with several indie developers to feature elements from their games in Travis Strikes Again. While part of the No More Heroes story, Suda does not consider the game a direct sequel to the previous title No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, but a fresh start for the character Travis. No More Heroes III (2021) To be released on Nintendo Switch in 2021, No More Heroes III takes place 9 years after No More Heroes 2 and 2 years after Travis Strikes Again, and has Travis return to his hometown of Santa Destroy from his exile. He encounters a huge artificial metropolis floating in the sea, and a mysterious flying object high above the city. Travis now has to defend the world from a super powerful army of aliens. =Spin-offs= No More Heroes: World Ranker (2012) Released on Android and iOS in 2012 in Japan only, players can create their own assassin and complete missions, killing assassins to move up in rank. It featured touchscreen controls and multiplayer/social elements. The game has been since removed from servers.

Great Barrier Reef controversy With Piers Larcombe, Ridd wrote an opinion piece in November 2017, published in the January 2018 issue of Marine Pollution Bulletin, challenging the prevailing understanding of the state of the Great Barrier Reef, drawing attention to what he argued was a reproducibility crisis and certain specific papers relating to the state of the Great Barrier Reef, and recommending a new review body for policy science. A Viewpoint article in rebuttal was printed in the April 2018 issue of Marine Pollution Bulletin by Schaffelke et al. Ridd replied in a further article in the June 2019 issue. Dismissal from James Cook University Beginning in April 2016, James Cook University took a number of disciplinary measures against Ridd, which culminated in Ridd being fired. The university denied that the dismissal was over Ridd's views on climate change. Ridd filed two crowdfunded lawsuits, the second over the dismissal. On 16 April 2019, Ridd won the lawsuit, with James Cook University found to be in violation of the Fair Work Act 2009; in September 2019, Ridd was awarded in excess of AU$1 million, together with AU$125,000 pecuniary penalty.

The site has been a protected area for a very long time, beginning with Peter the Great designating local territory as a 'protected ship grove' for wood to build ships. The site also has high ecological value as forest-steppe land. Administratively, the park is in the Zmiiv District of Kharkiv Oblast, about 50 km south of the regional city of Kharkiv. Topography The park is composed of a series of protected and recreational areas along both banks of the middle reaches of the Donets River and the Gomolshy River. The right banks of the river is hilly spurs of the Middle Russian Uplands, ranging up to 100 meters above the river. The left bank is generally flat plain of the East European Plain Included on the grounds are many archaeological sites and monuments of historical importance from all eras of Ukrainian history, from the Bronze Age (second millennium BC) to the time of Kyivan Rus. Climate and ecoregion The Homilsha Woods area has a Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Precipitation in the general region averages 450 mm/yr. The average temperature in August is . Holmosh Woods is in the transition zone between the East European forest steppe ecoregion (on the north) and the Pontic–Caspian steppe ecoregion (on the south). Flora and fauna The terrain is one of hills and ravines, with maple-ash-oak forests on the slopes of the right bank, and pine forests on the sandy terraces of the left bank. The forested areas are bordered by wet and dry meadows, with numerous small lakes. 500 hectares of the forest are 130–150 years old, with some oaks 200–300 years old. There are 850 species of higher plants that have been recorded in the park, with 138 of them listed as rare. 50 species of fish are found in the lakes and streams, 153 species of birds, and 53 species of mammals.

These workers are typically women who have immigrated from South Korea, though there are also Latina and Chinese immigrants employed by these shops. The majority of women who work in these nail salons are paid low wages, exposed to dangerous chemicals because of weak regulations, and develop complicated relationships with their clients, largely due to language differences and contradicting views on what constitutes quality customer service. Most Korean-owned nail salons are located in New York, and in reaction to a 2015 New York Times exposé documenting corruption within the state's nail salon industry, Gov. Andrew Cuomo created the New York State Nail Industry Enforcement Task Force, and signed into law stricter salon regulations and required the posting of wage bonds.  Entry into the workforce  There are several factors influencing why so many immigrant women work in Korean nail salons. It often has to do with the fact that they do not have to be proficient in English in order to do their jobs, they get paid in cash, the hours are somewhat flexible, and if they are undocumented they will struggle to get a job elsewhere. They are often introduced to this work through family, friends, church members, or neighbors, though some do find work through ad sections in Korean newspapers. Another reason nail salon workers join the industry is that they do not always have to become licensed. Depending on the state it can take hundreds of hours to get a license. Sometimes a worker has to have graduated high school, or have a certain level of English proficiency. Often the beauty schools only teach in English, making it difficult for immigrants to obtain their license.Sharma, Preeti, Saba Waheed, Vina Nguyen, Lina Stepick, Reyna Orellana, Liana Katz, Sabrina Kim, and Katrina Lapira. “Nail Files: A Study of Nail Salon Workers and Industry in the United States.” UCLA Labor Center. California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative. November 2018. https://www.labor.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NAILFILES_FINAL.pdf Despite this being illegal, many employers hire unlicensed workers anyway. In some cases employers make new employees pay to get the job and to be taught how to do manicures.  Ethnic hierarchies  Koreans own around seventy to eighty percent of the nail salons in New York, and four percent of foreign born salon workers come from South Korea. There is a socio-ethnic hierarchy in the state's nail salon industry. Korean workers are often paid more and can find jobs in more expensive areas. Some Korean salon owners have even been vocal about their low opinions of non-Korean workers, and some Latina and Chinese workers have talked about facing discrimination and ostracization in Korean-owned salons. In 2012 a group of Chinese workers sued the Korean nail salon chain Babi Nail Salons for paying them $3.00 or less a day, suffering abusive behavior from the owner, not being allowed to take breaks, and dealing with racist comments. They won the lawsuit and were supposed to collect over $400,000 in damages, but the owner has only paid them a small portion, citing that he does not have the money. The president of the Korean Nail Salon Association of New York denied any widespread racial or ethnic prejudice from Korean business owners toward non-Korean workers.  Language, employers, and customer service  For Korean immigrant women entering the nail salon industry, it can be very helpful for them to have an employer who also speaks their language and sometimes it is the only way they can get work; but it often comes at a cost. A worker's inability to find another job because of their low English proficiency can be taken advantage of by employers because they know that their workers cannot leave. So they will mistreat them, pay them low wages, and have them work for long hours. Language is also a source of tension and contention between workers and customers in Korean nail salons. It is common for manicurists to talk to each other in Korean when they are working, often to the irritation and discomfort of customers. Customers can feel that they are being slighted and excluded by workers when they do not speak English, or that it is improper to speak Korean when they are around Americans. Clients also tend to feel suspicious that they are being talked about or made fun of by workers. Customers often think of workers speaking Korean over English as a choice and a show of obstinance instead of something necessary for them to easily communicate. Sometimes workers purposely do not learn English or let on that they can understand and speak it, despite the fact that they usually get better tips if they do. The reasons for this vary. Some workers find small talk burdensome, as they want to finish their jobs and move on to the next customer; carrying a conversation is hard when they struggle with English, and they are often already exhausted by their work. Others feel a sense of community when they speak Korean with each other. There are manicurists who will not learn English because they do not feel the need to change or cater to the desires of customers, and shifting the power dynamic between themselves and the client is a way to regain a sense of agency. Yet there are customers who come to nail salons not just to get their nails done, but to be pampered. They want an experience, and a part of that experience is feeling like workers care about their comfort, are interested in their lives, and are happy to do their nails. That is also why Korean salons started offering massages; they make the client feel special and it gives them an edge when competing with Chinese salons. Depending on the class level of the client, if they do not feel cared for it is usually reflected in the tip, whether or not they return to the shop, or in their preference for certain workers who do fulfill that emotional connection. If they are primarily going to Korean salons because they want to get their nails done for cheap, chances are they will continue to patronize the business.  Income and wage theft  It is common for nail salon workers to be misclassified by their employers as independent contractors, instead of employees. When a worker is classified as an independent contractor they are not covered by labor laws relating to overtime, breaks, minimum wage requirements, sick time, paid vacation, Social Security, harassment, or discrimination. There are varying reports on how much money workers make in Korean nail salons, though it is typically around $30.00 to $80.00 a day; they often work for ten hours a day, and almost every day of the week. Sometimes newcomers only earn $10.00 depending on their employer. When asked about wage theft and underpayment by Sarah Nir, theTimes reporter who wrote the industry-changing exposé, Sangho Lee, the then president of the Korean American Nail Salon Association, refused to comment. He believed that to answer any questions would negatively impact Korean Nail Salons, because of how many owners did not pay minimum wage. Korean nail salon owners subsequently denied that they were stealing money from their employees. In June 2018 nail salon workers came together to speak at a New York State government hearing to advocate for the elimination of tipped wages, or sub- minimum wage. Workers argued that having their wages determined by the fact that they may get tips causes instability of income and a dependency on the generosity of customers. The prevalence of Korean nail salons in New York came partially from the fact that these salons offered cheaper options for manicures and pedicures, which opened up the industry to customers across the economic spectrum. Yet, the cheaper the prices posted by the salon, the less tip money the workers will receive. The director of the Korean Nail Salon Association, Donald Yu commented on this issue by saying that most workers make more money with the tipped wages than they would without them. An increase in wages, he argued, would cause an increase in prices, which would make customers not want to leave tips at all. He also mentioned that owners are struggling to survive with increasing prices in rent, tools, and with the pressure of competition, salons may have to close which will result in job loss for workers. Another way that immigrant women in nail salons bring in money is by participate in rotating credit associations, or kyes. RCAs are specific to the nail salon workers who are Korean. These workers create and maintain kyes for a number of reasons, but the biggest incentive to join is the sense of community, support, and trust established amongst co-ethnic women workers. Immigrating to the U.S. can be incredibly difficult, and being a part of a RCA helps these nail salon workers feel connected to home and more grounded in the U.S. There is, of course financial incentive to joining. The money members receive go into a number of things: college tuition for their children, capital for their own nail salons, rent, vacations, or savings in case of emergencies. It is also a way for undocumented immigrants to use a more informal system of saving, as creating financial accounts through official institutions is difficult.  Health risks  There are ingredients in nail products that are known to cause cancer and have been linked to reproductive issues. Dibutyl phthalate, toluene, and formaldehyde, alternately known as the \\"toxic trio,\\" are three of the most common chemicals used in nail products. Dibutyl phthalate can have an adverse effect on reproduction and development, formaldehyde is a carcinogen, and toluene can negatively effect both the nervous and reproductive systems. There is so little research on the effects of long term exposure to these chemicals and fumes, that there are not concrete conclusions, but many of the workers in nail salons report having similar health complications, such as asthma, fungal infections, nose bleeds, burning eyes, skin discoloration, coughing, nausea, aching necks and backs, and cancer. Miscarriages are also a common occurrence among these workers, as well as stillbirths and developmental delays in the children that they are able to bring to term. It is legal for cosmetic companies to use these chemicals. While the FDA does regulate cosmetic ingredients, it does not have the authority to recall products without having to face litigation, to require that companies test the safety of ingredients before they go on the market, to do their own review of products before they are released, nor can they force companies to provide them with the results or conclusions reached through in- house studies of the health effects of certain products. This allows products with the toxic trio, or other dangerous ingredients, to be released as long as companies and manufacturers report that the product is safe if used as directed (painting nails with the polish instead of ingesting it). Not taken into account by the FDA's mandate, which was written into law around eighty years ago, is the long term effects of being exposed to these chemicals, what it does to the body to being around a mixture of these chemicals every day for hours at a time, or the multiple ways for these chemicals to enter the system, including inhalation and skin absorption. It is also legal for these companies to not label the ingredients on the product package when selling to salons, though when the product is sold in a retail store the ingredients must be listed. This, combined with low English proficiency, leaves workers without the ability to know what is in the products they are using. Despite releasing a guide for nail salon workers to stay safe, OSHA has not updated its policies surrounding chemical exposure for workers since the 1970s. Specifically, they have not updated their Permissible Exposure Limits, despite acknowledging that they are out of date and not comprehensive enough.\\"Stay Healthy and Safe While Giving Manicures and Pedicures: A Guide for Nail Salon Workers.\\" OSHA: Occupational Safety and Health Administration. U.S. Department of Labor. https://www.osha.gov/Publications/3542nail-salon-workers-guide.pdf PELs determine the safe and legal amount of time a worker can be around chemicals, as well as the extent of the exposure level. Like the FDA, OSHA has not made policy changes that take into account the long term effects of being exposed to multiple chemicals for long periods of time, as well the lack of proper ventilation in some shops, which serves to make the exposure to these ingredients worse. PELs also do not take into account the age and gender of workers, which may influence what constitutes safe versus unsafe. Several advocate groups have formed in response to the lack of regulations regarding nail salon worker health, like the California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative, the Safe Nail Salon Project, New York Healthy Nail Salons Coalition, and National Healthy Nail and Beauty Salon Alliance. Many of the activists that work in these groups are former nail salon workers themselves, who have experienced first hand the effects of working in nail salons. These organizations call for tighter government regulation of chemicals and ingredients, proper education for workers on how to handle certain chemicals, the circulation of translated materials, and the provision of masks, gloves, and proper ventilation. It is not a choice for many workers to leave the nail salon business to improve their health. Being an immigrant woman who speaks little English impacts their ability to find other work. It is also difficult for them to receive medical treatment if their doctor does not speak their language, or if they are uninsured and undocumented. While the EU has banned more than 1,300 chemicals from being used in cosmetics, the U.S. has banned less than twelve, and despite there being around 10,000 chemicals in nail products, only eleven percent of those have been tested for safety by an independent agency.  Aftermath of the New York Times exposé  The majority of change in the nail salon industry has been in New York, largely because the Times article focused on corruption in New York. The Times article was released in May 2015, and within a few days Cuomo issued emergency orders to fight against wage theft and hazardous working conditions. He created the New York State Nail Industry Enforcement Task Force to investigate New York's nail salons and enforce new rules and regulations that would protect workers. Cuomo ordered that all nail salons post wage bonds, which work as a kind of insurance for workers that guarantees that they will get paid for their work, even if the salon closes. If salons do not comply with the order they will be shut down. Cuomo also order that employers post a workers' bill of rights inside the salon, written in multiple languages, including Korean. The Bill of Rights for Nail Workers includes information on how much money workers should make depending on the location of the salon and if they do or do not receive tips. It also informs workers that their employers must provide them with gloves, respirators for when they are working with artificial nails, as well as eye protection when they are handling chemicals. The employees are also informed that they cannot be denied a meal break, denied safety gear, or made to pay for their entry into their jobs. A hotline was also created for workers to report violations and abuse. The Korean Nail Salon Association of New York sued Cuomo over these new regulations and laws, specifically those that had to do with wage bonds, arguing that because the majority of nail salon owners were Asian, they were being unfairly targeted and that it constituted discrimination. They also felt discriminated against specifically as nail salon owners, and that other beauty industries were not being made to make the same changes. This led to owners raising their prices, and responding that this would hurt not only their business but the jobs of the workers because they may not be able to afford to keep them hired. They also argued that they were not given enough time to purchase the bonds. By December 2015 the lawsuit had been thrown out. In 2016 Cuomo instituted new rules surrounding the implementation of ventilation in salons that sought to expel air contaminates from the salon to outdoors. While the Korean Nail Salon Association of New York warned against it, a number of Korean nail salon owners decided to sue Cuomo over the new rules, citing that the new ventilation system was too expensive, and that research had not properly proven that the fumes and chemicals from nail products were toxic. The suit was thrown out in 2017. Within a year of its creation the task force found over 600 wage violations in 143 salons; as a result these salons were ordered to pay two million dollars to 652 employees in unpaid wages.

The area includes a landscape of rolling dairy farms on the site of a former ancient forest. Some native bush remains, including the first privately natural feature in New Zealand protected by covenant. History and culture =Early history= The Ngāti Kahupungapunga tribe were the first to settle the area. Ngāti Raukawa followed in the 16th century. European settlers arrived in the late 19th century, clearing most of the land for farmland by the end of the century. A school was established at Waotu in 1886 and relocated to its current site in 1969. =19th century= Young men from Waotu made a long journey into Hamilton in 1915 to enlist for service in World War I. The Duxfield Reserve picnic site was donated by councillor John Duxfield in 1968. The 16-hectare Jim Barnett Reserve, established in 1992, features Totara and Rimu. An ancient bush survived at this site during the Taupo Volcano eruption of 186 CE, but much of it was harvested for timber during the 1920s. A further 50 hectare site was cleared for farming in the 1970s. This prompted a neighbouring couple, Gordon and Celia Stephenson, to co-found the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust in 1977. In 1979 they became the first landowners in New Zealand to covenant private land, opting to protect 4 hectares of remaining native bush on their farm. =20th century= English student Matthew Purchase was shot during a hunting trip in Waotu in 2009. He survived with serious injuries.

A patron of the arts and literature, he was also a writer and playwright himself. He was also an administrator, a magistrate for Visakhapatnam by the Madras government in 1914 and involved in the delineation of the state of Odisha. Early life Vikram Dev was born in Sri Mukhalingam, Parvatalapeta of Srikakulam Taluk to Rekha Devi and Prince Krishna Chandra Dev who was the younger brother of Maharajah Sir Sri Sri Vikram Dev III K.C.I.E.. Evidently, Krishna Chandra left his home after the coronation of his brother. Vikram's mother died when he was nine and his father died six years later. He was adopted by the Madugula Raja family and known as Madugula Raju although this adoption was challenged in court in 1881. He learned English from J.S. Bard at Vizag and became an expert in Telugu, Odia and Sanskrit. He became a writer in all these languages and was awarded an honorary doctor of literature and made a Sahitya Samrat by the Andhra Bharati Tirtha Research University on 6 May 1933. He married the daughter of Sulochana of Nawrangpur who belonged to the royalty of Patna. A philanthropist, he donated to the cause of Andhra University and helped establish various cultural and educational institutions. Statue of ‘Sahitya Samarat’ HH Maharajah Vikram Dev IV D.Litt. in Andhra University, Visakhapatnam Contribution to Art and Literature Long before he was crowned as the king of Jeypore, Vikram Dev was a renowned scholar who gained expertise in five languages - Sanskrit-Hindi, Odia, Telugu, Bengali and English. He acquired enough fame through his contribution to the combined literature of all these languages. He was awarded D. Lit and the honorary title of 'Sahitya Samrat' by the Andhra Bharati Tirtha Research University in 1933. He wrote Telugu dramas like ‘Shree Nivas Kalyan Natak’, ‘Krushnarjuna Charitam’ and ‘Manavati Charitam’ that were staged in the iconic 'Jagannmitra Hall' established by the king which was seen as a noble attempt to flourish art and culture among the populace of the city. He annually invited and honored 100 learned scholars from all over India and donated one lac every year to the Andhra University. He donated two million rupees to fund the Andhra University which was ordered to be shifted to Guntur.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/au-to- celebrate-150th-birth-anniv-of-maharaja-vikram-deo/articleshow/69949545.cms He was one of the main writers of newspapers and Journals such as Nav-Bharat, Sahakar, Navin, Shishir, etc. He also contributed to the religious writings by authoring ‘Bhagawad Gita Mahatmya’ his first writing in Odia, ‘Sarasa Gitavali’ in his youth and wrote many strotras Kavacham and Chautisha etc. He served as the pro-chancellor of Utkal University and Andhra University. Philanthropist Vikram Dev contributed more to education than any other king in the region of Kalinga (South-east Odisha & North Andhra). He did not only save Andhra University by donating millions but also made sure that it is well established and efficient for his subjects. Therefore, he donated one lac rupees annually to the Andhra University. He donated one lac thirty thousand rupees to the S.C.B. Medical college at Cuttack and few thousand rupees to the post-graduate scholarship to Utkal University. A major portion of his donations contributed in laying the foundation of the first theatre hall of Visakhapattnam known as 'Jagannmitra Hall' and Jeypore College of Technology and Science. He founded an arts and crafts school named after his first cousin a.k.a. Maharajah Vikram Dev III KCIE in Jeypore which is now a government college. He bore all the cost of publications for some renowned writers that he interacted with in his time as the chancellor.

Ortiz survived and received emergency medical treatment, while an investigation quickly resulted in the arrest of several suspects in the attack. The suspected shooter was identified as Rolfi Ferreira Cruz. It was quickly reported that the attack was a paid hit job. On June 19, the Dominican Attorney General announced that Ortiz was shot by mistake, with another person named Sixto David Fernandez being the intended target of the shooting. Accounts of the event changed over time, leading to doubts about the truthfulness of the official account. Background Ortiz was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. Although he has lived in numerous other places during his career, and has resided in Miami with his wife Tiffany and two of their children since 2017, he has continued to maintain a home in the Dominican Republic. According to Ortiz's friends in the Dominican Republic, Ortiz often went to popular nightspots with them without any security presence, \\"trusting his fans to protect him.\\" Shooting Security camera footage revealed that on June 9, 2019, at approximately 5:40 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time, one of the suspects involved in the shooting, Alberto Miguel Rodriguez Mota arrived at the Dial Bar and Lounge in East Santo Domingo. Rodriguez Mota waited for several hours for the arrival of the intended target of the attack, Sixto David Fernandez, a friend of David Ortiz. After Fernandez arrived and sat down at his usual table, Rodriguez Mota took a picture of him, but the picture was blurry and the black pants being worn by Fernandez were obscured by a white object in the bar. Rodriguez Mota texted the picture to Jose Eduardo Ciprian, an inmate at 15 de Azua prison. Ciprian then texted the picture to another suspect Gabriel Alexander Perez Vizcaíno, who showed the picture to several other suspects in a meeting at a gas station. In the interim, however, Ortiz had arrived at the bar wearing white pants, and wearing a patterned shirt similar to that being worn by Fernandez, and sat next to Fernandez at the same table. Just prior to the incident, security camera footage showed two men on a motorcycle allegedly planning the attack with a man in a car near the bar where the shooting took place. At approximately 8:50 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time, Ortiz was \\"ambushed by a man who got off a motorcycle\\", saw Ortiz wearing white pants, and shot him with a single bullet in the back. Jhoel López, a Dominican TV host who was with Ortiz, was also wounded in the leg during the shooting. Medical response According to Ortiz's spokesperson, Ortiz underwent a six-hour operation performed by three local physicians at the Abel Gonzalez Clinic. During the surgery, a portion of his intestines and colon, as well as his gallbladder, were removed; liver damage was also reported. On June 10, a medical flight sent by Ortiz's former team, the Boston Red Sox, brought Ortiz to Boston, so he could receive further treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). He underwent a second surgery shortly after arriving at MGH, and was reported to be \\"making good progress toward recovery.\\" A spokesman for Ortiz reported that it was considered to be a good sign that Ortiz was able to walk a few steps \\"just one day after surgery.\\" Tiffany Ortiz released a statement on June 13 indicating that her husband was \\"in guarded condition in the surgical intensive care unit,\\" advised that his condition was upgraded to \\"good\\" on June 18, and that he was moved out of intensive care on June 22. On July 11, the Red Sox released an update on behalf of Tiffany Ortiz, noting that her husband had undergone a third surgery, at MGH, and was \\"recovering well and is in good spirits.\\" After more than six weeks at MGH, he was released from the hospital on July 26, 2019. López, struck by the same bullet that passed through Ortiz, was injured in the right thigh and did not need surgery. On July 29, in his first Instagram comments since leaving the hospital, Ortiz stated, \\"too bad I can't crush food yet\\". He made his first public appearance on September 9, throwing out a ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park. Investigation and legal response The first person to be arrested was Eddy Feliz Garcia, who reportedly fell off the motorcycle used to transport the shooter, and was beaten by patrons of the bar before being taken into custody. By June 12, six suspects had been arrested in relation to the shooting and more were being sought. Police Major General Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte revealed that the alleged organizer of the attack was promised 400,000 Dominican pesos (approximately $7,800) to carry out the attack. By June 14, eight men and one woman had been arrested and charged in connection with the attack. Police also recovered the gun used in the attack, a Browning Hi-Power 9mm. On June 14, a 10th suspect turned himself in to police. Also on June 14, prosecutors announced that they would reveal the motive and a \\"full narrative of how the case happened\\" within the following week. On June 18, law enforcement officials identified an eleventh suspect in police custody, Franklin Junior Merán, whom they alleged to have rented one of the vehicles involved in the attack. Among the suspects arrested was 25-year-old Rolfi Ferreira Cruz (also reported as Rolfi Ferreras Cruz and Rolfy Ferreyra Cruz), who was indicated by authorities to be the suspected shooter. Cruz was noted to be wanted in connection with several robberies and firearms-related charges in New Jersey. After Cruz was arrested for the shooting, he released a statement from his confinement claiming that Ortiz was \\"not his intended victim,\\" asserting that although he was hired to kill someone, the intended target was described by what they would be wearing, and that he mistakenly shot Ortiz because he \\"got confused by his clothing.\\" A Dominican prosecutor initially dismissed Cruz's explanation as a ploy to avoid being assaulted in jail due to Ortiz's popularity in the Dominican Republic. However, a few days later, Dominican Attorney General Jean Alain Rodríguez announced that the shooting had indeed been a case of mistaken identity, with the intended target of the attack being Sixto David Fernandez, a friend of Ortiz who was a frequent visitor to the bar, and who usually sat in the seat occupied by Ortiz at the time of the shooting. On June 17, Dominican court documents disclosed that Alberto Miguel Rodriguez Mota had been identified as the suspected mastermind of the operation, having allegedly communicated with another suspect a week before the shooting. At the time his name was disclosed, Rodriguez Mota was still at large and being sought. Dominican officials further identified Dominican drug trafficker Víctor Hugo Gómez, a known associate of the Gulf Cartel, and a cousin of the intended victim, as having solicited the murder. According to the authorities, Gómez \\"suspected his relative of betraying him to Dominican drug investigators years earlier.\\" Gómez was arrested by Dominican authorities on June 28, 2019. Following his arrest, it was reported that Gomez was now the suspected mastermind of the shooting. In a news conference on June 30, Dominican authorities said the price for the shooting was $30,000 and not $7,800 as previously claimed. =Named suspects= Suspects identified in the investigation include: * Rolfi Ferreira Cruz, the alleged shooter * Alberto Miguel Rodriguez Mota, alleged to have taken a picture of the intended victim * Víctor Hugo Gómez Vasquez, alleged to have solicited the attack. He has also been charged with federal drug trafficking offenses in Texas. * Jose Eduardo Ciprian, prison inmate alleged to have received and conveyed a picture of the intended victim * Gabriel Alexander Perez Vizcaíno, alleged to have shown the picture of the intended victim to other suspects *Luis Alfredo Rivas Clase, also known as “The Surgeon,\\" who allegedly met Vizcaíno hours before the shooting; Rivas Clase is also wanted in connection with an attempted homicide in Pennsylvania * Eddy Feliz Garcia, alleged to have been on the motorcycle used to transport the shooter * Franklin Junior Merán, alleged to have rented a vehicle involved in the attack *Maria Fernanda Villasmil Manzanilla, \\"The Venezuelan,\\" who was allegedly in the car with Rivas Clase when he met Vizcaíno Reactions News of the shooting was met with messages of love and support for Ortiz from many notable figures, particularly those involved with baseball. Among the players sending such messages were Pedro Martínez, Mike Trout, Alex Rodriguez, David Wells, Marcus Stroman, Nelson Figueroa, and Travis Shaw. Eduardo Núñez of the Red Sox, who was born in the Dominican Republic, said it was unimaginable that Ortiz was shot there, and that it was \\"an international shame.\\" Sports reporter Erin Andrews tweeted a message of support with a Sports Illustrated cover featuring Ortiz posing alongside first responders in the weeks after the Boston Marathon bombing. Former President Barack Obama also tweeted a reminiscence about Ortiz helping the city of Boston recover from the bombing, and \\"wishing him a speedy recovery of his own.\\" Later, in response to the official explanation that Ortiz was shot by mistake, Sports Illustrated said it \\"invites skepticism,\\" while Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe called it \\"simply not believable.\\" Fernandez, identified as the target of the attack, said that he has no enemies and does not look like Ortiz. Dominicans, including Pedro Martínez, have since expressed divided views on the official account, doubting claims made by the government, but also doubting that Ortiz was the actual target of the attack.

As a driver, Opert's race entries included the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. His team, Fred Opert Racing, fielded many notable Formula 1 drivers early in their careers including future Formula One World Champions Keke Rosberg, Alan Jones and Alain Prost, as well as future IndyCar champion Bobby Rahal. Racing career Opert raced sports cars and single-seater formula cars until 1970. He raced an Austin-Healey Sprite; a Jaguar XK150S; Elva Couriers; Porsche 911s; Chevron Sports cars; Brabham formula cars; and Chevron formula cars. He won the US North Eastern Championship in 1966 and the SCCA North Eastern Division Championship in 1969 driving Brabhams – a BT21A and a BT29, and entered 1969's inaugural IMSA event at Pocono. (Excerpted from IMSA 1969-1989 by Mitch Bishop and Mark Raffauf, Octane Press) He also raced in long distance races including the Daytona 24-hour and Sebring 12-hour in 1965, '66, '67 and '68. Fred Opert Racing: Formula Atlantic/Pacific/Mondial and Formula 2 Opert imported British sports and racing cars into the USA from the early sixties until 1978. The models he imported included the Elva Courier; Brabham; Chevron; Titan; Tui; and Tiga. Opert ran a turnkey racing business where drivers could buy or rent racing cars from him and have them prepared and transported to race meetings by his mechanics. (From The Fred Opert Story by Peter R Hill, Veloce Publishing) He also ran professional drivers for whom he could attract sponsorship or who brought sponsorship with them. The New York Times wrote that \\"Opert indicated that the primary reason he began fielding teams was to sell the race cars he imported—Chevron, Titan, Supernova and Brabham\\" but that 'now' (in 1978) Opert said he was in it “just because of the racing.” Fred Opert Racing's Keke Rosberg in pursuit of Gilles Villeneuve at the Edmonton International Speedway during the 1977 Formula Atlantic season Over fourteen years many future Formula 1 drivers including Alan Jones, Alain Prost, Bobby Rahal, Jacques Laffite, Didier Pironi, Jean-Pierre Jarier, Héctor Rebaque, Rolf Stommelen, Patrick Tambay, Peter Gethin, Tom Pryce and Rupert Keegan, all drove for Fred Opert Racing. Keke Rosberg was the driver whose name is most often linked with Opert as the American funded the Finn's racing in Formula Pacific, Formula Atlantic and Formula 2. Fred Opert Racing competed in the USA; Canada; Argentina; Colombia; Venezuela; Mexico; New Zealand; Japan; Macau; and many European countries. The Argentinian races were F2 Temporada in 1978 where Opert ran Rosberg in a Chevron B42. Fred Opert Racing School Opert established one of the USA's first motor racing schools in 1971. The school was at Bridgehampton and the first instructor was New Zealand racing driver Bert Hawthorne. An advertorial for the school appeared in the New York Magazine on 10 April 1972, four days before Hawthorne was killed racing at Hockenheim. Mexican Freddy van Beuren took over after Hawthorne's death. The school moved to Pocono in 1973 when the Bridgehampton track was sold to property developers. After the school moved an advertorial appeared in the June 1973 edition of Popular Mechanics. When van Beuren returned to Mexico, Swedish driver Bertil Roos became the chief instructor and eventually took over the school and rebranded it under his own name. Formula 1 Opert with his ATS F1 Team at the 1979 Monaco Grand PrixWith the demise of Chevron racing cars after the 1978 death of its founder Derek Bennett, Opert gave up running his own teams and took on the role of Team Manager with the ATS Formula 1 team, a \\"notorious\\" job - according to Motor Sport magazine - with \\"the highest turnover in motorsport\\". Opert soon became one of many casualties at ATS, resigning after the 1979 French Grand Prix following team owner Günter Schmid's decision to pull the ATS car from the race.  Return to team ownership Opert returned briefly and tragically to team ownership in 1983 when he put together a Formula Atlantic team for his friend Olivier Chandon de Brailles. Chandon was killed when he was testing an Opert Ralt Formula Atlantic car at Moroso Motorsports Park (now Palm Beach International Raceway) in Florida, preparing for the WCAR Formula Atlantic (Mondial) Championship that would start in April. Later years Opert turned his back on motorsport after the 1983 death of Chandon in one of his cars. Later in his life he took an active interest in Nico Rosberg's career, attending F1 races to follow Rosberg's fortunes. He died not long after attending the Hungarian Grand Prix then visiting Germany but missing 2016 German Grand Prix, because he was too ill. Later that year Nico Rosberg won the World Championship title.

Attendance varies with weather and time of year, usually ranging from hundreds in the winter months to low thousands in the summer. Established in 2007, it was the original 'bike party' now replicated in other cities around the world. Its motto is \\"Building community through cycling\\".  Monthly ride  San Jose Bike Party's rides are on the 3rd Friday of each month. The ride begins at 8pm, with a suggested meet-up time of 7:30pm. There is a different route and title theme for each month. The distance ranges from 15-30 miles. The route is announced on email, the web site and social media 24-48 hours before the ride. The relatively short notice of the route announcements started as a preventative measure against unruly riders who caused some mischief. =Regroup points= San Jose Bike Party at regroup point on July 19, 2019 San Jose Bike Party at regroup point on October 18, 2019 Two regroup points along the route allow everyone to catch up. They serve as rest and party stops. The overall pace is slow enough that some families bring their kids. The regroup points often have food trucks and DJ'ed music. =Nighttime rides= The 8pm start time, after the evening commute, means the regular monthly rides are always night rides. The ride starts before sunset from May to August at San Jose's latitude. California law requires lights and reflectors for cycling on public streets at night. = November 2018 ride cancellation = EPA air quality map showing unhealthy air in the SF Bay Area due to smoke from the Camp Fire on the day of SJ Bike Party's November 2018 ride cancellation San Jose Bike Party usually rides regardless of weather. The ride of November 16, 2018 was the first time a ride was cancelled. The reason for the cancellation was unhealthy air quality. The entire Bay Area was affected by wind-blown smoke from the Camp Fire far to the north in Butte County. For 2 days including the day of the monthly ride, the Air quality index in the Bay Area exceeded 200, a level indicating \\"very unhealthy\\" air. The same route from the cancelled ride was rerun, as well as the \\"Cartoon/Anime Ride\\" theme, in June 2019 under direction of the same ride leader volunteer who had originally prepared it. Emphasis on civility and safety San Jose Bike Party at a regroup point on May 17, 2019 San Jose Bike Party differentiates itself from protest rides such as nearby San Francisco's Critical Mass. Bike Party is a social event, not a protest. The organization encourages riders to ride safely, obey rules of the road and set a good example for others as much as possible. They repeatedly remind riders of 6 rules as \\"How we ride\\". * Stop at lights * Stay to the right * Pack your Trash * Roll Past Conflict * Ride Sober * Be nice Making a point about safety is relevant. Accidents and injuries have occasionally occurred. Visits by politicians Mostly during election seasons, San Jose's Mayor and City Council members or candidates for those offices have ridden with San Jose Bike Party. City Councilman Pierluigi Oliverio wrote an op-ed for San Jose Inside about his experience riding with Bike Party in March 2009. Bike Party has also attracted visiting politicians. There have been two occurrences of participation by mayors of sister city Dublin, Ireland. In both cases a special event ride was arranged on a weekend afternoon with a shorter route to fit the schedule of the Mayor's visit to San Jose. The ride for Lord Mayor Andrew Montague was on March 11, 2012. The ride for Lord Mayor Oisín Quinn was on March 9, 2014. Bike to the Bay 2019 group on the Guadalupe River Trail on October 13, 2019 San Jose Bike Party has since 2016 assisted organizing the annual \\"Bike to the Bay\\" event led by Santa Clara County Supervisor Dave Cortese. It is a group bicycle ride held in October along the Guadalupe River Trail from near downtown to Alviso Marina County Park for the Day on the Bay festival.  Organization  Established in 2007, San Jose Bike Party was the original 'bike party', now replicated in other cities. It was originally founded as an informal association. It later achieved non-profit incorporation in 2014 so it could accept donations and work with the city on events. The organization can use the Volunteer Protection Act to shield volunteers from liability when acting on behalf of the organization. It remains an all-volunteer organization with no employees.  Awards  San Jose Bike Party was awarded \\"2019 Environmental Organization of the Year\\" by the Santa Clara County chapter of the League of Conservation Voters.

Hanna's style was based in swing but open to bop and later styles, and since he was very much a two-handed pianist, his solo outing is a constant delight\\".

The Bertram House (), located on Hiddingh Campus, of the University of Cape Town on Government Avenue, in Gardens, is the only surviving unpainted red brick two-story house left from early Georgian architecture in the city. The house has a special place in the history of the South African architecture. In 1962, it was declared a national monument, and today remains a provincial heritage site in accordance with the National Heritage Resources Act (25/1999). In 1839, John Barker, an attorney who had emigrated from Yorkshire to Cape Colony in 1823, purchased the land. He built his family home there from 1839 to 1854 and named it after his wife, Ann Bertram Findlay, who had died in 1838. After the house passed through several families, the University of Cape Town used it for offices from 1903 onward. In 1930, the building became state property, and in 1976, it was placed at the disposal of the South African Cultural History Museum. In 1983 and 1984, the building was thoroughly restored. Ornamental bricks were introduced and slate was imported from Wales to bring the facade to its original glory. At the same time, the interior was repainted in the original dark green and ocher. The lobby is decorated in the Regency style. Since then, it has operated as a museum. The museum is the home of the Anne Lidderdale Collection, which includes Georgian furniture and English and Chinese porcelain donated by some of the leading English families of the early 19th-century Cape. Nowadays, beadwork and postage stamps are exhibited, and the building is known for book launches and music concerts.  Sources  * Oberholster, J.J.. Die historiese monumente van Suid-Afrika.

Since parts of the AOR have had been covered by the Chernobyl excursion zone the brigade is planned to be also embarked in a specialized CBRN defense capability in the coming years. The Jager (Ukrainian: єгерська) designation of the brigade, the first Ukrainian unit to bear this title after more than a century, is of German origin in the same-named light infantry formations of the German Army, the defunct Austro-Hungarian Army and in the former Imperial Russian Army, which stationed such units in the past in the Kiev and Odessa Military Districts.

Mount Alpenglow is the highest peak alongside Turnagain Arm, and although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the northern aspect of the mountain rises nearly a vertical mile in only one mile from the sea-level shores. The summit of Penguin Peak offers another good view of Alpenglow directly across the arm. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1969 by the United States Geological Survey. The mountain was so named since it often displays the post-sunset pink glow known as alpenglow for travelers on the Seward Highway and skiers at Alyeska Resort. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Alpenglow is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

It is part of the Sandakan Heritage Trail.  History  The cemetery was founded in 1890 by Madam Kinoshita Kuni (born 7 July 1854) from Futae Village, Amakusa County, Kumamoto Prefecture, a successful Japanese female manager of Sandakan's lucrative for Japanese prostitutes who died in the business with most of the graves belonged to women. Madam Okuni is a very influential and kind woman who fluent in English with many Yamato nadeshiko (Japanese girls) sought her guidance and protection with the treatment as a human beings of the girls in her brothel were much better than in the other Japanese brothels in Sandakan where she is called as the \\"Okuni\\" of South Seas. Herself was raised from a poor family before becoming the mistress of an Englishman in Yokohama at a young age. When her husband returned to England, she moved to Sandakan and opening a general store including a brothel. In 1891, there were already 20 brothels and 71 Japanese prostitutes in Sandakan. The cemetery built by Okuni is for to pray for the souls of Japanese who died in Sandakan where herself had a place reserved in the cemetery when she is still alive; showing that she intended to lived permanently in Sandakan and did not want to return to Japan with all of the grave stones in the cemetery were directly ordered from her homeland country.

History  Ken Stringfellow, a member of The Posies and Big Star, first came together with SALT's other founding members at Abbey Road Studios in London, during July 2015 recording sessions for Supercalifragile, the final album by Game Theory. Stringfellow was producing the posthumous album after the 2013 death of Scott Miller, who had founded Game Theory in the 1980s and The Loud Family in the 1990s. Miller had been a friend and musical collaborator with all three founding members of SALT, who had never previously met one another. Stéphane Schück, a Paris-based physician specializing in public health and epidemiology, had co-written four of Supercalifragiles songs with Miller, and Miller had produced a demo recording by Schück's onetime band, Swan Plastic Swan. When SALT was formed in 2016, multi-instrumentalist Anton Barbeau took on lead vocals and keyboard duties, alongside guitarists Stringfellow and Schück. Two of Schück's former bandmates, bass player Fred Quentin and drummer Benoit Lautridou, later joined the founding trio. Barbeau and Stringfellow, both American expatriates, live in Berlin and Paris, respectively, and the group's debut album was rehearsed in both cities. The album, titled The Loneliness of Clouds, was recorded in Paris and in London at Abbey Road Studios. It was released in June 2019 on Beehive Records, Barbeau's label. The lyrics of its ten songs, all written by Schück, were \\"translated\\" by lead vocalist Barbeau from \\"heavily French'd English into a more standardized tongue.\\"  Critical response  In a Power Popaholic review, SALT was called \\"a power pop supergroup that skipped under the radar\\". Even prior to the release of SALT's first album, critic Bill Kopp of Musoscribe contemplated the term \\"supergroup\\" based on Stringfellow and Barbeau's distinctive musical histories. Kopp suggested: The Big Takeovers Michael Toland recommended the group to \\"aficionados of guitar-based melody and singalong choruses\\", adding that \\"songwriters Schück and Barbeau are plainly incapable of penning anything that doesn't have hooks\\". Toland described SALT's debut album as \\"a bucket of the kind of catchy, slightly psychedelic power pop you'd expect from these folks... Stringfellow uses his producer's seat to guide the tracks toward maximum melodic glory.\\" Babysue wrote, \\"With a lineup like this... you can bet there's no way things couldn't sound rather fantastic.\\" Pointing to XTC, Game Theory, and The Beatles as the group's main influences, the reviewer added: In Stomp and Stammer magazine, Glen Sarvady called The Loneliness of Clouds \\"a solid set of lite psychedelia well suited for fans of the Paisley Underground or Dukes of Stratosphear. The harmony-rich mid-tempo procession gives equal play to guitars and keys, and when the tunes occasionally veer toward the homogeneous, Barbeau's quirks swoop in to clinch the deal.\\"  References   External links   Category:Musical groups established in 2016 Category:Power pop groups Category:French pop music groups Category:French indie rock groups Category:Psychedelic pop music groups ","title":"SALT (band)"},{"id":"61040876","text":"thumb Café Riche is on the corner of Parliament and WF Nkomo Streets, adjoining Church Square, Pretoria, South Africa.

The building was originally known as the Investment Building, but due to Café Riche's popularity, the original name was forgotten. Café Riche is one of the oldest restaurants in Pretoria. The building was designed in the Art Nouveau style popular in Europe from 1894 to 1914. The stone owl on the concrete pedestal, as well as the artwork of 'Mercurius,' is also the work of Van Wouw. The window frames and doors came from the Toringkerk, the second and last church in Church Square with a tower. Café Riche was declared a Provincial Heritage Site and recognized under Article 34 of the National Heritage Resources Act (Law 25/1999), because it was over 60 years old.  Water problems  In September 2015, the possible closure of Café Riche loomed over the building's basement office, which had been underwater as much as five years, after a storm had burst a sewage pipe in the basement. The building, owned by the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development, suffered damage to its foundation. New pumps were installed underneath the building, but they were stolen.

He is a founding member of the Blackbox Collective and Invisible Borders Trans-African Organisation and in 2013, he founded and established The Nlele Institute, where he serves as Director. He is a two-time winner of the Seydou Keita Prize for photography, and he has also won the Jean-Paul Blachere prize. He currently lives and works in Lagos.  Personal life and education  Uche Okpa-Iroha was born on January 2, 1972, to Mr. Nwokocha Okpa-Iroha and Mrs. Chidi Okpa-Iroha. He has four other siblings. The family hails from Abia State in the South Eastern Niger Delta area of Nigeria. Okpa-Iroha is married to Ayo Joy Okpa-Iroha and they have two children. Uche Okpa-Iroha holds a Bachelor of Technology degree in Food Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria which he completed in 1997. In 2013, he completed a two-year research residency and fellowship programme at the Rijksakademie in the Netherlands.  Artistic style  Uche Okpa-Iroha is multidisciplinary, his preference for photography and photojournalism as his preferred mediums is evident in his body of work. His works reflect the diversity and uniqueness of African communities. His contributions to the development of African photography have been inspired by his belief that representation and identity are some of the core issues hampering the development of African photography, based on the influence of stereotypes passed on from periods of colonized ruling. This informs his approach to his work, where he explores both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of inspiration to create various artistic expressions. His visual art style is a fusion of his interest in humanity, his fascination for the variety and complexity of human conditions and the interactions of these elements within their domestic environment that form the everyday realities of the common man and how that shapes the narrative of his culture.  Career  Uche Okpa-Iroha discovered his interest in photography in 2005, when he attended an exhibition hosted by the Nigerian collective Depth of Field (DOF) in London. He became a full-time professional photographer in 2006, having apprenticed under his cousin, the Prince Claus Laureate, Uche James Iroha. The following year, the Black Box Photography Collective was formed by Uche Okpa-Iroha and some friends as a community of photo-artistic enthusiasts. The group organized major exhibitions in Lagos, Nigeria and Havana, Cuba. In 2007, Okpa-Iroha was announced first runner-up of the Life in My City Art and Photography competition, organized by the Alliance Franciase and Rokana Industries in Enugu, Nigeria. In 2008, his first major project “The Under Bridge Life” was favorably received by critics and exposed him to international audiences. The project earned him the Seydou Keita award for the Best Photographic Creation at the 2009 edition of the African Photography Encounters in Bamako and in the same year, he received the Jean-Paul Blachere Foundation Prize for the same work. In 2011, Uche Okpa- Iroha was one of 25 artists selected for a two-year residency research fellowship programme at the Rijksakademie Van Bleeldende Kunsten. The prestigious Rijskakdemie Van Bleeldende Kunsten, which was founded by King William III in 1870 provided Uche the platform for developing his talent on an international scale and further exposed his works to the international community. He has been exhibited in various places including New York, Paris, Canada, Belgium, Spain, Germany, France and Berlin. He was on the Panel of Nominators for WorldPressPhoto's Joop Swart Masterclass selection committee in 2016. He is also a member of the International Federation of Kidney Foundation  Notable works  Plantation Boy (2012) Completed during the final year of his residency at the Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunsten Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the 'Plantation Boy' series see Okpa-Iroha intervening in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film, The Godfather by isolating and appropriating forty original film stills from the seminal movie. Through a process of digital reconstructions, the artist disrupts an iconic Hollywood image with the presence of an African man amongst the familial gangs of an Italian-American subculture. By meticulously placing himself in the frame of the images through strategies of reconstruction and reenactment, he addresses the politics of representation in western cinema that is marked by a striking absence of black bodies. He also challenges stereotypical and subservient representations of African identity by taking center stage within seminal and iconic scenes from the film to demonstrate 'the subjective representation of the presence of an omission' and as a representation of a deviant culture or race that was not originally there. The title situates the work within the black and African quest for freedom and self-determination that arose in the slave plantation era and continues to impact the lives of black subjects globally. He won the Seydou Keita Prize for this Series in 2009. ISOLATED (Series). (2011 — Present) ISOLATED is an ongoing series that Okpa-Iroha began in 2011, It showcases the pervasive informal modes of communication in cities, modes of text, unorthodox advertising and other modes of communication and displaying messages that are on the fringes of the spectrum. Most of the time these images exist as whims and are covered with other materials, as is very common in cities such as Lagos, something he calls the city's response to its having to constantly reshape its commercial geography, leading to the emergence of this novel, organic outlook alongside the dynamic urban language that it sprung. They are mostly in street corners, alleys, private residences, shops, church buildings, electric poles, and even on house lintels. Under the Bridge Life (2009) Under Bridge Life is a series of photographs that portray the \\"Life Under Bridge\\" in Lagos. It showcases the full-fledged ecosystem that thrives under the belly of Lagos bridges, which have become more than just shelters for thousands of residents. This is further enhanced by Lagos's idiosyncratic infrastructure of roads and bridges, the complex neural network that grows the 'Life' organically, even without planning or external support. He won the Seydou Keita Prize for this Series in 2015.

Life and work  His father was a member of the samurai class. In 1872, his family moved to Tokyo. At the age of barely ten, he was already creating Western-style paintings. In 1876, he was enrolled at the new Technical Fine Arts School ((now the Tokyo Institute of Technology), operated by the Ministry of Industry, where he studied for two years under the Italian artist, Antonio Fontanesi. When Fontanesi returned to Italy in 1878, he and several other students including Asai Chū, were unhappy with his replacement and left the school to create their own group, the \\"Association of the Eleventh\\" (十一次会), so called because that was the eleventh year of the Meiji era. It was Japan's first modern art association. In 1880, he went to Italy to continue his education. He initially worked with Cesare Maccari then, in 1881, entered a free school associated with the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. Two years later, he was granted admission to the school itself. He graduated there in 1887. Before returning to Japan, he spent some time in Paris. Once there, he and his old associate, Asai Chū (and others) established the ).

At this time in 1125, Damascus was under threats of the Frankish Crusaders under Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and Isma'ilis from Homs and elsewhere had joined Toghtekin's troops in the Battle of Marj al-Saffar against the Franks in 1126. Toghtekin thus welcomed Bahram. Abu Ali Tahir ibn Sa'id al-Mazadaqani (), the chief vizier of Toghtekin, was partial to the Nizaris, and persuaded Toghtekin to gave a Mission House (dar al-da'wah) in Damascus and the frontier stronghold of Banias to Bahram, who refortified the stronghold and made it his base, performing extensive raids from there and possibly capturing more places. By 1128, their activities had become so formidable that \\"nobody dared to say a word about it openly\\", as described by Ibn al-Qalanisi. Toghtekin thus became anxious about his relations with Bahram. Ibn al-Qalanisi blames al-Mazdaqani, while Ibn al-AthirRichards, D. S., Editor (2010), The Chronicle of Ibn al- Athir for the Crusading Period from al-Kamil fi’l-Ta’rikh. Part 1, 1097-1146., Ashgate Publishing, Farnham, UK, pp. 260-261 blames Toghtekin for the situation. =Death= Bahram was killed in action in Wadi al-Taym on the western slopes of Mount Hermon while fighting local tribes in 1128. Isma'ili presence in Damascus began to decline after his death. He was succeeded by Isma'il al-Ajami, another Persian da'i.

Since 18 December 2018, the Patriarchal parishes in Italy is part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe. As Archbishop Mark (Golovkov) noted: \\"In fact, this structure is an analogy of the diocese\\". Such a structure is similar to an apostolic vicariate in the Roman Catholic Church.  History  = Creation = On 27 December 2007, by decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, the parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Italy were separated from the Diocese of Chersonesus and subordinated to the Bishop of Bogorodsk, vicar of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. On February 2, 2008, Archbishop of Chersonesus, Administrator of the Italian parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate, consecrated building in Rome which is intended for further organize the diocesan administration in it.. In 2011, work began on the creation of a full-fledged diocesan administration at the Stavropegial Church of St. Catherine in Rome. For this purpose, the church had two rooms, which house the Secretariat of the office, the office and the archive. Since that time, issues related to the issuance of documents, registration of certificates, maintaining official correspondence concerning the Italian parishes are resolved through the diocesan administration in Rome, and not in Paris as before. On May 21, 2012, the Administration of the Moscow Patriarchate parishes in Italy () received the status of a legal entity in the Italian Republic. In July 2014, a Libro del Celebrante. Sluzhebnik was published in Italian. The book contains the liturgies of St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil the Great translated in Italian by the Administration of the Moscow Patriarchate parishes in Italy. In 2017 Bishop Anthony (Sevryuk) said that there are 67 parishes in Italy, and that the second-largest diocese of the Moscow Patriarchate abroad is in the Apennines. Ha added that besides Russians, Ukrainians and Moldovans, there are Italians in the patriarchate because of marriage to a member or by their independent choice. = Within the PEWE = On 28 December 2018, in response to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's actions in Ukraine, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decided to create the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe (PEWE) with its center in Paris whose \\"pastoral sphere of responsibility includes\\" Andorra, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Principality of Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, France, and Switzerland. The person chosen to be the primate primate of the PEWE as well as of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Chersonesus was Bishop John (Roschchin) of Bogorodsk who was at the time the administrator of the Patriarchal parishes in Italy; John continued to administer temporalily the Patriarchal parishes in Italy. On February 26, 2019, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church abolished the stauropigial status of the St. Nicholas parish and the St. Catherine parish in Rome and subordinated them to the Administration of the Parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Italy. On May 30, 2019, the Holy Synod of the ROC \\"taking into account the increasing number of Moldovan parishes and communities in Italy, as well as the need for special care of the numerous Moldovan-speaking flock of the Moscow Patriarchate in the Apennines\\" entrusted their archpastoral care to the bishop who bears the title of \\"Bogorodsk\\" as vicar of the Patriarchal Exarch of Western Europe.

Brandy flies in and parachutes out of his aircraft, but lands in a lake. Tommy rescues him in a rowboat, then shows Brandy a scrapbook about the flyer's exploits, who encourages the young man to become a flyer himself. Many years later, Tommy (John Trent) becomes a pilot and is managing an airport in Shreveport, Louisiana. He designs a radio-controlled bombing device that Tommy and his partner Skeeter Milligan (Milburn Stone) are ready to demonstrate to the Army. The Army commander (John Elliott) is very impressed when they score two direct hits. A gang of spies is also watching the test. The spies, who include a much-weathered Brandy, now a drunk running contraband, have been offered half a million dollars for the device from an enemy country. Another spy, Anita (Polly Ann Young), asks to take flying lessons from Tommy as a means of watching him and his operation. When he is tricked by a fake message, Tommy is captured by the spies. As he is being interrogated, a drunk and chagrined Brandy comes into the room. The spies then take Skeeter and Tommy's girl friend, Betty Lou Barnes (Marjorie Reynolds), hostage to force Tommy to give them the plans to the bombing device. Tommy, Skeeter and Betty Lou manage to escape in a biplane. A troop of Army soldiers arrive at the hideout and arrest Anita, while the other spies flee and pursue Tommy in Brandy's aircraft. Brandy, however, radios Tommy to change course and then crashes his aircraft into the ocean. When the spies are captured, a squadron of Army aircraft equipped with the new bombing device become part of a film shot at Shreveport. Tommy, Betty Lou and Skeeter all laugh at the prospect of \\"Tailspin Tommy\\" appearing on the silver screen.

The highest point, at , is Sheen Hill. Hulme End, near the southern boundary, has height ; Knowsley, near the northern boundary, has height . There is a steep escarpment to the River Dove in the east, and the ground falls less steeply to the River Manifold in the west. There is scattered settlement throughout the parish. The parish was described in 1851: \\"The face of the country is here wild and romantic, but the soil about the village is fertile and well enclosed.\\"\\"Sheen\\" GENUKI. Retrieved 11 June 2019. History The name Sheen may come from Old English sceon: shelters (perhaps herdsmen's shelters); or Old English sceone: beautiful. =Prehistoric= There are three Bronze Age bowl barrows. Brund Low, near crossroads north of the hamlet of Brund, is about high and about across; excavations in the 19th century found human cremations and flint and bronze artifacts. Rye Low, a short distance east of Brund, is about high and about across; excavations found deposits of vegetation and insects, also cremated bones and flint artifacts. A barrow near buildings south of Townend is about high and about across; cremations and flint artifacts have been found. =Church= St Luke's Church, Sheen There was a chapel at Sheen by 1185. The present Church of St Luke at Sheen, presumably on the same site, is a Grade II* listed building. Its origins are of the 14th century; it was mostly rebuilt between 1828 and 1832, using stone from Sheen Hill. The church was later described as \\"a well meant but wholly unecclesiastical structure\\". A. J. B. Hope offered to rebuild it at his own expense; the new church, designed by C. W. Burleigh and later by William Butterfield, was consecrated in 1852. =A. J. B. Hope= In about 1850 Sir Alexander James Beresford Beresford Hope, known as A. J. B. Hope, inherited the Beresford estate, which was mostly in Alstonefield, extending into Sheen. He wanted to make Sheen \\"the Athens of the Moorlands\\". He rebuilt the church, and built a new house for the incumbent to the design of William Butterfield. He also built a school with house attached, on glebe land south of the church, and a lending library and reading room, which was opened in 1856. (It closed, for lack of support, in 1889.) It was remarked in The Ecclesiologist that \\"the general effect is that of an ecclesiastical colony in the wilds of Australia\\". Not all Hope's plans were realized. =Buildings= Barn north of Brund, in the west of the parish At Knowsley in the north of the parish is the shaft of a stone cross, 15th-century or later. It was re-erected near its former site in 1897. Broadmeadow Hall, near the River Dove, is a stone farmhouse of the mid-17th century, a Grade II* listed building. It was restored in the 19th century, and in the early 1990s. There was a house here by 1573, when it was acquired by the Sleigh family. During the 17th century it became the manor house of Sheen, until 1709 when Gervase Sleigh sold the manor. The Staffordshire Knot, an inn in Sheen, has had the name since before 1872. In the mid-19th century its name was The Horse Shoe, and was run by John Woolley, a blacksmith. Beresford Manor, in the south-east of the parish, dates from the 17th century, with early 19th-century additions.

The citadel of Afamiyya, briefly held by Abu Tahir al-Sa'igh Abu Tahir was the second Nizari da'i in Syria sent by Hassan-i Sabbah, replacing al-Hakim al- Munajjim, and enjoying alliance with Ridwan. He kept using the Nizari base in Aleppo, while continuing the Nizari strategy of seizing strongholds in pro- Isma'ili areas, focusing on the Jabal al-Summaq highlands located between the Orontes River and Aleppo. At this time, the authority over the upper Orontes valley was shared between Janah al-Dawlah of Homs, Munqidhites of Shaizar, and Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, the Fatimid governor of Apamea based in its citadel Qal'at al-Mudhiq. Janah al-Dawlah had been murdered in 1103 by al-Hakim al-Munajjim, and Khalaf ibn Mula'ib three years later. Khalaf ibn Mula'ib was probably a Musta'li Isma'ili that refused to cooperate with the Nizari Isma'ilis under Abu Tahir, was murdered in February 1106 with the help of Abu'l Fath of Sarmin, an Ismaili da'i. Abu Tahir and Abu'l Fath subsequently captured Qal'at al-Mudhiq and Apamea by an \\"ingenious\\" plan. Tancred, the Frankish regent of the Principality of Antioch besieged Apamea, but was unsuccessful. A few months later he besieged the city again with the help of Mus'ab ibn Mula'ib, brother of the murdered Khalaf, and captured Apamea in September 1106. Abu'l Fath was executed, while Abu Tahir ransomed himself and went to Aleppo. In 1111, an abortive assassination attempt against Abu Harb Isa ibn Zayd, a wealthy Aleppine Persian, caused a general public resentment of the Nizari Ismailis in Aleppo. Ridwan nevertheless provided support for the Nizaris. Ridwan died in 1113 and the Nizaris of Aleppo were deprived of this important ally. During the short reign of his young son Alp Arslan al-Akhras, who ceded the Balis fortress on the Aleppo–Baghdad road to Abu Tahir. During his anti- Nizari campaign, the Seljuq sultan Muhammad I Tapar sent Sa'id ibn Badi', the rais of Aleppo, to turn Alp Arslan against the Nizaris. Abu Tahir and many other Nizaris in Aleppo were subsequently executed and others dispersed or went underground. Abu Tahir was succeeded by Bahram al-Da'i.

America and Americana are a staple of Turnbull's work – he has visited the country many times. In the various series it has inspired, a fierce critique of U.S culture is witnessed, in particular its politics, but also an affection and fascination which began from his boyhood when he was, like many of his generation, brought up on a diet of American TV programmes. This style has been dubbed ‘angry pop’, https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-ben-turnbull-packs-heat-in-his- exhibition-at an allusion to its power and harnessing of Pop Art sensibilities. His Superman series, https://observer.com/2011/07/london- gallery-plans-the-most-patriotic-911-tribute-youd-ever-want-to-see/ New York TimesJuly2011 is in part a tribute in part to the New York City fireman who lost their lives after the 9/11 attacks.

Violence against doctors has been observed in the United States, Australia, India, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and others. Australia In 2019, a survey showed that in the last three years, there has been a 48 percent increase in assaults against nurses in Queensland. In New South Wales the acts assaults against nurses increased by 44 percent over the same period. India Doctors' protest demanding justice for a fellow doctor. The Indian Medical Association has reported that 75% of doctors face verbal or physical abuse in hospital premises and fear of violence was the most common cause for stress for 43% doctors. The highest number of violence was reported at the point of emergency care and 70% of the cases of violence were initiated by the patient's relatives. The incidence of reported violent crimes against doctors in India has been increasing from 2006 to 2017, with the highest violence rate occurring in Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Factors attributed to violence against doctors are: absence of post graduate training in emergency medicine in India, poor quality of emergency care, poor mechanism for grievance redressal, poor emergency network among hospitals, poor communication skills of healthcare workers, resource poor emergency settings (fewer drugs, fewer facilities for investigations), high patient load, lack of proper training of healthcare staff, high work load and political interference in hospital affairs. In addition, the high expectations of the public and their perception that all services should be available for free adds to the problem. Unrestricted public access to all areas in government hospitals, coupled with lack of security, surveillance and mob-preventing-drills increase the risk of violence. The decreased civic responsibility showed by the public and the negative image of doctors portrayed in the media are also some factors that result in violence against doctors. At the psychiatry department, the violence of the patients were directed more to nurses than doctors and to women than men. In a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, 40% of doctors reported being exposed to violence in the last year. The point of delivery of emergency services was the most common place of violence and verbal abuse was the most common form of violence. The most common symptoms experienced by the doctors who were subjected to violence were anger, frustration and irritability. Out of those who were exposed to violence, only 44% reported the incidence to the authorities. Due to the increasing reports of violence against doctors, the main source of stress for doctors was fear of violence, followed by fear of being sued. In India, 62% of doctors who answered a survey reported that they were unable to see their patients without any fear of violence, and 57% had considered hiring security staff at their workplace. China In China, a 2019 survey by Dingxiang Yuan, a website for healthcare professionals, showed that 85% of doctors had experienced violence in their workplace. A survey conducted in 2008 found that 80% of healthcare professionals agreed that the doctor–patient relationship was poor or very poor. The 2014 survey conducted by the Chinese Medical Doctor Association (CMDA) found that the 60% of medical professionals surveyed had faced verbal abuse from patients and their relatives and 13% of the professionals had been physically assaulted and harmed. United States According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the intentional injury rate for private hospital employees was five times higher than the national rate of all other private industries. A 2018 survey conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians showed that out of more than 3,500 E.R. doctors, 47% of the doctors had been assaulted. 97% of the time, the assailant was a patient. Measures for reducing violence In the past 10 years, nineteen state governments of India have passed laws for the safeguard of physicians. However, the law could not be effectively implemented due to resistance from administration. Some suggestions for reducing violence against healthcare staff are: posting security personnel at the hospital entrance, confiscation of weapons before entering the hospital, mandatory registration for all visitors at the reception, restricting the number of bystanders to two for every patient, displaying of laws related to punishment for assaulting healthcare staff on the walls of hospitals, creation of an emergency protocol and evacuation plan in case of major violence. Giving training on communication skills for healthcare staff and providing the services of counselors for emotional support could likely reduce violence. In December 2019 in China, those \\"disturbing the medical environment, or harming medical workers' safety and dignity\\" will be subjected to administrative punishments such as detention or a fine under a new law effective from 1 June 2020.

In Māori traditions, once Rākaihautū landed the at the top of the South Island, he moved southward and dug up many of the island's major lakes using a magical (digging stick), filling them with food for his many descendants.  Origin  Rākaihautū originally sailed with his wife Waiariki-o-āio, their son Te Rakihouia, and their people from Te-patunui-o-āio aboard the canoe over 34 generations ago. The crew included some of Rākaihautū's kin who were of the tribes Te Kāhui Tipua, Te Kāhui Roko, and Te Kāhui Waitaha. Rākaihautū's daughter Te Uhi-tataraiakoa stayed behind in Te-patunui-o-āio. On the journey to the South Island the heavens and the ocean blocked the canoe's path, until Rākaihautū chanted a and cut a passage with his adze. He eventually landed the at Nelson, at the top of the South Island.  Exploration  From Nelson, Rākaihautū and his wife separated from Te Rakihouia and began to explore the Southern Alps. Te Rakihouia and Te Kāhui Waitaha took the canoe and continued down the east coast, eventually landing it near the Clutha River. In the tradition of Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rākaihautū, Rākaihautū dug out the large lakes from Lake Rotoiti, Lake Rotoroa, and Rangitahi in the north to Lake Te Anau and Lake Manapouri in the south. For this purpose he used a digging stick named . Upon reaching Foveaux Strait he then travelled back up along the east coast, reunited with Te Rakihouia, and settled in Banks Peninsula where he thrust his stick into a hill called above Akaroa Harbour, renaming it (the stick) to . The stick became the rocky peak that is known to Pākehā as Mount Bossu. Specific lakes that Rākaihautū is credited with digging include Lake Tekapo, Lake Pukaki, Lake Ohau, Lake Hāwea, Lake Wānaka, Lake Wakatipu, Whakatipu Waitī, Te Aitarakihi near Washdyke, Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora, and Lake Forsyth.

After the World War II, the new house was rebuilt between 1946 until 1947 on the hill of a destroyed house and became the first government permanent timber dwelling. The newly rebuilt and more comfortable house on the hill is located on the site of a destroyed house formerly owned by M M Clark where they renaming the new house as Newlands. Agnes lived in the house for several years before the house being owned by another few owners. After being left with no further occupants, the Sabah Museum Department together with Federal Department of Museum and Antiquities began to collaborate in 2001 to restore the house and on 26 April 2004, it was finally opened to public as a museum.  Haunted reputation  Through her years of living in the house, based on her own writings, Agnes is reportedly happy with the home, although there were some mysterious incidents of note that had happened throughout her stay in the house when Agnes everyday saw a tall unrecognisable female figure apparition. At one event she saw the apparition with family; saying goodbye to husband and taking her own baby before returning to the road in front of the house with body keep moving forward while her head managed to keep straight looking over behind (towards Agnes position). The same horror experienced earlier by Agnes also felt by the next house owner following Agnes return to the United States; a new female owner named Rosemary (living in the house from 1955 to 1967), the wife of G L Carson while sleeping alone in the house awaken by the sounds of a room door located at the end of the house being closed several times in early dawn and hearing footsteps that getting louder moving towards her room before shockingly saw an unrecognisable female apparition suddenly appeared at the end of her bed with eyes staring at her when she began to open her own eyes that causing her to be quickly fainted. Another incident involving a housemaid who working in the house from 1967 to 1968 saw a similar female apparition standing in the house stairs.  Features  The house has been restored and turned into a heritage house since the restoration works in 2004. The house provides insights to life during the administration of British North Borneo and is furnished with a reproduction of colonial furniture and antiques.

He was born in Cornwall, the eldest son of Edward Borlase of London, a mercer, and Suzannah Isham. He was educated at Kings College, Cambridge where he matriculated in 1591. He was knighted at Greenwich in 1606. He served as a soldier in the Low Countries, taking part in the expedition to the Palatinate in 1620 under Sir Horace Vere to defend the Protestant cause there. In 1633 he was appointed Master of the Ordnance in Ireland jointly with Sir Thomas Lucas, a post he held until his death. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Enniskillen in 1634 and for Belturbet in 1639. Following the recall to England of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, Borlase and Sir William Parsons were appointed joint Lord Justices of Ireland by the Protectorate in February 1641. As Wentworth's successors were either ill (Christopher Wandesford) or absent (Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester) the two men were the virtual rulers of Ireland until their dismissal in 1644 when the Marquis of Ormonde took over as Lord Lieutenant. During their time in office the two had to deal (somewhat ineffectively) with the major Irish insurgency of 1641. Borlase died in London. He had married Alice Edwards in 1610. They had a son, Sir John Borlase, who lived and died in Ireland. A second son, Edmund, became a physician and historian in Chester.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. History In 1836, DeForest and Catharine Maria (Booth) Manice of Hempstead, New York purchased over 1000 acres of land in this portion of Kalamazoo Count as an investment. In 1841, the Manices allowed Catharine's brother, William Booth, to settle on a portion of the land they had purchased. William and Abigail Booth moved to the land later that year from their home town of Stratford, Connecticut with their two sons. The Booths farmed the land for the next two decades, with William Booth serving in various public positions in the local government. During this time, he also constructed the first part of the farmhouse on the land. William Booth died in 1864, and in 1866 Thomas P. Dunham purchased the farm. Dunham was born in Junius, New York in 1822. He was a grocer in Chicago and a sugar broker in New Orleans for several years before coming to Kalamazoo County in 1859 with his wife Emily (Braden) Dunham. Thomas was active in local affairs, serving as Highway Commissioner and as director of the nearby school. The Dunhams added onto the house in about 1875. Thomas died in 1895, after turning the farm over to his eldest son Charles. Charles died in 1909, and the farm was turned over to the second son Edgar. The family operated the farm until 1946, when the last of Thomas's children died. In 1952, the Sprau family bought the farm. In 1967, they sold the bulk of the acreage to Kalamazoo Valley Community College for their new campus.

The first floor has a centrally located front door flanked by pairs of none=over-six double hung windows with shutters. The second floor has three windows, with the central one slightly off center. A shed-roof porch supported by plain columns runs the width of the front of the house. The barn is an eight-bay, timber-framed, side-gable structure with vertical wooden siding measuring 30 feet wide by 120 feet long. It was likely built about the same time as the house (about 1840). The toolshed is a single-story, side gable structure measuring 60 feet long by 16 feet wide. It dates from about the 1920s. The woodshed is a front gable, single story wood frame building measuring approximately 20 feet long and 16 feet wide.

He was known as the initiator of the first trial of homophobic discrimination in Serbia. He was one of the founders of the LGBT movement in Serbia.  Activism  Together with Lepa Mlađenović and another ten signatories, Nebrigić participated in the founding of Arkadija, the first LGBT organization in Serbia in 1990. The following year Nebrigić was one of the founders and co-editors of the anti-war magazine Pacifik, where he wrote on gay and lesbian themes. Nebrigić was active in the Centre for Antiwar Action which was also founded in 1991. Nebrigić was also a member of the Women in Black organization. He was released from serving in the army, as he informed the recruiting committee that he was homosexual. He was the first anti-war activist to speak publicly about his sexuality in the media. In 1997 in the Novi Sad newspaper Nebrigić published a gay themed Paris-New York travelogue. The following year he published the para-philosophical Labyrinth Dictionary. He also published works in journals such as Uznet, KulturTreger and ProFemina. From 1998 - 1999 Nebrigić was the Executive Director of the Campaign Against Homophobia, which was supported by the Humanitarian Law Fund and the European Youth Association. During this period he produced four reports analysing homophobia in Serbia and covering other topics of relevance to LGBT activism.  Lawsuit and Murder  In April 1999 Nebrigić filed a lawsuit against Vlastimir Lazarov, for repeatedly calling and harassing him and threatening his security. Lazarov was the father of Milan Lazar, Nebrigić's ex-boyfriend, who blamed Nebrigić for the fact that his son was gay. Nebrigić informed the police multiple times but was beaten and insulted by police officers in an official car. The Duty Attorney subsequently refused to represent Nebrigić on the grounds that he was gay. The hearing was scheduled for November 1999 but was delayed due to a judge's illness. On the night of December 29, 1999, on his 29th birthday, Dejan Nebrigić was murdered in his apartment in Pancevo. The investigation found that he had been killed by Milan Lazarov. Activists alleged that the Serbian government, who had been hostile to dissident movements and the gay civil rights lobby, used Nebrigić's murder as anti gay rights and anti-Western propaganda. In an interview with the Serb pro- government tabloid Politika Express, Reuters reported that Nedeljko Martinovic, the investigative judge who conducted the case, claimed that the gay rights movement was \\"in effect, a 'gateway' for all kinds of sects conducting a special war against our country\\". This led Nebrigić's colleagues to believe that his murder was a direct result of his activism.

Early life  Jack Malloch was born in Durban, Natal, South Africa on 8 October 1920. In 1925 his family moved to Umtali (now Mutare) in the eastern highlands of Southern Rhodesia. He was sent back to South Africa in 1933 to attend a boarding school in Somerset West in the Cape Province, but was withdrawn from the school in 1935 to begin working as a garage mechanic. In 1936 he earned a driver's licence and began driving for the railways.  World War II  In 1943 Malloch was accepted into the Royal Air Force; in December 1943 he received his pilot's wings and was sent to an operational squadron where he saw service as a fighter pilot. In February 1945 he was shot down behind enemy lines and wounded. He was kept safe from German capture by local partisans, who found a hiding place for him in the mountains. In April 1945, he was flown out and was able to rejoin his squadron.  Post-War career  After the War, Malloch returned to Southern Rhodesia. He married his wife Zoe (née Coventry) in Salisbury (now Harare) in January 1948. He kept flying, and in March 1951 was one of the pilots who participated in the first Spitfire ferry of new aircraft from the UK out to Southern Rhodesia for use in the Rhodesian Air Force. A year later, in March 1952, he formed Fish Air with Jamie Marshall. Later, in October 1955, they sold the company to Hunting Clan; Malloch was retained as a pilot.  The 1960s  In 1960, Malloch formed a new company named Rhodesian Air Services (RAS), an airline head-quartered in Salisbury; from 1963 to 1964, the RAS was involved in gun-running in the Yemen. The following year, in January 1965, Malloch formed a new company called Air Trans Africa (ATA). In November 1965, Southern Rhodesia declared UDI from the British Commonwealth and became Rhodesia. In response, the United Kingdom applied strict sanctions, and ATA became involved in various sanctions-busting operations from 1966–67. = The Congo = In 1960 the Republic of Congo (later Democratic Republic of Congo) gained independence from Belgium; the UHMK, with Belgian support, wanted to secede Katanga province from the rest of the country. Malloch began working for one of the secessionist leaders, Moise Tshombe, as a pilot. In July 1963, one of the Rhodesian Air Services Douglas DC-3s was shot down over Katanga by UN forces. By January 1963, the effort to secede Katanga had been defeated by UN forces, and their surrender led to the inclusion of the province in the Congo. Moise Tshombe returned from exile in June 1964 and was invited to become Prime Minister of the Congo. Malloch started working for Tshombe again, and between August and November 1964, he flew in support of the mercenary Mike Hoare against the Congolese rebels. Later, in 1967, the Mercenaries Revolt in the Congo was launched with the news that Tshombe had been kidnapped. Malloch flew re-supply missions for Jean \\"Black Jack\\" Schramme and his mercenaries from July-November 1967. = Biafra = In May 1967, Biafra declared independence from Nigeria, which sparked the Nigerian Civil War. Malloch made his first gun-running flight into Biafra to supply the rebels in July 1967; between 1967 and January 1970, he and his company ATA were making nightly weapons flights into Biafra. In 1968, he and the crew of his DC-7 were jailed on landing in Togo with a cargo of 9 tons of Nigerian banknotes. By January 1970, the Biafran rebellion had been defeated and the civil war thus came to an end.  The 1970s & 1980s  Former Afro- Continental Airways Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, Charles Prince Airport, Mount Hampden, 1975 In January 1970 Malloch formed a new company, this one named Afro-Continental Airways (ACA), as a subsidiary of Air Trans Africa. ACA operated an airline service between Salisbury, Rhodesia; Windhoek, South West Africa (now Namibia); and Blantyre, Malawi; flying a Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation, registered as VP-WAW and formerly owned by Varig Brazilian Airlines. After only a few years the new airline ceased operations and the aircraft was permanently grounded, reportedly becoming a club-house at Charles Prince Airport, Mount Hampden, near Salisbury. Between 1970 and 1980, Air Trans Africa, flying a fleet of Gabonese-registered aircraft, became heavily involved in Rhodesian sanctions-busting operations. In August 1973, the UK's Sunday Times newspaper ran an exposé of Malloch and his legal and illegal operations; this was the first public mention of his callsign \\"Tango Romeo\\", which was to become famous. Britain made their third complaint to the UN about Malloch and his sanctions-busting activities in May 1976. The following year, in January 1977, Malloch flew French mercenary Bob Denard and a team of mercenaries into Cotonou, Benin in a failed coup attempt. In May 1978, Malloch's Canadair CL-44 was intercepted by two MiG 21s over Angola and was forced to escape through the mountains. In July of the same year, he flew a 30 kg coelacanth from the Comores back to Salisbury. His CL-44 was destroyed by fire at Salisbury airport in February 1982. = Rhodesian operations = Independence Commemorative Decoration ribbon bar In January 1970 Malloch was called up as a reservist to the Rhodesian Air Force. He and his DC-7 aircraft become heavily involved in various Rhodesian military operations. He piloted the Rhodesians' largest SAS HALO paratroop drop over Mozambique in October 1977, and in November of the same year was involved with both the Rhodesian Army and the Rhodesian Air Force in Operation Dingo, a major raid conducted against the ZANLA headquarters in Chimoio, Mozambique. In 1978, he was the final recipient of the Independence Commemorative Decoration for services rendered to Rhodesia. Malloch was heavily involved in the SAS operation in north-eastern Zambia to blow up a bridge, known as Operation Cheese, in September 1979. = Mark 22 Spitfire = In 1978, Malloch persuaded a Rhodesian Air Force base to part with the Mk 22 Spitfire which had been sitting on a plinth outside the air base for over 20 years. He began renovating it the same year, which process included having a five-bladed variable-pitch propeller custom-built by a German firm. In March 1980, he made the first flight in the newly-renovated aircraft and it was featured at air shows in Zimbabwe at the time. Malloch was killed in his Mk 22 on the last day of filming the documentary Pursuit of a Dream on 26 March 1982 when he flew the aircraft into a thunderstorm.

Local mining operations were developed with the expansion of the Intercolonial Railway in the early 1900s, which spawned the Cumberland Coal Company. Mining operations depended heavily on highly skilled miners working in perilous underground conditions that were prone to explosions and underground earthquakes, as evidenced by the multiple disasters. In 1891 and 1956, coal dust explosions rocked the mine and resulted in many fatalities; in 1958 an underground earthquake, or \\"bump\\", caused sections of the mine to collapse. The site's historical value is due to Springhill's high importance in the industrialization of post-Confederation Nova Scotia and Canada in general. Nova Scotia was Canada's largest coal producer from 1867 until 1914, partially due to tariffs on foreign coal in Canada and the high demand for coal in other provinces in the late 1800s. After the two disasters in the 1950s, operations were downscaled and the mine officially closed in 1970. All that remains of the original mine is several brick buildings and the sealed pitheads for the No. 2 and No. 4 mines, with the Syndicate Mine entrance remaining open for the museum. The mine was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on March 12 1998, along with the coal mining sites in Stellarton and Sydney, Nova Scotia. Museum The National Historic Site is centred around a one-storey red brick building that was once used as a lamp cabin for the miners. The museum commemorates the tragedies of the mine and the heroics of the miners during the disasters as well as the history of prosperity brought by coal mining to Springhill. The museum offers tours of the wash house and the lamp cabin as well as a tour of a remaining part of the underground mine.

Although most present no technical difficulties in good conditions, careful route finding may be required when descending from the main summit, especially in mist. Most approaches start at the old bridge at the foot of its south east ridge, where there is parking space. From there, the best route of ascent may be up the crest of the ridge, or via a path to the north of this ridge and then up to the saddle between the main summit and its south east top. There are no constructed paths up or onto the ridge, but the boots of successive climbers have created steps which show and facilitate the way in some places, but disappear or are creating erosion in others.

Life  Lazarev was born on April 12, 1855 in the village of Grachevka, Buzuluksky district (Samara Governorate) into a free peasant family, whose father (Yegor's grandfather) was a serf. By the time of the general abolition of serfdom, Yegor was six years old. At the age of seven he left his village to study in the Samara Parish School, and then became a participant in meetings of the Samara intelligentsia, which took place in the evenings in the sewing workshop of his aunt, Anna. In 1874 he was arrested and excluded from the Samara Gymnasium, but was later acquitted of spreading propaganda. As part of the 159th Guriy Infantry Regiment, Lazarev participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), participated in the Battle of Kars. In 1880 he became a non-commissioned officer and met with Leo Tolstoy. In 1884, Lazarev was arrested for participating in the Narodnaya Volya military organization, and was visited by Tolstoy in Butyrka prison. Lazarev was administratively exiled to the Trans-Baikal village of Tataurovskoe for three years. Lazarev was released on July 8, 1887, with the prohibition of residing in a number of cities of the Russian Empire. He returned to his native village, but a year later, on February 19, 1888, was again arrested in Buzuluk because of his links with Narodnaya Volya. In August 1888, Lazarev was again exiled to Eastern Siberia for five years, but already on July 4, 1890, with the help of American explorer George Kennan, escaped and emigrated to the United States. In the US, he learned English and worked as a typesetter in Milwaukee. He worked with Kennan on a book and was involved in the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom. In 1894 he moved to London to unite isolated revolutionary groups. At the station, he was met by Nikolai Tchaikovsky. Lazarev then went to Paris, but under pressure from the Russian authorities, he was arrested and expelled from France on July 12, 1894. In the summer of 1895, Lazarev moved to Switzerland, where he married Yulia Alexandrovna Lakier, and settled in the town of Clarens. During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Lazarev was in Russia, was a member of the Peasant Commission under the Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and was one of the experts of the Social Revolutionary group at the Second Duma, but in 1907 he again left for Switzerland. In 1909, Lazarev returned to St. Petersburg, where he began working as a secretary for the editors of the Knowledge Herald magazine. In 1910 he was arrested and for the third time exiled to Siberia. Lazarev returned to Russia in 1917 where he witnessed Lenin’s arrival by train. He did not accept the October Revolution, however, and struggled against the Bolsheviks. He became Minister of Education in the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly in Samara Governorate. In 1919 he left Russia for Prague, where he published the journal Volya Rossii (The Will of Russia). He died in Prague in 1937.

He is the former editor in chief of the Magazyn Polski and of the Głos znad Niemna (\\"Voice from over the Neman\\") in exile as well as the former spokesperson of the Union of Poles in Belarus. Bantser is perhaps best known as the founder and singer of the Grodno-based streetpunk band Mister X, though he also serves as head of the \\"Grodno Rock-club\\". Childhood and early life Born in Minsk, then largest city in the Byelorussian SSR and now the capital of the Republic of Belarus, Igor moved with his family to Grodno in 1986. There he attended school number 25 (it is customary in Eastern Europe to name primary schools with numbers). In 1997 he became a member of the Малады Фронт organisation; in the same year he began working as a journalist for the \\"Пагоня\\" newspaper. From 1992 until 2002, Bantser lived in Warszawa – capital of Poland – where he studied international relations at the local university. During his stay in Poland he actively took part in efforts to promote the democratisation of Belarus, cooperating with Belarusian political migrants and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights. After returning to Belarus he worked as a journalist for several Russian language opposition magazines. Igor was also editor in chief of the Polish- language monthly publication Magazyn Polski in 2007. Musical career Mister X performing live in Minsk, in March of 2020. Ever since 2003, when with Boris from Oi! Bombers he founded the Mister X streetpunk band, he has been the group's primary vocalist. The whole band, including Igor, identify as SHARP and form part of the anti-racist skinhead and Oi! scene in West Belarus. Partially thanks to Bantser's fluency in Polish, Mister X have become well- known on the underground punk scene in Poland, where they are often referred to as \\"the most well-known Belarusian punk rock band\\" and \\"the flagship of Belarusian street punk\\". Since their formation, the band have toured with Igor in many European countries outside of their usual venues of Belarus, Poland, Russia, Latvia, and Lithuania – including Germany and other Western European countries. Depending on the song, Igor writes his lyrics and records his vocals in Russian, Polish, English, or Belarusian. Although Igor and his band's self-proclaimed apolitical stance initially led to them being somewhat ostracised on the then highly politicised Belarusian punk scene, it has not gotten in the way of garnering an international following of fans in the years following the band's creation, despite difficulties with the country's regime and travelling. The band and their fans have also experienced police brutality and repressions at the hands of the local authorities during one of their gigs in Ryazan, Russia. Activism Due to his critical stance of opposition towards the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko, which involves political and social activism on his part, Bantser has been imprisoned and punished by the Belarusian law enforcement numerous times. In March 2007 he was arrested and convicted for \\"swearing in the presence of militiamen\\", which resulted in his imprisonment for a period of 10 days and he was yet again stopped in October of the same year. Andżelika Borys stood in his defence, which resulted in her conviction and being charged with a fine. In the following years of 2008, 2009, and 2010, Igor was stopped several times by the militia of Belarus – often arrested and sometimes charged with criminal offences, mostly for his reluctance to accept state authority and insistence on protest; at one point in 2010 he went on a hunger strike. On the morning of 14 June 2011, Bantser was stopped by the militia in front of his home in Grodno. In this way he was prevented from making his way to the local courtroom to attend the process of Andrzej Poczobut. For the remainder of the day he was held in solitary confinement. The following day he was convicted to 5 days of arrest and charged for \\"uncensurable vocabulary\\". His case was considered in the militia building instead of the courts. Under arrest, as a sign of protest, he refused all food and liquids, which resulted in rapid weight loss of 8 kilograms; he was also for a period of time held in an overcrowded cell. Yet again on 24 June 2011, Igor was brutally stopped by the local authorities, as the militiamen dragged him across the street, for \\"being in a forbidden place\\". His process was once again considered in a militia building rather than a proper courtroom. He was accused of \\"loud swearing in public\\" and \\"refusing to submit himself to the militia\\". The case against him was shown by Bantser as being inconsistent, since according to the militia he was in 2 places at the same time – his innocence was confirmed by numerous witnesses. Regardless and contrary to the facts, the judge charged him a fine of 2,100,000 Belarusian rubles (then equal to more than 1000 Polish złoty). According to Grażyna Szałkiewicz, who gave testimony of Igor's innocence, the judge raised her voice and behaved aggressively towards her and the defence. In early July 2011, Bantser was arrested and charged the following day for \\"taking part in an illegal gathering on the 28th of June\\"; this resulted in a conviction and 10 days of arrest. He once again decided to go on a hunger strike in response to his unfair treatment. On 1 June, in 2012, Igor was stopped and arrested for 13 days after picketing in defence of the Polish School in Grodno. Since 2015, after receiving intimidating phone-calls from the militia with threats of forced expulsion from the country, Bantser has been focusing more on pursuing his musical calling while making ends meet. When the 2020 Belarusian protests escalated following the publication of falsified election results on the evening of 9 August 2020, police forces reportedly actively looked for Igor and detained him once he was found. Immediately after being incarcerated, Igor started a hunger strike. Initially his wife and friends, as well as his lawyer, were unable to establish contact with him due to a lack of information from the authorities. He was beaten twice during his time in arrest, but eventually released after 72 hours in detention. As the protests continued in Grodno, all opposition gatherings were eventually outlawed; on 24 August, Bantser was arrested alongside other anarchist and antifascist demonstrators for taking part in peaceful protest. He was given 10 days of arrest, while his peers were given 7, and once again initiated a hunger strike. Personal life Igor is a committed anti-fascist with a zero tolerance attitude towards racism in the skinhead scene, recognising the multi-cultural and ethnically diverse roots of his musical genre; likewise, he is an outspoken opponent of homophobia and sexism in punk rock and wider society. He does not eat meat and does not drink alcohol, his personal interests besides punk and rock music include: MMA, Muay Thai, and Rugby. Bantser has been married twice and has three children – one from the first marriage and two from the second. While his lifestyle in many ways could be seen as straight edge, Igor does not seem to openly identify as such. He is an agnostic.

The group provided a forum for discussing bisexual theory.  History  Bi Academic Intervention, a group of bisexual academics, researchers and writers, was formed at the 11th National Bisexual Conference held at the University of Nottingham in October 1993. The group aimed to create discussion around bisexual theory, provide visibility for bisexual researchers, and to ensure that bisexual identity was represented in academic research and discussions about sexuality. The group ran a number of one day events between 1993 and 1995 and, between 1993 and 1997, ran biannual day schools on bisexuality. Bi Academic Intervention published a newsletter that enabled bisexual academics and researchers to develop and share their theories. The group disbanded in 1995 as it was not felt to be productive to continue discussing bisexual theory in isolation from the related domains of feminist and queer theory.  Publications  An editorial collective of the same name was formed by members of the original Bi Academic Intervention and published a volume of bisexual theory The Bisexual Imaginary: Representation, Identity, and Desire in 1997. In the same year, the group also published a special issue of the International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies focused on bisexual theory.  Goals  The group articulated their goals in their co-written introduction to The Bisexual Imaginary: > in so far as Bi Academic Intervention is an intervention, one of whose goals > is to carve a space for bisexual theory, we want to produce work which will > impact upon and redirect an existing and important field. Second, it is > important because of debates about bisexual invisibility. There is an > ongoing concern within bisexual communities to make bisexuality visible in > places where it has previously been marginalized, and the strategies and > pitfalls of representation occupy a key place in this concern. But third, > another goal of Bi Academic Intervention is to intervene within bisexual > communities. We are uncomfortable with the assertion that bisexual > visibility has been a constant absence, and it therefore now an > unproblematic good, and want to ask: what are the different effects of > images of bisexuality, and the different meanings that become invested in > it?Bi Academic Intervention, The Bisexual Imaginary, 1-2.

An independent investigation by Philippine authorities later determined that the Chinese vessel involved in the incident failed to undertake measures to avoid colliding with the F/B Gem-Ver and abandoned the stricken boat's crew, in violation of maritime laws. Background F/B Gem- Ver sailed from San Jose, Occidental Mindoro on 29 May 2019, with 22 crewmen led by captain Junel Insigne. The vessel was rammed and sunk on 9 June 2019 by another ship described as Chinese by the crew while anchored near Reed Bank in the South China Sea. The whole sea is claimed by China as it territory, while a 2016 arbitration ruling determined the area to be within the Philippines exclusive economic zone. The ship that rammed F/B Gem-Ver left the crew floating at sea. Two of the crewmen managed to reach TGTG-90983-TS, a Vietnamese fishing vessel, after two hours of paddling; the rest of the crew were later rescued by this Vietnamese vessel, which sailed from Tiền Giang Province, Vietnam in the southern Mekong Delta. The Filipino crewmen were turned over to the Philippine Navy and were taken aboard BRP Ramon Alcaraz. All but one of the 22 crew members returned home to San Jose, Occidental Mindoro on 14 June 2019. A lone crewman was left behind to oversee the towing of the barely floating wreckage of their wooden boat back to its home port in San Jose. Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea stated that the incident was unprecedented; it was the first time that Chinese maritime assets \\"deliberately rammed, sank, and abandoned a Filipino fishing vessel in the West Philippine Sea\\". He further added that the incident could prove to be a tipping point in Sino-Filipino relations in the South China Sea; if no satisfactory action is passed on the part of China, it could \\"herald a new phase in Philippine-China interaction in the West Philippine Sea: one where we (the Philippines) will be forced out of the West Philippine Sea.\\" =F/B Gem- Ver= F/B Gem-Ver is a Filipino wooden-hulled fishing banca owned and operated by Arlinda B. dela Torre of San Roque, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines. It is in length with a beam of and gross tonnage of 14.38. It is powered by a diesel engine with a single screw. The boat was built in 2000. =Yuemaobinyu 42212= Yuemaobinyu 42212 (MMSI No. 412471286) is a Chinese steel-hulled fishing vessel operating from Guangdong Province, China. It is in length and a beam of . Investigation =Joint Philippine Coast Guard - Maritime Industry Authority investigation= Joint Philippine Coast Guard- Maritime Industry Authority report on the Recto (Reed) Bank incident The crew believed that the ship that rammed their vessel was Chinese but were unable provide the ship's bow number to the Philippine Coast Guard. On 20 June 2019, the joint Philippine Coast Guard - Maritime Industry Authority investigation was completed and its contents made public on 6 July 2019. Key points therein stated that: *The incident occurred within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone, approximately 140 nautical miles northwest of Piedras Point, Palawan. *The F/B Gem-Ver had two white anchor lights fore and aft, a flashing white light positioned on its mast and was equipped with a ship radar reflector. The weather was fair with starry skies and a first-quarter moon. The sea was calm and visibility was \\"slightly clear\\". Hence, no environmental factors could have prevented the Chinese vessel from seeing the Filipino fishing boat. The report stated in conclusion that the Chinese vessel \\"failed to take appropriate action to avoid the risk of collision.\\" *After the allision, the Chinese vessel maneuvered and halted \\"approximately 50 meters from the F/B Gem-Ver\\" with fishing lights on and was \\"considered to have direct knowledge of the distress situation\\", yet refused to aid the foundered boat. Hence, the Chinese vessel violated two maritime laws – the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). =Others= Though equipped with automatic identification system transponders, Yuemaobinyu 42212, the ship that sank the Filipino boat, was shown to have either had a problem with the equipment or had turned it off deliberately during the period from 27 April 2019 to 12 June 2019 and therefore could not be tracked immediately before or after the ramming incident. An Oceana Philippines representative stated that \\"going dark\\" was common practice for ships engaged in illegal fishing. Reactions =China= On 13 June 2019, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman pronounced the incident and \\"ordinary maritime accident\\". The following day, the Chinese Embassy in Manila released a statement via Facebook claiming that a Chinese fishing boat, Yuemaobinyu 42212, \\"was berthed near Reed Bank when it was suddenly besieged by 7 or 8 Filipino fishing boats\\". In attempting to evade the Filipino boats, the Chinese vessel's lightning grid cable dragged into the Filipino boat's pilothouse, causing the boat to tilt and founder. This Facebook post however, was later deleted. China released a revised statement on 18 June 2019, this time omitting the narrative that Yuemaobinyu 42212 had been besieged by 7 or 8 Filipino fishing boats. The statement referred to the incident as an \\"accidental collision\\" between fishing boats and offered sympathies to the Filipino fishermen. In August 2019 Chen Shiqin, the president of the Guangdong Fishery Mutual Insurance Association sent a letter to the Philippines apologizing for one of its member's ships sinking F/B Gem- Ver and subsequently abandoning its crew. It was initially reported that the apology was accepted, but this was later refuted by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs. =Philippines= Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on 12 June 2019 (Philippine Independence Day) condemned the sinking of F/B Gem-Ver. In particular he denounced \\"the actions of the Chinese fishing vessel for immediately leaving the incident scene abandoning the 22 Filipino crewmen to the mercy of the elements\\", an action which he described as \\"cowardly\\". Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. lodged a diplomatic protest regarding the incident with the People's Republic of China on the same day. Philippine Navy chief Vice Admiral Robert Empedrad on 15 June stated that what happened to the Filipino fishing boat was \\"not an accident but a deliberate maneuver to ram the smaller vessel.\\" Philippine Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio also stated that it was \\"highly likely that a Chinese maritime militia vessel rammed the Filipino fishing vessel\\". The People’s Liberation Army’s maritime militia, estimated to field 300 vessels and 4000 personnel, is made up of civilian fishermen who receive military training and pay. Their boats are equipped with reinforced hulls for ramming other vessels, as well as high- powered water hoses and sophisticated communications gear. After days of silence, President Rodrigo Duterte made a statement on 17 June 2019 about the incident, stating that this was a \\"maritime incident\\". For his part, F/B Gem- Ver captain Jonel Insigne declined to meet with the Philippine President; Insigne was described as \\"still too traumatized\\" by the incident to travel to the nation's capital. Duterte later stated that he was allowing China to continue fishing in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. This drew a disappointed reaction from the fishermen concerned, so much so that even the wife of the Gem-Ver's captain stated that she would welcome Duterte's impeachment. After the Chinese sent a letter of apology for the incident to the Philippines in August 2019, Philippine Justice Antonio Carpio emphasized that the author was in error when he stated that the incident occurred in the \\"waters of Reed Bank, Nansha Island Group\\". Nansha is the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands, and Reed Bank is a completely separate feature from any island in the Spratlys. =United States= The United States Embassy in Manila issued a statement on 14 June 2019, urging \\"all parties to refrain from using coercion and intimidation to assert their territorial and maritime claims.\\" =Vietnam= Vietnam released a statement on 20 June 2019, saying that its fishermen complied with international maritime laws when they rescued the distressed crew of the Filipino fishing boat. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Le Thi Thu Hang cited the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the convention of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and that Vietnam's vessels were discharging international obligations while operating at sea.

The basic function of the organization was lobbying the media in order to decriminalize homosexuality. In addition, members' activities focused on the abolition of all forms of discrimination against homosexuals in public state institutions.  History  The organization was inspired by the Gay- Lesbian Pink Club initiative from Ljubljana, whose organizers contacted LGBT activists from Serbia in October 1990. The first meeting was held at the Moscow Hotel, with Lepa Mladjenovic, Dejan Nebrigić, Boris Liler and other more famous activists. When choosing a name, Boris Lilera suggested Arkadija, \\"the land of love and freedom\\", which was the favoured proposal. In France, during the twentieth century, an LGBT magazine with the same name was published, and this was another reason for choosing the name. Since it did not have premises or finances, the original work of the activists consisted of lobbying for the rights of lesbians and gays in predominantly independent media: B92, Republika, Vreme, Radio Pančevo, as well as in various magazines such as the Pacifik, founded by Dejan Nebrigić, and women's peace publications Women in Black Group. On June 27, 1991, Arkadija publicly marked \\"Pride Day\\" on the platform of the Youth House, where several activists and art theoreticians spoke about gay and lesbian activism, culture and art. The following year, Arkadija attempted to organize a panel in the Student Protest at the Faculty of Philosophy, but the theology students prevented the audience and participants from entering the hall, and from that time Arkadija on June 27 marked stands and workshops closed to the public. During the first two years, members of the group visited international conferences, sought support and prepared the Statute of Arkadija. This statute laid out the goals of the association including the reduction of discrimination and violence, the equalisation of the homosexual age of consent with heterosexual age of consent, decriminalisation, an end to treating homosexuality as a disease, the introduction of sexual education in schools including homosexuality and bisexuality as normal sexual preferences, an end to patriarchal domination in society, revision of family legislation, etc.  Anti-war activism  During this period, war broke out in Yugoslavia, and members of the group became involved in anti-war activism, which slowed development and further planning around gay rights. The decision was made that Arkadija should not have a nationalistic narrative, and that the human rights of all discriminated groups should be promoted. Four years after its launch, in 1994, the Centre for Women's Studies was selected as the seat of the organization. In 1995, the number of active participants in the group increased, and representatives of the women's movement decided to become independent from Arkadija. They self- organized, and Ljiljana Živković and Jelena Labris launched a new organization called Labris, which was registered in 2000.

The Martin Melck House () on 96 Strand Street and the Kostershuis on 100 Strand Street, on either side of the Lutheran Church in Cape Town, are both national heritage sites of South Africa. With the building of the Lutheran church, Martin Melck, a German immigrant whose business success and advantageous marriage rendered him the wealthiest man in Cape Colony in the 18th century, lent part of his property on the east side of the church for a parsonage. He donated the property to the congregation in the end, and in 1781, after Melck's death, construction began on the house. Louis Michel Thibault was probably the original architect. Anton Anreith is generally considered to have been responsible for the stained-glass windows, the swan in the gable, and the engravings on the front door. The building is influenced by French Renaissance architecture. It is also unique in that the attic (a \\"belvedere\\") had four windows, at the time giving a wide view of the city and Table Bay. Spacious rooms, paved entryways, African teak floors on the ground floor and Real yellowwood floors on the top floor, African teak beams over the living room, and a courtyard make it a distinctive structure. Until 1891, it served as the parsonage for the church. In 1929, there was talk of demolition, but conservationists and the wider community saved it through intensive renovation. From 1932 on, it was named the Martin Melck House, earning the distinction of a national monument in 1936, and it was used by cultural groups in the city. Around 1975, and antique shop operated there. Shortly after 2000, it was home to a museum of gold art, a souvenir shop, a restaurant, and a goldsmith's studio. The museum focuses on 19th- and 20th- century gold works from Mali, Senegal, Ghana, and the Ivory Coast. The Golden Lion is the highlight of the collection and also serves as an emblem of the museum.

It was the primary fortress of the warlord Takeda Nobuyoshi, ancestor of the Takeda clan. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 2001. Background Hakusan Castle was built by Takeda Nobuyoshi, the son of Minamoto no Kiyomitsu of Yato Castle and the progenitor of the Takeda clan. Nobumitsu's residence was located just over a kilometer away and takes its name from the Hakusan Jinja, a Shinto shrine preexisting on this mountain. Little is known of the history of Hakusan Castle, other than that it was completely rebuilt by Aoki Nobutane as part the outer defensive line of Kai Province. After the fall of the Takeda clan, the castle came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who used it as a stronghold against the Odawara Hōjō in his struggle for control of the province. The castle was under the control of Yamadera Nobumasa for period, and disappeared from history in the Kanbun era of the Edo Period (1661-1673).

It is one of the few games compatible with the Atari XG-1 light gun accessory.  Plot  This game is set in a world where international terrorists have threatened to destroy the world. To accomplish this, the terrorists unleashed a weapon known as \\"sparkx\\" to attack 20 nuclear reactors. This weapon attacks the control rods of each reactor until forcing a nuclear meltdown. The player takes on the role of an unnamed hero tasked with destroying the sparkx within each reactor to save the world.  Gameplay  Meltdown is an arcade style shooter game. The object of the game is to protect the 20 nuclear reactor cores from sparkx. The player must shoot the sparkx before they damage the reactor core. If the player misses, a barrier temporarily appears. A maximum of four barriers can appear at a time. Sparx will bounce off of the barriers adding a defensive strategy to the game. Sometimes power ups will appear on screen called power crystals and bonus blocks. After a period of time, the play field area will shrink, causing the player to shoot in a more constrained place. If the reactor survives at the end of the round, the player is awarded with a password to continue their progress later. Alternatively, the player can shoot to continue to the next reactor. The game ends when either the control rods are destroyed or if the player saves all 20 reactors. At the title screen, the player chooses the number of players and the difficulty level. This game can be played with one or two players and either on novice or expert difficulty.  Reception  Videogamecritic.com gave the game a C- in 1999, citing \\"boring\\" graphics and \\"too easy\\" gameplay.

It was formed in June 1942 as the 1st Rifle Division (1st formation) and was converted into the 58th Guards Rifle Division at the end of the year for its actions in Operation Little Saturn. Advancing into Ukraine, the division participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in early 1943. From midyear it fought in the Belgorod–Kharkov Offensive, the Battle of the Dnieper, and the Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive, receiving the honorific Krasnograd for its capture of that city and the Order of the Red Banner. After capturing the Sandomierz bridgehead at the end of the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, the division fought in the Sandomierz–Silesian Offensive in January 1945, receiving the Order of Suvorov for its crossing of the Oder. It was the first to meet American forces on the Elbe during the Berlin Offensive on 25 April 1945, receiving the Order of Lenin. For its actions in the Prague Offensive at the end of the war, the division was awarded the name of Prague as an honorific. It was disbanded a little more than a year after the end of the war.  Formation and Stalingrad  The 1st Rifle Division (1st formation) was formed between 3 March and 22 June 1942 in the city of Melekess, Kuybyshev Oblast, part of the Volga Military District. The division was formed in accordance with shtat (table of organization and equipment) 04/200 from personnel of the disbanded 9th Sapper Army, conscripts from Kuybyshev Oblast, convalescents from hospitals, and freed prisoners from forced labor camps. It included the 408th, 412th, and 415th Rifle Regiments, the 1026th Artillery Regiment, and smaller units. The 1st was quickly assigned to the 5th Reserve Army (which became the 63rd Army on 10 July and the 1st Guards Army (Second formation) in November) on 9 June at the village of Aleksikovo, where it was reorganized in accordance with shtat 04/300 due to being understrength in equipment and transport. The division took up defensive positions on the left bank of the Don River along the line of Novaya Kalitva, Verkhny Mamon, and Sukhoy Donets on 27 June, covering the left flank of the Stalingrad Front. It first saw combat on 3 July and defended its positions until the beginning of the first Soviet counteroffensive near Stalingrad. During Operation Little Saturn, with the 1st Guards Army, the division went on the offensive on 16 December. Crossing the Don near Solontsy, Olkhovy, and Grushevo, it broke through fortified Axis defenses and developed the offensive to capture Boguchar on 19 December in cooperation with the 44th Guards Rifle Division.  Guards conversion to the end of the war  In recognition of its courage in the initial stages of Operation Little Saturn, the 1st Rifle Division was converted into the 58th Guards Rifle Division, an elite Guards unit, on 31 December 1942. The 408th, 412th, and 415th Rifle Regiments became the 173rd, 175th, and 178th Guards Rifle Regiments, respectively, while the 1026th Artillery Regiment became the 130th Guards Artillery Regiment on 27 February 1943. Continuing the attack, the 58th Guards captured Millerovo alongside the 38th Guards Rifle Division on 17 January 1943. During February, it reached the Seversky Donets near Voroshilovgrad, contributing to the capture of the latter on 14 February. During the second half of February and early March, initially with the 1st Guards, then the 6th Army, and the 3rd Tank Army from mid-March, of the Southwestern Front, the division participated in the repulse of the German counteroffensive south of Kharkov. In early August the division joined the 57th Army of the Steppe Front and fought in the Belgorod–Kharkov Offensive, then in the Battle of the Dnieper. For its courage in the battles for Krasnograd, the division received the name of the city as an honorific on 19 September. Division chief of staff Colonel Vladimir Rusakov succeeded to command of the 58th Guards on 24 September. The division began crossing the Dnieper north of Verkhnodniprovsk on 26 September, with the machine gun crew of Yefreytor Grigory Shtonda of the 175th Guards Rifle Regiment being among the first across. For repulsing German counterattacks and ensuring the crossing of the vanguard of the regiment, Shtonda was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. Between October and December the division fought in attacks toward Krivoy Rog with the 57th Army of the Steppe Front (the 2nd Ukrainian Front from 20 October). In early 1944, the division was transferred to the 37th Army of the 3rd Ukrainian Front and fought in the Nikopol–Krivoy Rog Offensive, the Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive, and the Odessa Offensive. Rusakov was wounded on 13 March and evacuated; he would return to the division in July and remained in command for the rest of its existence. For distinguishing itself in the capture of Voznesensk on 24 March the 58th Guards received the Order of the Red Banner on 29 March. In mid-July 1944 , the division was transferred to the 5th Guards Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front, with which it served for the rest of the war. During the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, it entered the battle with the army and defeated the German forces counter-attacking from Mielec, then fought in the battles for the retention and the expansion of the Sandomierz bridgehead. During the Sandomierz–Silesian Offensive of early 1945, the 58th Guards advanced more than in eleven days, crossing the Oder on 23 January north of Oppeln. It captured and held a bridgehead in the area of Oderwerder. For their actions in the crossing of the Oder, thirteen soldiers of the division were made Heroes of the Soviet Union. The division fought in the Lower Silesian Offensive and the Upper Silesian Offensive in February and March. For the \\"exemplary performance of combat missions\\" in the breakthrough of German defenses and the defeat of German troops southwest of Oppeln, the 58th Guards received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, on 26 April.2nd Lt. William Robertson and Lt. Alexander Silvashko, Red Army, shown in front of sign East Meets West symbolizing the historic meeting of the Soviet and American Armies, near Torgau, Germany, an arranged photo op on \\"Elbe Day\\". The division broke through German defenses on the Neisse during the Berlin Offensive and on 25 April made contact with the American 69th Infantry Division at Torgau on the Elbe River on 25 April 1945, splitting Germany into two separate parts, an event that became known as Elbe Day. The first contact was made between patrols near Strehla, when U.S. First Lieutenant Albert Kotzebue crossed the River Elbe in a boat with three men of an intelligence and reconnaissance platoon. On the east bank, they met forward elements of the 175th Guards Rifle Regiment of the division, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gardiev. For breaking through to the Neisse, the division was awarded the Order of Lenin on 28 May. The units of the division rapidly advanced during the Prague Offensive, participating in the capture of Dresden on 8 May and on the next day reaching the vicinity of Beřkovice, northwest of Prague. For distinguishing itself in the advance on Prague, the division received the name of the city as an honorific on 11 June. For their actions during the war, roughly 11,000 soldiers of the division were decorated, and 28 received the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  Postwar  The division marched to České Budějovice between 30 May and 3 July, where it was brought up to strength with the personnel of the disbanded 253rd Rifle Division of the 3rd Guards Army and served on the demarcation line between the Allied and Soviet forces. During this period the division conducted combat training and was rated excellent at inspections for the summer training period. Relocated to Amstetten on 11 November 1945, the division served the demarcation line with American troops, responsible for a sector. The division again received a rating of excellent in inspections carried out in May 1946 for the winter training period. The 58th Guards handed over their sector of the demarcation line to the 95th Guards Rifle Division on 17 May and transferred enlisted men not scheduled for demobilization to the 95th and 4th Guards Rifle Divisions. Most officers were sent to Tata to be transferred to the reserve, while some went to other units for further service. The remainder of the division moved to Pöchlarn on 22 May, where the transfer of all personnel and equipment was completed in June, finishing the disbandment process. The rest of the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps was also disbanded at the same time, still with the Central Group of Forces.

She ran for governor in 1922, and won more than a quarter of the vote.  Early life  Alice Lorraine Daly was born in Minnesota, the daughter of George H. Daly and Mary Ellen Egan. She grew up in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and attended the University of Minnesota, with additional studies at the Emerson College of Oratory in Boston.  Career  Daly taught in Pocatello, Idaho, as a young woman, and was an officer in the Idaho State Teachers’ Association. She moved to a job at the state normal school in Madison, South Dakota, in 1915; that year, she addressed the state's suffrage convention. In 1916, she became president of the Lake County Universal Franchise League; she began touring the state giving speeches for the suffrage cause. In 1918 she and Belle Leavitt met with William Jennings Bryan while he visited Sioux Falls. In 1919 she was the first woman to speak before the South Dakota Senate. Daly was the South Dakota chair of the Woman's Peace Party, and represented the state at the International Congress of Women, convened at The Hague in 1915. After suffrage was achieved, she was active in the League of Women Voters, the YWCA, and, during World War I, the American Red Cross and other war relief organizations. She attended the Pan-American Conference of Women in 1922, and testified at a Congressional hearing about an amendment to the Merchant-Marine Act of 1920, taking the position that it favored shipping interests over farming interests. Daly ran for the office of state superintendent of public instruction in South Dakota in 1920. In 1922, she ran for governor of South Dakota, as the candidate of the Nonpartisan League, under the slogan \\"Good Housekeeping in Government.\\" She was sometimes described as \\"the first woman candidate for governor in America\\". \\"My campaign will not be a campaign against anyone,\\" she explained in 1922. \\"It will be a campaign against conditions, against the weakness of our present, outworn, economic system, and for a more modern system of finance, credit, public control and ownership.\\" The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers endorsed her, telling its members that Daly \\"is the only candidate who is really the people's friend.\\" The Railroad Telegrapher assured union members that \\"Miss Daly is a fearless and true friend to all who seek to make this world safe for the people who work on farms, in shops and factories, in railroads and in mines.\\" She won over 46,000 votes, placing third.

He was a pioneer in Polish horticulture, which was in need of reform after World War I and World War II. Having studied in the United States, Pieniążek brought to Poland innovative solutions to various fruit-growing problems. In his scientific research, he generally focused on pomology, plant physiology, fruit tree crops, and conservation of orchards. He published over one hundred publications, including an academic handbook \\"Horticulture\\". Studies and scientific interests Right after Pieniążek graduated from the University of Warsaw in 1938, he decided to further his education by studying at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY from 1938-1942, where he got his PhD. Later, he became an assistant professor in the faculty of gardening and in 1945 he became an associate professor. After returning to Poland in 1946, he became a professor at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, and also a director in its faculty of horticulture. In 1952, he joined the Polish United Workers' Party. From 1965-1966, he served as the dean of the faculty of gardening at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. In 1954, he received the title of professor, no longer being an associate professor. In 1951-1983, he was a co-founder of the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, later known as the Institute of Horticulture and Floriculture. This institute to this day remains a symbol of Skierniewice and is named after Pieniążek, who was also its first manager. In 1952, Pieniążek joined the Polish Academy of Sciences as an associate member. In 1964, he became an outright member. From 1966-1971 he was secretary of the Faculty of Agricultural and Forestal Sciences, and from 1975-1980 a vice-president of the Academy. He was also an honorary chairman of the Horticultural Sciences Committee at the Polish Academy of Sciences. Szczepan Pieniążek was also a member of the International Society for Horticultural Science, and other international or Polish scientific societies. In February 1984, Pieniążek was named an honorary citizen of Skierniewice. Pieniążek put forward his first research programme in 1949. Its goals were, among many others, to introduce new apple cultivars from the US, and eliminate intercrops from orchards. The findings were later discussed at an international conference in Skierniewice. It was attended by 30 scientists, 15 of them from Eastern countries, and 15 from the Western countries.Wspomnienie wybitnego polskiego sadownika prof. Szczepana Pieniążka (A Memory of a Remarkable Polish Orchardist Szczepan Pieniążek) (radio \\"Jedynka”, 4.07.2008) During Stalinism in Poland, Pieniążek was an active exponent of the ideas of Ivan Michurin, a Soviet scientist who was a creator of quite controversial theories on plant breeding. Among those Pieniążek was mostly interested in dwarf fruit tree breeding theories, which are nowadays considered the most significant among all of Michurin's findings. At the same time, Pieniążek opposed the widely accepted discoveries of geneticists like Thomas Hunt Morgan.Sz.

Marchetti served first as a local pastor after his ordination but decided to later help Giovanni Battista Scalabrini in his mission to tend to and support Italian emigrants. He started to take trips to Brazil to focus on Italians relocating there and later moved there to found an orphanage and to work alongside abandoned children and emigrants. He also invited his sister, Assunta Marchetti, to help him in his work and she would continue his mission for the four decades after his death. She herself would become beatified, as a Blessed Mother. The process for his beatification started its initial planning phase in the mid-1990s that resulted in a formal process activating and allowing for Marchetti to be titled as a Servant of God. He later became titled as Venerable in mid-2016 after Pope Francis acknowledged that he had lived a life of heroic virtue. Life Giuseppe Marchetti was born on 3 October 1869 in Lombrici di Camaiore in the Lucca province as the second of eleven children to Angelo Marchetti (17.10.1846-26.4.1893) and Carola Ghilarducci (13.12.1850-22.2.1927). His siblings (in order) wrre: * Agostino (9.7.1868 - 27.2.1923) * Assunta (15.8.1871 - 1.7.1948) - beatified in 2014. * Angela Pardini (19.1.1873 - 28.6.1950) * Teresina Angeli (1876 - 22.9.1946) * Pio (1877 - 1952) * Vincenzo (22.2.1879 - 5.3.1879) * Elvira Dinucci (1880 - 1966) * Filomena Barbara Cecilia Capocchi (22.11.1886 - 11.11.1973) * Maria Luisa Zioni (10.7.1891 - 9.8.1987) His maternal grandparents were Antonio Giovanni Domenico Ghilarducci and Francesca Lenci. His maternal great-grandparents were Luigi Ghilarducci as well as Gio Domenico Lenci and Francesca Volpi. His paternal grandparents were Antonio Marchetti and Marianna D'Alessandro. In 1880 the Marchetti's relocated to Mulino di Camaiore so that his father could begin working as a miller, though he later died from pneumonia. In his childhood he liked reading the Psalms in the Bible and also was known for having read and liked The Imitation of Christ which he kept with him at most times. He distinguished himself in his ecclesial studies and later received his ordination to the priesthood on 3 April 1892 from the Archbishop of Lucca Nicola Ghilardi, before being appointed as the pastor for Compignano di Massarosa; he was first assigned to teach French to seminarians but this task was made brief so that he could begin pastoral work. He carried out his duties there as a pastor until he attended a conference in whichGiovanni Battista Scalabrini (the Bishop of Piacenza) spoke about Italian emigrants who were moving abroad. He decided from that point that he would collaborate with Scalabrini and the two set to work on how best to guide and support Italian emigrants. He often accompanied immigrants to the port in Genova to see them off, but decided that it was not enough to help them. Marchetti decided to focus on Brazil while Scalabrini – despite his own pastoral obligations in Piacenza – would focus on the United States. He undertook his first trip to Brazil from the Genova port on 15 October 1894, that lasted until December, and would later make a second trip in 1895 (serving as a chaplain on both trips) that confirmed to him the need to move to Brazil to better respond to his mission. That second trip saw a mother die aboard the ship \\"Julius Caesar\\" leaving her months-old daughter and husband. This episode proved to Marchetti the need to expand his care for both emigrants and children. It was after he arrived at São Paulo that he oversaw the establishment of an orphanage for the protection of abandoned children in 1895. Marchetti also invited his sister Assunta in 1895 to help him in his mission in Brazil and he would also go on to co-found alongside her the Scalabrinian Sisters. His sister would arrive in Brazil alongside their mother and two others, though their mother returned to their homeland in 1897. He later made his religious profession on 25 October 1895 in Piacenza into the hands of Scalabrini in the presence of his sister. Marchetti died on 14 December 1896 in São Paulo after having contracted typhoid fever as he tended to an ill woman on her deathbed, whose confession he went to go and hear. His remains are buried in São Paulo. Beatification process The centennial commemorating his death prompted the Scalabrinian Superior General Father Luigi Favero and the Scalabrinian Sisters Superior General Lice Maria Signor on 24 June 1996 to send word to their respective orders of their intention to pursue a beatification cause for Marchetti. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" edict (no objections to the cause) on 7 December 1999 and titled Marchetti as a Servant of God. The diocesan process was launched in the São Paulo archdiocese on 5 May 2000 and was later closed on 28 November 2001 before the C.C.S. validated the diocesan process on 21 February 2003. The postulation (the officials leading and coordinating the cause) submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2008 for assessment. It first went to six historians on 22 January 2008 with five out of six issuing their approval which enabled the cause to move forward. Six of eight theologians (those absent issued a written vote) met on 13 October 2015 but there was the unanimous conclusion that clarifications were needed before casting a definitive vote; these clarifications enabled for a unanimous agreement later on 21 January 2016. The cardinal and bishops of the C.C.S. also issued their assent to the cause on 8 July 2016. Marchetti became titled as Venerable on 8 July 2016 after Pope Francis issued a decree that acknowledged that Marchetti had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. The current postulator for the cause (since October 1996) is the Scalabrinian priest Ennio Guglielmo Bellinato and the current vice-postulator is Sr. Leocadia Mezzomo from the Scalabrinian Sisters. The first vice-postulator that had been assigned to the cause (from 2.2.1997) was Sister Blandina Felippelli (also from the Scalabrinian Sisters) and the second had been Father Sisto Caccia (from 10.5.2002).

He later went on to become a General-lieutenant. Early life Taran was born on to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Sholokhovo in the Yekaterinoslavsky Uyezd of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). After completing seven grades of school he attended a trade school in Zaporizhia, which he graduated from in 1933. He attended another vocational school in 1934, after which he was employed at a Metallurgical plant as an electrician until 1937. That year he graduated from training at the Nikopol aeroclub and joined the military in November. Barely a year later in December 1938 he graduated from the Kacha Military Aviation School of Pilots and was then assigned to the 50th Bomber Aviation Regiment. In Spring 1939 he was transferred to the 35th High-Speed Bomber Regiment, in which he first saw combat during the Soviet invasion of Poland. In November he was deployed to the warfront of the Winter War, where he piloted the Tupolev SB. After returning from the war in April he was assigned to the 81st Long-Range Bomber Regiment as a flight commander.  World War II  From the first month of Operation Barbarossa, Taran participated in the defense of the Soviet Union. He soon suffered a close call with death when his Il-4 was shot down by German fighters; he was able to parachute out of the plane shortly before it crashed. All other crew members on board were killed in the crash. Having parachuted out at a low altitude, he landed close to his fallen bomber and buried the remains of his deceased comrades. After returning to his unit three days later he returned to flying and was reassigned to a new flight crew. He remained with that crew until September 1942, during which he flew 150 missions and gained multiple shootdowns of enemy fighters with them. He was again shot down on 24 October 1941. For flying 33 daylight and 26 night missions he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 11 September 1941 and awarded it on 20 June 1942. In August 1942 his unit was honored with the guards designation and renamed the 5th Guards Long-range Aviation Regiment. During the ceremony of receiving the guards flag, Taran was the standard- bearer. That year he received a minor head injury during a mission to bomb an enemy airfield. In September he began flying with a new aircrew, and by 30 November 1943 he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union again for flying 350 sorties, during which two enemy crossings, fifteen supply warehouses, and eight aircraft on the ground were destroyed in addition to starting 39 fires. He was awarded the title again on 13 March 1944 before leaving the 81st Regiment in July. In July 1944 he became a flight inspector for the 6th Long-range Aviation Corps. In that role he approved nine pilots for night flights and reviewed 76 more pilots. In April he was made commander of the 240th Bomber Aviation Regiment, which carried out 190 sorties during spring 1945 and was tasked with bombing tank columns, ammunition storage facilities, bridges, airfields, and trains as well as photographing bombed areas. Throughout the war he flew 356 sorties, of which 316 were at night. He flew in the battles over Ukraine, the Caucasus, Kuban, Kursk, Leningrad, Belarus, Lviv, the Baltics, Konigsberg and Berlin.  Postwar  Taran remained in command of the 240th Regiment until April 1946, after which he became a squadron commander in the 199th Guards Bomber Regiment. From March 1948 to May 1951 he served as a flight inspector in the 4th Guards Aviation Corps, which used the B-25 and Tu-4. He then was appointed as commander of the 251st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, which he remained in until being made deputy commander of the 15th Guards Heavy Bomber Division in December 1954; in July 1955 he was promoted to commander of the division, and in 1957 he was promoted to the rank of general-major. After graduating from the Military Academy of the General Staff he became the commander of the 79th Heavy Bomber Division in December 1958; the division used the Tu-95. He then held a variety of flight training and staff posts before retiring in 1979 as a general-lieutenant. From then until 1984 he worked as a designer for the Tupolev Bureau. He died in Moscow on 14 September 2005 and was buried in the Troekurovsky cemetery.

It was published in 2013 by Blackwatch Comics. Illustrated by Steven Perkins, the story is presented with black-and-white art panels in a stark, film noir style and is visually different from Easton's previous Soul Stealer trilogy or his The Green Woman. While the perspective of both these earlier stories reflected their morally conflicted protagonists, Credence is harsher, with a bleaker perspective on the surrounding world. A sequel, Credence II: Lose This Skin, is slated for release in 2020.  Summary  Danny Credence is the most decorated cop in New York City, and is a self-destructive, angry, corrupt loner who prefers the company of his three-legged dog to human beings. He struggles to be a decent single father to his son, struggles with his ex- wife, and struggles with the constant pull between addiction and recovery. Coming from a family of cops, his identity is wrapped up in and defined by the legacy of his badge – being one of ‘the good guys' in search of the bad ones, even while he's committing morally questionable acts. With his life in crisis and his career the only thing he has to cling to, Credence struggles to stop himself from sliding into a degeneracy that both repulses and pulls him. As he pursues a murderer whose crimes shock even him, he realizes he understands his quarry with an intimacy that could be the final push into the darkness. \\"It's about a guy who's trying to hold together his family while he spirals deep into depravity — the catch being that he's also a cop,\\" Easton observed to TV Guide. \\"He's also a guy who is having a lot of trouble relating to everyday life...He understands criminals better than he understands what's going on in society.\\"  Reviews  Keith Howell commended the story in Ain't It Cool News. \\"Easton excels at delivering the inner darkness of human depravity while finding subtle ways to pierce the shadow with the sharp light of beauty,\\" he observed. \\"It's one more example of Easton pushing the boundaries of the box of public expectations. It delivers the goods like a solid police drama, but with a deeper spiritual resonance of how the bad choices we make drive the direction of our lives.\\" \\"Abel Ferrara's pull quote on the front of this comic isn't wrong, as Danny Credence really does give Harvey Keitel's character a run for his money,\\" Greg Burges of Comic Book Review wrote. “Credence navigates the world with a cynic’s eye, blasting humanity’s obsession with reality television and selfies,” adding, “It’s nice to see Easton try something different with the hard-boiled cop trope…it’s an unusual comic.” LA Weekly praised the novel, saying, \\"if Raymond Chandler was writing graphic novels today … it would read like Credence.\\"  References   External links  *Michael Easton Official website *The Credence File (PDF) *Easton, Michael (2014) \\"Credence\\" .

They have a Lagrangian containing second-order derivatives of a scalar field but do not generate ghosts (kinetic excitations with negative kinetic energy), because they only contain one propagating scalar mode (as well as the two usual tensor modes). History DHOST theories were introduced in 2015 by David Langlois and Karim Noui. They are a generalisation of Beyond Horndeski (or GLPV) theories, which are themselves a generalisation of Horndeski theories. The equations of motion of Horndeski theories contain only two derivatives of the metric and the scalar field, and it was believed that only equations of motion of this form would not contain an extra scalar degree of freedom (which would lead to unwanted ghosts). However, it was first shown that a class of theories now named Beyond Horndeski also avoided the extra degree of freedom. Originally theories which were quadratic in the second derivative of the scalar field were studied, but DHOST theories up to cubic order have now been studied.

Two segments, totaling have been built. The Trail primarily utilizes the abandoned road bed of the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad. The trail will connect with the Colonial Annapolis Maritime Trail on the east and the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail, via the Odenton Bike Path, on the west. When complete, it will be a component of the American Discovery Trail, the East Coast Greenway and the September 11th National Memorial Trail. The trail name is a reference to the railroad it replaces which during its last 10 years in operation was known as the South Shore Division because it ran along the south shore of the Severn River. History The Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad was chartered in 1837 and began operating in 1840. Competition and fees forced it into bankruptcy and reorganization in the 1880s and it changed its name to the Annapolis, Washington & Baltimore Railroad. In 1902 it was purchased by the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad (WB&A;) and transformed into an electric interurban line. In 1921, when the WB&A; purchased the B&A;, the line became known as the South Shore Division of the WB&A; and the B&A; as the North Shore Division based on their relationship to the Severn River. In 1935, the entire WB&A; ceased operations and the section between Odenton and Annapolis was sold for scrap. In the late 1980s, Maryland turned the southern portion of the B&A; railroad into a rail trail and by 1986, the success from that led Anne Arundel County to declare intentions to do the same for the South Shore line. On November 9, 1990 county leaders broke ground on a half- mile section of the trail between Waterbury Road and I-97 in Millersville, but work did not commence. For nearly 30 years, the trail languished, delayed by environmental concerns, local opposition and budget constraints. First the trail was delayed by the reluctance of owners to sell the rail bed, which by then had passed back into the hands of residents, to the county for a trail. Then money became an issue when, in 1992 limited by a cap on tax revenue, the County Council voted to pull $270,000 from the trail project to repair the Lake Waterford dam in Pasadena. Though they planned to restore the funding in 1994 and 1995 public opposition became an issue. In 1994, with formal plans still five years away, the county considered allocating $660,000 for planning and land acquisition; but local residents began to express cost concerns and fear of crime related to a connection to Millersville Elementary. At the same time, the project managers had to petition the Army Corps of Engineers for permission to use a portion of the rail bed that passed through what had since become wetlands. In 2001 the trail, this time the planned section along General's Highway, was facing public opposition because it would run through some people's front yards. In 2008, the County voted to redirect Program Open Space funding intended for the trail and other park projects towards the installation of artificial turf fields at county high school stadiums, further delaying the project. The county also struggled with land acquisition and ownership issues. It first claimed it had purchased all the land it needed in late 1999, but for years thereafter it was still trying to prove that it owned every parcel it claimed it did and it continued to make purchases for more than a decade. In 2000, the County had to buy a historic, two-story house on 2.9 acres along Cecil Avenue in Millersville to become the trail's headquarters because it was the only way to get a piece of property it needed. In 2013, the state paid $138,853 to acquire two parcels of land totaling 0.8 acres in Millersville. Despite this, the project continued to attract attention as a key connection. In 1991, the American Hiking Society and Backpacker magazine created a plan for the cross-country American Discovery Trail between Delaware and California and the South Shore Trail was designated a future portion of it. By 1998, it had been identified as part of the future East Coast Greenway. Work on segments of the South Shore Trail finally began in 2002 as part of other larger projects. That year, in construction related to the Nordstrom Wing of the Westfield Annapolis Mall, the County built 750 feet of trail between the Anne Arundel Medical Center and Jennifer Road. The following year, work was completed on the Odenton Bike Path which will serve as the connection between the South Shore Trail and the WB&A; Trail. In 2006 a section of the Annapolis Maritime Trail was constructed along Solomons Island Road from the South Shore Trail's Jennifer Road trailhead to Somerville Road; and later that same year, 2,500 feet of trail was built from the north end of the existing section to Bestgate Road at Commerce Park Drive. Meanwhile, the main portion of the trail along the railroad route suffered continued delays. Though the trail got $800,000 in the 2005 federal highway bill, there was no construction. In 2010 trail designers decided to reroute the trail in the Millersville area because they were concerned that paving over portions of nontidal wetlands would prove to be too expensive and that the permitting process would take too long. This redesign resulted in another delay in the slow-moving project. In the summer of 2012, the county spent more than $200,000 to buy land along the new planned route. At the time, the start of construction, which had been promised many times in the prior 22 years, was scheduled for July 1, 2013. However, it wasn't until 2015 that the state provided the $990,000 needed to design and construct the first phase between Hansel Drive and Waterbury Road. In 2017, the logjam broke. Construction of Phase I of the trail, the section from Hansel Drive to Waterbury Road, for which ground was originally broken in 1990, officially began in October 2017 In 2018, County Executive Steve Schuh announced a $9.4 million plan to complete the South Shore Trail to Odenton. The money would be used to acquire still more property, complete detailed designs and construct the paved multi- use trail. By that time, construction had been broken into five phases - Phase I (Waterbury to MD Rte. 3), Phase II (MD Rte. 3 to Odenton), Phase III (Bestgate to Eisenhower Golf Course), Phase IV (Eisenhower Golf Course to Waterbury Road) and Phase V (Bestgate Road to City of Annapolis), of which Phase V was complete and Phase I was underway. Phase I was completed in 2019 with a ribbon cutting on May 13, 2019. Description The trail currently exists in two sections, one in Parole, MD between Bestgate Road and Jennifer Road and another between Hansel Drive in Crownsville, MD and Waterbury Road in Millersville, MD totaling about 2.96 miles. County plans call for the sections to be connected and extended to the Odenton Bike Path. On the east end the trail begins at the end of the Annapolis Maritime Trail at the corner of Jennifer Road and Medical Parkway. It travels along Medical Parkway to the north side of the Westgate area where it turns east and then north to connect to Bestgate Road, covering about 3000 feet of distance and ending about 1500 feet from the old rail bed. A gap then exists from there to the start of the other section, about 6 miles away, at Waterbury Road.

This species was first described in 1900 by Giles. The female is attracted to houses where it seeks out humans in order to feed on their blood, mostly during the night. This mosquito is a major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.  Distribution and habitat  Anopheles funestus is found in tropical sub-Saharan Africa, its range extending from Senegal to Ethiopia, Angola, South Africa and Madagascar. Breeding takes place in water, any permanent or semi-permanent body of fresh water with some emergent vegetation being suitable, including swamps, lake verges, ponds and rice paddies. The larvae inhabit both sunlit and shaded locations, the vegetation probably being effective in reducing predation. In the Sahel, increased aridity has moved the northern limit of its range southward by about . Although it is considered to be a single species, part of a species complex, it shows some anomalies of behaviour across its range. It is present in the paddy fields of Madagascar but not in those of West Africa; it used to breed in fast-moving streams in South Africa before being largely eliminated by the use of insecticides, but when it became re-established there via Mozambique, it bred in swamps. It is present in mountainous areas of East Africa at altitudes of up to but is largely absent from forests.  Behaviour  The female mosquito lays a raft of eggs on the surface of water. The larval and pupal stages of the life cycle take place under water, but after metamorphosis, adults of both sexes leave the water and visit flowers to feed on nectar. Before it starts to breed, the female mosquito needs a meal of vertebrate blood to provide the protein it needs for egg production; the male does not bite. The adult female Anopheles funestus is \\"anthropophilic\\", being attracted to people rather than to other animals; however this is not invariably the case, as in Senegal, the populations of this mosquito in the west of the country feed on human blood while those in the east favour that of other mammals (zoophilic). It is also \\"endophilic\\" in its behaviour; this means it is attracted to the inside of human habitations, both when feeding and when resting. It feeds at night, typically after 10 p.m. and usually between midnight and dawn, which gives it access to widely dispersed hosts in a non-alert state.  Vector  Anopheles funestus is an efficient vector of the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria in humans. This is because of its endophilic and anthropophilic characteristics, and because the adult insect is relatively long-lived. This is a highly adaptable species and many populations have developed resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, resulting in an upsurge of malarial infections in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s.

Mendl was born in the Buenos Aires suburb of Hurlingham, where his father was a grain trader. He was sent to England, along with his brother Derek Mendl, where the two were educated at Repton School. From Repton he went up to University College, Oxford to study English and history. He was denied the opportunity to play first-class cricket for Oxford University due to a skiing accident. He debuted in minor counties cricket for Oxfordshire in the 1939 Minor Counties Championship. He served with the South Wales Borderers in the Second World War, enlisting as a second lieutenant. He began teaching at the Dragon School in Oxford in 1945, and for the next decade he opened the batting for Oxfordshire during the summer holidays. He made 76 appearances for the county in Minor Counties Championship, scoring 5,541 runs at an average of 50.83, with the Oxfordshire player Joe Banton considering him the greatest batsman to have represented the county. He made his debut in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for the Minor Counties cricket team against Yorkshire at Lord's in 1949. He accepted a teaching post in Scotland at the Edinburgh Academy in 1950. He made four first-class appearances for Scotland between 1953 and 1955, as well as appearing a first- class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Scotland at Aberdeen in 1957. His most notable innings for Scotland came against Derbyshire, when he scored 65 of Scotland's 100 runs total. He taught at the Edinburgh Academy until his retirement in 1977, serving as a housemaster of Dundas House from 1962 to 1965 and Mackenzie House from 1965 to 1972. Following his retirement, Mendl remained in the Trinity area of Edinburgh and became a keen golfer. Mendl died at Edinburgh in October 2001. He was survived by his wife Betty, whom he had met shortly after arriving at the Edinburgh Academy and married in 1952, and their two children.

Del Junco was convicted of all 4 murders, and given a life sentence for each of them. Early life Del Junco, originally from Cuba, was born as the first child into a family with a history of mental illness. His childhood was described as \\"very tragic\\", with Francisco being rejected by his peers, coupled with having to take medication for epilepsy since he was 3 years old. Although his father ignored him, Francisco's happiest memories involved going to the beach with his mother. At age 16, Del Junco began hearing voices and started seeing priestesses conducting black magic, gradually distancing himself from people as he feared somebody was out to kill him. In 1980, he moved to Miami to settle in with some relatives, arriving through the Mariel boatlift. During his time in the States, Del Junco worked several jobs, regularly visited his psychiatrist and was admitted to the Miami Mental Health Clinic a total of three times (in 1987, 1988 and 1992). Crimes, capture and trial From 1987 to 1995, he was arrested on several occasions for assaulting an officer, burglary, loitering and theft. Del Junco also did not visit his psychiatrist for a final appointment, but was still given a \\"guarded\\" prognosis and was judged as not being a threat to society. However, from August 1995 to March 1996, a total of four crack cocaine- addicted black prostitutes were beaten up, killed with metal pipes and their bodies burned with gasoline afterwards in Miami's Allapattah neighborhood. They were: Vida Hicks (43), Diane Nelms (44), Cheryl Ray (37) and Janice Cox (37). All of them were lured with the promise of free drugs and sex, with their upper torsos being lit on fire after they were killed. Following a 10-month investigation by a special task force, Del Junco was arrested, with a container of gasoline and wooden matches in hand, after the authorities were given substantial information by a homeless woman who was beaten up by Francisco, after she had refused to go on a date with him. Forensic tests were carried out, with results matching the size pattern of the accused's combat boots' prints, found on the crime scene. Del Junco himself later confessed to the crimes, explaining in detail how he took his victims to Key Biscayne, away from industrial surroundings, where he would kill them. He described details only the killer could know, thus exonerating a previous suspect only known under the nickname 'Dread'. At his trial, the Miami-Dade County judge ruled that Francisco del Junco was ineligible for the death penalty due to his mental illness, and was instead given four concurrent life sentences.

It is purported to be the ancestor of Euchre and to have given its name to the playing card known as the Joker. No definitive rules are known.  History  The earliest known record of the game of Jucker occurs in Spindler's 1848 book, Forget-me-not (Vergißmeinnicht), a pocket book \\"dedicated to love, friendship and family life\\" and occasional references surface during the second half of the nineteenth century. Little is known of its rules, but in 1899, Martin and Lienhart describe Jucker as a \\"card game in which the Bauer [i.e. Jack] is worth more than the Ace\\" and a Marsch was to take all five tricks in Juckerspiel. In 1908, Rausch confirms that, in Alsace, in the \\"widespread Juckerspiel\\", the phrase e Marsch mache means to take all the tricks and that the Bauer is the highest card. Later literary references to the game appear in the Rhineland and South Hessian region. Recently, David Parlett has stated that, \\"on linguistic grounds alone there can be no doubt as to [Euchre's] origin in the Alsatian game of Juckerspiel as brought to America by German immigrants.\\" Not only are Jucker and Euchre phonetically alike, but the terms Bauer and Marsch have been imported into Euchre as 'Bower' and 'march'.EUCHRE and related five-trick games at www.parlettgames.uk. Retrieved 14 Jun 2019 However, there are numerous other German games that use the same terms and references to Jucker do not pre-date those to Euchre, so the link remains tenuous.  Related games  The game of Reunion, a 19th-century Rhineland game, shares the feature of having two Jacks as the top trumps, but is a three-hand game played with 10-card hands and a 32-card Skat pack. Recently, members of the International Playing Card Society identified two games, still being played today in the region north of Alsace in Germany, that appear to be descendants of Juckerspiel: Bauer and Hunsrücker Bauern. = Bauer = Bauer is a four-handed, plain-trick game played in the Saarland. It employs a 32-card, French-suited Skat pack and there are 2 Jacks (Bauer) as top trumps: the trump Jack or Dicke (\\"fat one\\") and the Jack of the same suit colour or Linke (\\"left one\\"). Players form two teams of two and are dealt 8 cards each. Suit must be followed, but players may play any card if unable to follow. Teams start with eight points and aim to be first to zero, one game point being deducted to the winners of a deal if they declared trumps. If the declarers lose, they add a point and their opponents deduct one.Bauer -- Euchre in its area of origin at i-p-c-s.org. Retrieved 4 Jul 2019.Bauer (Kartenspiel) at www.spielwiki.de. Retrieved 4 Jul 2019. = Hunsrücker Bauern = The variant of Bauer, or Bauern, played in the Hunsrück, uses 32 French- suited cards and is a six-handed, two-team game in which there are, again, two Jacks as top trumps. If the cut card is a Jack, it determines the trump suit unless superseded later. Players are dealt five cards each from a Skat pack and, if trumps have not already been decided, the top card of the skat is turned for trumps. If it is a Jack, it determines trumps even if the cut card was a Jack. If it is a Jack, the bottom card of the skat is turned and, if it is the same suit, dealer may exchange with it. If not, players are asked in turn if they will play with the turnup suit. If any player says yes, the dealer may exchange with it. If no-one wants to play with the turnup suit, it is turned over again and players are asked if they will play with another suit. If all pass, the cards are redealt. This process is similar to that used in Euchre. Teams start with five lines marked on a slate (Striche) and play for the best of five tricks. If the declarers win, they erase a line; if they lose, they add a line and the winners erase a line.Re: Bauern Hunsrücker Kartenspiel at www.wer-weiss-was.de. Retrieved 4 Jul 2019.

The formal process of doing this process is stated in article XIII of the Treaty. This says that any country that wants to leave must send the United States (as the depositary) a \\"notice of denunciation,\\" which the U.S. would then pass on to the other countries in the alliance. After a one-year waiting period, the country that wants to leave would be out. As of , no member state has rescinded their membership, although it has been mentioned by a few countries. Notwithstanding, a number of former dependencies of NATO members have never applied for membership subsequent to their becoming independent states.  Procedure  Article XIII of the North Atlantic Treaty, is the article that member state use on informing other members or parties that it wishes to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. It states the following: > After the Treaty has been in force for twenty years, any Party may cease to > be a Party one year after its notice of denunciation has been given to the > Government of the United States of America, which will inform the > Governments of the other Parties of the deposit of each notice of > denunciation. This means that after 20 years since the signing of the treaty which was in 1949, thus 1969, any member state that wishes to leave just has to inform the United States that it wants to leave, and then after a year it formally leaves.  Contemplated withdrawals  = France = In 1966 due to souring relations between Washington and Paris because of the refusal to integrate France's nuclear deterrent with other North Atlantic powers, or accept any collective form of control over its armed forces, the French president Charles de Gaulle downgraded France's membership in NATO and withdrew France from the U.S.-led military command to pursue an independent defense system. However, the twenty-year rule prevented France from completely leaving NATO altogether. One consequence of this withdrawal was the movement of NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe from Rocquencourt (in France) to the city of Mons in Belgium. This changed in 2009 when president Nicolas Sarkozy changed course and returned France to full participation, and the French Parliament backed this decision with a vote of confidence. Currently, of the noted political parties in France; those advocating France withdraw from NATO include the far-right, National Rally and the Popular Republican Union,Schrepf, Jerôme. \\"Villeneuve-sur-lot. L'UPR entre conquête et résistance\\", LaDépêche.fr, May 24, 2013. Retrieved on 1 October 2013 together with the far-left La France Insoumise and the French Communist Party. The right-wing Gaullist Debout la France advocates reversing the 2009 decision for France returning to NATO command. In a 2017 poll of French public opinion toward NATO, 60% of French people have a favourable viewpoint, compared to 34% who have an unfavourable viewpoint. = Greece = In 1964, due to the Cyprus crisis, Greece withdrew military units from NATO forces in the Southern Mediterranean, over threats of invasion of Cyprus by fellow NATO member Turkey. Later in 1974 due to the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish forces, Greece withdrew from NATO military command. Notwithstanding, the country did not withdraw entirely from the organisation, but became significantly less active. In 1980, the Greek foreign minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis made remarks about the situation where he could see Greece fully withdrawing from the organisation. However, later diplomatic pressure from the United States led to Greece fully re-integrating with the alliance. = Iceland = Iceland is unique amongst NATO members that it does not have a standing army, and its defence forces consists of a militarised coastguard and a paramilitary peacekeeping force. Iceland's strong pacifist history has led to considerable opposition to NATO membership in Iceland. Nevertheless, the country is host to a notable United States Navy base at Keflavík airport, near the country's capital Reykjavík. Plus, its location in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean makes a strategic point for intelligence and signals information. The country's main nonpartisan pressure group for Iceland leaving NATO is Samtök hernaðarandstæðinga, which is a branch of War Resisters' International. In 2019 while during a visit by the Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to Iceland, the Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir spoke of her support for withdrawing Iceland from NATO. Her party, the Left-Green Movement, is the senior partner of the Icelandic government also supports withdrawing, but there isn't a majority in the Icelandic parliament for withdrawing. = Montenegro = The 2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election resulted in a victory for opposition parties for the first time in thirty years. Several of those parties, including the Democratic Front, oppose NATO membership. = Netherlands = The general consensus about the foreign and defence policy of the Netherlands is being a member of the alliance. Its membership is supported by all five main establishment parties in the Staten-General; the liberal VVD, the social-democratic PvdA, the christian-democrat CDA, right-wing populist PVV, and social-liberal D66. Other parties are supportive but would like to reform the alliance such as the green-socialist GroenLinks. While the far- right populist Forum voor Democratie supports NATO membership, it was reported by the investigative show Zembla that privately the party's leader Thierry Baudet would like the Netherlands to leave NATO and alight the country's foreign policy with Russia. = Romania = Some political parties in Romania oppose Romanian membership in NATO. One of them is Noua Dreaptă, which is also against the European Union. = Turkey = Since the 2016 attempted coup d'état and warming relations between Turkey and Russia, there has been calls for Turkey to leave or be thrown out of NATO. = United Kingdom = Membership of NATO is considered a non-debatable subject within the whole United Kingdom's defence and foreign policy framework. Membership is supported by the major parties in the UK, including the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Of the UK-wide parties in the House of Commons, only the Green Party is against NATO membership. Support for NATO is high in the United Kingdom with a poll in 2017 indicating that 62% of British people have a favourable view of NATO, compared with only 16% having unfavourable view of the Alliance. The situation with whether an independent Scotland should join NATO if it ever achieves independence, has been fraught within supporters of an independent Scotland. Originally the Scottish National Party was against NATO membership, much of this was due to the party's non-nuclear stance with Scotland hosting the Trident nuclear programme at the Clyde Naval Base. This changed in 2012, when the SNP under the leadership of Alex Salmond changed its manifesto saying that it would support NATO membership and would join NATO if Scotland ever becomes independent, provided the alliance respect Scotland's non-nuclear stance. This led to some senior members of the SNP to leave the party, including John Finnie and Jean Urquhart. Other independence parties including the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Green Party don't support Scotland's membership and would not join if Scotland becomes independent. Among the parties in Northern Ireland, NATO policy tends to follow along the unionist-nationalist axis using the basis on the UK's membership and Ireland's neutrality. All the main parties that support Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom including the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionist parties, support NATO membership. While the parties that advocate unification of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland including SDLP and Sinn Féin, support Irish neutrality. Among the non-sectarian parties which are parties are neither unionist or nationalist, both the Alliance Party and the Green Party of Northern Ireland are ambiguous in its viewpoint. = United States = Donald Trump expressed interest in withdrawing from the organisation during his 2016 presidential campaign. However, after he was inaugurated in 2017, he stated that the United States would protect allies in the event that Article V is invoked. Nevertheless, the New York Times reported in 2019 that a year earlier, he had already mentioned several times privately that he wanted the United States to leave NATO. Such concerns led the House of Representatives in January 2019, to pass the NATO Support Act (H.R. 676), confirming Congress' support for NATO and prohibiting funds being used for withdrawing from NATO. On December 11, 2019, the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee passed a bill to be put in front of Congress which would require Congressional approval for American withdrawal from NATO. Polling conducted by Pew Research Center in 2017, said that 62% of Americans are favourable to NATO compared to 23% who are not favourable. In terms of voters, over three-quarters of Democrats are favourable with just 48% of Republicans favourable. Also they said that a plurality of those surveyed, 47% said NATO does too little globally. In further polling in 2019 on the eve of NATO's 70th birthday, 77% of Americans say being a member of NATO is good for the United States. While both major parties support NATO membership, all the major third parties including the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the Constitution Party support withdrawing the United States from NATO.  Former parts of NATO as overseas territories and dependencies  On the time of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, many parts of the world were either overseas or dependent territories of their mother country such as France and the United Kingdom. As follows, many of them like Algeria and Malta were part of NATO. Although the treaty limits involvement to no lower than the Atlantic region of Tropic of Cancer, and as so defacto limits membership to those in North America and Europe as stated in Articles V & VI. So this means that once those overseas territories gained independence, those outside that area couldn't rejoin as full members. = Algeria = When France joined NATO in 1949, the northern African territory of Algeria was part of Metropolitan France. By virtue of this, Algeria was part of NATO since its inception. In fact Article VI clearly states that an armed attack on Algeria would considered an attack on NATO. When Algeria gained its independence from France in 1962, its membership was ceased and the Article VI cause was removed. Like many Maghreb and Arab countries, it aligned itself with the Soviet Union which it ended for Algeria with the end of the Cold War. Since 2000, Algeria has participated in NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue forum. = Malta = On the time of the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory in a form of a self-governing crown colony of the United Kingdom. Dependent territories like Malta had their international memberships of their mother country, so the island was part of NATO. In fact, the headquarters of the Allied Forces Mediterranean was based in the town of Floriana between 1952 and 1965. When Malta gained independence in 1964, the country did not apply to join NATO, due to the relations between NATO and the prime minister George Borg Olivier at the time, but nevertheless supported the alliance. This changed in 1971, when the Labour's Dom Mintoff was elected as prime minister and stated that Malta is neutral in its foreign policy, a position which was later enacted into the country's constitution in 1974. Later the country joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1979, at the same time when the British Royal Navy left its base in Malta Dockyard. In 1995, Malta joined NATO's Partnership for Peace defence program. However, it withdrew its membership a year later in 1996 by the newly elected Labour government. Maltese foreign policy changed notably in 2004, with the country joining the European Union and it re-joined the PfP program in 2008, pointing to a change in the island's foreign relations. Membership of NATO is not supported by any of the country's political parties including current governing Labour and the opposition Nationalists. NATO's secretary-general Stoltenberg says the alliance fully respects Malta's position of neutrality, and put no pressure for the country to join the alliance. = Cyprus = Like Malta, Cyprus was a crown colony at the time of the United Kingdom until it gained independence in 1960. As so, Cyprus was also a member of the NATO under the British crown. However the reason for Cyprus' non-membership due to the Cyprus conflict and relations between Greece and Turkey. This reason even also extends to Cyprus' non-participation in the Partnership for Peace program.

Notable wildlife artist Fenwick Lansdowne stated that Pope \\"gave us the first comprehensive, well executed pictorial record of Canadian birds.\\" According to Pope's biographer, Pope contributed \\"a great deal\\" to Canada's settler heritage through his paintings and journals. Pope's watercolours of birds are often compared to the works of John James Audubon, though Pope's works were smaller in size and ambition.  Life and art  William Pope was born on 8 January 1811, in Maidstone, Kent, England and attended art school in London. Born into a wealthy family, Pope had the means \\"to indulge in his two favourite pursuits, shooting and painting.\\" In 1834, Pope came to North America for the first time. He traveled in the United States, eventually moving on to what is now southwestern Ontario (then Upper Canada). He later began searching for birds in the backwoods of Upper Canada between 1834 and 1835. By 1847, he had painted almost 100 works. After travelling back and forth between England and Canada, Pope took permanent residence in Canada in 1859, living in Port Ryerse, Norfolk County, Ontario. As a \\"sportsman- naturalist\\", Pope hunted birds as well as painting them. Many of his works used watercolours, plus fine details added with pen and ink. A few of his works were landscapes but most of his wildlife paintings did not have elaborate backgrounds. Pope also wrote on the behaviour of the subjects in his drawings, writings which are summarized in Harry B. Barrett's biography of Pope, The 19th Century Journals & Paintings of William Pope. After Pope's death in 1902, his son William E. Pope took over his father's farm.  Legacy  In 1894, James Bain, chief librarian for Toronto Public Library, acquired a book of William Pope's original paintings from a used bookstore in London, England. In 1916, Pope's grandson sold 150 of his grandfather's watercolours to John Ross Robertson, who commented that \\"it would be a crime if these pictures were to leave the country\\". Robertson donated the paintings to Toronto Public Library, where they were first displayed on 29 January 1917. The works later underwent significant conservation treatment at the library. A commemorative plaque about Pope was installed by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in the County of Norfolk, Ontario.

It is currently in the planning and preconstruction stages. It would cover over 16,000 acres. The Utah Inland Port Authority is a government-run corporation with the responsibility and legal powers to develop and run the Utah Inland Port. As of August 2019, its current CEO is Jack Hedge. The Port Authority is governed by a Port Authority Board. Per Utah Code, seven board members are appointed, and four hold their post ex officio \\"The governor appoints two board members, one being an employee or officer of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. The following appoint one board member each: The Senate President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Salt Lake County Mayor, Chair of the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board (from among the Permanent Community Impact Fund Board). City Manager of West Valley City (with consent of City Council). Other board members include: Chair of the Salt Lake Airport Advisory Board (or the chair’s designee), Council Member from Salt Lake City Council District 1, Executive Director of the Department of Transportation, Director of the Salt Lake County office of Regional Economic Development.\\" The current board chair is Salt Lake City Councilman James Rogers; its previous chair was Derek Miller, chair of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce. History In 2016, the University of Utah submitted an assessment regarding a potential inland port in the Salt Lake City area. Funded by the World Trade Center Utah and the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, the report found the potential for strong economic benefits, including high-paying job opportunities, and rural economic development. It also found a need to perform additional studies on environmental impacts and the effect on tax revenues. Also in 2016, Governor Gary Herbert created an Inland Port Exploratory Committee to \\"drive the development\\" of an inland port in Utah. At the time, he stated that \\"despite anti-trade, isolationist rhetoric at the national level, Utah remains committed to promoting international trade.\\" The Inland Port Authority and Inland Port were created as legal entities by the Utah State Legislature, in bill SB234, in 2018. The boundaries of the port were first spelled out at this time, amounting to about 16,000 acres. In 2019, HB0433 significantly broadened the Inland Port Authority's reach. The proposed boundaries amount to approximately one-third of Salt Lake City's land area. On March 11, 2019, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski and the Salt Lake City's Attorney's Office brought a lawsuit against the port, challenging the legality of the legislation underlying the port's creation. On January 9, 2020, the presiding judge rejected the city's claims and dismissed the case. The city's new mayor, Erin Mendenhall, called the decision a “disappointment” but stated she planned to appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. =Protests= In April 2019, environmental activists disrupted the port board's monthly meeting. In May 2019, environmental advocates demonstrated against the port. On June 5, 2019, protestors disrupted the Inland Port Authority board meeting. On July 9, 2019, about 100 protestors stormed the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce building to protest the port. Fourteen were later charged with riot and criminal trespass after the protests turned violent. On August 14, 2019, a \\"working group\\" meeting was disrupted by protestors. On October 17, 2019, activists again protested the Inland Port Authority public board meeting. Criticisms and controversy =Loss of local control= Salt Lake City leaders have argued that the State Legislature is unfairly taking control of local land. SB 234 gave the Inland Port Authority administrative authority over all land-use decisions, and the power to capture 100 percent of newly generated taxes within the inland port borders. This would amount to millions of dollars in tax revenue that would not be captured by Salt Lake City for local property taxes. City leaders also assert that the creation of the inland port would take tax revenue that would otherwise have gone to Salt Lake City schools and libraries. The Utah League of Cities & Towns called the creation of the Inland Port Authority “nothing short of a state takeover of a swath of Salt Lake City without the city’s consent.” Prior to the passage of SB 234, Salt Lake City had approved a master plan that governed the development of the inland port area, as well as agreements with northwest quadrant landowners committing to reinvest tax revenues into the area to aid development. That master plan and agreements would be superseded by the creation of the inland port. The Salt Lake County Council was not consulted during negotiations over SB 234. The County Council asked Governor Herbert to veto the bill. HB 433 allowed the Inland Port Authority to expand its reach outside of the boundaries currently set, and prohibited any city from bringing legal action against the port, or any other challenge to the authority's creation or existence. In the runup to its passage, Jackie Biskupski stated \\"this bill effectively creates a government entity, not only unaccountable to the community but immune from judicial scrutiny, closing the courtroom door to local communities.\\" Supporters of the bill stated its goal was to allow other interested cities or counties to join the port project. The land the proposed port would be built on was once considered sacred by the Shoshone, Ute and Goshute Indian tribes. =Lack of transparency and conflicts of interest= The bill establishing the Inland Port was passed by the Utah Legislature with broad changes from earlier versions with little time for public comment and review. The bill was discussed for only 15 minutes on the floor of the state legislature. \\"The citizens of the Westpointe Community Council, which encompasses most of the [area of the inland port], believe the Legislature's late introduction of this bill (SB234) is by design to impede fair and proper citizen and stakeholder due process,\\" said Terry Thomas, vice chairman of the community council. Greg Hughes, who was the Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives when HB 234 was passed, appointed himself as an Inland Port board member. Less than a week later, he resigned from this position, after it was discovered that he owned property which was close enough to the port boundaries to have legally disqualified him from being on the board in the first place. In August 2018, board members voted 9-2 against making board subcommittee meetings available for public access. Eventually the board did away with subcommittee meetings altogether. The board's ex-chair, Derek Miller - who is also the chair of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce - sent an email in October 2019 inviting a national rail business a spot on the chamber's \\"exclusive\\" Inland Port Committee, in exchange for $10,000. Critics have suggested this represents a \\"pay-to-play\\" impropriety. Miller later called the fundraising email a mistake. =Environmental issues= The Utah Inland Port would increase train traffic and could increase coal consumption. The Inland Port is located in non-attainment zones for several airborne pollutants, meaning that current air quality standards are not met. Critics argue that the presence of an inland port would increase diesel truck traffic in the area and therefore further exacerbate poor air quality in Utah. Also, language adopted in the Utah code makes it difficult to regulate natural resources moving through the Inland Port; critics fear the port's presence would ease the export of coal, thus increasing its usage and associated environmental impacts including climate change. State Senator Luz Escamilla introduced a bill in the Utah state legislature that would fund the Utah Department of Environmental Quality to install air and water monitors at the site of the proposed port, to establish baseline readings for future comparison. No official environmental impact study has been completed, although Miller had stated one would be complete by the first quarter of 2019. A final draft of the port's overall business plan - with an environmental sustainability plan included - was released in May 2020. It was approved unanimously by the board the next month despite negative public comments. The Great Salt Lake is currently at half of its historical size; the shrinkage can be attributed directly to withdrawals for industrial, agricultural and economic activities. Additionally, the ecosystem surrounding the lake is considered to be under severe stress due to the falling water levels and other human activities. Environmental advocates are concerned the port's presence would increase the environmental pressures on the ecosystem and increase water expenditures. Millions of migratory birds also use the land as a stopover point yearly. =Traffic congestion= A critical analysis estimates the Inland Port's presence could create about 11,600 new truck trips and 23,000 additional car trips daily, at half of the Port's developable potential. “By way of comparison, the total number of daily vehicle trips on I-80 between downtown and the [Salt Lake City International] airport was about 42,000 in 2017,” the report states. “This traffic would not only affect I-80 but also I-15 and other streets serving the Port area, including Bangerter Highway and 5600 West.” References External links * Category:Dry ports Category:Ports and harbors of the United States ","title":"Utah Inland Port"},{"id":"61044385","text":"In the Drink is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Justin Courtney Pierre. Produced by Joshua Cain, the album was released on October 12, 2018 in the United States by Epitaph Records. Pierre was previously known as the frontman of indie rock group Motion City Soundtrack, which formed in 1997 and released six albums, also mainly on Epitaph. After the band went on a break in 2016 and re-emerged in 2019, Pierre settled into family life and began developing In the Drink. It was recorded with his former bandmate Joshua Cain. Background The origins of Pierre's first solo effort lie in the dissolution of his former group, Motion City Soundtrack. The band, over their nearly twenty-year career, toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. By 2016, much of the members were starting families and found time spent touring less desirable. They announced a farewell tour, which culminated in a career-spanning set at Chicago's Metro in September 2016. Following that show, Pierre returned to his hometown of Minneapolis and settled into home life with his wife and daughter. He entered therapy, gained weight, and considered options for his future. He briefly considered becoming an accountant, but was drawn back to music within a short time. In the Drink was recorded over a period of seven months, and was produced by Pierre's former bandmate, Joshua Cain, and recorded at his studio, Interdimensional Breakthrough Sound. Cain had developed his skills as a producer over the years, and due to their history, it was natural to reconnect with him for the project. Pierre plays every instrument on the album, aside from the trumpet and drums, which were played by David Jarnstrom of Gratitude. Release and reception In the Drink was announced on July 31, 2018. Pierre returned to Epitaph Records to distribute the release. The album was a promoted with a series of music videos, the first of which was influenced by French New Wave cinema, with the rest interconnected in an ethereal sense.

It belonged to the family Odobenidae, the only extant species of which is the walrus.  Discovery  Four specimens of Proneotherium were discovered in the Astoria Formation of Lincoln County, Oregon, U.S.A.. These specimens included cranial and postcranial remains and are all believed to be adult male animals.  Description  Proneotherium were more similar in appearance to modern fur seals and sea lions than walruses. They lacked the long tusks of walruses, and were more slender and smaller than their modern relatives. Autapomorphies of Proneotherium fossils include a continuous, horizontal crest connecting the mastoid and paroccipital processes of the skull. The teeth are also less secodont in function and appearance than more basal species. This likely represents the slow shift from a piscivorous diet to the mollusk-based diet of modern walruses. The hindlimbs of Proneotherium also show the beginnings of evolutionary shifts from a terrestrial lifestyle to a more aquatic one.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/10.22.2557 = Fragile X syndrome =  Unstable repeats as mutations in human genetic disease  Nelson and other collaborators at BMC, Emory University, and Erasmus University Rotterdam identified a massive expansion of CGG repeat (Trinucleotide repeat disorder) in FMR1. This was the first to be identified as the underlying mutations in human genetic disorders. Their findings in FMR1 explained the unusual inheritance in Fragile X syndrome and provided the principles for all subsequent unstable repeat disorders such as myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  FMR1 in neuronal function  By studying humans, mice, flies and yeast Nelson's research group has characterized the origins of instability in the repeat, the consequences of \\"premutation\\" length expansions, and the function of FMR1 and related FXR1 and FXR2. Nelson and his research group have defined roles for FMR1 and paralogs in circadian rhythm, energy metabolism, neuronal stem cell development, and microRNA function. Their research results are being used in research to define the role of FMR1 in development and potential treatment for these diseases in adulthood. = Fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) = FXTAS individuals are cognitively unaffected until they reach their 60 or 70, when they show neural degeneration and nuclear inclusions during autopsy. Nelson's research group has used flies and mice to identify and characterize modifiers that showed that the CGG repeat is necessary and sufficient to affect mammalian neurons. Models developed by Nelson's research group have improved the understanding of mechanisms of this disease, including a role for RNA-binding functions such as TDP-43 and alterations in 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine.  Public service  Nelson is a member of the Board of Directors of the American Society of Human Genetics, was its President in 2018, and served as Secretary from 2003 to 2009.

A 1988 recipient of the Robert Burns Fellowship, he published three books of poetry and was the 2000 writer in residence at the University of Waikato. Background Dickson was born in Milton in South Otago in 1944. His father, Walter Dickson, was a farm worker. His mother, Margaret Dickson, was a music teacher; she died when her son was 14. Dickson had one brother, 15 years his senior. He received his education at Southland Boys' High School in Invercargill and graduated from the University of Otago in Dunedin with a Bachelor of Arts with a major in English. He then trained as a librarian in Wellington and worked at Otago Polytechnic's Bill Robertson Library until he was made redundant in 2007. He then followed his partner, Jen Uren, whom he had known since their teenage years, to Christchurch where she had moved to in 1990. In Christchurch, Dickson worked at the Millennium Hotel as a kitchen hand and as an undertaker for Heritage Funeral Services. He developed bowel cancer and died on 4 February 2017. Career Dickson started writing poetry as a teenager, initially influenced by Vladimir Mayakovsky and T. S. Eliot, and later Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Blaise Cendrars, and Francis Ponge. In the late 1960s, he was a co-editor of the literary journal Morepork. It was only in 1986 that he published his first collection of poems, What Happened on the Way to Oamaru. He was awarded the Robert Burns Fellowship by his alma mater in 1988. His next publication, Butan, was an audio cassette in 1991. His next collection of poems, Sleeper, was published by Auckland University Press in 1998. Most of the poems in Sleeper were written or started during his Robert Burns Fellowship. Dickson was the writer in residence at the University of Waikato in 2000. In 2009, Dickson published a CD entitled Plain Song.

Early life Born Natalie Scarritt Wales in Cohasset, Massachusetts, she was the daughter of inventor and businessman Nathaniel B. Wales, inventor of the Kelvinator refrigerator. Educated at the elite Spence School in New York City, classmates remembered her as \\"annoyingly popular with the opposite sex\\"; she once invited thirty boys to a tea party - and no other girls.https://www.smh.com.au/national/new- york-socialite-bundled-for-britain-20130208-2e379.html Sydney Morning Herald obituary She was touring Europe at seventeen and almost married an English aristocrat, until her parents brought her home and sent her to Columbia University instead. She had her formal society debut the next year. She married a stockbroker named Kenelm Winslow in 1929; they had two children, her daughters Natalie \\"Bubbles\\" (1930-1988) and Mary-Chilton \\"Mimi\\" (1934-2014), before they divorced. She married diplomat Edward Latham in 1937, a marriage that ended in divorce in 1939. Bundles for Britain Shortly after Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, Natalie Latham sent a telegram to his wife Clementine asking what the British needed to help fight the war; Clementine replied that they needed warm socks for British sailors. Latham set to work, organizing her society friends and carefully following British Navy regulations. \\"Hopelessly fond of organizing\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/world/europe/lady-malcolm- douglas-hamilton-dies-at-103-aided-britain-in-war.html NY Times obituary for Lady Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton as she said of herself and with many Americans anxious to help, \\"Bundles to Britain\\" soon became a major enterprise, raising money through a variety of means and shipping millions of dollars worth of goods to Britain - clothing, blankets, ambulances, X-ray machines, hospital beds, oxygen tents, surgical instruments, blood transfusion kits, tinned food and children’s cots. An auction in England featured several items donated by the queen; Andrew Carnegie's wife made a major donation, actress Joan Crawford encouraged fans to send money to \\"Bundles\\" instead of buying her holiday gifts, and Eleanor Roosevelt spoke at a fundraiser.

It is a herbivorous species which is found in subtropical and tropical seas worldwide. Description Kyphosus bigibbus has an oval shaped body which is laterally compressed with a small head, a pointed snout and a slightly bulging forehead. The mouth is small and when closed the maxilla are hidden beneath the preorbital bones. The mouth is terminal and is almost oblique. The teeth are fixed and incisiform with their bases positioned horizontally in mouth, they have rounded crowns and have a curved, J shape. There are teeth are found on the centre of the roof of the mouth and on the tongue. The dorsal fin is a similar height along its length The anterior part of the dorsal fin has 11 spines which fold down into a scaled furrow while the posterior part contains 10-12 rays. The anal fin has three spines and 10-12 moderately long soft rays and is reasonably long at its base. The symmetrical caudal fin is forked but not extremely so. The lateral line has 61-76 scales of which 51-60 are pored. The colour varies from uniform grey to brownish, silvery vantrally, bronze to greenish tint dorsally. There are very indistinct dark stripes on the body and there are usually whitish streaks on the cheek. The dorsal and anal fins are frequently dark with black margins on their soft-rayed parts. There is sometimes a dark patch visible on the lower posterior angle of the base of the pectoral fin. The caudal fin is usually dark. There are infrequent records of completely yellow individuals and very rate records of albinos. The maximum total length of this species is and it has been weighed at . Distribution Kyphosus bigibbus has a wide distribution in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. In the Indo-Pacific it has been recorded off Western Australia as far south as Rottnest Island, in eastern Australia it is found from southern Queensland and New South Wales as far south as Montague Island, it occurs off northeastern New Zealand. It is also found in the Coral Sea off New Caledonia, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and the Kermadec Islands. In the Indian Ocean it is thought to probably range widely along the northern coasts from Myanmar to Yemen. In the western Indian Ocean it ccurs as far north is the Red Sea and from the Gulf of Aden off Somalia south to Madagascar, Réunion. Its range then extends around the Cape of Good Hope. It has not been confirmed to be present in the Persian Gulf. In the western pacific it is found off southern Japan, Korea, and China as far south as Taiwan, but it is absent from equatorial areas. In the western Atlantic it has been observed off Bermuda, Grand Cayman Island, Belize, and San Blas, Panama. In the eastern Atlantic it has been recorded from Saint Helena, Madeira, Ascension Island, and probably occurs around the Gulf of Guinea Islands and along the west African coast to South Africa. It is also found along Atlantic coast of northwestern Africa as far nor as Portugal, but it has not been recorded from the Mediterranean. It has been recorded from Brazil. Habitat and biology Kyphosus bigibbus is found in shallow coral and rocky reefs, including exposed isolated, offshore reefs and around islands. They are frequently recorded in the surge zone, down to depths of . They are often recorded in mixed schools with other related species. The juveniles often hide among flotsam and can disperse for long distances among this floating material. It is a herbivore which feeds mainly on algae of the genera Sargassum and Turbinaria.

Accessed May 2, 2019. Leadership crisis On May 2, 2019, Ayuk Tabe - still in prison - declared that the Sako-led cabinet had been dissolved, and that the cabinet led by himself had been restored. While the document recognized the Sako cabinet for its sincere efforts, it claimed that it was ultimately not fit to continue; At some point after making this declaration, Ayuk Tabe reached out to former SDF parliamentarian Wirba Joseph, asking him to assume leadership of the revolution. Wirba declined the request, believing the Interim Government to be an \\"imaginary structure\\" and detrimental to the cause.Crise anglophone : Un ancien député du SDF appelle les séparatistes à dire la vérité aux masses souffrantes, Le Bled Parle, Jul 4, 2019. Accessed Jul 4, 2019. (French) However, the Sako-led cabinet did not recognize Ayuk Tabe's authority to dismiss the interim cabinet, and consequently refused to step down. In June 2019, the Ambazonia Restoration Council \\"impeached\\" Ayuk Tabe for \\"treasonous misconduct\\", and declared that he had lost his mandate to speak on behalf of Ambazonia. The leadership crisis complicated the already delicate allegiances among Ambazonian separatist movements. The Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC), which traditionally has had a complicated relationship with the Interim Government, voiced support for Ayuk Tabe. Wirba Joseph called the impeachment of Ayuk Tabe \\"absurd\\". In November 2019, pro-separatist sources reported that Sako and his supporters had changed his title from Acting Interim President to President, aiming to permanently replace Ayuk Tabe even if the latter would ever be released.Dr. Sako sworn in as President of Ambazonia, Mimi Mefo Infos, Nov 30, 2019.

This complicated the prospect of any direct talks with the Cameroonian government.

Early life Kinglsand was born on September 4, 1834 in New York City. He was the eldest of eight children born to Mary (née Lovett) Kingsland (1814–1868) and Ambrose Kingsland (1804–1878), a merchant who was the 71st Mayor of New York City. Among his younger siblings was Ambrose Cornelius Kingsland Jr., (who married Katharine Aspinwall, daughter of merchant William Henry Aspinwall); Henry Pierre Kingsland; Mary Helena Kingsland, who married William Wright Tompkins (grandson of Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins); Cornelius Francis Kingsland; Walter Francis Kingsland, Albert Alexander Kingsland; Philip Kingsland, who died young; and Augusta Lovett Kingsland, who married Herman Leroy Jones. He was a member of the Kingsland family of New Jersey who had, for nearly 200 years, lived in and around Belleville, New Jersey. His paternal grandparents were Cornelius Kingsland and Abigail (née Cock) Kingsland. His nephew, Walter F. Kingsland, married Princess Marie Louise of Orléans in 1928, and his niece, Marjorie Kingsland, married Viscount Robert de Vaulogé. His maternal grandfather, George Lovett, was born in England. Kingsland attended Columbia University, where he was a member of the Alpha Zeta chapter of the Chi Psi fraternity, and graduated in 1856. Career After graduation from Columbia, Kingsland began his career with his father's firm, which became known as A. C. Kingsland and Sons, and was located at No. 55 Broadway in lower Manhattan, eventually becoming a partner. The firm was involved in the sale of sperm oil. In 1872, Kingsland became a director of the George's Creek and Cumberland Coal Company and served as the president of the George's Creek Railroad. After his father's death in 1878, George, along with his siblings, inherited the large estate. The property, which was not divided, was largely along the Hudson River in North Tarrytown, present day Sleepy Hollow, New York, and George managed the estate for the whole family. Personal life In 1875, Kingsland was married to Helen Schermerhorn Welles (1842–1911). Helen, a daughter of Katharine (née Schermerhorn) Welles and Benjamin Sumner Welles, was a granddaughter of Abraham Schermerhorn and niece of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, the Mrs. Astor, who was married to William Astor. Helen's brother was philanthropist Benjamin Welles Jr. and her nephew was Sumner Welles, the Ambassador to Cuba and Under Secretary of State. Together, they were the parents of: * Helen Schermerhorn Kingsland (1876–1956), who married Augustus Newbold Morris (1868–1928), the son of A. N. Morris. * George Lovett Kingsland Jr. (1885–1952), who married Marion de Forest (née Cannon) Prince, daughter of Harry Le Grand Cannon and divorced wife of John Dyneley Prince Jr., in 1915. After the death of her father, Marion's mother remarried to Theodore Frelinghuysen. They divorced in 1923. * Ethel Kingsland (1886–1967), who married Dr. Walter P. Anderton, president of the Medical Society of the County of New York, in 1915. He was a member of the Union Club, the Eastern Yacht Club, the Seawanhaka Yacht Club and the Corinthian Yacht Club, and served as Commodore of the New York Yacht Club. After suffering from gout and Bright's disease, Kingsland died at his summer residence in Babylon, New York on July 14, 1892. After a funeral conducted by the Rev. Dr. Cook at his home, 430 Fifth Avenue, with singing by the boys choir of St. Bartholomew's Church, he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx. After his death, his widow lived at 62 Fifth Avenue until her death in 1911. =Descendants= Through his daughter Helen, he was the grandfather of Augustus Newbold Morris (1902–1966), who was a lawyer, president of the New York City Council, and two-time candidate for mayor of New York City, George Lovett Kingsland Morris (1905–1975), a painter who married Suzy Frelinghuysen, and Stephanus \\"Stephen\\" Van Cortlandt Morris (1909–1984), a diplomat.

It is related to Greenwashing and Greenspeak.Sharon Beder: Greenwashing. In: John Barry, E. Gene Frankland (Eds.): International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics. London 2002, p. 253-54 For example, a commonly used greenscamming method is for anti- environmental organizations to give themselves environmentally friendly or \\"green\\" sounding names that suggest an interest in environmental protection to deceive the public about their true intentions and motives. This procedure corresponds to the aggressive mimicry in biology.See Haydn Washington, John Cook: Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. Earthscan, 2011, pp. 72–75.Paul R. Ehrlich, Anne H. Ehrlich: Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens our Future. Washington D.C., 1998, p. 16. Greenscamming is used in particular by industrial companies and associations that use astroturfing organisations to try to dispute scientific findings that they consider threatening to their business model. One example is the denial of man-made global warming by companies in the fossil energy sector, also driven by specially founded greenscamming organizations.  Background  One reason for setting up greenscamming organizations is that it is very difficult to communicate open anti-environmental movements or initiatives to the public as positive. Sociologist Charles Harper stresses that it would be very difficult for marketing departments to market a group with the hypothetical name \\"Coalition to Trash the Environment for Profit\\". Anti-environment initiatives are therefore often forced to give their front organizations deliberately deceptive names if they want to be successful in public. This is all the more important in view of the fact that surveys indicate that environmental protection is a social consensus. At the same time, however, there is a danger of being exposed as an anti-environmental initiative, which entails a considerable risk that the greenscamming activities backfire and are counterproductive for the initiators.See Charles Harper: Environment and Society. Human Perspectives on Environmental Issues. 5th edition. New York 2016, p. 244–246.  Organization and activities  Greenscamming organizations are very active in the organized climate denial scene, among others. An important financier of greenscamming organizations was the oil company ExxonMobil, which over the years financially supported more than 100 climate denial organizations and spent about 20 million US dollars on greenscamming groups.See Haydn Washington, John Cook: Climate Change Denial. Heads in the Sand. Earthscan, 2011, p. 75. In many of these organizations, James Lawrence Powell identified their \\"admirable\\" designations as the most striking common feature, which for the most part sounded very rationalistic. In this context, he refers to a list of climate denial organizations drawn up by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which includes 43 organizations funded by the Exxon oil company. None of these organizations had a name from which to derive their opposition to climate change. The list is headed by the organization Africa Fighting Malaria, whose website features articles and commentaries opposing ambitious climate mitigation concepts, even though the dangers of malaria could be exacerbated by global warming.James Lawrence Powell: The Inquisition of Climate Science. New York 2012, p. 93-94 Examples Examples of greenscamming organizations include the National Wetland Coalition, Friends of Eagle Mountain, The Sahara Club, The Alliance for Environment and Resources, The Abundant Wildlife Society of North America, the Global Climate Coalition, the National Wilderness Institute, the Environmental Policy Alliance of the Center for Organizational Research and Education, and the American Council on Science and Health.See also: Jen Schneider, Steve Schwarze, Peter K. Bsumek, Jennifer Peeples: The Hypocite's Trap. In: Under Pressure (= Palgrave Studies in Media and Environmental Communication). Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2016, Behind these alleged environmental protection organizations lie the interests of business sectors. For example, the National Wetland Coalition is backed by oil drilling companies and real estate developers, while the Friends of Eagle Mountain are backed by a mining company that wants to convert open-cast mines into landfills. The Global Climate Coalition was again backed by commercial enterprises that fought against government-imposed climate protection measures. Other Greenscam organizations include the US Council for Energy Awareness, backed by the nuclear industry; the Wilderness Impact Research Foundation, representing the interests of lumberjacks and ranchers; and the American Environmental Foundation, representing the interests of landowners.Charles Harper: Environment and Society. Human Perspectives on Environmental Issues. 5th edition. New York 2016, p. 245. Another Greenscam organization is the Northwesterners for More Fish, which had a budget of 2.6 million dollars in 1998. This group opposed conservation measures for endangered fish that restricted the interests of energy companies, aluminium companies and the timber industry in the region, and tried to discredit environmentalists who promoted fish habitats. The Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, the National Environmental Policy Institute and the Information Council on the Environment funded by the coal industry are also greenscamming organizations. In Germany, for example, this form of mimicry or deception is used by the so-called \\"European Institute for Climate and Energy\\" (EIKE), which mistakenly suggests by its name that it is an important scientific research institution.Michael Brüggemann: Die Medien und die Klimalüge. Falsche Skepsis und echte Leugnung. In: Volker Lilienthal, Irene Neverla (Eds.): „Lügenpresse“: Anatomie eines politischen Kampfbegriffs. Cologne 2017, p. 137–157, p. 143/44 and 150. In fact, EIKE is not a scientific institution at all, but a lobby organization that neither has an office nor employs climate scientists, but instead disseminates fake news on climate issues on its website.See Stefan Rahmstorf, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber: Der Klimawandel: Diagnose, Prognose, Therapie.

It is the final game in the Microsoft Golf series, and the successor to Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition. It uses the same game engine as Links LS 2000 (1999), part of Microsoft's Links series of golf games. Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition was marketed as a basic golf game with limited features, intended for casual players and beginners. It received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to Metacritic, with some praise going towards the game's graphics and high resolution. Some critics noted similarities between the game and Links LS 2000, and believed that it would appeal to its target demographic. Gameplay Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition is similar to Links LS 2000, and features seven courses, most of which are already featured in previous Links games and add-on disks. Courses include Bighorn in California; Bountiful Golf Club and Entrada at Snow Canyon, both in Utah; Kapalua Plantation and Mauna Kea, both in Hawaii; Sea Island Golf Club in Georgia; and the fictional Three Canyons red rock course. Courses include varying obstacles and conditions relating to wind, fog, and cloud coverage. Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition features ten game modes, five of which are absent from Links LS 2000. Modes include match, Nassau, scramble, skins, and stroke. The game also offered multiplayer through MSN Gaming Zone. The game includes three playable golf characters, and more can be custom-made by the player. The game has three swing methods, including Easy Swing and PowerStroke, both previously featured in Links LS 2000. The PowerStroke uses computer mouse motion to simulate the swing. The game includes commentary in response to golf shots. The player can take mulligans and gimmes, and can utilize various camera angles to aid in golfing. Grid lines can be placed on the course to aid in putting. Development and release Microsoft Golf 2001 was developed and published by Microsoft, which owned the rights to the Links series. Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition uses the same game engine as the 1999 game Links LS 2000. In North America, Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on August 24, 2000. It was marketed as a basic golf game with limited features, intended for casual players and beginners. Reception Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Some critics viewed Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition as a basic version of the Links games; several noted similarities between the game and Links LS 2000 in particular. Kevin Rice of Daily Radar considered it a \\"continuation of Links LS 2000 with very minor changes,\\" but stated that this was \\"not really a bad thing\\". Brett Todd of Computer Games Magazine called the game \\"really nothing more than a repackaged Links LS 2000 offered at a bargain basement price,\\" while stating that this \\"is both good and bad.\\" Critics considered the game a good value at $20, and believed it would appeal to its target demographic of casual players, rather than hardcore golfers. Considering its low price, Todd believed the game could have appeal for some people, but not for most, stating that nearly all of its good points had been eclipsed by other golf games. Stephen Poole of GameSpot called the game an \\"attractive package\\" for its variety of terrain and \\"excellent\\" course design. Some praise went to the graphics and the high resolution. Shawn Nicholls of AllGame considered the courses to be \\"blatantly artificial\\", and \\"inconsistent\\" with the appearance of the golfer, while Gordon Goble of Gamecenter felt that the golfer characters could have been better animated. Sports Gaming Network considered the graphics to be good, but dated. Nicholls praised the sound, commentary, and music, while Scott Steinberg of IGN criticized the commentary for occurring a few seconds too soon or too late in reaction to golf shots. Michael Lafferty of GameZone was disappointed by how limited the commentary was, and Poole stated that the commentary was \\"delivered as if the speaker had just finished walking 27 holes.\\" Despite a few minor deficiencies, Lafferty praised Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition for its simple gameplay and called it \\"the golf game that will enable families to play together and give the newer players a chance to succeed.\\" Rice considered the game to be realistic, while Nicholls stated that computer golfers expecting a realistic and challenging experience would be disappointed by the game. Steinberg stated that lifelong golfers should stick to the Links games, as Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition \\"lacks serious challenge.\\" Steinberg called the game \\"a lot more user friendly and less intimidating for newly baptized proponents of the sport.\\" Sports Gaming Network criticized the lack of an off-line tournament mode, a feature that was present in Links LS 2000. Todd considered the game to be dated, but also \\"good in a 1997-98 sort of way,\\" while calling it a \\"reasonably deep simulation of golf.\\" Some criticized the grid lines for being difficult and unhelpful. The PowerStroke swing method was also criticized. Nicholls stated that the game seemed \\"impossible and frustrating\\" when using the PowerStroke, and Sports Gaming Network considered the PowerStroke awkward to use. Goble criticized the PowerStroke icon's location onscreen: \\"It is, for some wacky reason, located right at the base of the screen, in almost exactly the same spot where the game's hidden menu panel is activated. We cannot count the number of times we accidentally triggered that menu when all we wanted to do was make a damn shot.\\" References External links * Official website (archived) * Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition at MobyGames Category:2000 video games Category:Golf video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition"},{"id":"61045627","text":"Links LS 2000 is a golf video game developed by Access Software and published by Microsoft.

It was praised for its multiplayer, variety, and game physics, but critics felt that rival golf games such as Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge were superior, in part because of their inclusion of a golf course designer.

The game featured new online multiplayer options over its predecessor, including MSN Gaming Zone, and was compatible with the online LS Tour 2000. The game also introduces a feature called \\"SkyScape\\" that allows the player to change the amount of cloud coverage, and includes other adjustable options relating to wind, fog, haze, and camera angles. The player can also create and edit sounds. Links LS 2000 features commentary from David Feherty and Craig Bolerjack. The game includes three different ways to hit a ball, including Easy Swing and the complex PowerStroke; with the latter version, the player uses computer mouse motion to perform a shot. In addition to LS Tour 2000, several other golfing events were held for online users of the game, including tournaments by the Virtual Golfing Association. Other online events included e-World Shotgun 2000 and the World Links Championship. Development and release Links LS 2000 was developed by Access Software. Because of a limited development period, few new features were added to the game in relation to its predecessor. Links LS 2000 was completed in September 1999, and was released in North America the following month. The game was released as a set of three CDs, and was published by Microsoft, which purchased Access Software earlier in 1999. Links LS 2000 10-Course Pack is an add-on program for Links LS 2000 and its predecessor. It features additional courses for tournaments. It was completed in January 2000, and was released the following month. Links LS Classic, released in November 2000, is a version of Links LS 2000 that includes 21 championship courses. In November 2000, a Macintosh version of Links LS 2000 was released. It was ported to Macintosh by Green Dragon Creations, and was published by MacSoft, also in a set of three CDs. Contests In November 1999, Microsoft launched the \\"Links LS 2000 Hole-in- One Sweepstakes,\\" in which players would try to make a hole-in-one on the seventh hole of the game's Mauna Kea course. The winner would receive a two- person trip to Hawaii, a five-night stay at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, $500 of spending money, and a round of golf on the real Mauna Kea course. In June 2000, Microsoft announced its \\"Father's Day on the Fairway Sweepstakes\\", in which two grand-prize winners would compete against each other in real golf and a game of Links LS 2000. The winner would get to play a round of golf with Arnold Palmer, while 100 first-prize winners would receive a free copy of Links LS 2000. Reception Critics viewed Links LS 2000 as a minimally upgraded version of its predecessor, and were hopeful that Links 2001 would be more of a substantial update in the series. Tony Wyss of GameSpy described the game as Links LS 1999 but with more multiplayer options, as well as \\"minimal feature improvements that keep it from being great.\\" Wyss considered it \\"an extremely difficult game to assess as a reviewer,\\" recommending it for first- time players of a golf video game while stating that owners of Links LS 1999 might want to reconsider before purchasing it. Sports Gaming Network also considered it a difficult game to review because of its similarities to the previous game, and likewise recommended it for beginning computer golfers. William Abner of Computer Games Strategy Plus considered it a \\"terribly difficult game to rate,\\" praising its gameplay, its features, and calling it \\"one of the finer\\" golf simulations available, while noting its similarities to the previous game. Paul Rosano of Hartford Courant wrote that because of its $50 price, the game was difficult to recommend to owners of its predecessor, but stated that for players who \\"haven't updated since \\"Links 98\\" or earlier, there is definitely enough to warrant a purchase.\\" Tom Ham of PC Accelerator wrote that Links LS 2000 \\"feels more like an upgrade than a full- fledged product – still not a bad thing.\\" Stephen Poole of GameSpot wrote that the game's additional features \\"are so unimpressive both in quantity and quality that there's simply not much reason for owners of the previous version to get excited,\\" further stating that the game felt more like an add-on course bundle. Jeff Lackey of Computer Gaming World wrote that the game \\"appears to be a meager repackaging of its predecessor\\" with \\"just the barest minimum of additions necessary to justify the new package and name.\\" Critics believed that competitors such as Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge and PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition were superior to Links LS 2000, with Poole writing that \\"the days of simply assuming the latest iteration of Links is the best golf sim around are long gone - especially if the series doesn't begin to evolve more quickly than it has in the past couple of installments.\\" Lackey cited the game's lack of a course designer as one of its disadvantages against competitors, and noted that additional courses could not be downloaded for free, as with rival games. Martin Korda of PC Zone considered the lack of a course designer to be significant, calling its absence almost unforgivable. Sports Gaming Network considered the absence of a course designer to be the game's \\"biggest, most glaring omission,\\" stating that such a feature \\"has become virtually mandatory in the golf sim world these days\\" and that it would have significantly improved the game's replay value, while writing, \\"Its absence is sorely felt, particularly as this version of the game offers so little else that is new.\\" The graphics received a mixed reception, with criticism going towards the game's golfer animations, and the lack of moving water. Some praised the graphics, including Michael L. House of AllGame, who also praised the SkyScape feature. Ham wrote that the game \\"is gorgeous and the overall look of the courses is great,\\" but he stated that the digitized golf players resembled cardboard cutouts and that the trees and scenery \\"look like cheap bitmap leftovers from the Sega Genesis days.\\" Erik Peterson of IGN was critical of the trees and bushes for resembling cardboard cutouts, while stating that they \\"are so pixelated at times that they are nearly indistinguishable\\". Peterson also wrote that the golf crowd resembled a series of \\"blocky wax reproductions\\". Michael Phillips of Inside Mac Games called the graphics \\"quite nice, but not perfect,\\" criticizing the pixelated golfers and writing that \\"it's a tad disappointing to watch clouds that are still and water that doesn't move.\\" Poole stated that the game's digitized graphics looked dated in comparison to rival golf games, writing \\"it simply looks like a photo and doesn't feel like a golf course.\\" Wyss considered the courses beautiful, but felt the graphics could be better. Wyss stated that the 3D golfer characters looked awkward against the backdrop of the golf courses. Sports Gaming Network called it a \\"great looking game\\" but considered its graphics to be dated, while mentioning minor graphical improvements over the previous game. Michael Lafferty of GameZone considered the graphics average, and stated that the game would not appeal to golfers. The sound received some praise, although Lafferty considered it to be average. Philip Michaels of Macworld noted minor glitches in which the sound would cut out at the end of golfing holes. The multiplayer options were praised, as were the variety and the game physics. Abner believed that Links LS 2000 had more realistic putting physics than its predecessor, while Peterson stated that the physics were \\"probably the best yet seen on a golf-sim.\\" Some criticized the Easy Swing and PowerStroke options respectively for being too simple and too difficult, although Korda considered it to be the most fun of the three swing options, while Sports Gaming Network called it \\"the best non-real-time mouse swing in the business.\\" Lackey considered the lack of a real-time aspect to be a \\"major drawback\\" for the PowerStroke swing. Ham felt that the game's commentary could have been better, while Poole described it as having \\"huge gaps of silence followed by failed attempts at humor or insipid post-shot observations\\". Wyss praised the commentary for its humor. Nash Werner of GamePro stated that Links LS 2000 \\"does everything right,\\" while St. Louis Post-Dispatch called it \\"the most realistic golf experience possible for the PC\\" and praised its \\"sharp and crisp\\" imagery. Links LS 2000 was the sixth best-selling computer sports game of 1999, with 104,225 units sold, bringing in revenue of $4.6 million. In March 2000, the game won a Codie Award from the Software and Information Industry Association for \\"Sports Games - Best Product.\\" The Houston Chronicles Bob LeVitus, also known as \\"Dr. Mac,\\" included the Macintosh version in his \\"Dr. Mac Game Hall of Fame Awards\\" in 2001; it won \\"Best Sports Game For Big Kids\\".

Background Bark of species from the genus Cinchona produces the alkaloid quinine, a potent anti-malarial treatment. Although originally native to South America, cinchona plantations were established in India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies during the 19th century. By 1913, 95 percent of quinine production was controlled by the Dutch through large plantations on Java.Steere, W. (1945). The Cinchona-Bark Industry of South America. The Scientific Monthly, 61(2), 114-126. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/18623 With the outbreak of World War II, a supply of quinine was essential for successful military operations. In 1942, the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies cut off the supply of quinine to the allies. Recognizing the need for a new source of quinine, a program was established by the United States Board of Economic WarfareSteere, W. (1945). The Discovery and Distribution of Cinchona pitayensis in Ecuador. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 72(5), 464-471. doi:10.2307/2481477 under the operation of the Defense Supplies Corporation (DSC). Professor William C. Steere was brought on as Assistant Director. The objective was to find supplies of cinchona bark in the Andes for military use. It had three goals: to control all sites with commercial cinchona for long term development; to develop plantations that could compete with established cinchona monopolies to ensure emergency provisions; and to train people in the producing countries to take over the industry at the end of US involvement. Six countries signed an agreement with the DSC; Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Bolivia. Wild populations of cinchona were also to be exploited.Cuvi, N. (2011).

Retrieved from https://pubsapp.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v06/i05/pdf/503timeline.pdf Exploratory missions =Colombia= The first party left for Colombia in October 1942. It consisted of two foresters, two botanists, a chemist, and a lawyer. This initial group included Steere, Francis Raymond Fosberg, and Leslie Holdridge. At first, two field parties were organized. Each team had a botanist to identify cinchona species, as well as a forester to calculate the volume of bark and logistics of harvest. They began their search in the high altitude rainforests of the Cordillera Oriental and the Rio Magdalena, making an inventory of all available species. Once cleared for harvest, bark from an area was gathered with native labor. It was transported on the backs of people or mules to rivers and airstrips. Eventually, it would arrive at one of the field laboratories located in Bogotá, Colombia, Quito, Ecuador, Lima, Peru, or La Paz, Bolivia. Dry bark was often shipped directly to America. Over time, additional personnel were recruited to assist with the Colombian mission. This included Earl Lemley Core,Clarkson, Roy B. and Jesse F.

Surveying was difficult, however, since the cinchona forests of Ecuador were often remote and inaccessible. Surveying parties ranged between ten and fifteen men, many of whom served as porters and trail cutters. By mid-1943, Ecuador was the second largest producer of cinchona bark in Latin America. Personnel involved with the Ecuadorian missions included Wendell Holmes Camp, William Brooks Drew, , Frederick Wilson Popenoe, Gerald Webber Prescott, Misael Acosta Solís, William Campbell Steere, Julian Alfred Steyermark, and Ira Loren Wiggins.Solís, M.

Retrieved from https://web.archive.org/web/20171026121023/http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=5910 Plantation development The American pharmaceutical company Merck and Co. planned to develop the cinchona industry in the Western hemisphere as early as 1932. Their research was backed by the US Department of State, US Department of Agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food of Guatemala, and the United Fruit Company. Small experimental plantations were established in Guatemala and Costa Rica during the 1930s. After the outbreak of the war, the US government seized a plantation at El Porvenir, Guatemala and turned it into the world's largest cinchona nursery. Here, large scale research was conducted on propagation and harvesting techniques. Seedlings were distributed to other nearby countries, and further plantations were established in Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru. Older plantations that existed before US involvement in Peru and Bolivia were also exploited. End of the program In 1944, quinine was successfully synthesized by American chemists Robert Burns Woodward and William von Eggers Doering. This, along with the recovery of Asian plantations and a healthy stockpile of antimalarial products in US control, led to the termination of the program. Overall, the US had imported approximately 40 million pounds of dry bark over the course of two years. The program ceased operations on November 30, 1945.

According to Bloomberg Businessweek, her departure was part of the Trump administration's push to counter China's influence in American research, and ethnic Chinese scientists, including American citizens like Wu, were targeted for investigation. MD Anderson was a center of the crackdown, with three other top Chinese-American researchers being forced out besides Wu. MD Anderson had formerly encouraged international collaboration and created \\"sister\\" relationships with five Chinese cancer centers. In March 2019, Wu was appointed Dean of the School of Public Health of her alma mater Zhejiang University.  Contributions  Wu is known for designing cohort studies for the purpose of discovering the causes of cancer and potential prevention measures. She and her colleagues conducted studies showing that fifteen minutes of moderate exercise per day can increase lifespan by an average of three years, that eating highly cooked meat can contribute to kidney cancer, that high-carbohydrate diets can contribute to lung cancer in non-smokers, and that chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes can also contribute to cancer.

Since July 2020, he is also serving as the Contact Tracing Czar of the Philippine government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before entering politics, he served in the Philippine Constabulary and Philippine National Police (PNP) for 38 years. He was the chief of the Cordillera regional police office, the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), and the Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM). He retired with the rank of police director as the PNP's Deputy Chief for Operations. Born and raised in Baguio, Magalong graduated from the Philippine Military Academy in 1982.

He was accused of plotting to assassinate President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2001 but was later cleared in 2005. He then led the quelling of the March 2005 prison riot in Camp Bagong Diwa. In 2006, he was detained for three months after joining an alleged failed coup attempt against Arroyo. After his reinstatement, he was assigned to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and the Quezon City police office. He then became the director of the CIDG and chairman of the PNP Board of Inquiry on the Mamasapano Incident. Magalong published the investigation report on March 13, 2015 which implicated PNP chief Alan Purisima and President Benigno Aquino III of misconduct leading to the deaths of 44 SAF troopers. In 2019, Magalong testified before the Senate accusing PNP chief Oscar Albayalde of protecting police officers involved in the drug trade.

During his stay there he was later promoted to the rank of Captain. He would later on be assigned to Agusan del Norte. = Philippine National Police = During the early days of the merger of the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police, Magalong would get to experience the CIDG for the first time. He later on described it as \\"not his world\\". He was transferred to the Special Action Force of the PNP of SAF, founded in 1983 by then Gen. (later President) Fidel V. Ramos of the PC. From 1997 to 2001, he headed its Special Operations Battalion, which is PNP's counterterrorism group.  2001 EDSA Revolution  Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ascended to the presidency after President Joseph Estrada was removed from power in the Second EDSA Revolution. Magalong was later accused of plotting to assassinate the new president. Magalong described it as \\"a false charge; my name was used by some parties who wished to ingratiate themselves with the new administration.\\" While he was under investigation, he was assigned to hazardous areas, to the Cordilleras in 2001 and back to Mindanao in 2003. It was only in March 2005 that he was absolved of the charges against him.  2005 Bicutan Siege  On March 14, 2005, two weeks after Magalong was absolved of the assassination plot charges against him, inmates in the Camp Bagong Diwa were able to seize weapons from the guards. Magalong would lead the assault on the Camp, with 64 other SAF troopers. It resulted in 27 dead inmates and the surviving inmates pleaded a massacre and human rights violation on the part of the SAF. It was during this siege that Magalong almost died, evidenced by his kevlar helmet with two bullets embedded in it. He keeps it in his office as a reminder, saying \\"I keep it around, just to remind myself, tama na yung pa-warrior-warrior mo, Benjie, you have a family now.\\"  2006 State of Emergency  On February 24, 2006, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Proclamation 1017, declaring a state of emergency existed in the country. Malacañang justified this as they claimed to have foiled a coup d'état attempt, involving several members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police. Among those alleged perpetrators was Supt. Benjamin Magalong, alleged to have been participating in the destabilization efforts and attempting to recruit men to beef up the main destabilization force. He later on admitted his role in the plot and was imprisoned for three months.  Police Regional Office Cordillera (PRO-COR)  Magalong was appointed as head of the Regional Office of the PNP in Cordillera or PRO-COR on October 29, 2011, succeeding C/Supt. Villamor Bumanglag. Under his administration, several advances were made, such as a purchase of ammo reloading machines, which cut the costs for reloading slug and a GIS-based crime mapping system was launched, which tracks hazard-prone areas and recent crime data in the region. Abra and Kalinga also experienced its most peaceful elections in 2013. He was succeeded by C/Supt. Isagani Nerez  Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG)  In December 2013, he returned for the second time to the CIDG and this was appointed as its new chief, succeeding Dir. Francisco Uyami Jr. The CIDG is the PNP's primary investigation arm. Magalong was originally intended to head the Directorate for Intelligence (DI), but was instead was appointed to the CIDG. He said in an interview for the Asian Dragon Magazine that he did not want the post due to its highly politicized nature and that he even tried to exchange commands with Gen. Calima who was appointed in his stead as DI Chief, but Gen. Calima did not want anything to do with the post. He assumed the post and afterwards created a 14-man National Advisory Council, with the goal of the PNP transformation program known as \\"Patrolman 2030\\".  2015 Mamasapano crisis  The Fallen 44 of the Special Action Forces Gen. Magalong led the Board of Inquiry (BOI) on the Mamasapano incident. Pressure came from various groups telling him to either soften the president's liability or to not release the report at all. On March 13, 2015, the BOI released their report on the incident. It indicted President Benigno Aquino III, Gen. Alan Purisima and SAF Chief Getulio Napeñas as liable for the deaths of the 44 SAF troopers for bypassing the chain of command. This has been believed to be the cause for him to be set aside as a contender for the PNP Chief post.  Post-Mamasapano inquiry  After the report had been released, he was transferred to the PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management in July 2015 by the new PNP Chief Ricardo Marquez, his classmate in the 1982 Sandigan Class, succeeding Dir. Francisco Montenegro. In 2016, incoming PNP Chief Ronald \\"Bato\\" Dela Rosa said that he will appoint Magalong as his Deputy Chief of Operations.  Retirement from the PNP  After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 56, Gen. Magalong retired on December 15, 2016 from the Philippine National Police, as the Deputy Chief of Operations, having served for more than 38 years. He received 166 Military and PNP achievement and merit Medals for his combat and law enforcement accomplishments, among which, are the Distinguished Conduct Star, the Distinguished Service Star, the PNP Gold Cross and 15 Outstanding Achievement Medals. He was succeeded by PDDG. Ramon Apolinario.  Post-retirement  Since his retirement, Magalong has served as Senior Vice President for Operations of Steel Asia, one of the largest steel manufacturers in Asia until November 1, 2018. On January 5, 2018 President Duterte appointed him to serve as a director of the Philippine National Oil Company or PNOC, to serve the unexpired term of Bruce Concepcion until June 30, 2018.  Political career  = Mayor of Baguio =  2019 election  On October 17, 2018, Magalong filled his certificate of candidacy for the mayoralty post of Baguio City, offering the citizens of Baguio \\"a breath of fresh air\\". He ran under a platform of speedy government action, revitalizing the environment, innovating peace and order condition, aggressive traffic management, empowering the youth and a responsive education program. He would go against 8 others, mostly veteran politicians including Vice Mayor Edison Bilog, Councilors Ed Avila and Leandro Yangot, Jr. and former Councilor Jose Molintas. On the night of May 13, 2019, election day, he was declared as the winner of the 2019 mayoral polls garnering 41,482 votes, a large margin over his closest contender, Vice Mayor Bilog, who garnered 22,670 votes. He was proclaimed along with re-elected Congressman Mark O. Go and Vice Mayor-elect Faustino A. Olowan. He would succeed outgoing three-term Mayor Mauricio G. Domogan, who lost in his congressional comeback bid. A month after his proclamation as the winner in the mayoral elections, Magalong warned establishments in the city of the existence of several persons using his name to supposedly extort money or place food orders, mostly in restaurants he and his family frequents.  Mayoralty  = 2019 = During his inauguration on June 30, 2019, Magalong outlined his 10-point agenda for the city of Baguio for the next three years. The list included: * Speeding Up Government Action * Revitalizing The Environment * Innovating Peace and Order Condition * Aggressive Traffic Management * Responsive Education Program * Empowering the Youth * Expanding Health and Social Services * Responsible Tourism * Enlivened Culture, Arts, Crafts, and Heritage * Market Modernization Faced with the city's massive waste problem, he began office by temporarily halting the collection of biodegradable waste due to the malfunction of the city's waste-to-fertilizer machines. According to him, a possible solution to would be waste-to-energy technology, which will be initially tested by PNOC. He also ordered Baguio's dumpsite in Irisan be converted into an ecopark by 2020. Several establishment were closed due to lacking or erroneous permits. Massive clean-up drives of the city began since he took office. In accordance with President Duterte's order to clear public roads, several obstructions in the city's roads such as construction and advertising materials were ordered immediately removed. He further expanded his 10-point agenda to 15 points, adding the following to his agenda: * Efficient Disaster Management * Empowered and Accountable Barangay Governance * Strengthened Livelihood and Entrepreneurial Services * Unemployment Reduction * Resolution of IP clans and claims In a move to revitalize the air quality in the city's main thoroughfare, the ascending lane (right side) of Session Road will be closed to traffic every Sunday beginning August 4 for 4 weeks thereafter. However, due to concerns aired, the implementation was postponed to August 18. The closure was extended for up to 6 months every Sunday, beginning August 18, 2019. In September 2019, he expressed his dismay over the ongoing rehabilitation of the Baguio Convention Center, and has since then vowed that he will not tolerate substandard work adding it was about time these contractors became answerable to the people. He also testified before a Senate hearing on \\"ninja cops\\", accusing then-PNP General Oscar Albayalde of blocking the dismissal of 13 policemen involved in an irregular drug raid in 2013, from which some policemen had allegedly profited from. In October 2019, days after his testimony at the Senate, Magalong revealed that he has been receiving death threats and is worried for his family. In November 2019, Magalong stood behind one of the city's POSD officer for performing his task without fear or favor. Judge Nelson Largo of Cabanatuan City parked his car in a no parking area, causing the officer to issue him a parking ticket and have the license plate of the car removed, to which Largo retaliated by issuing a subpoena, calling the act of removing the license plates as a violation of due process. Magalong called Judge Largo's actions of having the enforcers subpoenaed as unprofessional and arrogant and said he himself was prepared to accompany the enforcers involved. Days later, during a probe launched by the Supreme Court, Largo retracted the subpoena. The Baguio City Council has since then declared Largo as persona non grata via a Resolution. = 2020 = In December 2019, amidst the influx of tourist into the city, Magalong ordered an aggressive anti-littering campaign, leading to the arrest of 49 people as of January 2020 and has promised that he will continue such campaign. In January 2020, Magalong, along with DILG Sec. Eduardo Año and DOT Sec. Bernadette Romulo-Puyat officially launched the rehabilitation of the city, which they estimate may last more than three years. The city, however, will not be closed to the public, unlike the rehabilitation efforts done in Boracay. During a top level meeting on the problems hounding the city, specifically on its air quality, solid waste management and water pollution and supply, Magalong said in jest that the water used to grow the famous strawberries come from the cesspool of Baguio, which is illegally discharged into the Balili River. The statement caused disdain to La Trinidad and Benguet officials. La Trinidad Mayor Romeo Salda disproved Magalong's statement saying that no irrigation comes from the Balili River as they only source it from the creek of Pico and Puguis. Magalong later issued a statement of apology saying, \\"I came up with uncalled for statement that I should have not said at all. I was wrong and I apologize\\" emphasizing that he was pertaining to the issue of the city's guilt of polluting the river which flows into the municipality of La Trinidad. In late January, due to the threat posed by the COVID-19, Magalong cancelled the opening parade of the Panagbenga Festival and other major events within the next three weeks, also affecting the CARAA Games. Magalong stated in an interview that \\"The tourism revenues are the least of my concerns. My main priorities are the health of my constituents\\", which earned him praise from all sectors, especially from the residents of Baguio. The Panagbenga Festival was later rescheduled to late March 21–29, a month from the original scheduled date. On July 13, Magalong was appointed by the national government as the Contact Tracing Czar of the Philippine government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Magalong's COVID-19 testing and tracing policies in Baguio were hailed by medical experts as a model that the whole country should follow.

Coup  On Friday, October 11, 1968 the National Guard deposed President Arnulfo Arias, who was in a movie theater in Panama City. Upon learning of the events, he took refuge in the Panama Canal Zone under the control of the United States Army. Major Boris Martínez (from Chiriquí Province) and Lieutenant Colonel Jose Humberto Ramos (from Santiago, Veraguas Province) commanded the coup. The \\"Provisional Junta of Government\\", led by colonels José María Pinilla Fábrega and Bolívar Urrutia Parrilla, would be imposed. El golpe de estado del 11 de octubre de 1968 – Panamá Vieja Escuela On October 12, the newspaper El Mundo (the only one which circulated that day) indicated that a military junta took power, without mentioning the names of its members, and that National Guard troops with machine guns surrounded the residence of Arnulfo Arias, who managed to take refuge in the Panama Canal Zone. The newspaper also reported that sporadic shots were heard \\"in the slum areas of Panama City,\\" while the director of Hospital Santo Tomás stated that a man and a woman were shot and wounded. The newspaper warned that all civil rights had been suspended. During 1968, guerrilla activity was registered in the urban area and in the interior of the country by the Federación de Estudiantes de Panamá and other organizations, as well as supporters of deposed President Arias. There were military acts against the National Guard, the closing of newspapers and the development of the issue of pamphlets and clandestine writings.  Rise of Torrijos and aftermath  Having received news of the coup while in the Panama Canal Zone, Lieutenant Colonel Omar Torrijos and a few officers, including businessman Demetrio B. Lakas, sought to re-establish some form of civilian rule, even attempting to install President Arias' vice-president, Raul Arango as the new president, much to Martínez's dismay. Although the \\"Provisional Junta of Government\\" was appointed, Martinez and Torrijos were the true leaders from the beginning. Soon after the coup, Torrijos was promoted to full colonel and named commandant of the National Guard. They barred all political activity and shut down the legislature. They also seized control of three newspapers owned by President Arias' brother, Harmodio and blackmailed the owners of the country's oldest newspaper, La Estrella de Panamá, into becoming a government mouthpiece. With enough opposition against Martinez including from the United States, Torrijos ousted and exiled Martínez and Jose Humberto Ramos to Miami on February 23, 1969, nearly four months after the initial coup. Torrijos went on to rule Panama as the de facto military dictator until his death in a plane crash on July 23, 1981.

Christensen intended to capitalize on the growing demand for apartments in Racine, which existed in and near downtown but not in the more desirable western residential neighborhoods where Wilmanor would be built. J. Mandor Matson, who had designed both Park and Horlick high schools, was hired as the project's architect.

The agency was autonomous and supervised by an agent subordinate to the District Collector of Vizagapatam District.  History  The agency was created soon after the Gumsur Rebellion of 1835 based on the recommendations of the Russell Report of 18 November 1834. As per the recommendations, the zamindars of the hill regions of the north-eastern part of the Madras Presidency were given more autonomy than those of other districts. However, the general administration of the country was to be overseen by a commissioner or agent subordinate to the District Collector of Vizagapatam. The proposals were approved by the Madras government and agencies were eventually created by Act XXIV of 1839.
