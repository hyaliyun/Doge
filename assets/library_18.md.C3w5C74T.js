He is known for musical collaborations and subsequent lawsuits pertaining to musician-songwriter Brian Wilson, co-founder of the Beach Boys. Thomas was producer and director of the PBS music program Soundstage for WTTW. He also wrestled under the name Buddy Love. The Beach Boys =Stars and Stripes and Imagination= In the mid 1990s, Thomas was enlisted to co-produce the Beach Boys' Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, an album consisting of country music stars covering Beach Boys songs. Beach Boy Mike Love says it was Thomas who suggested the idea of a country album, and it was released on River North Records, the label he had been running. Thomas also produced the track \\"Everything I Need\\" for the Wilsons, a group comprising Wilson's daughters. Session drummer Hal Blaine, who played on the recording, later said that Thomas ruined the song with excessive amounts of percussive flourishes: \\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing, what they did to this beautiful [song]. It was like someone took a beautiful Ferrari and beat the crap out of it with a sledgehammer. ... Some guys will get hold of Brian and talk him into anything.\\" Wilson commenced recording a new solo album with Thomas. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin writes that the \\"slick sound of Joe's work ‚Äî and the entree it might allow Brian into the adult contemporary market ‚Äî was a large part of his appeal.\\" The High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan believed: \\"I don't think Brian really wanted to work with him ‚Äî but he had no choice, he was being pulled in that direction.\\" In 1998, the magazine Uncut wrote: \\"Brian was being coerced away from [collaborator] Andy Paley (by wife Melinda, according to observers), toward Joe Thomas.\\" Imagination was released in June 1998. Wilson stated: \\"We call it a Brian Wilson album, but it's really a Joe Thomas/Brian Wilson album.\\" Thomas purposely took it upon himself to ensure that the new work would sound as close to adult contemporary radio as possible. Carlin wrote, \\"Most [arrangements] were dominated by tinkling keyboards, with plenty of melodic interjections from a gently plucked nylon- string guitar. If Brian tried to use an instrument or an arrangement that might not fit into the soothing blend, Joe would shake his head and slice it out of the picture. And if this bothered Brian, he didn't show it.\\" Many of Wilson's fans expressed their disappointment with the music being homogenized \\"to sound exactly like every other song on the radio.\\" In June 1998, Rolling Stones Jason Fine reported: \\"Melinda says he's obligated to do another record with Thomas. ... As is often the case with Brian's career, Brian doesn't seem to be the one calling the shots. 'I'd like to stay here in L.A., but we built the studio, so I guess I have to go,' he says simply.\\" Wilson soon filed a suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas. The suit was made after Thomas allegedly began to raise his industry profile and wrongfully enrich himself through his association with Wilson. Thomas reciprocated with a suit citing that Ledbetter \\"schemed against and manipulated\\" him and Brian. The case was settled out of court. Thomas' AllMusic profile states: \\"The live DVD productions that were eventually released after the partnership of Wilson and Thomas went south are apparently studied in some recording classes as examples of how performers can be edited out of a production, specifically Thomas and his frequent collaborator Steve Dahl.\\" =Radio and No Pier Pressure= The reunited Beach Boys performing in May 2012. According to Thomas, Wilson circa 2008 or 2010 inquired to him about demo tapes recorded during the sessions for Imagination: \\"He called up and said I've got some ideas for some new Beach Boys songs, and I said, That‚Äôs great, and I pointed out to him that when we worked together several years ago he had the genesis of some other Beach Boy songs that he had never really wanted to put on any of his solo records.\\" The two proceeded to meet with Mike Love in Palm Springs, who then agreed to a collaboration. The end product, titled That's Why God Made the Radio (2012), received generally favorable reviews. In 2012, Thomas returned to co-produce the Beach Boys' Live ‚Äì The 50th Anniversary Tour, which was widely criticized for its auto-tuned vocals. According to Love, during the performances, it was Melinda who had attempted to install five auto-tune units, one on each of the band members' microphones. Thomas again co-produced Wilson's solo album No Pier Pressure (2015). The album garnered mixed reviews that widely referenced its adult contemporary arrangements and extensive use of auto-tune. Thomas was again responsible for the album's particular sound, according to biographer Christian Matijas-Mecca, with one of his signatures being the way woodwinds complement the end of a vocal line.

The struggle arose from tensions between competing groups of people as increasing numbers of European Americans entered traditional Oconee territory. The conflict delayed the opening of the University of Georgia, planned as part of the new state's institutions.Lee Shearer, \\"History behind UGA's late start\\", Athens Banner-Herald, 19 Jan 2009, accessed 19 Nov 2010 The European Americans prevailed over the Creek, and a tradition of coexistence between the groups ended. The European Americans wanted to settle the land, and they demanded the government relocate the Creek, which contributed eventually to passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, setting policy and implementation of removal of all the southeastern tribes to west of the Mississippi River. The war catalyzed Georgia voters' ratifying the United States Constitution, in order to gain federal help to fight the Creek.Joseph Harris Chappell, Georgia History Stories, 1905, accessed 19 Nov 2010 As a result of the war, some Creek Oconee moved across the border into northern Florida, and then further south in the state, to escape European-American encroachment. They joined other majority-Creek peoples there, and developed a new Muskogean-related tribe, the Seminole, by the late eighteenth century. Through the Seminole Wars of the nineteenth century, some of the Indians resisted all efforts by extensive United States forces to move them to reservations.

The surrounding neighbourhood is called Sorgenfri after it. Only the cellar and foundations survive of the first Sorgenfri House, which was built in 1705 to design by Fran√ßois Dieussart. The current house was built in 1756 by Lauritz de Thurah and later adapted and extended by Peter Meyn in the 1790s. Lauritz de Thurah has also designed buildings which flank the driveway closer to the road. Sorgenfri Palace is surrounded by a large park which is bounded by M√∏lle√•en to the east. It was adapted to the English Romantic style in the late 1790s and early 1899s and contains several small buildings. Christian X used it as a summer residence and it has later been part of it let out to relatives of the royal family. The park is open to the public. History Sorgenfri in 1742 Sorgenfri Palace is located at the site of a medieval settlement, M√∏lletorp, which was owned by the Bishopric of Roskilde but confiscated by the crown during the Reformation in the 1530s. In 1686, it was replaced by a country house by High Court Justice Michael Vibe. Sorgenfri in Lauritz de Thurah's Den Danske Vitruvius Count Carl von Ahlefeldt acquired the estate in 1702. He commissioned the architect Fran√ßois Dieussart to build a new summer residence at the site and renamed it Sorgenfri. The building, a half-timbered, three-winged complex in Baroque style, was completed in 1705. The central wing contained a banquet hall with double high ceilings. Passage between the two residential side wings was therefore only possible at the ground floor. King Christian VI acquired the estate in 1730. His son, Crown Prince Frederick, the later King Frederick V, used it as summer residence from 1742. The building was refurbished by Lauritz de Thurah who also constructed new stables and a new wing for the gentlemen of the Court. After his ascend to the throne in 1747, Frederick V gave the property to his aunt, Sophie Caroline, Dowager Princess of East Frisia. She demolished it and charged Lauritzde Thurah with the construction of a new house on the foundations of the old one. Sophie Caroline died in 1764. In 1766, Sorgenfri was ceded to the 12-year-old Prince Frederick, the half-brother of Christian VII of Denmark. In 1769, he sold the property to Jean Henri Desmerci√®res. The next owner was the merchant and shipowner Henrik Bolten, whose trading house was based in the Boltens G√•rd in Copenhagen. He went bankrupt in the late 1780s and Sorgenfri was then reacquired by Prince Frederick in 1789. He charged Peter Meyn with adapting and expanding the house. Sorgenfri in 1865 When Crown Prince Frederik died in 1805, Sorgenfri was passed on to his son, the later King Christian VIII, who used it as a summer residence. After his death in 1848, Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie spent all her summers at the estate until her death in 1881. Frederik VII had ceded Sorgenfri to the state in 1856 and after 1881 it was left empty for years. In 1898, it was ceded to Prince Christian, later King Christian X as summer residence. King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine continued to live at Sorgenfri in the summer time and the king was often seen riding in the neighborhood. Prince Knud married Princess Caroline-Mathilde in 1933. During the Second World War, the royal family, was staying at the Palace. On 29 August 1943, the Germans launched Operation Safari, where under the command of Lieutenant General Eduard Ritter von Schleich, they attacked the palace, resulting in a firefight and the death of seven Germans. Prince Knud and Princess Caroline-Mathilde continued to live in Kavalerfl√∏jen until Christian X's death in 1947 and then moved into the main building. The main building was once again left empty with Princess Caroline-Mathilde's death in 1995. From 1991, Count Christian of Rosenborg, a first cousin of Margrethe II, and Countess Anne Dorte lived in a detached wing of the palace called Damebygningen until they died in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Architecture Sorgenfri Palace is designed in the Neoclassical style. The roof is topped by a cupola dating from the renovation in 1791-94\\\\. Palace garden The classical wing Damebygningen, Sorgenfri Palace, 2014 The palace is located in a garden, which was originally made in Baroque style in 1706. Prince Frederick had this changed to an English landscape garden style between 1791 and 1794. The line of lime trees in front of the palace is still a trace of the baroque style garden. Architect Nicolai Abildgaard was responsible for the garden pavilions The Swiss House and The Norwegian House. The M√∏lle√•en river runs through the park on the east side. A memorial bench for poet Viggo Stuckenberg and a memorial stone for women's rights activist Gyrithe Lemche are also located in the park. Park The park covers a large area on both sides of Lyngby Kongevej. It contains several listed buildings. Woodland and a garden surround the castle. A French-style garden with symmetry, topiary shrubs and ornamental vases was created in the 18th century. Crown Prince Frederik adapted it in the English style with winding paths and romantic garden furniture such as a well, a grotto and gazebos. The latter, the Norwegian House and the Swiss House, were designed by Nicolai Abildgaard.

Products include machines, industrial services and software and energy solutions. The SDAX technology group has 21 production sites worldwide and 161 international sales and service sites. The company is based in Bielefeld.  History  Mill-Turn Machine On 1 October 1870, locksmith Friedrich Gildemeister founded the ‚ÄòWerkzeugmaschinenfabrik (Machine Tool Plant) Gildemeister & Comp‚Äô back in the ‚Äòpioneer days‚Äô in Germany. In the following decades, the plant near the Cologne-Minden train station in Bielefeld was expanded to include several production facilities. For over 100 years ‚Äì until 1976 - the company was based across the street from the main railroad station, where the hotel Bielefelder Hof and the municipal exhibition hall are now situated. Gildemeisterstra√üe 60 in Bielefeld has since become the group‚Äôs headquarters. Today, 7,236 employees and 261 trainees work for the group worldwide. In 1890, the company had around 100 employees, among them a wages clerk and three technicians to assemble the machines. In 1899, the former partnership was changed to a public limited company with capital assets of 1 million Goldmarks. In 1920 five engineers founded Maho AG as Mayr, Hoermann & Cie GmbH. Gildemeister went public in 1950 and at the end of 1969, the company became a public company with a broad spectrum of shareholders. = Merger of Deckel & Maho. Later Gildemeister = In 1993 Friederich Deckel AG and Maho AG merged. In 1994 Gildemeister AG acquired Deckel Maho AG and was renamed Deckel Maho Gildemeister AG. In 2002, Gildemeister received approval from the German Stock Exchange for admission to the ‚ÄòPrime Standard‚Äô. Following restructuring of the German Stock Index in March 2003, the Gildemeister share was listed on the SDAX. At the end of December 2007, Gildemeister AG was included in the MDAX stock index. In 2008, the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office initiated proceedings against the Gildemeister AG CEO, R√ºdiger Kapitza. The charges brought against him included embezzlement, fraud, corruption and tax evasion. In late summer, the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office and the Financial Market Authority, BaFin, stopped their unsuccessful investigations into insider trading. However, proceedings continued in other areas. Investigations in Austria were also finally stopped in March 2013 and Kapitza was cleared of suspicion of embezzlement and fraud. = Cooperation with Mori Seiki = In March 2009, the company signed a cooperation agreement with the Japanese company Mori Seiki. This agreement allowed the company to further consolidate its sales and service network in global key markets. The cooperation in markets in Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Turkey was followed by the USA and India. Since September 2011, the two companies have continued to further expand their joint market presence in Europe. In order to strengthen their successful global cooperation, Gildemeister and Mori Seiki signed a cooperation agreement and decided to align their company names. On 1 October 2013, Gildemeister Aktiengesellschaft became DMG MORI Seiki Aktiengesellschaft. Mori Seiki changed its name to DMG MORI Seiki Company Limited. On the global market, both companies used the DMG MORI brand. On 21 January 2015, the DMG MORI Seiki Aktiengesellschaft signed another cooperation agreement with DMG MORI Seiki Co., Ltd. This agreement specified objectives for strategic growth and sought to consolidate the successful cooperation between the companies. On 8 June 2015, DMG MORI Seiki Aktiengesellschaft became DMG MORI Aktiengesellschaft and DMG MORI Seiki Company Limited changed its name to DMG MORI Company Limited as a further confirmation of the merger.

The most notorious of all Legnica Piast rulers, thanks to his excellent financial politics his Duchy was expanded to the Oder River, and he became the founder of the Duchy of Legnica- Wo≈Ç√≥w-Brzeg (). He was the second son of Frederick I, Duke of Chojn√≥w-O≈Çawa- Legnica-Brzeg-Lubin, by his wife Ludmila, daughter of George of Podƒõbrady, King of Bohemia.  Life  A minor at the death of his father in 1488, Frederick II and his brothers John II and George I inherited Legnica, Chojn√≥w and Lubin under the regency of their mother, Dowager Duchess Ludmila, regnant Duchess of Brzeg and O≈Çawa as a dower. During his early years, the young Dukes spent some time in Prague, at the court of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia. The premature death of his older brother John II in 1495 left Frederick II as the Head of his house, but he remained under his mother's tutelage for another three years, until 1498, when he could take over by himself the government of Legnica. When George I also reached adulthood in 1505, both brothers decided to divide their domains. Frederick II kept Legnica and all the minor Duchies, and George I obtained Brzeg (which after the death of Ludmila in 1503 reverted to them with O≈Çawa) and Lubin. In 1507, Frederick II made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land where he is said to have been dubbed a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre. During 1516-1526 he was Governor of Lower Silesia. After George I's death in 1521 without issue, Frederick inherited Brzeg (Lubin was given to his sister- in-law as dower); this and the purchase of Wo≈Ç√≥w in 1523 increased his finances and brought about in all his domains a time of prosperity. In the same year he mediated between the Teutonic Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg and King Sigismund I of Poland, for the possession of Prussia, which eventually became the secular Duchy of Prussia in 1525, with Albert as its Duke but under Polish sovereignty. From 1523 Frederick II was a strong supporter of the Reformation and founded in 1526 the first Protestant University in Legnica; however, because of the controversies between Luther and Caspar Schwenckfeld, it wasn't until 1530 that the University finally opened. Despite his own conversion to Protestantism, Frederick II allowed his subjects to choose their own religion. During his reign, Frederick II worked for the order and cleanliness of his cities, established public lighting and paved streets. His achievements also enhanced the defense of their Duchy. In his desire to change Legnica's layout he replaced numerous chapels and churches with city walls and fortress. Before the year 1521 there were in the suburbs about 15 churches and chapels, all these were demolished. Together with his wife Sophie, Frederick II also founded a bronze Army to defend the city. From 1540 to 1544 he obtained the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w as a pledge. In 1542 his nephews Joachim, Henry II, John and George of Podƒõbrady pledged to him their Duchy of Ziƒôbice (M√ºnsterberg), which after Frederick II's death was taken by Ferdinand I of Habsburg. He is one of the figures on the Prussian Homage painting by Jan Matejko.

Historically all the residences of the royal family were privately owned. With the introduction of the new Constitution in 1849, some of the residences were claimed as property of the \\"Kingdom of Denmark\\". Some of the palaces are still privately owned by the Queen or other members of the Royal Family. The Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties (the Danish equivalent of the Historic Royal Palaces Agency) is responsible for the management and upkeep of some of the royal palaces and gardens. The Danish Royal Family traditionally occupy different royal residences during different seasons of the year. In summer, Queen Margarethe resides at Marselisborg Palace or Graasten Palace. In the winter, she resides at Amalienborg, whereas her residence during spring and autumn is Fredensborg Palace. Sometimes members of the royal family spend time on the Royal Yacht Dannebrog, especially when on official visits overseas and on summer cruises in Danish waters. Palaces =Amalienborg Palace= Amalienborg Palace Amalienborg Palace is the winter home of the monarch, and is located in Copenhagen, Denmark. It consists of four identical classicizing palace fa√ßades with rococo interiors around an octagonal courtyard; in the centre of the square is a monumental equestrian statue of Amalienborg's founder, King Frederik V. Amalienborg was originally built for four noble families; however, when Christiansborg Palace burnt down on 26 February 1794, the royal family bought the palaces and moved in. Over the years various kings and their families have resided in the four different palaces. Currently, the Queen herself resides in Christian IX's Palace and the Crown Prince in Frederik VIII's Palace. Christian VIII's Palace has apartments for other members of the royal family, whereas Christian VII's Palace is used for official events and to accommodate guests. =Christiansborg Palace= Christiansborg Palace Historically, Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, was the main residence of the Danish kings. But after the fire of the first Christiansborg Palace in 1794, the royal family moved their residence to Amalienborg. However, even though the royal family does not reside in the palace, parts of Christiansborg have continued to be used by the monarch for official purposes and state ceremonies. It is the site of public audiences, meetings of the Council of State, state dinners, receptions and other ceremonies. Also, the Royal Stables which provide the ceremonial transport by horse-drawn carriage for the royal family, are located here. The royal parts of the palace are open to the public when they are not in use for official purposes. =Fredensborg Palace= Fredensborg Palace Fredensborg Palace is a palace located on the eastern shore of Lake Esrum (Danish, Esrum S√∏) in Fredensborg on the island of Zealand (Sj√¶lland) in Denmark. It is the Danish Royal Family‚Äôs spring and autumn residence, and is often the site of important state visits and events in the Royal Family. It is the most used of the Royal Family‚Äôs residences. =Marselisborg Palace= Marselisborg Palace. Marselisborg Palace is the summer residence of the royal family in Aarhus. Historically, the Palace was the property of the Marselis dynasty, its namesake. Marselisborg became a royal residence when Crown Prince Christian (later Christian X) and his consort Princess Alexandrine were given the Palace as a wedding present by the people of Denmark. As such the palace is the property of the Kingdom of Denmark, and will remain in possession of all future monarchs of Denmark. The royal couple used it as their summer residence. The building was rebuilt by the Danish architect Hack Kampmann. The present Queen Margrethe II was given the palace by her father, King Frederick IX of Denmark in 1967. =Gr√•sten Palace= Gr√•sten Palace is the second summer residence of the Danish royal family. It is located in Gr√•sten in the Jutland region of southern Denmark. The main house has a modern, all-white facade, with Venetian doors opening onto sweeping, manicured lawns and gravel walkways. The grounds include a huge stables court. =Hermitage Lodge= The Eremitage Hunting Lodge (Danish: or ) is located in Dyrehaven north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It was built by architect Lauritz de Thurah in Baroque style from 1734 to 1736 for Christian VI of Denmark in order to host banquets during royal hunts in Dyrehaven. Never intended for residence, the Eremitage was built as a setting for hosting royal banquets during hunts in Dyrehaven, which surrounds the building. It originally featured a hoisting apparatus able to raise the table from the basement to the dining room, allowing the king and his guests to dine without any waiters present, or \\"en ermitage\\" (in solitude), hence the name of the castle. The apparatus was removed in the late 18th century as it was causing endless mechanical problems, and no signs of it remain. The previous building on the site, the Hubertus Chalet, had a similar apparatus and was nicknamed for the same reason. =Sorgenfri Palace= Sorgenfri Palace Sorgenfri Palace is a royal residence of the Danish monarch located in the Lyngby-Taarb√¶k municipality in Greater Copenhagen. Originally a country seat, Sorgenfri Palace was built for the Danish nobleman Count Carl Ahlefeldt in 1706. The palace first became a royal residence in 1730 after coming into the possession of the Danish Royal Family. Sorgenfri was the preferred summer residence of King Christian X and his wife Queen Alexandrine. Both of Alexandrine's children Frederik and his brother, Knud, were born there. Both Knud and his wife Caroline-Mathilde lived at Sorgenfri Palace until their respective deaths in 1976 and 1995. Today the palace is closed to the public but the palace gardens are accessible when the monarch is not in residence. Countess Anne-Dorte, the widow of Count Christian of Rosenborg (a younger son of Prince Knud), resided in a wing of the palace until her death . =Ch√¢teau de Cayx= Ch√¢teau de Cayx is a residence of the Danish Royal Family located in the wine district of Cahors in southern France. The ch√¢teau was first fortified during the fourteenth century. Since then it has been rebuilt and renovated several times. The Lefrancs built the extensive wine cellars under the ch√¢teau. The phylloxera infestation devastated the vineyards during the late nineteenth century, and the owners emigrated to Indo-China. They did not return to Europe until 1955. In 1965 the family's heir, Henri Marie Jean Andr√© de Laborde de Monpezat, married Princess Margrethe, then heiress presumptive to the Danish throne, becoming Prince Consort of Denmark after she succeeded to Denmark's throne. The royal couple purchased the ch√¢teau and the estate in 1974. Since then they have renovated it extensively. According to the official website of the Danish monarchy, the residence has become a \\"relaxed setting for reunions of the entire Danish Royal Family and their French relatives\\". It has been the setting for holiday photocalls for the Danish Royal Family, including for Prince Henrik's 80th birthday. The residence is not open to the public. A guided tour of the gardens is available during the summer. The ch√¢teau still produces wine.

It is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white. The first papermaking process was documented in China during the Eastern Han period (25‚Äì220 AD) traditionally attributed to the court official Cai Lun. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the Islamic world, where pulp mills and paper mills were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe. By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing waterwheels in Spain. Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of wood-based papers. Although precursors such as papyrus and amate existed in the Mediterranean world and pre-Columbian Americas, respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper. Nor is true parchment considered paper; used principally for writing, parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic \\"paper\\" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties. Precursors: papyrus In contrast to paper, papyrus has an uneven surface that visibly retains the original structure of the ribbon-like strips that make it up. As the papyrus is worked, it tends to break apart along the seams, leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart. The word \\"paper\\" is etymologically derived from papyrus, Ancient Greek for the Cyperus papyrus plant. Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the Cyperus papyrus plant which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean societies for writing long before paper was used in China. Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the interior of the Cyperus papyrus, and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running at right angle to the first. The two layers are then pounded together into a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents. Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed. This produces a much more even surface, and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time. Paper in China Earliest known extant paper fragment unearthed at Fangmatan, circa 179 BCE Hemp wrapping paper, Western Han period of China, circa 100 BCE Oldest paper book, composed of six different materials, circa CE 256 The world's earliest known printed book (using woodblock printing), the Diamond Sutra of 868, shows the widespread availability and practicality of paper in China. Archaeological evidence of papermaking predates the traditional attribution given to Cai Lun, an imperial eunuch official of the Han dynasty (202 BCE ‚Äì CE 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced. The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at Fangmatan in Gansu province, and was likely part of a map, dated to 179‚Äì141 BCE. Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to 65 BCE and at Yumen pass, dated to 8 BCE. The invention traditionally attributed to Cai Lun, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 CE. The innovation is a type of paper made of mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishing nets, old rags, and hemp waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.Papermaking. (2007). In: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved April 9, 2007, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. =Techniques= During the Shang (1600‚Äì1050 BCE) and Zhou (1050‚Äì256 BCE) dynasties of ancient China, documents were ordinarily written on bone or bamboo (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of silk was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The Han dynasty Chinese court official Cai Lun (c. 50‚Äì121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE. However, the discovery of specimens bearing written Chinese characters in 2006 at Fangmatan in north- east China's Gansu Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE. It therefore would appear that \\"Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking\\". The record in the Twenty-Four Histories says uses Wade-Giles transcription :In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih. But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use. Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees, remnants of hemp, rags of cloth and fishing nets. He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing (105 CE) and received praise for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai. The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of paper mulberry was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of tan (Ê™Ä; sandalwood). In the Eastern Jin period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After printing was popularized during the Song dynasty the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital. =Uses= Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han from the 2nd century BCE. Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous \\"medicine\\" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period. Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century CE, paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. Toilet paper was used in China from around the late 6th century. In 589, the Chinese scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531‚Äì591) wrote: \\"Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from Five Classics or the names of sages, I dare not use for toilet purposes\\". An Arab traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: \\"... [the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper\\". During the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape. During the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper envelopes. During the Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368), the first well-documented Europeans in Medieval China, the Venetian merchant Marco Polo remarked how the Chinese burned paper effigies shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while cremating the dead during funerary rites. =Impact of paper= According to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a \\"strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation.\\" Indeed, the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result, individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries. Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total. By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works. A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works. The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man. According to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that \\"it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production.\\" During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of woodblock printing from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world. However, despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the Middle East had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian Domenico Grimani's collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Biblioth√®que du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, Thomas Jefferson's private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Acton, reached 70,000. Paper became central to the three arts of China ‚Äì poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone. Paper in Asia and Africa After its origin in central China, the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at Dunhuang by 150 CE, in Loulan in the modern-day province of Xinjiang by 200, and in Turpan by 399. Paper was concurrently introduced in Japan sometime between the years 280 and 610.DeVinne, Theo. L. The Invention of Printing. New York: Francis Hart & Co., 1876. p. 134 =Eastern Asia= Paper spread to Vietnam in the 3rd century, to Korea in the 4th century, and to Japan in the 5th century. The paper of Korea was famed for being glossy white and was especially prized for painting and calligraphy. It was among the items commonly sent to China as tribute. The Koreans spread paper to Japan possibly as early as the 5th century but the Buddhist monk Damjing's trip to Japan in 610 is often cited as the official beginning of papermaking there. =Islamic world= Paper page fragment from a Coptic language Bible from Egypt in the Islamic period, 8th century or later. Origin Paper was used in Central Asia by the 8th century but its origin is not clear. According to the 11th century historian, Thaalibi, Chinese prisoners captured at the Battle of Talas in 751 introduced paper manufacturing to Samarkand.Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58) Quraishi, Silim \\"A survey of the development of papermaking in Islamic Countries\\", Bookbinder, 1989 (3): 29‚Äì36. However there are no contemporary Arab sources for this battle. A Chinese prisoner, Du Huan, who later returned to China reported weavers, painters, goldsmiths, and silversmiths among the prisoners taken, but no papermakers. According to Al-Nadim, a writer in Baghdad, Chinese craftsmen made paper in Khorasan: According to Jonathan Bloom ‚Äì a scholar of Islamic and Asian Art with a focus on paper and printing, the connection between Chinese prisoners and the introduction of paper in Central Asia is \\"unlikely to be factual\\". Archaeological evidence shows that paper was already known and used in Samarkand decades before 751 CE. Seventy-six texts in Sogdian, Arabic, and Chinese have also been found near Panjakent, likely predating the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. Bloom argues that based on differences in Chinese and Central Asian papermaking techniques and materials, the story of Chinese papermakers directly introducing paper to Central Asia is probably metaphorical. Chinese paper was mostly made of bast fibers while Islamic paper was primarily made of waste material like rags.Paper-making and the exchange of ideas, Christine Baker, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Quote: \\"The problem is: no one thinks this actually happened. Sources report that there was paper making in Central Asia at least fifty years before. Further, Chinese and Muslim civilizations made paper in different ways ‚Äì there's no evidence that knowledge of how to make paper was transferred at this battle.\\" The paper-making innovations in Central Asia may be pre-Islamic, probably aided by the Buddhist merchants and monks of China and Central Asia. The Islamic civilization helped spread paper and paper-making into the Middle East after the 8th-century, from where it arrived into Europe centuries later, and then to many other parts of the world. A historical remnant of this legacy is the continued use of the word \\"ream\\" to count bundles of paper, a word derived from Arabic rizma (bundle, bale).  Shift from parchment to paper  During the 8th century, paper started to replace parchment as the primary writing material for administrative uses in Baghdad, the capital of Abbasids. According to Ibn Khaldun, a renowned Muslim historiographer, parchment was rare, and a great increase in the number of correspondents throughout Islamic territories, resulted in an order issued by Al-Fadl ibn Yahya, the Abbasid‚Äôs Grand Vizier, for the manufacture of paper to replace parchment. There are records of paper being made at Gilgit in Pakistan by the sixth century, in Samarkand by 751, in Baghdad by 793, in Egypt by 900, and in Fes, Morocco around 1100, in Syria e.g. Damascus, and Aleppo, in Andalusia around 12th century, in Persia e.g. Maragheh by 13th century, Isfahan by 14th century, Ghazvin and Kerman, in India e.g. Dowlat Abad by the 16th century.Harrison, Frederick.

A Persian geography book written by an unknown author in the 10th century, Hodud al-Alam, is the oldest known manuscripts mentioning papermaking industry in Samarkand. The writer stated that the city was famous for paper manufacturing and the product was exported to many other cities as a high-quality item. Samarkand kept its reputation for papermaking over few centuries even once the industry spread across other Islamic areas. For instance, it is said that some Ministers in Egypt preferred ordering their required paper to Samarkand from which the paper was transported all the way to Egypt. In Baghdad, particular neighbourhoods were allocated to paper manufacturing and in Bazaar paper merchants and sellers owned distinct sectors being called Paper Market or Suq al-Warraqin, a street which was lined with more than 100 paper and booksellers' shops. The expansion of public and private libraries and illustrated books within Islamic lands was one of the notable outcomes of a drastic increase in the availability of paper. However, paper was still considered a valuable good given the remarkable required input e.g. primary materials and labourers to produce the item in the absence of advanced mechanical machinery. In one case Ibn al-Bawwab, a Persian calligrapher and illuminator, had been promised by the Sultan to be given precious garments in response to his services. Once the Sultan deferred delivering the promised clothes, he instead proposed the option of taking the papers stored in the Sultan‚Äôs library as his present. In another example, the hospitality of a Minister in Baghdad, Ibn Al-Forat, had been described by his generosity in freely handing out papers to his guests or visitors.  Types of paper  A wide range of paper types with different properties and place of origins were manufactured and utilised in Islamic lands. Paper varieties were named based on several criteria: * Origins (e.g.Isfahani, Baghdadi, Halabi, Mesri, Samarkandi, Dowlat Abadi, Shami, Charta Damascena), * Sizes (Solsan, Nesfi,‚Ä¶), * And sometimes people who have supported the product (e.g. Nuhi, Talhi, Jafari, Mamuni, Mansouri).  Paper primary materials  Bast (hemp and flax), cotton, and old rags and ropes were the major input materials for producing the pulp. Sometimes a mixture of materials was also used for pulp making, such as cotton and hemp, or flax and hemp. Other uncommon primary materials such as fig tree bark are also reported in some manuscripts.  Papermaking process  Unfortunately, very few manuscripts mentioned the methods of papermaking, the phases and applied devices. But a stunning painting from an illustrated book in Persian has implicated different steps and devices of the traditional process of paper making which is astonishingly in line with few extant documents describing the paper manufacturing process. In this painting two major phases of papermaking have been separately illustrated: * Pulp making and pulp dewatering: water power mill mixes linen wastes (Karbas) and rags, as the primary materials of papermaking, with water. They are well beaten in stone pits. In the next step, the watery pulp is poured into a piece of fabric, tied around two workers‚Äô waists, to get initially dewatered and probably homogenised and purified. Once the pulp is dewatered into a considerable extent it passes through the next treatment phase. * Paper final treatments: this phase consists of several consequent steps e.g moulding the pulp with a square laid with wire-like lines (dipping the mould in the vat containing pulp), pressing, sizing, drying and polishing. Each step in this phase is undertaken by a particular device. For instance, in the drying process, the paper was stuck to the wall with the use of horsehair. Traditional paper making process-Oriental Paper A highly valuable manuscript from the 13th century has also elaborated the process of papermaking in detailed. This text shows how papermakers went through a multitude of steps to produce a high-quality paper. This papermaking instruction or recipe is a chapter under the title of al-k√¢ghad al-balad√Æ (local paper) from the manuscript of al-Mukhtara'f√Æ fun√ªn min al-·π£unan attributed to al-Malik al- Mu·∫ìaffar, a Yemeni ruler of Rasulids. The bark of fig trees, as the main source of papermaking in this recipe, went through frequent cycles of soaking, beating and drying. The whole process that took 12 days was designed to produced 100 sheets of high-quality paper. During the pulping stage, the beaten fibres were transformed into different sizes of Kubba (cubes) which they were used as standard scales to manufacture a certain number of sheets. The dimensions were determined based on three citrus fruit: limun (lemon), utrunja (orange) and narenja (Tangerine). A summarized version of this detailed process is as below. Each procedure was repeated several times. * Soaking paper in a pool * Dewatering paper through squeezing and pressing * Making balls from the pulp * Pressing the balls * Drying the paper by sticking them to the wall and exposing the final product into the sun  Paper properties  Near Eastern paper is mainly characterized by sizing with a variety of starches such as rice, katira, wheat and white sorghum. Rice and white sorghum were more widely used. Paper usually was placed on a hard surface and a smooth device called a mohreh was used to rub the starch against the paper until it becomes perfectly shiny. The laborious process of papermaking was refined and machinery was designed for bulk manufacturing of paper. Production began in Baghdad, where a method was invented to make a thicker sheet of paper, which helped transform papermaking from an art into a major industry. The use of water-powered pulp mills for preparing the pulp material used in papermaking dates back to Samarkand in the 8th century. The use of human/animal-powered paper mills has also been identified in Abbasid- era Baghdad during 794‚Äì795, though this should not be confused with later water-powered paper mills (see Paper mills section below). The Muslims also introduced the use of trip hammers (human- or animal-powered) in the production of paper, replacing the traditional Chinese mortar and pestle method. In turn, the trip hammer method was later employed by the Chinese. Historically, trip hammers were often powered by a water wheel, and are known to have been used in China as long ago as 40 BCE or maybe even as far back as the Zhou Dynasty (1050 BCE‚Äì221 BCE), though the trip hammer is not known to have been used in Chinese papermaking until after its use in Muslim papermaking. Apart from large-scale and more mechanized paper manufacturers, small to medium-sized manufacturers had labour-intensive papermaking processes By the 9th century, Muslims were using paper regularly, although for important works like copies of the revered Qur'an, vellum was still preferred. Advances in book production and bookbinding were introduced.Al-Hassani, Woodcock and Saoud, \\"1001 Inventions, Muslim heritage in Our World\\", FSTC Publishing, 2006, reprinted 2007, pp. 218-219. In Muslim countries they made books lighter‚Äîsewn with silk and bound with leather-covered paste boards; they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. By the 12th century in Marrakech in Morocco a street was named \\"Kutubiyyin\\" or book sellers which contained more than 100 bookshops.The famous Kutubiya mosque is named so because of its location in this street In 1035 a Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold. Since the First Crusade in 1096, paper manufacturing in Damascus had been interrupted by wars, but its production continued in two other centres. Egypt continued with the thicker paper, while Iran became the center of the thinner papers. Papermaking was diffused across the Islamic world, from where it was diffused further west into Europe. Paper manufacture was introduced to India in the 13th century by Arab merchants, where it almost wholly replaced traditional writing materials. =Indian subcontinent= The evidence of paper use on the Indian subcontinent appears first in the second half of the 7th century. Its use is mentioned by 7th‚Äì and 8th-century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim memoirs as well as some Indian Buddhists, as Kakali and ≈öaya ‚Äì likely Indian transliteration of Chinese Zh«ê (tsie). Yijing wrote about the practice of priests and laypeople in India printing Buddha image on silk or paper, and worshipping these images. Elsewhere in his memoir, I-Ching wrote that Indians use paper to make hats, to reinforce their umbrellas and for sanitation. Xuangzang mentions carrying 520 manuscripts from India back to China in 644 CE, but it is unclear if any of these were on paper. Thin sheets of birch bark and specially treated palm-leaves remained the preferred writing surface for literary works through late medieval period in most of India. The earliest Sanskrit paper manuscript found is a paper copy of the Shatapatha Brahmana in Kashmir, dated to 1089, while the earliest Sanskrit paper manuscripts in Gujarat are dated between 1180 and 1224. Some of oldest surviving paper manuscripts have been found in Jain temples of Gujarat and Rajasthan, and paper use by Jain scribes is traceable to around 12th-century. According to the historical trade-related archives such as Cairo Geniza found in the synagogues of the Middle East, Jewish merchants ‚Äì such as Ben Yiju originally from Tunisia who moved to India ‚Äì imported large quantities of paper into ports of Gujarat, Malabar coast and other parts of India by the 11th-century to partly offset the goods they exported from India. According to Irfan Habib, it is reasonable to presume that paper manufacturing reached Sindh (now part of south Pakistan) before 11th-century with the start of Arab rule in Sindh. Fragments of Arabic manuscripts found in the Sindhi city ruins of Mansura, which was destroyed circa 1030, confirm the use of paper in Sindh. Amir Khusrau of Delhi Sultanate mentions paper-making operations in 1289. In the 15th century, Chinese traveler Ma Huan praised the quality of paper in Bengal, describing it as white paper that is made from \\"bark of a tree\\" and is as \\"glossy and smooth as deer's skin\\". The use of tree bark as a raw material for paper suggests that the paper manufacturing in the eastern states of India may have come directly from China, rather than Sultanates formed by West Asian or Central Asian conquests. Paper technology likely arrived in India from China through Tibet and Nepal around mid-7th century, when Buddhist monks freely traveled, exchanged ideas and goods between Tibet and Buddhist centers in India. This exchange is evidenced by the Indian talapatra binding methods that were adopted by Chinese monasteries such as at Tunhuang for preparing sutra books from paper. Most of the earliest surviving sutra books in Tibetan monasteries are on Chinese paper strips held together with Indian manuscript binding methods. Further, the analysis of the woodblock book covers of these historic manuscripts has confirmed that it was made of tropical wood indigenous to India, not Tibet. Paper in Europe A copy of the Gutenberg Bible, printed on paper during the 1450s, in the New York Public Library The oldest known paper document in Europe is the Mozarab Missal of Silos from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in X√†tiva in 1056.Richard Leslie Hills: Papermaking in Britain 1488‚Äì1988: A Short History. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015, (Reprint), S. 2.Filipe Duarte Santos: Humans on Earth: From Origins to Possible Futures. Springer, 2012, , S. 116. Papermaking reached Europe as early as 1085 in Toledo and was firmly established in X√†tiva, Spain by 1150. It is clear that France had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in Fabriano, Italy and in Treviso and other northern Italian towns by 1340. Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in Troyes, France by 1348, in Holland sometime around 1340‚Äì1350, in Mainz, Germany in 1320, and in Nuremberg by 1390 in a mill set up by Ulman Stromer. This was just about the time when the woodcut printmaking technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the old master print and popular prints. There was a paper mill in Switzerland by 1432 and the first mill in England was set up by John Tate around 1490 near Hertford,Richard L. Hills, ‚ÄòTate, John (c.1448‚Äì1507/8)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 24 June 2015. Subscription or UK public library membership required.Historie ruƒçn√≠ho pap√≠ru but the first commercially successful paper mill in Britain did not occur before 1588 when John Spilman set up a mill near Dartford in Kent. During this time, paper making spread to Poland by 1491, to Austria by 1498, to Russia by 1576, to the Netherlands by 1586, to Denmark by 1596, and to Sweden by 1612. Arab prisoners who settled in a town called Borgo Saraceno in the Italian Province of Ferrara introduced Fabriano artisans in the Province of Ancona the technique of making paper by hand. At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth. Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time. They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, sizing paper by means of animal glue, and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local tanneries. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper. They adapted the waterwheels from the fuller's mills to drive a series of three wooden hammers per trough. The hammers were raised by their heads by cams fixed to a waterwheel's axle made from a large tree trunk. Americas Amate is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture. In the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the Mayans no later than the 5th century CE.The Construction of the Codex In Classic- and post classic- Period Maya Civilization Maya Codex and Paper Making Called amatl or amate, it was in widespread use among Mesoamerican cultures until the Spanish conquest. The earliest sample of amate was found at Huitzilapa near the Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco, Mexico, belonging to the shaft tomb culture. It is dated to 75 BCE.Benz, Bruce; Lorenza Lopez Mestas; Jorge Ramos de la Vega (2006). \\"Organic Offerings, Paper, and Fibers from the Huitzilapa Shaft Tomb, Jalisco, Mexico\\". Ancient Mesoamerica. 17 (2). pp. 283‚Äì296. The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus. The bark material is soaked in water, or in modern methods boiled, so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres. They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets. It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form, but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers. As a result, amate has a rougher surface than modern paper, and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink. European papermaking spread to the Americas first in Mexico by 1575 and then in Philadelphia by 1690. =United States= The American paper industry began with the establishment of the first paper mill in British America in 1690 by William Rittenhouse of Philadelphia with the help of Pennsylvania's first printer, William Bradford. For two decades it would remain the only mill in the colonies, and for the next two centuries the city would remain the preeminent center of paper manufacturing and publishing. The first paper mills relied solely on rag paper production, with cotton rags generally imported from Europe. However by the mid-19th century the sulfite process had begun to proliferate in other regions with better access to wood pulp, and by 1880, America had become the largest producer of paper goods in the world. While the Delaware Valley remained an important region in paper production and publishing through the late nineteenth century, Philadelphia was overtaken by regions using these new processes which had greater access to water power and wood pulp. The earliest of these mills were centered in New England and Upstate New York, the latter of which became home to International Paper, the largest pulp and paper company in the world, which held a 20% market share in 2017, and at its peak produced more than 60% of the continent's newsprint in 1898, before an industry shift to Canada. Chief among papermaking cities in New England and the world was Holyoke, Massachusetts, at one time making 80% of the writing paper of the United States and home to the ill-fated American Writing Paper Company, the world's largest producer of fine papers by 1920. By 1885 the Paper City, as it is still called, produced 190 tons per day, more than twice Philadelphia's capacity. Quickly it became a hub of paper machinery and turbine technology, host to the largest paper mills in the world in the 1890s, and D. H. & A. B. Tower, the largest paper mill engineering firm in the United States in the 19th century. The Tower Brothers and their associates would be responsible for designing mills on five continents. In the United States the firm supported the Berkshires' paper industry, building the first mills used to make U.S. currency by the Crane Company, as well as the first sulfite process mills of Kimberly Clark in Wisconsin, allowing the company to be the first west of the Appalachians to adopt the process, with access to vast forest resources. The pulp and paper industry continued to develop in other regions, including California, Ohio's Miami Valley, with centers in Dayton, Hamilton, and Cincinnati, as well as regions of the South, like Texas and Georgia, the latter being home to Georgia Pacific and WestRock, the 2nd and 3rd respective largest paper producers in the United States today. Wisconsin's industry nevertheless endured and as of 2019 it had far and away the most paper manufacturers in the country, with 34 such enterprises. While only smaller specialty manufacturers remained in Pennsylvania and New England, New York retained 28 mills, followed by Georgia with 20, Michigan with 17, and Alabama with 16 respectively.  Paper mills  The Nuremberg paper mill, the building complex at the lower right corner, in 1493. Due to their noise and smell, paper mills were required by medieval law to be erected outside the city perimeter. The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim papermakers. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century.Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin 1985, pp. 68‚Äì73: : Scholars have identified paper mills, likely human or animal powered, in Abbasid-era Baghdad during 794‚Äì795. It is evident that throughout the Islamic lands e.g. Iran, Syria (Hama and Damascus), and North Africa (Egypt and Tripoli) water power mills were extensively used to beat the flax and rag wastes to prepare the paper pulp The Water mill was built under Abd al-Rahman II in C√≥rdoba Donald Hill has identified a possible reference to a water-powered paper mill in Samarkand, in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni, but concludes that the passage is \\"too brief to enable us to say with certainty\\" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill. This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time. Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century. Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon. A decree by the Christian king Peter III addresses the establishment of a royal \\"molendinum\\", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of X√†tiva. The crown innovation was operated by the Muslim Mud√©jar community in the Moorish quarter of X√†tiva, though it appears to have been resented by sections of the local Muslim papermakering community; the document guarantees them the right to continue the way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill. Paper making centers began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; paper making centers reached Germany a century later. The first paper mill north of the Alps was established in Nuremberg by Ulman Stromer in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated Nuremberg Chronicle. From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes. Fiber sources Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers. It was not realized at the time how unstable wood pulp paper is. A means of removing printing inks from paper, allowing it to be re-used, was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this process is called deinking. 19th-century advances in papermaking Although cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with fibres from wood pulp. Although older machines pre-dated it, the Fourdrinier papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. Nicholas Louis Robert of Essonnes, France, was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for Leger Didot with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of Bryan Donkin, a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at Frogmore Paper Mill, Hertfordshire, in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at St Neots intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop. However, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, Matthias Koops (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.Koops, Matthias. Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper. London: Printed by T. Burton, 1800. His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. \\"Koops. Matthias.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000, Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.30‚Äì32 Then in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both Friedrich Gottlob Keller and Charles Fenerty began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the western world were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. Together with the invention of the practical fountain pen and the mass-produced pencil of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary printing press, wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th-century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the clerk, or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. Unfortunately, early wood-based paper deteriorated as time passed, meaning that much of the output of newspapers and books from this period either has disintegrated or is in poor condition; some has been photographed or digitized (scanned). The acid nature of the paper, caused by the use of alum, produced what has been called a slow fire, slowly converting the paper to ash. Documents needed to be written on more expensive rag paper. In the 2nd half of the 20th century cheaper acid-free paper based on wood was developed, and it was used for hardback and trade paperback books. However, paper that has not been de-acidified was still cheaper, and remains in use (2020) for mass-market paperback books, newspapers, and in underdeveloped countries. Determining provenance Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways. The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar. Using known sheets can produce an exact identification. Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results. Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process. Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.

Biography In the mid-1960s, Ellison traveled to Rochester, New York, where he met the original members of the Soul Brothers Five, becoming the sixth member and prompting the band to change its name to the Soul Brothers Six. The other members of the group included Charles Armstrong, Harry Armstrong, Vonnell Benjamin, Lester Pelemon, and Joe Johnson. The group signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records. Ellison was the lead guitarist, singer, and songwriter for the group; and while traveling to a recording session in Philadelphia in 1967, Ellison wrote \\"She's Some Kind of Wonderful.\\" This original version reached number 91 on the US Billboard chart. In 1987, the book Sweet Soul Music named the Soul Brothers Six as a major influence on the sound of modern music. Not only has the trademark bass line in \\"She's Some Kind of Wonderful\\" been utilized by countless other artists for a variety of different songs, but the song has also earned the Soul Brothers Six a spot in music history. More than 50 different artists have recorded \\"She's Some Kind of Wonderful,\\" making it one of the most recorded songs in the history of music. In 1995, Ellison received a citation of achievement from Broadcast Music for writing the third-most played song in the world. After the Soul Brothers Six broke up in the 1970s, Ellison continued to record and perform. In 1993 he released his first solo album, Welcome Back, followed by Missing You in 2000. In 2007, he released his third solo album, Back. He is a regular performer at the Nice Jazz Festival in France, and also performs regularly throughout Europe, Asia and North America. In November 2008, Ellison was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year, and for R&B;/Soul Recording of the Year, for Back at the Hamilton Music Awards in Hamilton, Ontario. He also performed at the awards ceremony. On December 6, 2009, he was honored with the Arcelor Mittal Dofasco Lifetime Achievement Award and performed at the Hamilton Music Awards. Ellison released his autobiography, Some Kind of Wonderful: The John Ellison Story, in July 2012. This work explores the racism and violence Ellison encountered and examines the relationship between these experiences and his songwriting. In July 2013, a site near his childhood home in Landgraff, West Virginia, was cleared by Boy Scouts and other volunteers, as part of a service project connected to the 2013 National Boy Scout Jamboree. Plans are pending to build a replica of his boyhood home to house a museum dedicated to Ellison's music and his early life in the local mine camp community of Landgraff. In October 2015, John was formally inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.

Location  It is located in Pune district, 5 to 6 km from Malavli Railway station out of which 3 km is steep road. It has an elevation of 1084 meters above sea level. Friends of forts website It is built on the same plateau as Lohagad.  History  It was built during 1713-1720 CE by Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa of Maratha Empire. Maharashtra Government Tourism Site Visapur fort was built much later than Lohagad but the histories of the two forts are closely linked. In 1818, when reducing the Peshwa's forts, the strength of Lohagad and its fame as the treasury of the Maratha kingdom, caused the English to make special preparations for its attack. A detachment of 380 European and 800 native soldiers, with a battering train, summoned from Konkan, were joined by artillery from Chakan, and two other British battalions. On 4 March 1818, Visapur was attacked and occupied. Making use of its higher elevation and proximity to Lohagad, the British troops set up their cannons on Visapur and bombarded Lohagad, forcing the Marathas to flee. Thus, in 1818, Lohagad-Visapur was taken over by the British in 1818 AD and placed under the command of a Colonel Prother. Considering, the strategic importance of Visapur, both the north (Konkan) and the south (Deccan) gateways were blown up, and except a few huts, nothing was left standing. In contrast, most of Lohagad fort is still intact.  Major Features  Visapur Fort is larger and at a higher elevation than its twin fort- Lohagad. Within the fort are caves, cisterns of water, a decorated arch and old houses. These two roofless buildings surrounded by outer or veranda walls said to have once been Government offices. The ruins of a large stone-built house are known as the Peshwa's palace. In addition to a huge carving of Hanuman, there are also several temples dedicated to him scattered all over the place. Nirvana adventures website There is a well which local legend says was built by the Pandavas. In 1885, near the north wall there was an iron gun ten feet long and of four-inch bore, marked with the Tudor Rose and Crown, flanked by the letters E. R. This is probably a gun of Queen Elizabeth's reign probably taken as bounty from an English ship and presented to the Peshwa by Kanhoji Angre or some other commander of the Maratha Navy. Like other guns on the fort it has been disabled by breaking off its trunnions. Close to it are the remains of an old Mahadev shrine. Unlike the inner structure, majority of its wall is still intact. At a moderate pace, it takes two hours to walk along the winding Visapoor walls. It is high and strengthened by towers along the west face. In other parts, the wall varies from 3 feet thick fortification, backed by masonry platforms where the slope of the hill is easy, to a mere parapet of dry stone where the plateau ends in a precipice. Two massive bastions still flank the ruined central gate.

While working as a printer for the Macon News in 1913, Johnson converted to Christianity and felt called of God to preach. He entered Asbury University in September 1913 and transferred to Trevecca College in 1914. In 1916, Johnson married Sarah Mershon and began serving as a minister in the Southwest Kansas Conference of the Methodist Church. He transferred to the South Georgia Conference in 1918 and completed conference studies at Emory University in 1920. In 1922 he transferred to the Kentucky Conference of the Methodist Church and returned to Asbury College as a student, where he completed an A.B. degree in 1925. He served as athletic director and shorthand instructor at Asbury while pursuing his M.A. at the University of Kentucky, which he completed in 1926. Johnson served as book editor and circulation manager for the Herald Press from June 1926 to June 1927, at which time he enrolled at George Peabody College for Ph.D. work, completing the degree in 1929. He served as the head of the History Department at Mississippi State College from 1929 to 1934. In 1934, Johnson was appointed pastor of the Wilmore Methodist Church, where he cleared a long-standing debt. He became Executive Vice President at Asbury College under Dr. Henry Clay Morrison in 1935 while the institution was on the verge of bankruptcy with nearly $5 million of debt. The debt was cleared in 1938, and the college endowment was raised to over half a million dollars by 1939. Asbury College was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as an accredited liberal arts institution in 1940, the same year that Z.T. Johnson assumed the presidency. He was the first alumnus of the college to serve as president. The longest- tenured president in the school's history to date, Johnson's presidency at Asbury College was marked by growth, both of the student body and the campus physical plant. Campus improvements during his administration included an amphitheater, a nine-hole golf course, an athletic field with a quarter-mile track, a farm, twenty-one duplexes, a triplex, an 18-unit apartment, eight faculty homes, five dormitories (including the Johnson Men's Dormitory), a student center, a library addition, a fine arts building, a science hall, and the Z.T. Johnson Cafeteria. During his term as president, the student enrollment rose from 526 to 1,135. It was also under Johnson's administration that Asbury College moved to full racial integration in 1962. Johnson retired from the presidency of Asbury College in 1966. Johnson served as mayor of Wilmore, Kentucky from 1970 to 1972. He died on May 30, 1981, in Lexington, Kentucky, at the age of 83. Sources * Asbury College: Vision and Miracle, by Joseph A.

History This former site of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company's River Station (1876‚àí1901) is considered the \\"Ellis Island of Los Angeles\\" where new arrivals from the east first disembarked. Corn leaking from train cars and sprouting along the tracks gave rise to the nickname The Cornfield. The site was established as a California state park in 2001. Park development In 2001, a five-foot section of the historical Zanja Madre irrigation canal was uncovered. In 2005, the former industrial site was transformed into a productive cornfield for one season as an art project called \\"Not a Cornfield.\\" In 2006, a contest was held in conjunction with the California State Parks Foundation to select a design for the park. The preliminary park opened on September 23 of the same year. Hargreaves and Associates of San Francisco ultimately won the contest. Development of the park has been slow. California's budget deficit forced officials to scale back plans for the park in 2010, earmarking $18 million instead of the planned $55 million. Plans for a bridge, water fountain, theme gardens, an upscale restaurant, as well as an ecology center with restored wetlands were tabled.

Eleven poemsone contested and one definitely spurioushave been ascribed to Thibaut in the chansonniers. Three further anonymous songs have also been attributed to him by Terence H. Newcombe, his modern editor.Les po√©sies de Thibaut de Blaison (Geneva: Droz, 1978). Thibaut was the seneschal of Poitou and his uncle was Maurice, Bishop of Poitiers. In 1214 Thibaut helped negotiate a truce between Philip II of France and John of England. In 1212 he was taking part in the Reconquista in Spain and he was among the Albigensian Crusaders besieging Toulouse in 1218. He appears alongside the trouv√®re Amauri de Craon in a document of 1219. He attended the coronation of Louis IX in 1226, along with the trouv√®re Hue de la Fert√©. Theobald I of Navarre, also a trouv√®re, dedicated the song De ma dame souvenir to Thibaut and also used Thibaut's Amours, que porra devenir as a model for a religious poem of his own. Gautier d'Espinal also borrowed the melody of Amours for one piece. Thibaut himself borrowed from rhythms from the polyphonic repertoire of the day. He may have based his Bien font Amours lor talent on the conductus Quid frustra consumeris and Chanter et renvoisier seuil on Sol sub nube latuit. With the exception of three chansons that are restricted to a sixth Amours, que porra devenir, Chanter et renvoisier seuil, and Huimain par un ajourantand one, Li miens chanters ne puet mais remanoir, which is severely restricted in movement, most of Thibaut's melodies move freely. They are all basically syllabic, with only Li miens chanters exhibiting more complex melisma. Compared to his melodies (all recorded in bar form),The first six lines of Quant je voi are given mensural notation in the Chansonnier Cang√©. his prosody is usually simple, though three songsBien font Amours lor talent, Bon jour ait hui cele a cui sui amis, and Quant je voi est√© venir exhibit some variety. The simplicity of Bien font Amours is more in keeping with Thibaut's style and not the more \\"flamboyant\\" style of Gautier de Dargies, to whom it is also attributed.

Rival Soviet and US expeditions are launched to visit it. (The world balance as it existed in 1963 is assumed to be still in place.) One important aspect of the plot is that the Soviet expedition includes the first woman in space.

The subsets of vertices must be disjoint. The ordinary TSP is a special case of the set TSP when all subsets to be visited are singletons. Therefore, the set TSP is also NP-hard. There is a direct transformation for an instance of the set TSP to an instance of the standard asymmetric TSP. The idea is to first create disjoint sets and then assign a directed cycle to each set. The salesman, when visiting a vertex in some set, then walks around the cycle for free. To not use the cycle would ultimately be very costly. The Set TSP has a lot of interesting applications in several path planning problems. For example, a two vehicle cooperative routing problem could be transformed into a set TSP, tight lower bounds to the Dubins TSP and generalized Dubins path problem could be computed by solving a Set TSP. Illustration from the cutting stock problem The one-dimensional cutting stock problem as applied in the paper / plastic film industries, involves cutting jumbo rolls into smaller ones. This is done by generating cutting patterns typically to minimise waste. Once such a solution has been produced, one may seek to minimise the knife changes, by re-sequencing the patterns (up and down in the figure), or moving rolls left or right within each pattern. These moves do not affect the waste of the solution. border In the above figure, patterns (width no more than 198) are rows; knife changes are indicated by the small white circles; for example, patterns 2-3-4 have a roll of size 42.5 on the left - the corresponding knife does not have to move. Each pattern represents a TSP set, one of whose permutations must be visited. For instance, for the last pattern, which contains two repeated sizes (twice each), there are 5! / (2! √ó 2!) = 30 permutations. The number of possible solutions to the above instance is 12! √ó (5!)6 √ó (6!)4 √ó (7!)2 / ((2!)9 √ó (3!)2) ‚âà 5.3 √ó 1035. The above solution contains 39 knife changes, and has been obtained by a heuristic; it is not known whether this is optimal. Transformations into the regular TSP, as described in would involve a TSP with 5,520 nodes.

Newton, a fellow Scot, had been the tutor of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. After Prince Henry's death in 1612, Newton and Cunningham continued to be administrators and collectors for the Welsh and duchy incomes which funded Prince Charles' household. This income passed to Prince Charles, and continued as a separate income stream when he became king. Cunningham wrote letters to his cousin David Cunningham of Robertland, who was grandson of the royal master of work David Cunningham of Robertland. The letters advise his younger cousin on aspects of their estate business and interests. He also discusses taking Newton's son Sir Henry Newton on an educational trip to France.National Records of Scotland on-line catalogue, GD237/25.

Plot summary In the 1970 of this story, Eire has become an authoritarian police state, made somewhat acceptable to the population by the vast wealth flowing from a secret and forbidden science zone occupying a large area of the South-West. Here is based the mysterious 'Industrial Corporation of √âire' which has produced a range of new technologies. Its enigmatic founders are not Irish: they settled there and resist all attempts to find out who they are. A young British scientist agrees to be sent as a spy to find out just what is going on. Although labelled as Science Fiction by the publisher, the bulk of the novel owes more to the thriller style of the John Buchan tradition, as the Cambridge hero battles across wild Irish landscapes fighting a series of murderous thugs and secret policemen. The science fiction denouement is confined almost to the last chapter and foreshadows the theme of Hoyle's later A for Andromeda, though in a far more cursory manner. Also of note is the way the young hero seems to come to accept the notion of an authoritarian society ruled by a few self-appointed \\"supermen\\".

Cleon Skousen. It was formerly known as The Freemen Institute. According to the NCCS, the founding of the United States was a divine miracle. As such, the NCCS worldview and program are based on two major pillars: (1) understanding the divine guidance that has allowed the United States to thrive and (2) rejecting what it views as the sometimes tyrannical or sinful deviations of the modern U.S. federal government from that divine mold. History The center had its origins when in 1967 Skousen, a professor at Brigham Young University, organized an off-campus institute for constitutional studies. In 1971, this was formerly christened as The Freemen Institute. It was later given its current name and its headquarters moved to Washington, D.C. The center ran conferences in the 1980s and 1990s through a non-profit it controlled called \\"The Making of America Conferences, Inc.\\" Board members of this non-profit included Skousen, William H. Doughty, Donald N. Sills, and Glenn Kimber. Impeached Arizona governor Evan Mecham was also a regular donor to the center. In the early 1990s, an effort to build a conservative community in Southern Utah to house the center collapsed amid the developer's unfulfilled promises. Leadership The current CEO and chairman of the board is Zeldon Nelson NCCS web site Previous chairmen were: *W. Cleon Skousen *Andrew Allison *Jim Bartleson *John L. Harmer, former lieutenant governor of California *Earl Taylor Jr. The Making of America controversy In 1987, controversy erupted in California over the NCCS-published textbook The Making of America by W. Cleon Skousen. The book quoted a 1934 essay on slavery by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Fred Albert Shannon that described black children as \\"pickaninnies\\"; another section stated that life for white Southerners was \\"a nightmare\\" due to \\"the constant fear of slave rebellion\\", and claimed that white slave owners were \\"the worst victims of slavery\\". The state's bicentennial commission had approved the sale of the book as a fundraising device to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the United States Constitution. Gary K. Hart and Willie Brown demanded that then-Governor George Deukmejian fire the three members of the Bicentennial Commission who had cast \\"yes\\" votes on the sale of the book. The controversy was resolved after the commission issued an apology, stating that it had made a \\"serious error in judgment\\" by approving the sale of the book. Allies and popularity A 2011 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center said that the NCCS had found a number of new organizational allies among \\"constitutionalist\\" groups such as the John Birch Society, the Eagle Forum, and the Oath Keepers.Fringe Mormon Group Makes Myths with Glenn Beck‚Äôs Help by Alexander Zaitchik, Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report, Spring 2011, Issue Number: 141 Additionally, in the media, the NCCS \\"found a powerful voice in the form of Glenn Beck, who is a Mormon himself and used his Fox News platform to advocate for NCCS books and ideas. Through Beck's sustained and energetic advocacy, once-forgotten NCCS tracts... such as The 5,000 Year Leap have become unlikely bestsellers... Since the rise of the Tea Party Movement, the all-volunteer NCCS has experienced exploding interest from Tea Party-affiliated groups such as the 9.12 Project and the Tea Party Patriots. On any given Saturday, several of nearly twenty \\"Making of America\\" NCCS lecturers are giving seminars\\" across the United States. At a 2010 seminar presented by the NCCS, participants were told that the Constitution came directly from a governmental system adopted by Moses and much later by the legendary Anglo-Saxon brothers Hengist and Horsa and then copied by Thomas Jefferson. Among other things specific to the amendments of the Constitution they were told that by giving women the vote the 19th Amendment violated states' rights.

He was a student at Columbia University from 1926 to 1927. In 1926, Humphreys was appointed deputy attorney general for the state of New York during the 1926 election when voting machines were used for the first time Humphreys' early political experience came as publicity director for the Indiana Republican State Committee in the elections of 1932 and 1934. In 1933 Humphreys joined the staff of International News Service (INS) as a political writer, eventually becoming the bureau manager of the Kansas City office. For the 1936 election year, he was assigned by INS to Topeka, Kansas and the Alf Landon presidential campaign. During the time that Humphreys traveled with Landon's campaign train the two men developed a close relationship which was to last until the time of Humphreys' death. INS Chief For the years 1937 through 1944, Humphreys transferred to the INS Washington, D.C. branch, becoming chief of the INS congressional staff and the Washington News editor. During this time, while writing a daily column called \\"Washington-Up-To-The- Minute,\\" Humphreys established close contacts with many members of Congress. He left INS and Washington in 1944 to become the national affairs editor of Newsweek Magazine. However, following the 1948 campaign and the resulting election of Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, Humphreys was asked by Speaker of the House Joe Martin to return to Washington to establish and direct a public relations office for the Republican Congressional Committee.Louis Galambo et al. The Papers of Dwight D. Eisenhower: NATO and the Campaign of 1952: Vol. XIII. Baltimore. Johns Hopkins University Press. 1989. p. 1297. From this office, Humphreys introduced a variety of visual aid techniques, including television \\"spots\\" and 16mm films, in and effort to publicize individual GOP congressmen and to attempt to rid the Republican party of \\"the depressive atmospheric condition\\" in America linking Republicans \\"with the vested interest\\" and disassociating them \\"from the ordinary human beings.\\" In July 1952, Republican National Chairman Arthur Summerfield arranged for the \\"loan\\" of Humphreys to the RNC to serve as publicity director for the duration of the 1952 campaign. For this campaign Humphreys designed a blueprint, known as \\"Document X,\\" which \\"marked the first time a presidential campaign was planned and put on paper to the last detail.\\" The campaign plan, which covered the who, when, where, and what to do/say for the Eisenhower- Nixon ticket, was, according to Humphreys, followed throughout the campaign \\"with only a few adjustments to meet political circumstances as they arose.\\" In addition to being prominent in the initial campaign strategy, Humphreys was also instrumental, along with Summerfield, in keeping Nixon on the Republican ticket following the \\"expense Fund\\" affair. RNC Campaign Director The 35th wedding anniversary of President Eisenhower and his wife, taken in 1955. It was Humphreys job to promote Eisenhower to the public Following the Republican victories, Humphreys did not return to the Congressional Committee, but stayed with RNC to become campaign director, a position he held from 1954 until 1960. These years involved the organization of the Republican party nationally, regional planning conferences, strategy development, RNC meetings, analyses of elections and polls, campaign tours, two RNC campaign schools (1955 and 1958), speeches, appearances, and another Dwight D. Eisenhower-Richard Nixon campaign. For the 1956 election Humphreys devised a second original campaign plan, and was also involved in halting the \\"dump Nixon\\" movement before the RNC convention. Always Attack Throughout the Eisenhower years in the White House, Humphreys strived to improve the public relations of the president and his administration. It was his belief that the basic strategy in politics should always be to attack. In a 1953 memo to Leonard Hall, Humphreys stated that \\"it would be a political mistake for this administration to rely solely on its achievements\\"; instead \\"political warfare must be waged by selling our philosophy, our achievements, our kind of government against the alternative.\\" At the close of the administration, in 1960, President Eisenhower appointed Humphreys to head the staff of the newly formed National Cultural Center project. Humphreys had a lifelong interest in the performing arts, especially classical music. At one period in his career, while working for INS, he wrote a column which reviewed the latest classical albums and he personally owned all the technically advanced equipment in sound recording. Humphreys remained with the ambitious Cultural Center project for a single year until the fund- raising machinery bogged down and came to a complete standstill. The Republican Coordinating Committee In 1961 Humphreys turned once again to politics and the Republican party, this time to serve as staff director and consultant for the Joint Senate and House Republican Leadership. From this position Humphreys continued his efforts to improve the public relations of Republican members of Congress. He arranged to make wide political use of the popular Republican ex-president by holding highly publicized meetings at Gettysburg with Eisenhower and such GOP stalwarts as Everett Dirksen and Charles Halleck. Another innovation was what came to be called \\"The Ev and Charlie Show\\" in which the two Republican congressional leaders appeared weekly on television to advertise the Republican stand on national issues and to discredit the Kennedy administration. Humphreys was involved in writing the scripts for these press conferences. One of Humphreys' last contributions was the creation of the Republican Coordinating Committee which was designed to broaden the advisory base on national party policy, to establish task forces to deal with national problems, and to stimulate communication and a common approach among party members. The Committee was formed in March 1965, just a few months before Humphreys' death. Throughout his years with various news organizations and with the RNC, Humphreys produced a number of published articles on a wide variety of politically related topics and personalities. He also contributed chapters to two books on politics, wrote numerous unpublished reports and studies for the Republicans, created scripts for various political slide and movie productions, and occasionally drafted speeches for such high- ranking political figures as James Farley, Alf Landon, Leonard W. Hall, Arthur Summerfield, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. See also *Politics of the United States References External links *Papers of Robert Humphreys, Dwight D.

In 1890, a community was platted by two promoters, Frank Bourn and Frank Scott (whence the town's name). Together they envisioned a resort community at the location. Lots were sold on the rumor that the railroad would soon build a line through the town (the only access to the town was by boat). A post office, general store, hotel, saloon and a sawmill were built, and a newspaper (the Frankfort Chronicle) was established, which attracted even more investors. The financial Panic of 1893 scared away any more investors, and the future of the town took a downhill turn. Frankfort continued to survive mainly as a logging town until the late 1940s. Unfortunately, no railroad line ever materialized and Frankfort never prospered. The post office had closed in 1918. The town was sold to a logging company in 1953 and by 1960, it had only two residents. Reportedly, very little remains of the town today, apart from some foundations.

Career Cunliffe was born in Bolton and played for several Lancashire clubs, including Little Lever, Middleton Borough and Oldham County before joining First Division Liverpool in 1897. He made 14 First Division appearances for Liverpool during the 1897‚Äì98 season, scoring five times, including two against Stoke at Anfield on 9 October 1897. Numerous changes were made to the club's forward-line during that season and Cunliffe only featured three times during the second half of the season. He also played in four FA Cup ties for Liverpool, scoring the winner in their 2‚Äì1 second round replay with Newton Heath on 16 February 1898. Cunliffe spent the 1898‚Äì99 season with New Brighton Tower in the Second Division. He made thirty league appearances, scoring 15 goals in a forward line which included former England international Alf Milward. In the summer of 1899, he joined Portsmouth who had been founded a year earlier and were elected as members of an expanded Southern League for the 1899‚Äì00 season. Cunliffe made his Fratton Park debut on 6 September 1899 in a friendly match against local rivals Southampton, when he scored the opening goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory. Cunliffe scored again in the first Southern League derby match against Southampton at The Dell on 14 April 1900 as Pompey ended their inaugural professional season as runners-up. He also scored Portsmouth's first goal in the FA Cup proper in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Blackburn Rovers on 1 February 1900; Portsmouth lost the replay 5‚Äì0. Cunliffe's form earned him selection for England against Ireland in 1900. For the match, played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin on 17 March 1900, the England team were confidently expecting an easy match after five successive victories, including winning 13‚Äì2 the previous year. The England selectors chose five debutantes, including Cunliffe, who made his solitary England appearance at inside right, with his Portsmouth teammate Matt Reilly in goal for the Irish. In the event, the game was far more difficult than expected, with England only managing a 2‚Äì0 victory, with goals from Charlie Sagar and Harry Johnson, who were also both making their international debut. For the next season, Cunliffe returned to New Brighton Tower, where he made a further 28 league appearances with nine goals. He scored all three goals in an FA Cup intermediate round match at Port Vale on 5 January 1901. Despite finishing fourth in the league, the cost of maintaining a professional football club became too high for the Tower's owners, and the club was disbanded in the summer of 1901. Following the folding of the New Tower club, Cunliffe returned to Portsmouth for the 1901‚Äì02 season, in which he helped the south coast team take the Southern League title for the first time, by a margin of five points over Tottenham Hotspur, as well as retaining their Western League title. Cunliffe remained at Portsmouth until May 1906, when he signed for New Brompton. He spent one season with the Kent-based club, finishing as top scorer with 15 goals, before moving on. He later played for Millwall Athletic and Heywood before finishing his career at Rochdale in 1914.

She operated on the Wightlink Ryde Pier to Portsmouth route from 2000 to 2009 along with her sister ship HSC FastCat Ryde. Prior to working for Wightlink, the ship worked in Singapore and was named Water Jet 2. In 1999, the year before it was sold to Wightlink, its name was changed to Supercat 18. From early autumn 2009, Wightlink took delivery of two new vessels to operate the route, Wight Ryder I and Wight Ryder II. Both the FastCat Shanklin and FastCat Ryde were retained by Wightlink until 2010, due to teething problems which occurred with the new vessels. They were then sold on to new owners Severn Link. In January 2010, the FastCat Shanklin was re-painted into a new livery for use with Severn Link travelling between Ilfracombe and Swansea as part of a new catamaran service with a shorter travel time of 50 minutes. The re-paint occurred in Portsmouth Harbour and shortly afterwards the ferry departed for Swansea. On 29 January 2010 the ship arrived in the Bristol Channel and visited Ilfracombe before heading to Swansea Docks.http://www.thisisnorthdevon.co.uk/news/Ferry-calls- Ilfracombe-harbour/article-1781026-detail/article.html After arriving there it received an interior refurbishment. However the proposed ferry service failed to start as stated by Severn Link at Easter 2010.

When Jensen was fired in February 2003, Batley took over as interim coach, and the \\"interim\\" tag was removed less than two weeks later. Batley led the Mammoth to a 27-16 record in two and a half seasons, making the playoffs each year, but his contract was not renewed after the 2005 season. A year later, Batley was hired by the expansion Chicago Shamrox to be their first-ever coach and general manager. After consecutive 6-10 seasons, the Shamrox suspended operations shortly before the 2009 season began, and Batley was out of work again, though not for long. In January 2009, Batley became the head coach of the Toronto Rock after the Rock fired Glenn Clark. The Rock were 5-8 after Batley took over, and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. After the season, Mike Kloepfer resigned as Director of Lacrosse Operations of the Rock, and Batley applied for the job but was turned down. After Terry Sanderson was announced as the new GM, Batley was informed that he would not be returning as head coach of the Rock. In March 2016, Batley replaced Dan Perreault as head coach of the Vancouver Stealth, he left the team in 2018.

He was in command of the steamer when it undertook a trial, day return, crossing of the English Channel organized by the South Eastern Railway from Folkestone to Boulogne-sur-Mer in June 1843. The crossing was a part of the first one day round trip from London across the English Channel, which included a 2 hour 10 minute stopover for passengers in Boulogne. This crossing was considered to be the first one day round trip on this route. A similar steamer to Water Witch In June 1843, because of difficulties with Dover harbour, the South Eastern Railway company developed Boulogne-sur-Mer-Folkestone route as an alternative to Calais-Dover. The first ferry crossed under the command of Captain Hayward. On the day of the inauguration, a special train left London at 6 a.m. The distance of from London to Folkestone was covered in 2 hours and 40 minutes. The ferry, under the command of Captain Hayward was boarded by the party which included several members of parliament and reached Boulogne at 12:30 p.m. After a reception by the authorities in Boulogne, after 2 hours and 10 minutes the ferry left port still under Captain Hayward's command. The ferry reached Folkestone at 6:30 p.m. and the train arrived in London at 10:05 p.m. To honour the event, English rosarian Henry Bennett named a rose cultivar after Captain Hayward. Channel ferries & ferry ports The new Water Witch, commanded by Captain Hayward had before this event, been carrying passengers from Dover to Boulogne, since November 1836.

Litter in the United States is an environmental issue and littering is often a criminal offense, punishable with a fine as set out by statutes in many places.  Litter laws, enforcement efforts, and court prosecutions are used to help curtail littering. All three are part of a \\"comprehensive response to environmental violators\\", write Epstein and Hammett, researchers for the United States Department of Justice. Littering and dumping laws, found in all fifty United States, appear to take precedence over municipal ordinances in controlling violations and act as public safety, not aesthetic measures. Similar from state-to-state, these laws define who violators are, the type or \\"function\\" of the person committing the action, and what items must be littered or dumped to constitute an illegal act. Municipal ordinances and state statutes require a \\"human action\\" in committing illegal littering or dumping, for one to be \\"held in violation.\\" Most states require law enforcement officers or designated, authorized individuals, to \\"...witness the illegal act to write a citation.\\" Together, prosecutions and punitive fines are important in fighting illegal littering and dumping. A significant portion of litter along roadways in the U.S. is now being attributed to improperly tarped vehicles such as open-bed vehicles as well as trash and recycling collection vehicles that have not been properly secured. A national survey of United States prosecutors noted the most important factor in prosecuting an offense was the \\"degree of harm\\" a violation posed and the \\"criminal intent\\" of the offender. America's most prosecuted littering offense involve illegal hazardous waste disposals. Civil and criminal fines are the \\"most common strategy governments use to control environmental behaviors.\\" Most offenders settle outside of court. For small littering, a monetary penalty and/or a specified number of hours picking up litter or community service is the typical punishment. Going to jail for a littering/dumping conviction is rare. For example, in California the punishment for first-time littering starts at a $100 fine and eight hours of picking up roadside litter. A defendant's third offense and all subsequent offenses are punished with a minimum penalty of a $750 fine and 24 hours of litter cleanup (per offense). Such penalties are often prominently posted on roadside signs. In Idaho, the Comprehensive Litter Prevention and Abatement Act was signed into law in 2006. Litterers can be fined up to $180 when including a subcharge of US$80 and be ordered to clean a littered area in the community. In Washington State, the littering of (especially lit) cigarettes can incur a fine of up to $500. During the summer months, drought-like conditions and tinder-dry forests, lit or smoldering debris have started many wildfires. State litter surveys have shown that an average of 352 pounds of litter is picked up for every mile of highway including about 3,000 cigarette butts. In 2002, some 350 car accidents involved litter or road debris. In the state of Oregon, throwing a lighted cigarette or other tobacco product is a Class B misdemeanor, and is punishable by a fine of up to $2,500 and 5 years in prison. This is in addition to penalties for \\"placing offensive substances in waters, on highways or other property\\" which is a Class A misdemeanor and carries with it a maximum fine of $6,250 and 10 years in prison. Littering Surveys and Rankings Since the 1970s, over 70 studies measuring littering, its contents and impacts on local and state governments, have taken place in both the United States and Canada, according to Reducing Litter on Roadsides by the Transportation Board of the National Research Academies.http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_syn_394.pdf More recently, litter has been identified as a problem for storm water systems, prompting litter surveys to determine the characterization of storm water trash and the extent to which various components of litter contribute to this problem. Citizens Combating Litter The \\"Caught Doing Good!\\" campaign, started by the Pennsylvania Resources Council, implemented a system that rewarded citizens who were caught using proper receptacles to dispose of their trash in city streets.

Born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Baseball career =Minor leagues= Nichols was 27 years of age when he broke into professional baseball in 1925. Pitching for the New Haven Profs of the higher-level Eastern League‚Äîa team then owned by future Baseball Hall of Fame executive George M. Weiss‚ÄîNichols won 15 games, lost 20, and compiled a 2.93 earned run average in 43 games and 304 innings of work. The following year, he was more successful, winning 13 and losing six, with an ERA of 2.37.Baseball Reference =Major Leagues= He earned a promotion all the way to the National League Pirates, where he appeared in three games as a relief pitcher between July 30 and August 4, 1926, but posted a poor 8.22 ERA. Pittsburgh sent Nichols back to New Haven, where in 1927, he won six of ten decisions and sported an earned run average well below 3.0 at 2.60. But in a second trial with the Pirates, who were headed for the National League pennant, Nichols again fared poorly. He pitched in eight games, all in relief, lost all three of his decisions, and put up a mediocre 5.86 earned run average (which, unfortunately, would be the best ERA of his MLB career). His last appearance in a Buc uniform came on July 23, two months before the Pirates played in the 1927 World Series. Nichols was drafted by another contending club, John McGraw's New York Giants, that off- season, but turned out to be the worst season of his major league career. Nichols allowed 13 runs (seven earned) and 11 hits in only three games and 2 innings. He spent part of 1928 and all of 1929 in the minor leagues with the Montreal Royals of the top-level International League. Then, in October 1929, he was selected in the Rule 5 draft by the tail-ending Philadelphia Phillies. The campaign would be Nichols' only full year in Major League Baseball, and it was an historic season for his ball club. The 1930 Phillies batted .315 as a team; they featured two batters who hit over .380‚ÄîHall of Famer Chuck Klein (.386) and Lefty O'Doul (.383)‚Äîand scored 944 runs. But their pitching staff allowed 1,199 runs of their own, and posted a horrendous 6.71 earned run average.Baseball Reference, 1930 Philadelphia Phillies season statistics The Phillies finished 52‚Äì102 and dead last in the National League. Nichols worked in 26 games for the 1930 Phillies, and compiled a 1‚Äì2 won‚Äìlost record with a 6.79 earned run average. He made the only five starts of his big-league career, and on June 17 recorded his only complete game and only victory in a major league uniform, defeating the Pirates 5‚Äì4 at the Baker Bowl, going all ten innings on the mound.Retrosheet box score (17 June 1930): \\"Philadelphia Phillies 5, Pittsburgh Pirates 4 (10 innings)\\" The following year saw Nichols appear mostly for the St. Paul Saints of the American Association, although he was treated roughly in three July games during another trial with the Phillies. In , Nichols got into the last 11 games of his pro career, all as a relief pitcher for the Phillies. He dropped two more decisions, but earned his only MLB save (not then an official statistic) on April 25 against the Boston Braves.Retrosheet box score (25 April 1932): \\"Philadelphia Phillies 4, Boston Braves 3\\" His final professional game came in a Philadelphia uniform on May 29; he was the losing pitcher in relief in a contest against the Giants. All told, Nichols posted a 1‚Äì8 won‚Äìlost record as a big-leaguer, with a 7.19 career earned run average. He allowed 167 hits and 56 bases on balls, with 33 strikeouts, in 122 innings pitched. However, his son, Chet Jr. (1931‚Äì1995), would enjoy a degree of success during his nine-season MLB pitching career (1951, 1954‚Äì1956, and 1960‚Äì1964), winning 34 games and, as a rookie, becoming the earned run average champion of the National League.

French service Pi√©montaise was built by Enterprise √âtheart at Saint Malo to a design by Fran√ßois Pastel. On 18 December 1805 she sailed from Brest for √éle de France.

On 6 September, she captured the 14-gun East India Company brig Grappler, the three-masted country ship Atomany, and the East Indiaman . Between September and October 1807, Pi√©montaise captured Caroline, Eggleton or Eggleson, master, Sarah, Henderson, master, , James, master, Udny, Walteas or Wallis, master, Danneberg or Danesburgh or Castel Dansborg, Winter, master, Highland Chief, Mahapice or Makepiece, master, Eliza, Sparkes, master, and Calcutta.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4243.Asiatic Annual Register, Vol. 10, p.123.

The value of the prize was 215,930.24 francs. In early March 1808, Pi√©montaise captured three more merchantmen off Southern India. Capture On 6 March 1808, she encountered HMS St Fiorenzo.NAVAL HISTORY of GREAT BRITAIN - Vol V The two ships battled for three days until Pi√©montaise, out of ammunition and having suffered heavy casualties, had to strike her colours on 8 March. The evening before she struck, Lieutenant de vaisseau Charles Moreau, who had been severely wounded, threw himself into the sea. Captain Hardinge, of St Fiorenzo, was killed in the fighting on the last day. Over the three days the British suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. The French suffered some 48 dead and 112 wounded. Lieutenant William Dawson took command and brought both vessels back to Colombo, even though Pi√©montaise's three masts fell over her side early in the morning of 9 March. Pi√©montaise had on board British army officers and captains and officers from prizes that she had taken. These men helped organize the lascars to jury-rig masts and bring Pi√©montaise into port. St Fiorenzo had too few men, too many casualties, and too many prisoners to guard to provide much assistance. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"San Fiorenzo 8 March 1808\\" to any surviving claimants from the action. British service The British brought Pi√©montaise into service as HMS Piedmontaise, commissioning her under Captain Charles Foote. From May to August 1810, she took part in the successful expedition to the Banda Islands, along with and . The expedition also included . Foote died in September and Commander Henry D. Dawson replaced him, only to die shortly thereafter. Piedmontaises next captain was T. Epworth, who was replaced in turn by Captain Henry Edgell.

Retrieved 25-02-2014. Saifi became widely known when he was identified as one of the kidnappers who abducted in 2003 a group of 32 tourists, most of them German, in Algeria. It was then that the Algerian government claimed that the former military agent had switched sides and defected. After the hostages were released in two groups - one liberated by the Algerian army, the other against ransom - Saifi and 50 of his men allegedly left northern Mali and were pursued through Niger by combined Algerian and Malian forces into northern Chad. In March 2004, Saifi was captured by the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a Chadian rebel group. The MDJT leaders tried to have him sent to Germany to stand trial, but finally handed him over to the Algerian secret services in October 2004. In June 2005, the Algerian government announced that he had been sentenced to life imprisonment.\\"Algerian rebel gets life sentence.\\" BBC (25 June 2005). An investigation by Le Monde diplomatique assured in 2005 that Saifi was not a true Islamist but an agent of the Algerian government who staged a false flag attack by kidnapping the tourists. The British writer Jeremy Keenan elaborated on this theory since 2006, speculating that the supposed presence of (false) Islamist extremist terror elements in southern Algeria would allow the US to broaden their counterterrorist agreements with several Sahel countries.Jeremy Keenan: \\"The Collapse of the Second Front,\\" Foreign Policy In Focus (September 26, 2006).

Different local authorities also have the powers to impose on-the-spot fines to those caught littering. These are generally under ¬£100. Legal Cases are heard in the Magistrates' Court. Approximately 400 people in the UK were prosecuted in 2003 by the police for littering. Alternatively, in some areas offenders could receive a ¬£80 fixed penalty fine for littering from the local authority litter warden. The offence of leaving litter (section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990) says that if a person drops, throws deposits or leaves anything so as to cause defacement in a public place, they could be committing a littering offence. The same applies to litter thrown from cars. Police officers or litter wardens are empowered and trained to deal with offenders. It is also possible for the public to report information about littering incidents to the police, the local authority or a litter warden, who would then decide whether or not they wish to proceed any further. Whilst it is possible to take out a private prosecution, it would be at a person's own expense, and strong evidence would be needed in court to secure a conviction. In 2018, data released through Freedom of Information requests showed that fewer than half of all fixed penalty notices issued by Scottish councils were paid.

Plot summary Erica and Brian Tate are a seemingly happy and successful academic couple. At least, Brian Tate is successful:Chapter 12 begins \\"on a Monday afternoon in December\\" of the first year of the novel, which runs from March of one year to May of another. In this chapter, Erica complains to her friend Danielle about how much she hates living in 1969. In the last chapter, Brian notes that New York State has just passed a liberal law legalizing abortion; this pinpoints 1970. he is the holder of the endowed Sayles Chair of Political Science at Corinth University in upstate New York. As he reaches his mid-40s, he begins to undergo a midlife crisis. He is an admirer and scholar of the work of George Kennan, the diplomat who devised President Harry Truman's policy of containment of the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Brian, meanwhile, ends up helping a group of young women (he is attracted in particular to one, the beautiful young student Jenny) who want to protest the sexist attitudes of Professor Dibble, a highly conservative colleague in Brian's department. Brian ends up futilely attempting to support both sides in this battle, to his own discomfiture. In the war between men and women, as in other wars, when the two sides are extremely polarized, there can be no middle ground though there are contradictions on both sides. The War Between the Tates as a roman √† clef When The War Between the Tates was published in 1974, Lurie was a part-time adjunct teaching English at Cornell University (she later became the second woman to be awarded tenure at Cornell) where her husband was a full professor. The fictional Corinth University, with its setting of creeks flowing through deep gorges, gracious but not always comfortable academic buildings, and its shabby college town, is obviously modeled on Cornell. In a 2005 interview in the Cornell Chronicle, Lurie maintained that her novel had been a composite: > The events in The War Between the Tates, her 1974 roman √† clef of the > marital (and extramarital) travails of a professor and his wife, 'happened > to people I know, but it happened at three different universities.'\\"the > Cornell News Service, September 2005 Nearly 25 years later, her colleague, > Jonathan Culler, jokingly mentioned the fear in the Cornell English > department that she might write a sequel to The War Between the Tates.See > July 1998 Cornell Chronicle. Lurie's novel, in fact, is only loosely based on the real people and events of the tumultuous 1960s, and her characters are the more devastating for being types rather than recognizable portraits. Although she was at Cornell during the famous protests by black students in April 1969, the topics dealt with in her book are feminism, the woes of parenthood, infidelity, and academic pomposity not race relations.In April 1969, there was a takeover of the Student Union Willard Straight Hall at Cornell by group of militant African Americans, some of whom displayed guns (though they were not used). Conservatives even today fault the administration for negotiating with SDS, the student organization, and acceding to some of their demands, a course of action that hardliners consider a mortal wound administered to institutional authority and a cultural turning point in the 1960s (see, for example, Donald Downs, Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University, Cornell University Press, 1999). At the time, some Cornell professors and students, particularly in government or political science, left Cornell (e.g. Allan Bloom and his proteg√© Alan Keyes, a black conservative, who followed Bloom to Paris) because they thought that the source of \\"power\\" in the university had now shifted from the authorities to the students, thereby fatally compromising professorial dignity. The depression and subsequent suicide of another political science professor, Clinton Rossiter, who stayed, has also been linked to the event. At the fictional \\"Corinth\\", instead exists a very funny takeover of the office of political science Professor Dibble by his irate female students. The character of Dibble, a reactionary and sexist with a heart condition, is thought to be based on the young Allen Bloom. In the novel, the character Dibble is outraged because the administration has failed to call for military assistance to deal with the protesters, in his mind thereby compromising \\"professorial dignity\\". The only (somewhat oblique) reference in the novel to the student takeover at Cornell occurs when the women protesters are depicted as being inspired by thoughts of what black students might do in a takeover situation similar to theirs. In The War Between the Tates, moreover, the repercussions are strictly personal, Brian Tate's, not Dibble's, professorial pomposity is punctured. Tate gets mixed up in the demonstration, at first on the side of the women, and then by unadvisedly trying to rescue his colleague, the terrified Dibble, from their blockade of his office. Some of Tate's mixed motivations are described this way: > Brian felt some sympathy for Jenny's cause. After all, Dibble probably had > made some foolishly unprofessional remarks. He was a boor and a reactionary > and Brian's longstanding enemy [Brian is a liberal], while Jenny was a > beautiful young girl who admired him and would be grateful if he helped her > to defeat their common enemy; Brian had already imagined some of the forms > this gratitude might take.Alison Lurie, The War Between the Tates ( New > York: Avon Books [1974] 1971), p. 282. Tate's attempt to help Dibble escape out of the window goes hilariously awry and attracts a large crowd. When Tate is discovered trapped together with Dibble, everyone mistakenly assumes that the demonstration was aimed at him and not Dibble, thus Tate inadvertently acquires the reputation of sexism, while Dibble, who really is a sexist, ironically escapes with no consequences. Dibble then resigns from the university in high dudgeon. Brian Tate becomes a symbol because he is photographed and appears this way in the media. He becomes a figure attracting support and opprobrium for views that he does not, in fact, hold, as the imagery of \\"culture wars\\" takes over people's attention.

History The Amherstburg Echo was founded in November 1874 by William D. Balfour and John A. Auld. The first home of the Amherstburg Echo was in a building on the west side of Ramsay Street. Balfour was elected Speaker of the Legislature in 1894 and Provincial Secretary two years later. He died on August 19, 1896 just two weeks after assuming his duties there. Shortly thereafter, Arthur Marsh of the Essex Free Press joined the Amherstburg Echo as John Auld's partner. Thus began the involvement of the Marsh family, which lasted for 85 years. As the paper grew in size and stature, a more modern facility was required. Shortly after arriving here Arthur married Bessie Hicks and they raised a son and a daughter, John and Helen. Arthur served as co-editor of the paper and served as president of the Canadian Weekly Newspaper Association. Prominent architect J.C. Pennington was hired to draw up plans and in 1915 the Echo moved into its new building on the west side of Dalhousie Street. Arthur Marsh's 23-year-old son John, a recent graduate of McGill University, joined his father at the paper after Auld's death in 1924. The Marshes were the recipient of many awards for excellence throughout the years proved its stature, as did letters of admiration from other weeklies. When Arthur Marsh was fatally injured in an automobile accident in 1940, his daughter Helen left her teaching career at Amherstburg Public School behind and joined her brother John Marsh at the paper, John taking over as editor. John's column, \\"With the Tide\\", commented on his passions for historical conservation, including Fort Malden's restoration. Helen advocated for women's rights in the weekly, including her widely read ‚ÄúConversation Pieces‚Äù column which is significant as a social history of Amherstburg from 1940 to 1980. In 1981 John, then 80 years old, sold The Amherstburg Echo to John and Linda James. Both John and Helen continued to write a column for a few years after the sale before settling into retirement. John and Helen Marsh helped found the Marsh Collection Society, a local history centre where many have come and continue to come to research the history of the area. James owned the Echo until the early 1990s when he sold the Echo and its historic location at 238 Dalhousie St. to Bowes Publishers Limited, which eventually became part of Sun Media. In October 2012, the Echo was closed by Sun Media,http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2012/10/23/amherstburg- echo-shutters-its-presses/ who announced it would increase Amherstburg coverage in its recently launched Windsor This Week paper.

They recorded the \\"Sun Carriage / Determined\\" demo 7\\" (written by Ron Price; a very rare vinyl with only about ten pressed) for the fledgling Head Records run by Jeff Barrett (later the founder of Heavenly). With principal songwriter Watts, the line up evolved to include Bex who had originally drummed in Loop and Sarah Wills on bass. Sun Carriage toured with Loop throughout the UK and supported various bands of the time such as House Of Love, Spacemen 3, Lush and even Happy Mondays. Bex was later replaced by Michael Ryan on drums, and soon after Chris Leech left, leaving the band as a trio of Watts, Ryan and Wills for the rest of its natural life. Their music combined the artful influences of David Bowie with a bit of the pre-grunge and rock 'n roll/garage of Iggy Pop and the Stooges, some of the heaviness of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath plus Neil Young and a dash of early Roxy Music, to name a but a few, often at a slug-like pace reminiscent of the Melvins and a similar rawness to (then) early Nirvana.

After succeeding his uncle Eliya XII Denha in 1780 as patriarch of Mosul, he made a Catholic profession of faith and was recognised in 1783 by the Vatican as patriarchal administrator and archbishop of Mosul. His career as patriarchal administrator was controversial, and was marked by a series of conflicts with his own bishops and also with the Vatican. Suspended from his functions in 1812 and again in 1818, he was reinstated by the Vatican in 1828. In 1830, following the death of the Amid patriarchal administrator Augustine Hindi, he was recognised by the Vatican as patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans and the Mosul and Amid patriarchates were united under his leadership. This event marked the birth of the since unbroken patriarchal line of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Yohannan Hormizd died in 1838 and his successor Nicholas I Zaya was chosen by the Vatican, ending the centuries-old practice of hereditary succession in the Eliya line of the Church of the East. Sources Yohannan Hormizd's career, first as patriarchal administrator and finally as patriarch, was dogged by disputes. Most of the surviving contemporary accounts of his patriarchate are partisan, and must be used with care. Yohannan Hormizd himself wrote a polemical autobiography in Syriac, a fragment of which (breaking off in 1795) was translated into English by the Anglican missionary George Percy Badger and reproduced in his classic 1852 study of the Church of the East, The Nestorians and Their Rituals.Badger, Nestorians, i. 150‚Äì60 His opponents responded with an equally intemperate history of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd under the headship of Gabriel Dambo of Mardin (1775‚Äì1832), which was published in a French translation by M. Bri√®re in 1910 and 1911.Bri√®re, 'Histoire du couvent de Rabban Hormizd', ROC, 15 (1910) and 16 (1911) Both texts provide spirited accounts of the intrigues that followed Yohannan's election as patriarch in 1780. Neither can be trusted on matters of interpretation, but if read judiciously they shed valuable light on the politics of the Chaldean Church in the late eighteenth- and early- nineteenth centuries and provide a wealth of factual detail omitted in many accounts of this period. The partisan spirit of the contemporary accounts was reflected in the texts of several later Chaldean authors, notably Giamil and Tfinkdji. Stephane Bello, writing in 1939 with access to the Vatican archives, was the first scholar to write a dispassionate account of Yohannan Hormizd's career. He has been followed more recently by Habbi. Much of the recent scholarship on Yohannan Hormizd is in French or German, but convenient English summaries of his career were made by David Wilmshurst in 2000 and by Christoph Baumer in 2006.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 28‚Äì32; Baumer, Church of the East, 250‚Äì1 In 2003 Wilhelm Baum and Dietmar Winkler devoted three paragraphs to Yohannan Hormizd.Baum and Winkler, Church of the East, 121‚Äì2 Background By 1760 the Church of the East had become divided into three patriarchates: * The largest and oldest Patriarchal See was based at the Rabban Hormizd monastery of Alqosh, near Mosul. It spread from Aqrah up to Seert and Nisibis, covering the South rich plain of Mosul (it is known also as Eliya line). Since the 15th century, its Patriarchs belonged to the Bar Mama (or Abuna) family and they were appointed through a strict hereditary system: the old patriarch chose one of his nephews (or sometimes his young brother), and consecrated him as metropolitan bishop with right of succession. The nephew was known as natar kursi (designated successor). In 1760 the patriarch of this See was Eliya XII (or XI) Denkha, the uncle of Yohannan Hormizd. * In 1681, the patriarchal See of Amid became independent and made a formal union with Rome (it is also known as the Josephite line). This See included a few towns such as Amid and Mardin in the North-West Mountains, which are now in Turkey. In 1760 the patriarch was Joseph IV Lazar Hindi, a relative of Augustine Hindi. The patriarchate struggled with financial difficulties due to the tax burden imposed by the Turkish authorities. * The third patriarchal See was located in Qochanis and extended into the North East Mountains (also known as the Shimun line). This patriarchal line began in 1553 when Mar Yohannan Sulaqa was consecrated bishop by the Pope, but soon became independent of Rome and still survives in the denomination today known as Assyrian Church of the East Early life Church in Mosul about 1850 According to his autobiography, Yohannan Hormizd was born in 1760 in Alqosh to an Assyrian family. His father, the deacon Hanna (Yohannan), was the brother of the Mosul patriarch Eliya XII Denha (1722‚Äì78).Badger, Nestorians, i. 150 The Vatican opened a correspondence with both the Mosul and Qochanis patriarchs in 1770. At this period hereditary succession (normally from uncle to nephew as the patriarchs themselves remained celibate) was in force in both patriarchates. Eliya XII Denha had consecrated his nephew Ishoyahb a metropolitan in 1745 and had also bestowed upon him the traditional title natar kursya ('guardian of the throne'), thereby designating him his presumptive successor. Eliya XII and his nephew Ishoyahb both made Catholic professions of faith in 1771 in response to this overture from the Vatican, and Pope Clement XIV wrote to Eliya on 12 December 1772 to commend his zeal and to urge him to bring over his people to Catholicism. Earlier in the same year, however, Eliya had deposed Ishoyahb from his metropolitan rank, apparently alarmed by his ambition, and ordained the twelve-year-old Yohannan Hormizd, another nephew, as a deacon. Four years later, on 22 May 1776, Yohannan was consecrated a metropolitan by Eliya XII Denha and named natar kursya in his turn. If his uncle had lived a few years longer, Yohannan's succession would probably have been assured, but the patriarch was among the victims of a plague which swept through the Mosul district in 1778, and died in the village of Alqosh on 29 April 1778.Badger, Nestorians, i. 150‚Äì1  Irregular patriarchal succession, 1780‚Äì83  On the following day his nephews Ishoyahb and Yohannan both made Catholic professions of faith and were reconciled. Despite the late patriarch's preference the Latin missionaries supported Ishoyahb, who shortly afterwards succeeded his uncle as patriarch, taking the name Eliya XIII Ishoyahb, without open opposition from the young Yohannan. In May 1779, as soon as he had obtained his firman of office from the Ottoman civil authorities, Ishoyahb abandoned his Catholic profession of faith. The notables of Mosul, with the support of the Latin missionaries, deposed him and unanimously chose Shemon of Amid, the Chaldean metropolitan of Mardin (1758‚Äì88), as patriarch in his place. Shemon however declined to accept the honour, and Ishoyahb's opponents were obliged to turn instead to the young Yohannan Hormizd, who had demonstrated his zeal for the Catholic cause since Ishoyahb's volte face by converting the Nestorians of the large Erbil villages of A√Ønqawa, Armuta and Shaqlawa to Catholicism and encouraging them to withdraw their loyalty from his cousin. Yohannan was elected patriarch in 1780, and his supporters bribed the governor of Mosul to use his influence to obtain a firman from Constantinople, granting him authority over both the Chaldean Christians and the Nestorians. Yohannan then sent a profession of faith and a letter of submission to the Vatican.Badger, Nestorians, i. 152 The Vatican was placed in a dilemma by this turn of events. If Yohannan's profession of faith was genuine, he might be the Catholic patriarch of Babylon the Vatican had long been hoping for, and his confirmation would be rapidly followed by the adoption of Catholicism by all the villages of the Mosul patriarchate. On the other hand, to confirm Yohannan's election would be to condone the distasteful practice of hereditary succession. There was also the possibility that Yohannan's submission was no more sincere than Ishoyahb's had been two years earlier. The Vatican's initial response was therefore to inform Raphael Terconuski, the superior of the Catholic mission at Mosul, that Yohannan Hormizd's profession of faith appeared to be satisfactory, but that his election was to be considered null. On 18 February 1783, having considered further, the Sacred Congregation decided to appoint Yohannan archbishop of Mosul and administrator of the patriarchate of Babylon, granting him all the necessary powers to that end except the title and the insignia of the patriarch.Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 11‚Äì14  Patriarchal administrator and archbishop of Mosul, 1783‚Äì1830  = Honeymoon period, 1783‚Äì1801 = For the next eight years Yohannan Hormizd seemed to justify the hopes placed in him. He lived on amicable terms with the Catholic missionaries and devoted his energies to the conversion to Catholicism of the villages under his authority. In May 1790, on the advice of the missionaries, he consecrated his nephew Shemon metropolitan, and in August of the same year sent him to the Zibar district, where he converted the Nestorian villages of Arena and Barzane.Badger, Nestorians, i. 155 The following year he sent Shemon to Mengesh in the Sapna district, where he was equally successful. The high point of this honeymoon period came in February 1791, when the Vatican appointed him patriarchal administrator of the Amid patriarchate, recalling Lazar Hindi to Rome to leave him a free hand. This appointment led to strenuous protests from Lazar Hindi, his vicar-general Joseph Attar and the clergy of Amid, and on 3 February 1793 Yohannan Hormizd's appointment was rescinded. At about the same time the Mosul missionaries began to report disquieting rumours about his performance of his duties. He was said, among other things, to have released a monk from his vows for a payment of 73 piastres, to have used liturgical books full of errors, to have visited families without a companion, and to have feasted in the house of a newly-wed couple. Although each of these incidents was relatively minor in itself, and could equally have been explained by mere imprudence rather than active corruption, their frequency was disturbing. For his part, Yohannan accused the missionaries of arrogance and mischief-making, and on his request the apostolic vicar of Baghdad, Fulgence de Sainte Marie, was sent to Mosul as apostolic vicar in 1796 to report on the situation.Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 12‚Äì13 While his relations with the Vatican were cooling, Yohannan Hormizd also had to deal with the opposition of his cousin Ishoyahb, who continued to assert that he was the rightful patriarch. After Yohannan's irregular election in 1780 Ishoyahb withdrew to Amadiya, whose governor Isma'il gave him 'the Nestorian dioceses of the mountain' to govern. He made another Catholic profession of faith on 7 April 1783 in an attempt to regain the sympathies of the missionaries, and to preserve the patriarchate within his family consecrated his nephew Hnanisho metropolitan in 1784. Several years of bitter faction-fighting followed, in which the civil authorities in Baghdad held the balance between Muhammad, governor of Mosul, who supported Yohannan Hormizd, and Isma'il, governor of Amadiya, who sheltered Ishoyahb and his followers. In 1788 Yohannan's nephew Shemon was arrested on a visit to the village of Bir Sivi in the Zakho district on Isma'il's orders, and was only released by the joint efforts of the governor of Mosul and Sulaiman, governor of Baghdad.Badger, Nestorians, i. 153 In 1792 Yohannan and his two brothers went to Amadiya on business, and were arrested, beaten and imprisoned for three and a half months by the Turkish authorities. Again, the governor of Baghdad intervened to secure their release.Badger, Nestorians, i. 156 = First clash with the Vatican, 1802 = Yohannan's precarious relations with the Vatican survived a further test in 1801, only to sink further in 1802. In 1796 a delegation from the Malabar Christians arrived in Mosul and begged him to consecrate a bishop for them. Yohannan punctiliously wrote to the Vatican for guidance, but as Rome was then under French occupation he did not receive a reply, and in 1798 consecrated the Indian priest Paul Pandari as a bishop for the Malabar Christians. As many of the Malabar Christians were now in communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church, which had replaced the Church of the East as the main focus of loyalty among the Syrian Christians of India three centuries earlier, Yohannan tactfully appointed Pandari bishop 'of Mar Behnam', a celebrated West Syrian monastery near Mosul. The Malabar Christians informed the Vatican of Pandari's arrival in India in a letter of 17 January 1800, and Yohannan was asked to account for his actions.Puliurumpil, A Period of Jurisdictional Conflict in the Suriani Church of India, 2‚Äì50 His explanation was accepted, and in a general consistory of 23 September 1801 the possibility of appointing him patriarch of Babylon was considered.Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 14‚Äì15 Unfortunately for Yohannan, his position was immediately undermined by renewed complaints from a section of the Chaldean church. On this occasion his opponents, supported by the Latin missionaries, impugned his orthodoxy and accused him of embezzling monastic property. In 1802 the priest Yohannan Mushe of Tel Isqof was despatched to Rome with letters demanding the dismissal of both Yohannan and his nephew Shemon, metropolitan of Amadiya. He had only sufficient funds to reach Saida in Syria, where he entrusted the letter to the missionary Leopold Sebastien, who was leaving for Rome. The letters do not seem to have produced any immediate effect, but doubtless added to the concern in the Vatican about Yohannan Hormizd's reliability. = Increasing opposition, 1802‚Äì12 = The monastery of Rabban Hormizd, Alqosh Some years later Yohannan Hormizd faced another challenge to his authority from a Baghdad merchant named Gabriel Dambo, one of the most remarkable figures of the nineteenth century Chaldean church. A Chaldean Christian born in Mardin in 1775, Dambo had made sufficient money by middle age to be able to retire from business, and he decided to devote the rest of his life to the service of the Church. The once-thriving monastery of Rabban Hormizd near Alqosh had been abandoned for many years, and he dreamed of reviving its monastic life and restoring it to its former glory. He paved the way by giving free lessons in Baghdad to young Chaldean Christians in Arabic, grammar, logic and rhetoric, and after winning a formidable reputation as a teacher and scholar moved to Mosul. In 1808 he had no difficulty in persuading the Chaldean authorities and their Catholic missionary advisers to allow him to establish a seminary in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd. Before long he collected a number of pupils, who were vowed to poverty and celibacy, and was appointed lay superior of the seminary. An energetic and charismatic visionary, Gabriel had his own ideas of how things should be done, and had little patience with the leaders of the Chaldean Church. If the new seminary was to succeed it needed its own income, and Gabriel insisted, probably correctly, that a large proportion of the property then in the hands of the patriarchal family was originally owned by the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and should rightly revert to it. Yohannan Hormizd, understandably, did not agree. This single issue would have been sufficient to poison relations between the two men, but there were other causes of friction as well. The new seminary had attracted men who disliked Yohannan Hormizd and wanted more vigorous leadership. The monks rallied around their superior and made no secret of their distaste for the patriarchal administrator. They were joined by the Catholic missionaries, who shared their admiration for Gabriel, and by a number of influential priests, notably Yohannan of Tel Isqof and Yohannan of Alqosh. In 1809 the Vatican seriously considered the possibility of suspending Yohannan Hormizd, and rumours that he had indeed been suspended were circulated by his opponents, eliciting a spirited letter of protest to the Vatican by his supporters on 15 October 1811. Yohannan Hormizd's opponents were eventually able to win over the pasha of Mosul to their side, who briefly imprisoned him. The missionaries, led by the priest Joseph Campanile, immediately took steps to replace him, and Campanile on his own authority consecrated the priest Shemon Sayyegh bishop of Mosul. He was later reproved by the Vatican for this abusive consecration, and Augustine Hindi was ordered to send Shemon to Mosul merely as a priest. At the same time, learning of Yohannan Hormizd's imprisonment, the Vatican appointed Augustine Hindi apostolic delegate and the priest Giwargis of Alqosh apostolic vicar of Mosul, 'during the absence of the said archbishop', on 4 October 1811. This decision sent a clear signal that the Vatican's patience with Yohannan Hormizd was, for the moment, almost at an end. = Suspension and Reinstatement, 1812‚Äì30 = Yohannan Hormizd was eventually ransomed by his supporters and returned to Mosul, where he had several of his opponents imprisoned. After a series of mutual recriminations, the Rabban Hormizd monks and the Catholic missionaries wrote jointly to the Propaganda calling for Yohannan's deposition, alleging that he was opposed to their order, that he incited the Kurds of Isma'il Pasha against them, and that he was endeavouring to lead the Chaldean proselytes back to Nestorianism. The Vatican was alarmed at these charges and on 15 February 1812 suspended Yohannan from his functions as archbishop of Mosul and patriarchal administrator and appointed Shemon Sayyegh apostolic vicar for Mosul and the priest Giwargis of Alqosh apostolic vicar for the patriarchate of Babylon. Both men were placed under the direct authority of Augustine Hindi, who was named apostolic delegate for the affairs of the patriarchate of Babylon. While this decision temporarily placed the two Catholic patriarchates under a single trustworthy authority, it was from the Vatican's point of view little more than a makeshift, as Hindi could never command the same prestige in the Mosul district as a member of the old patriarchal family.Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 16‚Äì18 Yohannan Hormizd's suspension lasted for six years. At first he refused to accept the validity of the Vatican's decision, and issued threats against his opponents. Eventually he decided to seek a reconciliation with them, and a meeting was held on 20 February 1818 at Alqosh, attended by a hundred clergymen and notables, in which he agreed to apologise in writing for his misdeeds. In return, the assembly decided to send a letter to the Vatican to ask for his suspension to be lifted. Unfortunately, these good intentions were frustrated, as the letter's courier was killed en route and the letter never reached its destination. The Vatican, ignorant of the rapprochement between Yohannan Hormizd and his opponents, was briefed on the affairs of the Chaldean Church early in 1818 by Campanile, who is unlikely to have placed a sympathetic construction on Yohannan Hormizd's previous record. The Sacred Congregation concluded that Yohannan Hormizd had not taken his suspension seriously, and on 24 May 1818 it was renewed. The appointments of Augustine Hindi and Giwargis of Alqosh were renewed by briefs of 26 June 1818, and Yohannan Hormizd was informed of the new sentence in a latter of 11 July 1818.Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 391‚Äì4; Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 18 and 66‚Äì9 Once again, Yohannan refused to accept the validity of the sentence, and for the next few years continued to assert his authority wherever he could, abetted by the civil authorities at Amadiya. The Rabban Hormizd monks refused to have anything to do with him and accepted the authority of Augustine Hindi (the colophon of manuscripts copied in the monastery at this period dutifully mention the patriarchal administrator Mar Augustine, not Mar Yohannan). Three monks of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd were consecrated metropolitan bishops at Amid by Hindi in March 1825: the future patriarch Joseph Audo for Mosul, Lawrent Shoa for Baghdad, and Basil Asmar for Amadiya. Two other bishops perhaps consecrated on the same occasion, Mikha'il Kattula and Ignatius Dashto, were sent to Seert and Mardin, traditional sees of the Amid patriarchate, but the other three returned to their home villages north of Mosul; Basil Asmar to Telkepe, Lawrent Shoa to Tel Isqof and Joseph Audo to Alqosh. There each of the three metropolitans began ordaining priests and deacons, in a direct challenge to Yohannan's authority.Badger, Nestorians, i. 163 Meanwhile, the Vatican reconsidered the condemnation of Yohannan Hormizd in the light of fresh information, and on 25 November 1826 publicly absolved him. At the same time, to restore the peace of the Chaldean Church, it urged the 66-year-old former patriarchal administrator to renounce his claims to the archdiocese of Mosul and to retire quietly. Yohannan, vindicated by the Vatican's absolution and supported by the local civil authorities, stubbornly refused to retire. Instead, he fought back against his opponents. In 1827, during the absence of the superior Gabriel Dambo in Rome, a number of monks in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd rebelled against its administrator Yohannan Gwera, who enjoyed the support of the metropolitan Joseph Audo. Yohannan Hormizd upheld the rebels, and was also able to have Basil Asmar expelled from Telkepe, forcing him to take refuge in Amid. On 3 April 1827, shortly after Basil's arrival, Augustine Hindi died at Amid and was buried in a cemetery outside the city's walls. His death ended the 146-year independent existence of the Amid patriarchate. Basil Asmar, who had endeared himself to the clergy and people of Amid, was appointed Hindi's successor as metropolitan of Amid in 1828, and the Vatican confirmed the appointment. Amid reverted to a metropolitan diocese of the Chaldean Church, and the Amid patriarchate came to an end. Basil's appointment required a bishop to be found for the see of Amadiya, and as Joseph Audo had failed to overcome the opposition of Yohannan's supporters to his appointment of metropolitan of Mosul, Gabriel Dambo and the Catholic missionaries agreed that he should be reassigned to Amadiya. Like Basil before him, however, he declined to trust his life to the good faith of Isma'il Pasha, and withdrew to Alqosh, where he continued to intrigue among the Chaldeans and with the local authorities of Mosul against Yohannan. As a result of these intrigues Yohannan was imprisoned for a third time by the Ottoman authorities, for four months.Badger, Nestorians, i. 163‚Äì4 After Yohannan's release the charges made by his opponents were investigated by the Latin apostolic vicar Pierre- Alexander Coupperie, who travelled to Mosul to interview him. Yohannan was absolved of blame and restored to the exercise of his jurisdiction. Gabriel Dambo was then in Rome, to lobby more effectively against his rival, and he and his supporters declared Coupperie's decision invalid and insisted that they would not accept Yohannan's authority unless he was absolved personally by the pope. Coupperie therefore persuaded a number of influential Chaldeans to join him in a written appeal to the Vatican for Yohannan's reinstatement.Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 22  Patriarch of Babylon, 1830‚Äì8  Couperrie died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded as apostolic vicar by his assistant Laurent Trioche, who was consecrated a bishop for the purpose by Yohannan and the metropolitan Lawrent Shoa of Kirkuk on the Vatican's instructions. Like his predecessor, Trioche took Yohannan's part, and in a consistory held in the Vatican on 5 July 1830 it was agreed that Yohannan should be relieved of the archdiocese of Mosul, confirmed as patriarch of the Chaldeans and awarded the pallium (the traditional symbol of the Vatican's recognition of his succession).Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 394‚Äì5 The decision was communicated to Yohannan Hormizd, now aged 74, in two papal bulls of the same date.Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 396‚Äì9; Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 22 Fifty years after his irregular succession to Eliya XII Denha, Yohannan Hormizd was finally recognised as patriarch of the Chaldean Church and awarded the title patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans. The suppression of the Amid patriarchate and the union of the Chaldean dioceses under the patriarch of Babylon in 1830 marked the birth of the modern Chaldean Catholic Church. The new patriarch was awarded the pallium in a ceremony held in Baghdad on 6 April 1834. = Further troubles = According to Badger, Yohannan Hormizd was unhappy with the thought of the unbroken succession of the Eliya line ending with his death, and made a curious bargain with the Nestorian church in an attempt to continue the succession. He ordained his nephew Mansur Sefaro a priest, and in 1831 sent him to the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham (1820‚Äì61), who consecrated him at Urmi and appointed him metropolitan over the Nestorians of Amadiya. The new metropolitan took the name Eliya, the traditional name of the Chaldean patriarchs before the schism of 1552 (Yohannan's own family), and shortly afterwards abandoned the pretence of being a Nestorian and was readmitted into the Chaldean church, ultimately becoming the first Chaldean bishop of Aqra in 1852.Badger, Nestorians, i. 167‚Äì8 In spite of this account, it was presumably with the intention of excluding this nephew from being his successor that in 1837 Yohannan, aware that he had not long to live, designated Gregory Peter di Natale, metropolitan of Gazarta, as coadjutor and \\"guardian of the throne\\". The feud between Gabriel Dambo and Yohannan Hormizd ended in 1832, when Alqosh was pillaged by K√∂r Muhammad, chief of the Soran Kurds of Rawanduz. Gabriel Dambo was among the hundreds of East Syrians killed by the Kurds, and was succeeded as superior of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd by Yohannan Gwera. Despite the death of his chief rival, the patriarch's troubles continued throughout the 1830s. The monks of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd still refused to acknowledge his authority, and were supported by the metropolitan Joseph Audo, who now claimed jurisdiction over the monastery on the grounds that it lay within his diocese of Amadiya. Yohannan Hormizd retaliated by suspending Audo and a number of Rabban Hormizd monks, but this action had little effect. A rumour spread that a new Latin apostolic vicar had been appointed in Rome and was now on his way to Mosul, and the patriarch's enemies temporarily came into line to make a good first impression on this important official. But when after two months he had still not arrived, they resumed their duties in flat defiance of Yohannan's orders. One man only, a priest named Stephen, sent in his submission to the patriarch, and was appointed priest of Telkepe.Badger, Nestorians, i. 166 The patriarch now sent the metropolitan Gregory Peter di Natale to Mosul, accompanied by a priest named Andrew to represent the apostolic vicar Laurent Trioche, to inquire into the conduct of the Rabban Hormizd monks. Joseph Audo thereupon retired to Amid, where he was welcomed by its metropolitan Basil, and the delegates condemned the obstinacy of the monks and returned to Baghdad. In the light of this vindication of the patriarch's behaviour, an attempt was made by the monastery's superior Yohannan Gwera to put his side of the story. He travelled to Rome, accompanied by the monks Mikha'il Jammala and Peter, and eventually obtained a papal audience. The response of the Vatican authorities to the monks' complaints was lukewarm. They were assured that their allegations would be investigated but were also censured for their disobedience.Badger, Nestorians, i. 166‚Äì7; Bello, Congr√©gation de S. Hormisdas, 122‚Äì39 On 13 October 1837, conscious that he had not long to live, Yohannan designated as coadjutor and 'guardian of the throne' Gregory Peter di Natale, metropolitan of Gazarta, presumably with the intention of excluding his nephew Eliya from the patriarchal dignity. However, he did not promise the succession to his coadjutor, and in order to ensure that the hereditary principle would play no part in the selection of the next patriarch the Vatican appointed by a bull of 25 September 1838 Nicholas Zaya, metropolitan of Salmas, Yohannan's coadjutor with the right of succession.Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 400‚Äì1 The reason given in the bull for this decision was the growing infirmity of the patriarch and the desirability of avoiding inconvenience and harm should the patriarchate suddenly become vacant. Zaya was Persian by birth, from Khosrowa, and as such could lay claim to the protection of the foreign consuls in Turkey. He had also been educated at the Propaganda, and it was hoped that after Yohannan's death he would loyally implement Vatican policy. Yohannan, meanwhile, had died a few weeks earlier, on 16 August 1838. His family, which had provided successive patriarchs since the middle of the fifteenth century, now renounced its hereditary right of succession but insisted on keeping the title Abuna as the family name henceforward. Nicholas Zaya duly succeeded Yohannan Hormizd as patriarch, but the manner in which his succession had been arranged by the Vatican offended most of the Chaldean bishops, and Zaya's brief reign (1839‚Äì46) would prove to be as stormy as that of his predecessor.

Bush of the United States during the second term of his administration. Analogous to the President's use of an airplane designated Air Force One, the automobiletraditionally a limousineis informally known as \\"Cadillac One\\". The limousine model was replaced on January 20, 2009, upon the inauguration of President Barack Obama, although both models are still in use. Specifications and capabilities The model is a 2005 hand-crafted, custom built, heightened-roof, and armored vehicle designed with the styling of the Cadillac DTS sedan built on a GM four-wheel drive platform. The vehicle was custom built by Centigon (formerly O'Gara, Hess & Eisenhardt). It was first used on January 20, 2005, during the second inauguration parade of George W. Bush. Most details of the car are classified for security reasons. The vehicle is one of a kind. It sports a tall roofline, an all-wheel drive set up based on that of the Cadillac Escalade, red and blue emergency lights built into the front grille, and is fitted with red strobe lights in the headlights and rear brake lights. The standard door handles have been replaced by those of a more loop design. The vehicle is completely fitted with military grade armor thick for maximum protection. The windows do not open, the wheels are fitted with run flat tires, and five antennas are mounted on the trunk lid. Due to the thickness of the glass, much natural light is excluded, so a fluorescent halo lighting system in the headliner is essential. The car can seat seven people, including the President. The front seats two, and includes a console-mounted communications center. A glass partition divides the front from back. Three rear-facing seats are in the back, with cushions that are able to fold against the partition. The two rear seats are reserved for the president and another passenger; these seats have the ability to recline individually. A folding desk is between the two rear seats. Storage compartments in the interior panels of the car contain communications equipment. Use, 2005- On domestic trips, Cadillac One displays the American and presidential standard flags, which are illuminated by directional flood lights mounted on the hood. The limousine is airlifted for domestic and international use primarily by a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III. When the President performs a state visit to a foreign country, the presidential standard is replaced by the foreign country's flag. On May 23, 2011, the 2005 model presidential state car was involved in an incident when it got stuck on a ramp as it exited the U.S. Embassy in Dublin, Ireland, during an official visit by President Obama. It is understood that the wheelbase of the vehicle was too great for the ramp and it had to be towed off the ramp as a large crowd looked on. =Replacement= On January 6, 2009, it was announced that a new, model year 2009, modified Cadillac would be used during the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009. The model was replaced by the on that day. Both cars remain in the presidential fleet and the older model is occasionally used. The older model mainly serves as a backup to the primary vehicle.

There exist hyperelliptic curves of every genus g \\\\geq 1. If the genus of a hyperelliptic curve equals 1, we simply call the curve an elliptic curve. Hence we can see hyperelliptic curves as generalizations of elliptic curves. There is a well- known group structure on the set of points lying on an elliptic curve over some field K, which we can describe geometrically with chords and tangents. Generalizing this group structure to the hyperelliptic case is not straightforward. We cannot define the same group law on the set of points lying on a hyperelliptic curve, instead a group structure can be defined on the so-called Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. The computations differ depending on the number of points at infinity. This article is about imaginary hyperelliptic curves, these are hyperelliptic curves with exactly 1 point at infinity. Real hyperelliptic curves have two points at infinity.  Formal definition  Hyperelliptic curves can be defined over fields of any characteristic. Hence we consider an arbitrary field K and its algebraic closure \\\\overline{K}. An (imaginary) hyperelliptic curve of genus g over K is given by an equation of the form C : y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) \\\\in K[x,y] where h(x) \\\\in K[x] is a polynomial of degree not larger than g and f(x) \\\\in K[x] is a monic polynomial of degree 2g + 1. Furthermore, we require the curve to have no singular points. In our setting, this entails that no point (x,y) \\\\in \\\\overline{K} \\\\times \\\\overline{K} satisfies both y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) and the equations 2y + h(x) = 0 and h'(x)y = f'(x). This definition differs from the definition of a general hyperelliptic curve in the fact that f can also have degree 2g+2 in the general case. From now on we drop the adjective imaginary and simply talk about hyperelliptic curves, as is often done in literature. Note that the case g = 1 corresponds to f being a cubic polynomial, agreeing with the definition of an elliptic curve. If we view the curve as lying in the projective plane \\\\mathbb{P}^2(K) with coordinates (X:Y:Z), we see that there is a particular point lying on the curve, namely the point at infinity (1:0:0) denoted by O. So we could write C = \\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in K^2 y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) \\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ O \\\\\\\\} . Suppose the point P = (a,b) not equal to O lies on the curve and consider \\\\overline{P} = (a, -b-h(a)). As (-b-h(a))^2 + h(a)(-b-h(a)) can be simplified to b^2 +h(a) b, we see that \\\\overline{P} is also a point on the curve. \\\\overline{P} is called the opposite of P and P is called a Weierstrass point if P = \\\\overline{P}, i.e. h(a) = -2b. Furthermore, the opposite of O is simply defined as \\\\overline{O} = O. = Alternative definition = The definition of a hyperelliptic curve can be slightly simplified if we require that the characteristic of K is not equal to 2. To see this we consider the change of variables x \\\\rightarrow x and y \\\\rightarrow y - \\\\frac{h(x)}{2}, which makes sense if char(K) ot= 2. Under this change of variables we rewrite y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) to \\\\left(y - \\\\frac{h(x)}{2} \\\\right)^2 + h(x) \\\\left(y - \\\\frac{h(x)}{2}\\\\right) = f(x) which, in turn, can be rewritten to y^2 = f(x) + \\\\frac{h(x)^2}{4}. As \\\\deg(h) \\\\leq g we know that \\\\deg(h^2) \\\\leq 2g and hence f(x) + \\\\frac{h(x)^2}{4} is a monic polynomial of degree 2g + 1. This means that over a field K with char(K) ot= 2 every hyperelliptic curve of genus g is isomorphic to one given by an equation of the form C : y^2 = f (x) where f is a monic polynomial of degree 2g + 1 and the curve has no singular points. Note that for curves of this form it is easy to check whether the non-singularity criterion is met. A point P = (a,b) on the curve is singular if and only if b = 0 and f'(a) = 0. As b = 0 and b^2 = f(a) , it must be the case that f(a) = 0 and thus a is a multiple root of f . We conclude that the curve C : y^2 = f(x) has no singular points if and only if f has no multiple roots. Even though the definition of a hyperelliptic curve is quite easy when char(K) ot=2, we should not forget about fields of characteristic 2 as hyperelliptic curve cryptography makes extensive use of such fields.  Example  Figure 1: Example of a hyperelliptic curve As an example consider C : y^2 = f(x) where f(x) = x^5 - 2x^4-7x^3 + 8x^2 + 12x = x (x + 1) (x - 3) (x + 2) (x - 2) over \\\\mathbb{R}. As f has degree 5 and the roots are all distinct, C is a curve of genus g = 2. Its graph is depicted in Figure 1. From this picture it is immediately clear that we cannot use the chords and tangents method to define a group law on the set of points of a hyperelliptic curve. The group law on elliptic curves is based on the fact that a straight line through two points lying on an elliptic curve has a unique third intersection point with the curve. Note that this is always true since O lies on the curve. From the graph of C it is clear that this does not need to hold for an arbitrary hyperelliptic curve. Actually, B√©zout's theorem states that a straight line and a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 intersect in 5 points. So, a straight line through two point lying on C does not have a unique third intersection point, it has three other intersection points.  Coordinate ring  The coordinate ring of over is defined as :\\\\;K[C]=K[x,y]/(y^2+h(x)y-f(x)). The polynomial \\\\,r(x,y)=y^2+h(x)y-f(x) is irreducible over \\\\overline{K}, so :\\\\overline{K}[C]=\\\\overline{K}[x,y]/(y^2+h(x)y-f(x)) is an integral domain. Proof. If were reducible over \\\\overline{K}, it would factor as for some ‚àà \\\\overline{K}. But then so it has degree , and so it has degree smaller than , which is impossible. Note that any polynomial function G(x,y)\\\\in\\\\overline{K}[C] can be written uniquely as :\\\\,G(x,y)=u(x)-v(x)y with u(x), v(x) ‚àà \\\\overline{K}[x]  Norm and degree  The conjugate of a polynomial function in \\\\overline{K}[C] is defined to be :\\\\overline{G}(x,y)=u(x)+v(x)(h(x)+y). The norm of is the polynomial function N(G)=G\\\\overline{G}. Note that , so is a polynomial in only one variable. If , then the degree of is defined as :\\\\,\\\\deg(G)=\\\\max[2\\\\deg(u),2g+1+2\\\\deg(v)]. Properties: :\\\\;\\\\deg(G)=\\\\deg_x(N(G)) :\\\\;\\\\deg(GH)=\\\\deg(G)+\\\\deg(H) :\\\\deg(G)=\\\\deg(\\\\overline{G})  Function field  The function field of over is the field of fractions of , and the function field \\\\overline{K}(C) of over \\\\overline{K} is the field of fractions of \\\\overline{K}[C]. The elements of \\\\overline{K}(C) are called rational functions on . For such a rational function, and a finite point on , is said to be defined at if there exist polynomial functions such that and , and then the value of at is :\\\\,R(P)=G(P)/H(P). For a point on that is not finite, i.e. = O, we define as: :If \\\\;\\\\deg(G)<\\\\deg(H) then R(O)=0, i.e. R has a zero at O. :If \\\\;\\\\deg(G)>\\\\deg(H) then R(O) is not defined, i.e. R has a pole at O. :If \\\\;\\\\deg(G)=\\\\deg(H) then R(O) is the ratio of the leading coefficients of and . For R\\\\in\\\\overline{K}(C)^* and P\\\\in C, :If \\\\;R(P)=0 then is said to have a zero at , :If is not defined at then is said to have a pole at , and we write R(P)=\\\\infty.  Order of a polynomial function at a point  For G=u(x)-v(x)\\\\cdot y\\\\in\\\\overline{K}[C]^2 and P\\\\in C, the order of at is defined as: :\\\\;ord_P(G)=r+s if is a finite point which is not Weierstrass. Here is the highest power of which divides both and . Write and if , then is the highest power of which divides , otherwise, . :\\\\;ord_P(G)=2r+s if is a finite Weierstrass point, with and as above. :\\\\;ord_P(G)=-\\\\deg(G) if .  The divisor and the Jacobian  In order to define the Jacobian, we first need the notion of a divisor. Consider a hyperelliptic curve C over some field K. Then we define a divisor D to be a formal sum of points in C, i.e. D = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P [P]} where c_P \\\\in\\\\Z and furthermore \\\\\\\\{c_P c_P ot= 0 \\\\\\\\} is a finite set. This means that a divisor is a finite formal sum of scalar multiples of points. Note that there is no simplification of c_P[P] given by a single point (as one might expect from the analogy with elliptic curves). Furthermore, we define the degree of D as \\\\deg(D) = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P} \\\\in \\\\Z. The set of all divisors \\\\mathrm{Div}(C) of the curve C forms an Abelian group where the addition is defined pointwise as follows \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P [P]} + \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{d_P [P]} = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{(c_P + d_P)[P]}. It is easy to see that 0 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{0 [P]} acts as the identity element and that the inverse of \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P [P]} equals \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{-c_P [P]}. The set \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(C) = \\\\\\\\{D \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Div}(C) \\\\deg(D) = 0\\\\\\\\} of all divisors of degree 0 can easily be checked to be a subgroup of \\\\mathrm{Div}(C). Proof. Consider the map \\\\varphi : \\\\mathrm{Div}(C) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{Z} defined by \\\\varphi(D) = \\\\deg(D), note that \\\\mathbb{Z} forms a group under the usual addition. Then \\\\varphi(\\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P [P]} + \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{d_P [P]}) = \\\\varphi( \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{(c_P + d_P)[P]}) = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P + d_P} = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_p} + \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{d_p} = \\\\varphi(\\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{c_P [P]}) + \\\\varphi(\\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{d_P [P]}) and hence \\\\varphi is a group homomorphism. Now, \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(C) is the kernel of this homomorphism and thus it is a subgroup of \\\\mathrm{Div}(C). Consider a function f \\\\in \\\\overline{K}(C)^{*}, then we can look at the formal sum div(f) = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{\\\\mathrm{ord}_{P}(f)[P]}. Here ord_{P}(f) denotes the order of f at P. We have that ord_{P}(f) < 0 if f has a pole of order -ord_{P}(f) at P, ord_{P}(f) = 0 if f is defined and non-zero at P and ord_{P}(f) >0 if f has a zero of order ord_{P}(f) at P.Isabelle D√©ch√®ne, The Picard Group, or how to build a group from a set It can be shown that f has only a finite number of zeroes and poles,Alfred J. Menezes, Yi-Hong Wu, Robert J. Zuccherato, An elementary introduction to hyperelliptic curves, page 15 and thus only finitely many of the ord_{P}(f) are non-zero. This implies that div(f) is a divisor. Moreover, as \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{\\\\mathrm{ord}_{P}(f)} = 0, it is the case that div(f) is a divisor of degree 0. Such divisors, i.e. divisors coming from some rational function f, are called principal divisors and the set of all principal divisors \\\\mathrm{Princ}(C) is a subgroup of \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(C). Proof. The identity element 0 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{0 [P]} comes from a constant function which is non-zero. Suppose D_1 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{\\\\mathrm{ord}_{P}(f)[P]}, D_2 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{\\\\mathrm{ord}_{P}(g)[P]} \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Princ}(C) are two principal divisors coming from f and g respectively. Then D_1 - D_2 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{(\\\\mathrm{ord}_{P}(f) - \\\\mathrm{ord}_P(g))[P]} comes from the function f/g, and thus D_1 - D_2 is a principal divisor, too. We conclude that \\\\mathrm{Princ}(C) is closed under addition and inverses, making it into a subgroup. We can now define the quotient group J(C) := \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(C) / \\\\mathrm{Princ}(C) which is called the Jacobian or the Picard group of C. Two divisors D_1, D_2 \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(C) are called equivalent if they belong to the same element of J(C), this is the case if and only if D_1 - D_2 is a principal divisor. Consider for example a hyperelliptic curve C : y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) over a field K and a point P = (a,b) on C. For n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} the rational function f(x) = (x-a)^n has a zero of order n at both P and \\\\overline{P} and it has a pole of order 2n at O. Therefore, we find div(f) = nP + n\\\\overline{P} - 2n O and we can simplify this to div(f) = 2nP - 2nO if P is a Weierstrass point. = Example: the Jacobian of an elliptic curve = For elliptic curves the Jacobian turns out to simply be isomorphic to the usual group on the set of points on this curve, this is basically a corollary of the Abel-Jacobi theorem. To see this consider an elliptic curve E over a field K. The first step is to relate a divisor D to every point P on the curve. To a point P on E we associate the divisor D_P = 1 [P] - 1 [O], in particular O in linked to the identity element O-O=0. In a straightforward fashion we can now relate an element of J(E) to each point P by linking P to the class of D_P, denoted by [D_P]. Then the map \\\\varphi: E \\\\rightarrow J(E) from the group of points on E to the Jacobian of E defined by \\\\varphi(P) = [D_P] is a group homomorphism. This can be shown by looking at three points on E adding up to O, i.e. we take P,Q,R \\\\in E with P + Q + R = O or P+Q = -R. We now relate the addition law on the Jacobian to the geometric group law on elliptic curves. Adding P and Q geometrically means drawing a straight line through P and Q, this line intersects the curve in one other point. We then define P+Q as the opposite of this point. Hence in the case P+Q+R=O we have that these three points are collinear, thus there is some linear f \\\\in K[x,y] such that P, Q and R satisfy f(x,y) = 0. Now, \\\\varphi(P) + \\\\varphi(Q) + \\\\varphi(R) = [D_P] + [D_Q] + [D_R] = P] + [Q] + [R] - 3[O which is the identity element of J(E) as [P] + [Q] + [R] - 3[O] is the divisor on the rational function f and thus it is a principal divisor. We conclude that \\\\varphi(P) + \\\\varphi(Q)+ \\\\varphi(R) = \\\\varphi(O) = \\\\varphi(P+Q+R). The Abel- Jacobi theorem states that a divisor D = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in E}{c_P [P]} is principal if and only if D has degree 0 and \\\\sum_{P \\\\in E}{c_P P} = O under the usual addition law for points on cubic curves. As two divisors D_1, D_2 \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(E) are equivalent if and only if D_1 - D_2 is principal, we conclude that D_1 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in E}{c_P [P]} and D_2 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in E}{d_P [P]} are equivalent if and only if \\\\sum_{P \\\\in E}{c_P P} = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in E}{d_P P}. Now, every nontrivial divisor of degree 0 is equivalent to a divisor of the form [P] - [O], this implies that we have found a way to ascribe a point on E to every class [D_P]. Namely, to [D_P] = [1 [P] - 1 [O we ascribe the point (P - O)+O = P. This maps extends to the neutral element 0 which is maped to 0+O=O. As such the map \\\\psi: J(E) \\\\rightarrow E defined by \\\\psi([D_P]) = P is the inverse of \\\\varphi. So \\\\varphi is in fact a group isomorphism, proving that E and J(E) are isomorphic.  The Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve  The general hyperelliptic case is a bit more complicated. Consider a hyperelliptic curve C: y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) of genus g over a field K. A divisor D of C is called reduced if it has the form D = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{[P_i]} - k [O] where k \\\\leq g, P_i ot= O for all i = 1,...,k and P_i ot= \\\\overline{P_j} for i ot= j. Note that a reduced divisor always has degree 0, also it is possible that P_i = P_j if i ot= j, but only if P_i is not a Weierstrass point. It can be proven that for each divisor D \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Div}^0(C) there is a unique reduced divisor D' such that D is equivalent to D'.Alfred J. Menezes, Yi-Hong Wu, Robert J. Zuccherato, An elementary introduction to hyperelliptic curves, page 20 Hence every class of the quotient group J(C) has precisely one reduced divisor. Instead of looking at J(C) we can thus look at the set of all reduced divisors. = Reduced divisors and their Mumford representation = A convenient way to look at reduced divisors is via their Mumford representation. A divisor in this representation consists of a pair of polynomials u,v \\\\in K[x] such that u is monic, \\\\deg(v) < \\\\deg(u) \\\\leq g and u v^2 + vh - f. Every non-trivial reduced divisor can be represented by a unique pair of such polynomials. This can be seen by factoring u(x) = \\\\prod_{i = 1}^{k}{(x-x_i)} in \\\\overline{K} which can be done as such as u is monic. The last condition on u and v then implies that the point P_i = (x_i, v(x_i)) lies on C for every i = 1,...,k. Thus D = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{[P_i]} - k[O] is a divisor and in fact it can be shown to be a reduced divisor. For example, the condition \\\\deg(u) \\\\leq g ensures that k \\\\leq g. This gives the 1-1 correspondence between reduced divisors and divisors in Mumford representation. As an example, 0 = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{0 [P]} is the unique reduced divisor belonging to the identity element of J(C). Its Mumford representation is u(x) = 1 and v(x) = 0. Going back and forth between reduced divisors and their Mumford representation is now an easy task. For example, consider the hyperelliptic curve C : y^2 = x^5 -4 x^4 -14x^3 +36x^2 + 45 x = x (x + 1) (x - 3) (x + 3) (x - 5) of genus 2 over the real numbers. We can find the following points on the curve P = (1,8), Q = (3,0) and R= (5,0). Then we can define reduced divisors D = [P] + [Q] - 2[O] and D'= [P] + [R] - 2[O]. The Mumford representation of D consists of polynomials u and v with \\\\deg(v) < \\\\deg(u) \\\\leq g = 2 and we know that the first coordinates of P and Q, i.e. 1 and 3, must be zeroes of u. Hence we have u(x) = (x-1)(x-3) = x^2-4x+3. As P = (1,v(1)) and Q = (3, v(3)) it must be the case that v(1) = 8 and v(3) = 0 and thus v has degree 1. There is exactly one polynomial of degree 1 with these properties, namely v(x) = -4x+12. Thus the Mumford representation of D is u(x) = x^2 -4x +3 and v(x) = -4x + 12. In a similar fashion we can find the Mumford representation (u',v') of D', we have u'(x) = (x-1)(x-5) = x^2 -6x + 5 and v(x) = -2x+10. If a point P_i=(x_i,y_i) appears with multiplicity n, the polynomial v needs to satisfy \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\right)^j\\\\left[v(x)^2+v(x)h(x)-f(x)\\\\right]_{_{x=x_i}}=0 for 0\\\\leq j\\\\leq n_i-1. = Cantor's algorithm = There is an algorithm which takes two reduced divisors D_1 and D_2 in their Mumford representation and produces the unique reduced divisor D, again in its Mumford representation, such that D is equivalent to D_1 + D_2.Alfred J. Menezes, Yi-Hong Wu, Robert J. Zuccherato, An elementary introduction to hyperelliptic curves, page 22‚Äì27 As every element of the Jacobian can be represented by the one reduced divisor it contains, the algorithm allows to perform the group operation on these reduced divisors given in their Mumford representation. The algorithm was originally developed by David G. Cantor (not to be confused with Georg Cantor), explaining the name of the algorithm. Cantor only looked at the case h(x) = 0, the general case is due to Koblitz. The input is two reduced divisors D_1 = (u_1,v_1) and D_2= (u_2,v_2) in their Mumford representation of the hyperelliptic curve C: y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) of genus g over the field K. The algorithm works as follows # Using the extended Euclidean algorithm compute the polynomials d_1, e_1,e_2 \\\\in K[x] such that d_1 = \\\\gcd(u_1,u_2) and d_1 = e_1 u_1 + e_2 u_2. # Again with the use of the extended Euclidean algorithm compute the polynomials d, c_1,c_2 \\\\in K[x] with d = \\\\gcd(d_1,v_1 + v_2 + h) and d = c_1d_1 + c_2(v_1+v_2+ h). # Put s_1 = c_1e_1, s_2 = c_1e_2 and s_3 = c_2, which gives d = s_1u_1 + s_2 u_2 +s_3(v_1+v_2+h). # Set u = \\\\frac{u_1u_2}{d^2} and v = \\\\frac{s_1u_1v_2 + s_2u_2v_1 + s_3 (v_1v_2 +f)}{d} \\\\mod u. # Set u'= \\\\frac{f - vh -v^2}{u} and v'= -h-v \\\\mod u'. # If \\\\deg(u') > g, then set u = u' and v = v' and repeat step 5 until \\\\deg(u') \\\\leq g. # Make u' monic by dividing through its leading coefficient. # Output D = (u', v'). The proof that the algorithm is correct can be found in . Example As an example consider the curve :C : y^2 = x^5 -4 x^4 -14x^3 +36x^2 + 45 x = x (x + 1) (x - 3) (x + 3) (x - 5) of genus 2 over the real numbers. For the points :P = (1,8), Q = (3,0) and R= (5,0) and the reduced divisors :D_1 = [P] + [Q] - 2[O] and D_2= [P] + [R] - 2[O] we know that :(u_1 = x^2-4x+3, v_1 = -4x+12), and :(u_2 = x^2-6x+5, v_2 = -2x+10) are the Mumford representations of D_1 and D_2 respectively. We can compute their sum using Cantor's algorithm. We begin by computing :d_1 = \\\\gcd(u_1,u_2) = x-1, and :d_1 = e_1 u_1 + e_2 u_2 for e_1 = \\\\frac{1}{2}, and e_2 = - \\\\frac{1}{2}. In the second step we find :d = \\\\gcd(d_1,v_1 + v_2 + h) = \\\\gcd(x-1,-6x+22) = 1 and :1 = c_1d_1 + c_2(v_1+v_2+ h) for c_1 = \\\\frac{3}{8} and c_2 = \\\\frac{1}{16}. Now we can compute :s_1 = c_1e_1 = \\\\frac{3}{16}, :s_2 = c_1e_2 = - \\\\frac{3}{16} and :s_3 = c_2 = \\\\frac{1}{16}. So :u = \\\\frac{u_1u_2}{d^2} = u_1u_2= x^4 -10x^3 +32x^2 -38x +15 and :v = \\\\frac{s_1u_1v_2 + s_2u_2v_1 + s_3 (v_1v_2 +f)}{d} \\\\mod u ::= \\\\frac{1}{16}(x^5 - 4x^4 -8x^3 -10x^2 +119x + 30 ) \\\\mod u ::= \\\\frac{1}{4}(5x^3 -41x^2+83x-15). Lastly we find :u'= \\\\frac{f -v^2}{u} = \\\\frac{1}{16}(-25x^2 +176x -15 ) and :v'= -v \\\\mod u' = -\\\\frac{72}{125}(17x-5). After making u' monic we conclude that :D = (-25x^2 +176x -15 , -\\\\frac{72}{125}(17x-5)) is equivalent to D_1 + D_2. More on Cantor's algorithm Cantor's algorithm as presented here has a general form, it holds for hyperelliptic curves of any genus and over any field. However, the algorithm is not very efficient. For example, it requires the use of the extended Euclidean algorithm. If we fix the genus of the curve or the characteristic of the field (or both), we can make the algorithm more efficient. For some special cases we even get explicit addition and doubling formulas which are very fast. For example, there are explicit formulas for hyperelliptic curves of genus 2Frank Leitenberger, About the Group Law for the Jacobi Variety of a Hyperelliptic Curve and genus 3. For hyperelliptic curves it is also fairly easy to visualize the adding of two reduced divisors. Suppose we have a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 over the real numbers of the form :C: y^2 = f(x) and two reduced divisors :D_1 = [P] + [Q] - 2 [O] and :D_2 = [R] + [S] - 2 [O]. Assume that :P,Q ot= \\\\overline{R},\\\\overline{S}, this case has to be treated separately. There is exactly 1 cubic polynomial :a(x) = a_0x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x + a_3 going through the four points :P,Q,R,S. Note here that it could be possible that for example P = Q, hence we must take multiplicities into account. Putting y = a(x) we find that :y^2 = f(x) = a^2(x) and hence :f(x) - a^2(x) = 0. As f(x)-a^2(x) is a polynomial of degree 6, we have that f(x) - a^2(x) has six zeroes and hence a(x) has besides P,Q,R,S two more intersection points with C, call them T and U, with T ot= \\\\overline{U}. Now, P,Q,R,S,T,U are intersection points of C with an algebraic curve. As such we know that the divisor :D = [P] + [Q] + [R] + [S] + [T] + [U] - 6 [O] is principal which implies that the divisor :[P] + [Q] + [R] + [S] -4[O] is equivalent to the divisor :-([T] + [U] -2 [O]). Furthermore, the divisor :[P] + [\\\\overline{P}] - 2[O] is principal for every point P = (a,b) on C as it comes from the rational function b(x) = x-a. This gives that -([P]-[O]) and [\\\\overline{P}] - [O] are equivalent. Combining these two properties we conclude that :D_1 + D_2 = ([P] + [Q] - 2[O]) + ([R] + [S] - 2[O]) is equivalent to the reduced divisor :[\\\\overline{T}] + [\\\\overline{U}] - 2[O]. In a picture this looks like Figure 2. It is possible to explicitly compute the coefficients of a(x), in this way we can arrive at explicit formulas for adding two reduced divisors.

Brenton Leonard Butler) was a murder case in Jacksonville, Florida. During the investigation of a shooting death outside a motel in 2000, police arrested 15-year-old Brenton Butler and charged him with the murder. Butler subsequently confessed to the crime, and the case went to trial. However, during the trial he testified that he had been brutalized into his confession, and he was acquitted. The case gained significant notice in the media, and became the subject of an award-winning documentary, Murder on a Sunday Morning. Case In May 2000, two tourists from Georgia were accosted outside the Ramada Inn on University Boulevard. Mary Ann Stephens was shot in the head in front of her husband and the killer fled. During the subsequent investigation, police picked up Butler, a 15-year-old student at Englewood High School who was on his way to submit a job application to a local Blockbuster Video. Butler was brought to the victim's husband, who identified him as the killer. Police brought Butler in for questioning, and he confessed to the murder, both orally and in writing, in front of at least two detectives. State Attorney Harry Shorstein decided to prosecute the case. During the trial, however, Butler testified that two detectives involved in the investigation, including Michael Glover, son of the then current Sheriff Nat Glover, had intimidated and physically abused him into confessing. Butler was represented by Patrick McGuinness and Ann Finnell, two attorneys from the public defenders office. They supplied a photograph of Butler with bruises on his face, which they claimed was the result of the interrogation. The jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Butler not guilty; one juror later cited the testimony about the interrogation as one of the key factors in their decision. State Attorney Shorstein and Jacksonville Sheriff Glover took the unusual steps of apologizing to Butler and re-opening the case of two unrelated suspects. However, Michael Glover denied the allegations against him, and Shorstein said there was no evidence that Butler had been physically abused during the interrogation. Legacy After the case, the State Attorney's Office launched a grand jury investigation into the conduct of the officers and prosecutors, while the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office began an internal affairs investigation. The grand jury investigation criticized the prosecutor and police for their handling of the case but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The police disciplinary board sought the suspension of three officers and other penalties for two more, but these measures were later largely overturned. Michael Glover retired from JSO and became a private investigator, while Dwayne Darnell was transferred from the homicide division. The Butler case opened up discussion about the video taping of police interrogations. At the time of the investigation, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office was in discussions over implementing video recording during interrogations. The office had purchased the equipment and was prepared to start taping interrogations, but held off at the request of the State Attorney's Office. After the grand jury investigation, the Sheriff's office began taping interrogations of juvenile suspects, and implemented other procedural changes recommended by the jury. The Butler case was the subject of the French documentary film Murder on a Sunday Morning, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards in 2001. The documentary follows Butler's defense team as they build their case for his innocence. In 2004, Butler wrote a book about his experience, entitled They Said It Was Murder.Schoettler, Jim (February 18, 2004). \\"Teen's book details ordeal of his arrest\\" . The Florida Times-Union. Retrieved July 7, 2009. Later developments After Butler's acquittal, his attorneys tipped the Sheriff's Office to two other suspects, Juan Curtis and Jermel Williams. Williams pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified against his co- defendant at the trial; he was sentenced to ten years in prison. Curtis' fingerprints were found on the victim's purse, which had been recovered after the crime but had never been tested. The Butler case figured into the new trial; the judge allowed Curtis' lawyers to discuss the eye-witness identification, but ruled that Florida's evidence laws forbade them from using Butler's confession. Curtis was subsequently found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. However, in 2004 appeals court found that the exclusion of the confession denied Curtis' constitutional right to a fair trial, and granted a retrial. At this second trial Curtis was found guilty and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Lawsuit In late February 2001, lawyers for the Butler family announced that they were moving forward with a civil lawsuit seeking $2.5 million in damages against the City, the Sheriff's Department and individual officers involved.\\"Butler Family Plans $2.5 Million Civil Lawsuit\\" (February 22, 2001).

There he started his writing career in his early teenage years by writing articles and short stories for Toffan Magazine. After the end of the Second World War, the family returned to Tehran. There, Zohari studied Persian literature at Tehran University, and later achieved a PhD in literature from the same university. After graduation, Zohari worked as high school and university teacher, and as a journalist for Ferdowsi Magazine, Fokahi and some others for some years before he became a government employee and worked in various positions such as head of media and PR for the Ministry of Education and vice-director of the National Library of Iran. In his work, Zohari found inspiration in all his surroundings, and most of his poems were about his social environment or love, however the most published one was about the country's social circumstances. In 1953, he met Nima Yooshij for the first time, which resulted in many more visits in the following years, to discuss poetry and modern literature that many believe influenced Zohari's work and modern poetry in Iran. In 1977, Zohari travelled to Paris and stayed until 1979, when he returned to Iran, however due to some of his socialistic thought in 1982, three years after the Iranian Revolution, he was again forced to leave Iran and moved to Paris. The experience to leave his home by force for the second time, once when he was a child and once as an adult, was very difficult for Zohari, and caused his decision to do not write anymore. Due to his enormous love for Iran, Zohari returned to Tehran in 1992, but during some legal straggling he died of a heart attack in 1995.

The Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella over the funeral pyre of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, inside the royal crematorium at Sanam Luang (2017). The Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella (: Nopphapadon Mahasawettachat, officially called the Nine-Tiered Great White Umbrella of State) is considered the most sacred and ancient of the royal regalia of Thailand. A royal umbrella (also called a chatra) consists of many tiers, five for the crown prince (or the viceroy), seven for an unconsecrated king, and nine for a fully sovereign Thai king. Until the coronation rites are completed the new king will not be able to sit on the throne under the nine- tiered umbrella. Description The umbrella's shades are made of white silk trimmed with gold, attached to a gilded golden stem. The umbrellas are usually displayed above an important throne in the royal palace (similar to a baldachin). The umbrellas themselves are considered sacred objects and receive offerings from the king on the anniversary of his coronation day. There are currently seven such umbrellas, with six distributed at the various throne halls in the Grand Palace and one in the Dusit Palace. Derived from ancient Hindu beliefs, the umbrella symbolises the spiritual and physical protection the king can give to his subjects. The multiple tiers symbolise the accumulation of honour and merit the king may possess. During the coronation ceremony of the Thai monarch, at one point before the king is crowned, the Chief Court Brahmin will approach the king and hand him the nine-tiered white umbrella. The king will accept it and hand it over to a royal page, who will position it above the throne that the king will sit on to be crowned. A mantra is then invoked by the other Brahmins, to fanfare and music. On the anniversary of the king's coronation day, a public holiday called the Coronation Day (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏°‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏•: Wan Chantra Mongkol) or literally 'the day of the blessing of the umbrella' is celebrated in Thailand. The day will involve the king himself carrying out certain rites in remembrance of his consecration. The main ceremony being a benediction service by monks inside the Amarin Winitchai throne hall, where the royal regalia, royal utensils and royal weapons are displayed on the Phuttan Kanchanasinghat Throne. The court Brahmin would then chant a mantra, in the presence of the king, and perform a circumambulation of the nine-tiered umbrella. Gold and silver flowers will then be offered to the spirits protecting the throne, followed by the tying of a strip of red cloth around the umbrella's stem and ending the service by the sprinkling of lustral water on the royal regalia. For King Bhumibol Adulyadej the celebration usually involves a general audience, where he would appear in state seated on the throne under the nine-tiered umbrella to receive well wishes. After his death the public holiday (on 5 May) was cancelled by the government.

As a privateer she had an inconclusive but bloody encounter with of the Royal Navy, commanded by Commander Henry Lambert, off the Indian coast in April 1804.Marshall (1831), Vol. 3 Part 1, pp. 256‚Äì8. The French then brought her into service in June 1804 as the frigate Psych√©. In February 1805 she encountered San Fiorenzo, under the command of the same Henry Lambert, now an acting captain. After a sanguinary engagement of over three hours, Psych√© surrendered. The British took her into service as HMS Psyche. In British service she captured several prizes and took part in the capture of Mauritius and in an operation in Java. She was broken up at Ferrol in 1812. Merchant In 1802, Psych√© sailed the Indian Ocean as a merchantman under Captain Jacques Bergeret. Privateer On 1 January 1804 Psych√© captured the East Indiaman , of 558 tons (bm), near Mauritius. On 9 April 1804, while under the command of Captain Trogoff, she encountered , which was escorting the country ship William Petrie to Trincomalee. Psych√© outgunned Wilhelmina, which was armed en fl√ªte. She had only 21 guns: eighteen 9-pounder and two 6-pounder cannon, and one 12-pounder carronade. Psych√© carried 36 cannon, a broadside that was more than double that of Wilhelmina: twenty-four 12-pounder guns, two 6-pounders and ten 18-pounder carronades. Psych√© also had a crew of 250 men, compared with Wilhelminas 124. Nevertheless, Captain Henry Lambert of Wilhelmina sailed towards Psych√© to give William Petrie a chance to escape. Light winds meant that the engagement did not begin until 11 April, when both ships opened fire, exchanging broadsides and attempting to tack around to rake their opponent. After several hours fighting, Psych√© broke off and fled. Both ships had sustained heavy damage, Wilhelmina to her masts and rigging, while Psych√© was reduced to a near-sinking condition. Wilhelmina had nine of her crew wounded, three mortally and six slightly, while Psych√© lost ten killed and 32 wounded, 13 of them mortally. Wilhelmina put into port, while William Petrie also arrived safely at her destination. French naval service In June 1804 Decaen purchased Psych√© for the French Navy at R√©union. On 10 January 1805, under Captain Jacques Bergeret, she captured the country ship Elisa. However, an East Indiaman, Iudus, recaptured Eliza, Waters, master; she then went into MadrasLloyd's List, n¬∞4253, accessed 1 October 2015. On 14 February, Psych√© captured the country ships Pigeon and Thetis. Bergeret armed Pigeon with four guns and gave her a crew of 34 men under the command of Lieutenant Ollivier. On 14 February, Psych√©, Pigeon, and Thetis encountered HMS San Fiorenzo, now under the command of Captain Henry Lambert (acting), off the Malabar Coast of India. The French abandoned Thetis as San Fiorenzo approached and Lambert put a prize crew aboard her under the command of a midshipman, and continued his pursuit. At ten minutes past eight, San Fiorenzo and Psych√© started to exchange broadsides at about a cable length () from each other. After one hour, San Fiorenzo could hardly govern; Bergeret seized the opportunity to manoeuver and rake her, but as Psych√© had lost all her carronades and several guns, her fire was ineffective. After San Fiorenzo managed to train her guns on Psych√© again, the superiority of San Fiorenzos fire led Bergeret to attempt a boarding. At 9:45, the two frigates sailed side by side and for twenty minutes French boarding parties attempted to storm San Fiorenzo, but British small arms fire repelled them. A fire breaking out in the orlop deck of Psych√© further distracted her crew from the fight. At this point, Pigeon fired four to five shots to distract San Fiorenzo, before escaping into the night. Around 11:00 or 11:30, the two frigates parted, both unmanageable, and Psych√© with only two guns still operable. Both crews attempted to repair their ships and around midnight, San Fiorenzo had effected her repairs and came to re-engage the hapless and ungovernable Psych√©. Seeing the hopelessness of his position, Bergeret sent Ensign Hugon on a boat to negotiate a capitulation, offering to surrender Psych√© in exchange for the British permitting his crew to keep their personal weapons and effects and to stay aboard overnight to attend to the wounded. Lambert accepted the terms and Bergeret struck his colours at midnight. Psych√© had 57 killed and 70 wounded out of her crew of 240 men; San Fiorenzo had 12 killed and 36 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"San Fiorenzo 14 Feby. 1805\\" to any still surviving claimants from the action. British naval service Psych√© entered British service as HMS Psyche, being commissioned under Commander William Woolridge in about August 1805. Under Woolridge Psyche took a number of small prizes in 1806: * 26 March ‚Äì French sloop packet ship Alexandriane, taken at sea while sailing from √éle Bourbon; * 20 May ‚Äì French schooner C√©lestine, taken at sea while carrying a cargo of plank, corn, and cloves; * 26 May ‚Äì A French brig, (Name unknown), which Psyche ran on shore where she wrecked under the batteries of St. Gilles; * 26 May ‚Äì French lugger Uranie, taken at sea with a cargo of rice; * 26 May ‚Äì French lugger Sophie, taken at sea and burnt after her cargo of rice was removed; * 1 June ‚Äì Brig Paque Bot, taken at sea with a cargo of gum and rice; * 2 June ‚Äì French schooner √âtoile, taken at sea and scuttled after her cargo of rice had been removed; * 10 June ‚Äì French brig Coquette, taken at sea with a cargo of rice; * 10 June ‚Äì French lugger Grange, taken at sea and scuttled. Captain Fleetwood Pellew took command in 1807. His father, Rear Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, \\"Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels in the East Indies\\", sent Psyche and to reconnoitre the port of Surabaya. On 30 August they captured a ship from Batavia and from her learned the disposition of the Dutch military ships in the area. Psyche proceeded to Samarang while Caroline pursued another vessel. Psyche arrived at Samarang at midnight and next morning her boats captured and brought out from under the fire of shore batteries an armed 8-gun schooner and a large merchant brig. However, Psyche had seen three more Dutch vessels, one of them a warship, and so Pellew destroyed the two captured vessels and at mid-day set out after the three other vessels. By 3:30 on 1 September Psyche had caught up with the Dutch vessels and run them ashore. She went as close as the water depth would allow, anchored and exchanged fire with them. All three surrendered quickly. One that she captured was the 24-gun corvette , which had a crew of 150 men. Scipio was badly shot up and her commander, Captain- Lieutenant Jan Hendrik Correga, had been mortally wounded. The largest armed merchant ship was Resolutie, of 700 tons. She had a valuable cargo and as passengers the colours and staff of the Dutch 23rd European Battalion. The third vessel was the brig Ceres, of 12 guns and 70 men. Pellew had too few men to be able to deal with the prisoners so he paroled the officers to the governor of Samarang and gave up the all the other men against a receipt. The British took Scipio into service under her existing name, but then renamed her Samarang. Captain John Edgcumbe assumed command at Bombay in 1808. He then sailed Psyche to the Persian Gulf with Brigadier-General John Malcolm and his staff on an embassy to the Persian Empire. There, during the four hottest months of the year, Psyche provided protection for the British embassy at Abusheer. At the beginning of 1809, a detachment of troops from the 56th Regiment of Foot came on board Psyche to serve as marines.Cannon, pp. 34‚Äì35 Psyche returned to Bombay and then convoyed troops to Pointe de Galle. From there she went to Colombo to embark troops for Travancore to suppress a mutiny among the native troops in 1809. Psyche silenced some batteries and her boats destroyed several vessels, suffering one man wounded in the process. Later, Psyche captured two vessels transporting elephants to the mutineers.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp. 209‚Äì10. Next, Psyche accompanied to Manila in search of two French frigates, and to induce the government of the Philippines to side with Spain against France. After they returned to Prince of Wales Island, Psyche escorted their Dutch prize to Bombay. Psyche and Doris captured in the China Sea an American ship named Rebecca. Rebecca had left Baltimore in December 1807 and arrived at Batavia on 18 May 1808. She finished unloading there on 3 June. The Dutch government chartered her to carry a cargo to take a cargo to Decuma and then return to \\"Souza Caya\\". She left Batavia on 29 April 1809 and it was on this outward bound voyage that on 29 May Psyche and Doris captured Rebecca. They brought her into Bombay where on 3 January 1810 the new Vice admiralty court condemned her for a violation of His Majesty's Order in Council of 7 January 1807, prohibiting trade between enemy ports or ports from which British ships were excluded. Her cargo of 4,000 bags of Batavian sugar and 13,710 pieces of sapan-wood were auctioned on 7 March 1810. Then on 10 March Rebecca, of 600 tons burthen, teak-built at Pegu, too was auctioned off.Robert Houghton: A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers: Prize-taking. Accessed 16 October 2016. Rebeccas owners appealed the condemnation but lost on appeal on 18 July 1811.Rebecca may have been the vessel purchased at Calcutta that in 1800 repelled an attack by the French privateer while Rebecca was sailing from Bengal to Baltimore. Later in 1810 Psyche transported Brigadier-General Malcolm on a second embassy to Persia. She then sailed to the Cape of Good Hope before sailing to Rodrigues where the British were assembling a fleet to attack Isle de France (now Mauritius). On 29 November the force landed at Grand Baie; the island surrendered on 3 December. Between May and August 1811 Psyche participated in an expedition to Java under Rear Admiral Sir Robert Stopford. While there, Edgcumbe succumbed to hepatitis and had to be invalided back to Britain. Captain Robert Worgan George Festing, who had been serving on shore with the Army, received promotion to Post-captain on 9 October 1811 and assumed command of Psyche.Marshall (1828) Supplement, Part 2, pp. 446‚Äì7. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the award of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Java\\" to any surviving participants that claimed it. Fate In 1812 Festing sailed Psyche to Europe. She was in such a dilapidated state that she had to put into Ferrol to be broken up. M. Santos, the purchaser, took possession on 6 August. Her crew was repatriated to Britain on the transport Bideford.

Deep sea communities remain largely unexplored, due to the technological and logistical challenges and expense involved in visiting this remote biome. Because of the unique challenges (particularly the high barometric pressure, extremes of temperature and absence of light), it was long believed that little life existed in this hostile environment. Since the 19th century however, research has demonstrated that significant biodiversity exists in the deep sea. The three main sources of energy and nutrients for deep sea communities are marine snow, whale falls, and chemosynthesis at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. History Prior to the 19th century scientists assumed life was sparse in the deep ocean. In the 1870s Sir Charles Wyville Thomson and colleagues aboard the Challenger expedition discovered many deep-sea creatures of widely varying types. The first discovery of any deep-sea chemosynthetic community including higher animals was unexpectedly made at hydrothermal vents in the eastern Pacific Ocean during geological explorations (Corliss et al., 1979).Minerals Management Service Gulf of Mexico OCS Region (November 2006). \\"Gulf of Mexico OCS Oil and Gas Lease Sales: 2007‚Äì2012.

Corliss and J. van Andel, first witnessed dense chemosynthetic clam beds from the submersible DSV Alvin on February 17, 1977, after their unanticipated discovery using a remote camera sled two days before. The Challenger Deep is the deepest surveyed point of all of Earth's oceans; it is located at the southern end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands group. The depression is named after HMS Challenger, whose researchers made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at station 225. The reported depth was 4,475 fathoms (8184 meters) based on two separate soundings. In 1960, Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard descended to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Trieste bathyscaphe. At this great depth a small flounder-like fish was seen moving away from the spotlight of the bathyscaphe. The Japanese remote operated vehicle (ROV) Kaiko became the second vessel to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep in March 1995. Nereus, a hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is the only vehicle capable of exploring ocean depths beyond 7000 meters. Nereus reached a depth of 10,902 meters at the Challenger Deep on May 31, 2009. On 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 multibeam sonar bathymetry system aboard the R/V Kilo Moana indicated a maximum depth of . The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth (this is an error of about 22 meters at this depth). Environment =Darkness= Pelagic zones The ocean can be conceptualized as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and presence or absence of sunlight. Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon. The stratum of the water column up till which sunlight penetrates is referred to as the photic zone. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, is referred to as the euphotic zone (also referred to as the epipelagic zone, or surface zone). The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the dysphotic zone (dysphotic means \\"poorly lit\\" in Greek). The dysphotic zone is also referred to as the mesopelagic zone, or the twilight zone. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of , which, in the tropics generally lies between 200 and 1000 meters. The euphotic zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as extending from the surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1‚Äì1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the euphotic zone may extend to a depth of about 150 meters, or rarely, up to 200 meters. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of meters deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 1000 meters. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness. Since the average depth of the ocean is about 4300 meters, the photic zone represents only a tiny fraction of the ocean‚Äôs total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Any life forms present in the aphotic zone must either be capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding, or must rely on material sinking from above, or must find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. =Hyperbaricity= Location of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench These animals have evolved to survive the extreme pressure of the sub- photic zones. The pressure increases by about one atmosphere every ten meters. To cope with the pressure, many fish are rather small, usually not exceeding 25 cm in length. Also, scientists have discovered that the deeper these creatures live, the more gelatinous their flesh and more minimal their skeletal structure. These creatures have also eliminated all excess cavities that would collapse under the pressure, such as swim bladders.The Deep Sea at MarineBio.org ‚Äì Ocean biology, Marine life, Sea creatures, Marine conservation Pressure is the greatest environmental factor acting on deep-sea organisms. In the deep sea, although most of the deep sea is under pressures between 200 and 600 atm, the range of pressure is from 20 to 1,000 atm. Pressure exhibits a great role in the distribution of deep sea organisms. Until recently, people lacked detailed information on the direct effects of pressure on most deep-sea organisms, because virtually all organisms trawled from the deep sea arrived at the surface dead or dying. With the advent of traps that incorporate a special pressure-maintaining chamber, undamaged larger metazoan animals have been retrieved from the deep sea in good condition. Some of these have been maintained for experimental purposes, and we are obtaining more knowledge of the biological effects of pressure. =Temperature= The two areas of greatest and most rapid temperature change in the oceans are the transition zone between the surface waters and the deep waters, the thermocline, and the transition between the deep-sea floor and the hot water flows at the hydrothermal vents. Thermoclines vary in thickness from a few hundred meters to nearly a thousand meters. Below the thermocline, the water mass of the deep ocean is cold and far more homogeneous. Thermoclines are strongest in the tropics, where the temperature of the epipelagic zone is usually above 20 ¬∞C. From the base of the epipelagic, the temperature drops over several hundred meters to 5 or 6 ¬∞C at 1,000 meters. It continues to decrease to the bottom, but the rate is much slower. Below 3,000 to 4,000 m, the water is isothermal. At any given depth, the temperature is practically unvarying over long periods of time. There are no seasonal temperature changes, nor are there any annual changes. No other habitat on earth has such a constant temperature. Hydrothermal vents are the direct contrast with constant temperature. In these systems, the temperature of the water as it emerges from the \\"black smoker\\" chimneys may be as high as 400 ¬∞C (it is kept from boiling by the high hydrostatic pressure) while within a few meters it may be back down to 2‚Äì4 ¬∞C.Nybakken, James W. Marine Biology: An Ecological Approach. Fifth Edition. Benjamin Cummings, 2001. p. 136‚Äì141. =Salinity= NOAA rendering of a brine pool in the Gulf of Mexico Salinity is constant throughout the depths of the deep sea. There are two notable exceptions to this rule: #In the Mediterranean Sea, water loss through evaporation greatly exceeds input from precipitation and river runoff. Because of this, salinity in the Mediterranean is higher than in the Atlantic Ocean. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase in this area.Pinet 1996, p. 206. The resulting pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic Ocean across the basin. This water warms and becomes saltier as it travels eastward, then sinks in the region of the Levant and circulates westward, to spill back into the Atlantic over the Strait of Gibraltar.Pinet 1996, pp. 206‚Äì207. The net effect of this is that at the Strait of Gibraltar, there is an eastward surface current of cold water of lower salinity from the Atlantic, and a simultaneous westward current of warm saline water from the Mediterranean in the deeper zones. Once back in the Atlantic, this chemically distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist for thousands of kilometers away from its source.Pinet 1996, p. 207. #Brine pools are large areas of brine on the seabed. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity that is three to five times greater than that of the surrounding ocean. For deep sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic extremophiles that live in this specialized biome. Brine pools are also known to exist on the Antarctic continental shelf where the source of brine is salt excluded during formation of sea ice. Deep sea and Antarctic brine pools can be toxic to marine animals. Brine pools are sometimes called seafloor lakes because the dense brine creates a halocline which does not easily mix with overlying seawater. The high salinity raises the density of the brine, which creates a distinct surface and shoreline for the pool.NOAA exploration of a brine pool The deep sea, or deep layer, is the lowest layer in the ocean, existing below the thermocline, at a depth of 1000 fathoms (1800 m) or more. The deepest part of the deep sea is Mariana Trench located in the western North Pacific. It is also the deepest point of the earth's crust. It has a maximum depth of about 10.9 km which is deeper than the height of Mount Everest. In 1960, Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard reached the bottom of Mariana Trench in the Trieste bathyscaphe. The pressure is about 11,318 metric tons- force per square meter (110.99 MPa or 16100 psi). Zones =Mesopelagic= Most mesopelagic fish are ambush predators with upward-facing eyes, like this sabertooth fish. The mesopelagic zone is the upper section of the midwater zone, and extends from below sea level. This is colloquially known as the \\"twilight zone\\" as light can still penetrate this layer, but it is too low to support photosynthesis. The limited amount of light, however, can still allow organisms to see, and creatures with a sensitive vision can detect prey, communicate, and orientate themselves using their sight. Organisms in this layer have large eyes to maximize the amount of light in the environment. Most mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations, moving at night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, and returning to the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances, and are undertaken with the assistance of a swimbladder. The swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the mesopelegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between , thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change. Mesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines, and use colour and bioluminescence to camouflage them from other fish. Ambush predators are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use countershaded silvery colours. On their bellies, they often display photophores producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible. =Bathyal= Gulper eels use their mouth like a net to catch prey, and have a bioluminescent tail to attract prey. The bathyl zone is the lower section of the midwater zone, and encompasses the depths of . Light does not reach this zone, giving it its nickname \\"the midnight zone\\"; due to the lack of light, it is less densely population than the epipelagic zone, despite being much larger. Fish find it hard to live in this zone, as there is crushing pressure, cold temperatures of , a low level of dissolved oxygen, and a lack of sufficient nutrients. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20% of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5% filters down to the bathypelagic zone. The fish that do live there may have reduced or completely lost their gills, kidneys, hearts, and swimbladders, have slimy instead of scaly skin, and have a weak skeletal and muscular build. Most of the animals that live in the bathyl zone are invertebrates such as sea sponges, cephalopods, and echinoderms. With the exception of very deep areas of the ocean, the bathyl zone usually reaches the benthic zone on the seafloor. =Abyssal and Hadal= Giant tube worms chemosynthesize near hydrothermal vents The abyssal zone remains in perpetual darkness at a depth of . The only organisms that inhabit this zone are chemotrophs and predators that can withstand immense pressures, sometimes as high as . The hadal zone (named after Hades, the Greek god of the underworld) is a zone designated for the deepest trenches in the world, reaching depths of below . The deepest point in the hadal zone is the Marianas Trench, which descends to and has a pressure of . Energy sources Wood fall as an energy source. =Marine snow= The upper photic zone of the ocean is filled with particle organic matter (POM) and is quite productive, especially in the coastal areas and the upwelling areas. However, most POM is small and light. It may take hundreds, or even thousands of years for these particles to settle through the water column into the deep ocean. This time delay is long enough for the particles to be remineralized and taken up by organisms in the food webs. Scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted an experiment three decades ago in deep Sargasso Sea looking at the rate of sinking. They found what became known as marine snow in which the POM are repackaged into much larger particles which sink at much greater speed, 'falling like snow'. Because of the sparsity of food, the organisms living on and in the bottom are generally opportunistic. They have special adaptations for this extreme environment: rapid growth, effect larval dispersal mechanism and the ability to use a ‚Äòtransient‚Äô food resource. One typical example is wood-boring bivalves, which bore into wood and other plant remains and are fed on the organic matter from the remains. =Whale falls= For the deep-sea ecosystem, the death of a whale is the most important event. A dead whale can bring hundreds of tons of organic matter to the bottom. Whale fall community progresses through three stages:Shana Goffredi, Unusual benthic fauna associated with a whale fall in Monterey Canyon, California, Deep-Sea Research, 1295‚Äì1304, 2004 # Mobile scavenger stage: Big and mobile deep-sea animals arrive at the site almost immediately after whales fall on the bottom. Amphipods, crabs, sleeper sharks and hagfish are all scavengers. # Opportunistic stage: Organisms arrive which colonize the bones and surrounding sediments that have been contaminated with organic matter from the carcass and any other tissue left by the scavengers. One genus is Osedax,Noah K. Whiteman, Between a whale bone and the deep blue sea: the provenance of dwarf males in whale bone-eating tube worms, Molecular Ecology, 4395‚Äì4397, 2008 a tube worm. The larva is born without sex. The surrounding environment determines the sex of the larva. When a larva settles on a whale bone, it turns into a female; when a larva settles on or in a female, it turns into a dwarf male. One female Osedax can carry more than 200 of these male individuals in its oviduct. # Sulfophilic stage: Further decomposition of bones and seawater sulfate reduction happen at this stage. Bacteria create a sulphide-rich environment analogous to hydrothermal vents. Polynoids, bivalves, gastropods and other sulphur-loving creatures move in. =Chemosynthesis= Hydrothermal vents hydrothermal vent Hydrothermal vents were discovered in 1977 by scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. So far, the discovered hydrothermal vents are all located at the boundaries of plates: East Pacific, California, Mid-Atlantic ridge, China and Japan. New ocean basin material is being made in regions such as the Mid- Atlantic ridge as tectonic plates pull away from each other. The rate of spreading of plates is 1‚Äì5 cm/yr. Cold sea water circulates down through cracks between two plates and heats up as it passes through hot rock. Minerals and sulfides are dissolved into the water during the interaction with rock. Eventually, the hot solutions emanate from an active sub-seafloor rift, creating a hydrothermal vent. Chemosynthesis of bacteria provide the energy and organic matter for the whole food web in vent ecosystems. Giant tube worms can grow to tall because of the richness of nutrients. Over 300 new species have been discovered at hydrothermal vents. Hydrothermal vents are entire ecosystems independent from sunlight, and may be the first evidence that the earth can support life without the sun. Cold seeps A cold seep (sometimes called a cold vent) is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs, often in the form of a brine pool.  Ecology  Deep sea food webs are complex, and aspects of the system are poorly understood. Typically, predator-prey interactions within the deep are compiled by direct observation (likely from remotely operated underwater vehicles), analysis of stomach contents, and biochemical analysis. Stomach content analysis is the most common method used, but it is not reliable for some species. In deep sea pelagic ecosystems off of California, the trophic web is dominated by deep sea fishes, cephalopods, gelatinous zooplankton, and crustaceans. Between 1991‚Äì2016, 242 unique feeding relationships between 166 species of predators and prey demonstrated that gelatinous zooplankton have an ecological impact similar to that of large fishes and squid. Narcomedusae, siphonophores (of the family Physonectae), ctenophores, and cephalopods consumed the greatest diversity of prey, in decreasing order. Cannibalism has been documented in squid of the genus Gonatus.

Johnson as the 36th President of the United States was held on Friday, November 22, 1963, aboard Air Force One at Love Field, Dallas, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy earlier that day. The inauguration ‚Äì the eighth non-scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to ever take place ‚Äì marked the commencement of the first term (a partial term of ) of Lyndon B. Johnson as President. Assassination of John F. Kennedy At 12:30 pm Central Standard Time on November 22, Kennedy was shot in Dallas while riding with his wife, Jacqueline, in the presidential motorcade. Vice President Johnson was riding in a car behind the president with his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough. Immediately after shots were fired, Johnson was thrown down and sat on by Secret Service agent Rufus Youngblood, and the President's and Vice President's cars sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital. There were initial reports that Johnson might have also been shot, slightly wounded in the arm or that he had suffered another heart attack (he had suffered one eight years earlier that nearly killed him). Mrs. Johnson confirmed to reporters that he was fine and did not suffer any injury or illness other than being shaken at what he'd seen. In the hospital, Johnson was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who encouraged him to return to Washington in case he too was targeted for assassination. Johnson wished to wait until he knew of Kennedy's condition; at 1:20 pm, he was told Kennedy was dead and left the hospital almost 20 minutes later. Love Field, Dallas thumb400pxrightLyndon B. Johnson taking the oath of office on Air Force One following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dallas, Texas.

Hughes, (#4) Congressman Albert Richard Thomas, (#5) Lady Bird Johnson, (#6) Chief Jesse Curry (Dallas police chief), (#7) Lyndon B. Johnson, (#8) Evelyn Lincoln (personal secretary to John F.

Photo by Cecil W. Stoughton. At this point arrangements were made to provide Secret Service protection of the two Johnson daughters (Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson), and it was decided that the new president would leave on the presidential aircraft because it had better communications equipment. Johnson was driven by an unmarked police car to Love Field, and kept below the car's window level throughout the journey. The President waited for Jacqueline Kennedy, who in turn would not leave Dallas without her husband's body, to arrive aboard Air Force One. Kennedy's casket was finally brought to the aircraft, but takeoff was delayed until Johnson took the oath of office. There was concern that since the Secret Service had taken the body of Kennedy from Parkland Hospital against the wishes of the Dallas medical examiner, Earl Rose, who had insisted an autopsy was required, the Dallas Police Department would seek to prevent Air Force One taking off. Assassination of the President was not yet a federal crime. President Johnson chose federal district Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a long-standing friend, to swear him in. He had previously sought her appointment to a federal judgeship, which Robert F. Kennedy initially rejected on advice from the Justice Department on account of her age (then 65 years old). When the Justice Department reversed its decision a few weeks later and appointed Hughes, Johnson was outraged at having not been consulted. = Inauguration aboard Air Force One= For the inauguration twenty-seven people squeezed into the sixteen-foot square stateroom of Air Force One for the proceedings. Adding to the discomfort was the lack of air conditioning as the aircraft had been disconnected from the external power supply, in order to take off promptly. As the inauguration proceeded the four jet engines of Air Force One were being powered up. The Warren Commission's report detailed the inauguration: The swearing-in ceremony administered by Judge Hughes in an Air Force One conference room represented the first time that a woman administered the presidential oath of office as well as the only time it was conducted on an airplane. Instead of the usual Bible, Johnson was sworn in upon a missal found on a side table in Kennedy's Air Force One bedroom. After the oath had been taken, Johnson kissed his wife on the forehead. Mrs. Johnson then took Jackie Kennedy's hand and told her, \\"The whole nation mourns your husband.\\" At almost exactly the same time as the ceremony, CBS anchor Walter Cronkite read aloud on the air wire copy from the Associated Press officially confirming Kennedy's death, subsequently adding that Johnson would be sworn in as president. According to the Museum of Broadcast Communications's Encyclopedia of Television, during their frantic afternoon coverage of the unfolding events, American broadcasters made a \\"determined effort\\" to refer to him as \\"President Johnson\\". The famous photograph of the inauguration was taken by Cecil Stoughton, John F. Kennedy's official photographer. On Stoughton's suggestion Johnson was flanked by his wife and Jacqueline Kennedy, facing slightly away from the camera so that blood stains on her pink Chanel suit would not be visible. The photograph was taken using a Hasselblad camera.AmericanHeritage.com The inauguration was sound recorded by White House press secretary Malcolm Kilduff using Air Force One's dictaphone. Aftermath Hand-marked statement During the flight back to Andrews Air Force Base, Johnson made several phone calls on the radio telephone, including to Rose Kennedy (JFK's mother) and Nellie Connally (wife of John Connally). In addition, he made the decision to request all cabinet members to stay in their posts and asked to meet both parties' leaders in Congress soon. Johnson also asked Jack Valenti, Bill Moyers, and Liz Carpenter to write a brief statement for him to read on the day's events, which he then edited slightly himself. At 6:10 pm, after landing at Andrews amid a crowd of Congressional leaders, he walked to an already prepared set of microphones and began his first public statement as president: Johnson had to raise his voice to be heard at the Air Force base, and afterward regretted delivering the remarks, believing he sounded harsh and strident. Legacy The image is imitated in several films, such as space opera TV series Babylon 5 during the inauguration of President Morgan Clark and the 2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica during the inauguration of President Laura Roslin.

The modern filled Nusstorte was first widely available in the 1960s though it was invented in the 1920s. History While there are recipes for Nusstorte from the 19th century, they are different from the modern Nusstorte. These pastries contained nuts mixed into a dough, but were not filled. The modern, filled Nusstorte was developed by an Engadin (a region in Graub√ºnden) baker named Fausto Pult in 1926. In 1934 he sold the pastries at the Mustermesse in Basel, which introduced them to the wider world. Because the climate in Graub√ºnden is too cold for nut trees to thrive, the origin of nuts in their pastries is subject to some debate. One theory is that a baker, who had lived in France, brought nut trees back with him which he was able to plant in Val Bregaglia. Another theory, that comes up often in the literature, is that the traditional shortcrust pastry Fuatscha Grassa was crossed with a French nut pastry by confectioners from Graub√ºnden living in France. When they returned to Graub√ºnden, the idea was brought along. A third theory is that during the Middle Ages many confectioners from Graub√ºnden moved to Venice and for 300 years specialized in sweets. When they were expelled in 1766, the Graub√ºnden confectioners traveled around Europe before many of them settled back in Graub√ºnden. The idea of nut pastries could have easily come from one of these wandering cooks. Production The B√ºndner Nusstorte is commonly made by small independent bakers scattered throughout Graub√ºnden. For this reason, there are a variety of recipes, some of which are closely guarded secrets. The basic pastry is made of a classic shortcrust pastry, which contains flour, sugar, egg, butter and a bit of salt. The filling is made of caramelized sugar, to which heavy cream or milk and coarsely chopped nuts (commonly walnuts but rarely other nuts) are added. Some recipes include a little milk or honey. The B√ºndner Nusstorte is produced throughout the entire canton and is one of the largest export items for independent bakers. It is estimated that Nusstorten sales represent 20 to 40% of the total sales for many bakers and are a major source of income. Consumption The Nusstorte, with a buttery crust and cream and nut filling, is loaded with calories. They are generally cut into pieces and eaten for dessert together with coffee or tea. They can be purchased throughout the year and are widely available over the internet. The Nusstorte will remain fresh for several months, which makes them popular as gifts and allows them to be shipped around the world.

In mining, these lower- frequency signals can be relayed underground through various antennas, repeater or mesh configurations, but communication is restricted to line of sight to these antenna and repeaters systems. Overview Through-the-Earth transmission can overcome these restrictions by using ultra-low frequency (300‚Äì3000 Hz) signals, which can travel through several hundred feet of rock strata. The antenna cable can be located on the surface only at a mine site, and provide signal coverage to the mine. The antenna may be placed in a \\"loop\\" formation around the perimeter of the mine site (or wherever coverage is needed) for systems using magnetic fields to carry signals. Systems that use electric fields as the signal carrier are not subject to this limitation. Transmissions propagate through rock strata which is used as the medium to carry the ultra-low-frequency signals. This is important in mining applications, particularly after any significant incident, such as fire or explosion, which would destroy much of the fixed communication infrastructure underground. If the terrain makes a loop surface antenna impractical to install, then the antenna can be installed underground or a non-magnetic field type carrier may be used. But because the signal travels through rock, the antenna does not need to run into all parts of the mine to achieve mine wide signal coverage, thus minimizing the risk of damage during an incident. Cave radios Portable magnetic-loop cave radios have been used by cavers for two- way communication and cave surveying since the 1960s.David Gibson, \\"Cave Radiolocation\\" In a typical setup the transmitting loop, consisting of many turns of copper wire, is oriented horizontally within the cave using a spirit level, and driven at a few kHz. Though such a small antenna is a very poor radiator of propagating radio waves at this low frequency, its local AC magnetic field is strong enough to be detected by a similar receiving antenna up to a few hundred meters away. The received signal's strength and its dependence on orientation of the receiving coil yields approximate distance and directional information. Systems like Molefone and HeyPhone operate as single-sideband (USB) 87 kHz radio with earthed electrodes of 25-100 m length. Design for HeyPhone system is openly available. Personal emergency device There are several systems that have been recently developed. One system is known as the PED System, where PED is an acronym for personal emergency device. Initially developed after a mining disaster in Australia at Moura No. 4 Coal Mine in 1986,http://www.dme.qld.gov.au/mines/moura_no4.cfm and further developed after the Moura No. 2 Coal Mine explosion in 1994 http://www.dme.qld.gov.au/mines/moura_no2.cfm where the need for a communication system to survive major incidents underground was identified in the inquiries into the disasters. PED is a one-way text paging device, with wide use in Australia, as well as installations in the United States, China, Canada, Mongolia, Chile, Tanzania, and Sweden.http://www.msha.gov/regs/comments/06-722/transcripts/Presentations/MST.pdf Australian company Mine Site Technologies began the development of PED in 1987, and it became commercially available and Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) approved in 1991. The best documented use of PED during a mine emergency is from the Willow Creek Mine Fire in 1998 in Utah, where it was able to quickly alert miners underground of the need to evacuate before toxic fumes from the fire filled the mine. Reports of this use can be seen on the MSHA website.http://www.msha.gov/disasterhistory/WCREEK/CHRONO/C0.HTMhttp://www.msha.gov/disasterhistory/WCREEK/WCREEK.HTM Development Emerging technologies have recently been developed such as the Rescue Dog Emergency Through the Earth Communication System https://dl.dropbox.com/u/34622965/Rescue%20Dog%20Web%20Brochure.pdf developed by E-Spectrum Technologies. The Rescue Dog is a two-way extended-range portable through-the-Earth solution that was developed in the US in cooperation with The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (or NIOSH) http://www.homeandsmallbusinessnetwork.info/niosh/mining/mineract/contracts/200-2008-26818.htm which does not rely on large loop surface antennas for signal transmission. New non-portable systems have also been developed by companies such as Lockheed Martin for use in emergency chambers to provide post-accident, two- way, emergency voice and text communications independent of surface or in-mine infrastructure. =New technologies= A new wireless \\"Miner Lifeline\\" telecommunication technology is being tested in 2012 at the West Virginia Robinson Run mine (recent production per year of coal using 600 miners). The system supports voice, text, or SOS sent on a \\"bubble\\" of magnetic waves, and \\"can move more than up or down and laterally, arriving in less than a minute.\\" The Israeli company Maxtech has developed a software system that automates the optimal organization of a set of limited-range communications devices, using any mixture of types of communication (through-the-earth radio, line-of-sight radio or optical, etc.). This system was used in the Tham Luang cave rescue.

Biography Born into an aristocratic family in L√ºbben (Spreewald), Manteuffel attended the Landesschule Pforta from 1819. In 1824‚Äì1827, he studied jurisprudence and cameralism at the University of Halle, where he joined the Corps Saxonia Halle, a duelling Studentenverbindung in the K√∂sener Senioren-Convents-Verband (\\"KSCV\\"). In 1830, Manteuffel commenced his clerkship in law. He became a Landrat (local administrator) of the district of Luckau in 1833; in 1841, he was promoted to Oberregierungsrat (a senior administrative position) in K√∂nigsberg, and in 1843 he was made Vice-President of the government in Stettin. In 1844, the Prince of Prussia, who was then the head of the Ministry of State, appointed him there as an expert councillor (vortragender Rat). Soon thereafter he was also made a member of the royal Council of State. He worked in the field of finance until in 1845 he was made Director at the Ministry of the Interior. The Vereinigte Landtag of 1847 (an assembly of the members of Prussia's provincial legislatures) gave him an opportunity to demonstrate his parliamentary skills, whereupon Manteuffel showed himself a champion of the bureaucratic political system and an opponent of constitutional liberalism. On November 8, 1848, Manteuffel entered the cabinet of Friedrich Wilhelm, Count Brandenburg, receiving the portfolio of the Ministry of the Interior. For the next ten years, he held various positions in the government and was high in the favor of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Manteuffel had a major part in drafting the Prussian constitution of 5 December 1848. But it was also he who contributed to the announcement of 7 January 1850, which repealed significant provisions of that constitution; he also defended it in Parliament. During his career in the post-revolution Prussian government, Manteuffel proved an important reformer whose changes were of crucial historical importance. He conceived of the purpose of government as being a mediating entity for the \\"conflicting interests\\" within Prussian civil society. In pursuing this mediation position, Manteuffel often came into conflict with the conservative and ultra-conservative members of the parliamentary government, whom he found unwilling to fully embrace the new constitutional order. He stressed that gone were the days in which the Prussian state should act, in his own words, 'like the landed estate of a nobleman.' He faced this opposition head on. However, Manteuffel's efforts to impose a more structured decision making apparatus within the royal palace was halted by the ultra-conservatives who, due to their high aristocratic status, traditionally had the most direct contact with the king. There was a greater degree of success to be found in Manteuffel's other efforts, however. One of these was directed at creating a less regulated economy. In 1856, as Minister-President, he oversaw government policy removing state controls over the \\"flow of credit to financial institutions\\" and limiting supervisory powers within the iron and coal industries. Manteuffel also enjoyed success in his efforts to give the Prussian state a much more hands-off stance toward the press. This was a necessary step due to the increased antagonism between these two entities in recent years. Switching from a policy of outright censorship, after 1848 the Prussian state began imposing hefty penalties on publications which printed material damaging to state interests. Responding to increasing pressure to find a different press policy, Manteuffel decided to diminish the confrontational nature of the government stance. The press no longer directly censored or attacked the press but instead joined the printed debate through the placement of \\"government friendly-articles in key journals.\\" This was a major shift in the relationship between press and state in Prussia. Instead of imposing regulations from above, the government operated in the arena of the press itself. Manteuffel was thus very much aware of the need to face rather than repress the power of the press which, in his words, '[had] grown with the expanded participation of the people in public affairs.' When he was temporarily entrusted with managing foreign affairs after the Count of Brandenburg died, he took part in the negotiations for the Agreement of Olm√ºtz in November 1850, and surrendered the constitutional rights of Kurhessen and Holstein to the Austrian restoration zeal. \\"The strong man takes a step back\\"; these were the words with which he sought to calm the members of the recently re-established Bundestag who were unhappy with these measures. On 19 December 1850 he was permanently appointed Prussian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, in which function he took part in the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris of 1856. He remained in this post until October 1858, when the king gave up the throne, and the Prince of Prussia (afterwards Emperor William the Great) became regent.Manley/Schurz, p. 214. On 6 November, he and the entire cabinet were dismissed. He thereupon withdrew to his estate in Lausitz, and after being elected by G√∂rlitz entered the Prussian House of Representatives, but did not participate in the proceedings in any spectacular way. From 1864 he was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. Honors On 6 February 1850, he was made an honorary citizen of Berlin, and the Manteuffelstra√üe in Kreuzberg was named after him. In the southern part of Wlhelmshaven, another Manteuffelstra√üe was opened on 17 June 1869 in the presence of King Wilhelm I. By the street lay the Manteuffelplatz (Exerzierplatz). He was also an honorary citizen of Danzig, Brandenburg an der Havel, Stettin and all the towns of the Niederlausitz.

Vargas became one of the richest drug lords in Colombia, as well as one of the most wanted by police. In 1995 Vargas began serving a six-year prison term, during which he survived an assassination attack when his rivals set off a bomb at his jail. In 2006, he was again arrested in Madrid for cocaine trafficking. While awaiting a trial on those charges, Vargas was killed on January 8, 2009, when he was shot to death in a hospital bed. Biography In his early life, Leonidas Vargas was a poor and little-educated meat vendor in the rural region of Caqueta, a southern region of Colombia. He eventually became associated with drug lords Jos√© Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha and Pablo Escobar, the wealthy and powerful leader of the Medell√≠n Cartel. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Vargas ran a multimillion-dollar cocaine empire that included a network of large cocaine- processing laboratories deep in the jungles of Caqueta. The mass-produced cocaine was then exported to the United States of America. Vargas eventually becoming one of Colombia's richest drug lords. His strongholds were among the guerrillas of the Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, with whom Vargas was believed to have established drug trafficking links. Vargas became known as \\"The King of Caqueta\\", as well as the nickname \\"El Viejo\\", which means \\"The Old Man\\". Vargas has been accused of organizing hit squads of hired killers, and is believed to have ordered the murder of the Colombian presidential candidate Horacio Serpa. He was particularly known for a love of women, drink and football. Vargas was jailed in Colombia in 1995 for 19 years and fined $1.5 million for drugs offenses, plus another 25 years in jail for murder and illegally carrying firearms. While imprisoned in 1997, he survived an assassination attempt when his rival set off a bomb at his jail. Vargas was released early in 2002, but authorities seized assets to the value of $40 million and 135 houses, four vehicles, two bank accounts and three companies, all of which were acquired with the proceeds of drug trafficking. Since about 2006, Vargas had been involved in a romantic relationship with Colombian actress and beauty queen, Liliana Lozano. Spanish police arrested Vargas in Madrid in July 2006 on charges of trafficking of cocaine, which had been discovered in a container in the port of Valencia in eastern Spain. At the time of his arrest, Vargas was in possession of a forged Venezuelan passport and was planning to travel to Germany for the final game of the World Cup Finals. At the time of his 2006 arrest, Vargas was on the list of Colombia's most-wanted cartel bosses, with a bounty of $5 million against him. Vargas was freed on conditional bail due to health reasons, with a trial date to be determined later as Spanish police completed their investigation. Due to the terms of his bail, Vargas was not provided security or a police bodyguard. Death In January 2009, Vargas was checked into the Doce de Octubre Hospital in Madrid due to heart and lung problems. He was placed in a fifth private room with one other patient. On January 8, two men came into his room while Vargas slept. One of the men stood guard in the doorway. The other man, wearing an overcoat and scarf, asked the other patient if he was Vargas. When the patient responded, \\"No\\", the man turned to Vargas, pulled out a silenced pistol and fired four shots at him, killing Vargas instantly. The gunman then threatened the other patient at gunpoint to keep quiet, saying \\"Don't move, don't say anything. This has nothing to do with you.\\" The gunman then left the hospital room with the second man. A nurse who responded to the sound of the gunshots found Vargas' bullet-ridden body, and was so horrified by the sight that she required medical attention. Police set up a large dragnet around the hospital, but both men escaped. Authorities believed them to be professional hitmen from eastern Europe, who were hired to settle scores between Vargas and rival drug gangs. On January 10, two days after Vargas was killed, his brother Fabio Vargas, 47, and girlfriend Liliana Lozano, 30, were shot to death in a hotel in Palmira. Authorities believed the two killings, coupled with the murder of Leonidas Vargas, were the signs of a bloody war waged to take control of Vargas' cocaine business. The murder of Leonidas Vargas also led to calls by the Patients' Defence Association and other advocacy groups calling for better security measures in Spanish hospitals. Madrid health authorities dismissed such calls, claiming further security measures would only limit people's freedoms and accessibility for visitors. Seven arrests were made in connection with the Leonidas Vargas murder, which authorities believed was committed by an organized group involved in extortion and drug trafficking. On October 25, 2009, 24-year-old Jonathan Andrew O. was arrested in Madrid for allegedly committing the murder itself. He was arrested at the Madrid-Barajas Airport after a flight from the Colombian city Cali.

Ms. Harrelle, who lived with Jutra for a time, played the lover and companion to the film's other protagonist, Claude, who was played by Jutra himself. Her role in the film, as herself, is very telling as it describes the way in which she was perceived as an exotic outsider in French Canada, and people often assumed that she was Haitian, despite having been born in Montreal. These assumptions are played with in the film, as when she performs a song in patois, \\"Ti-zoizeau\\". Johanne was baptized Joan Harrell. She was raised with her two brothers in an orphanage after their African American father died and French Canadian mother fell ill when she was only 3 years old. She later became known in the fashion world as Johanne Harrelle.

This method is part of the IDEF family of modeling languages in the field of systems and software engineering.  Overview  One of the primary mechanisms used for descriptions of the world is relating a story in terms of an ordered sequence of events or activities. The IDEF3 Process Description Capture Method was created to capture descriptions of sequences of activities, which is considered the common mechanisms to describe a situation or process. The primary goal of IDEF3 is to provide a structured method by which a domain expert can express knowledge about the operation of a particular system or organization. Knowledge acquisition is enabled by direct capture of assertions about real-world processes and events in a form that is most natural for capture. IDEF3 supports this kind of knowledge acquisition by providing a reliable and wellstructured approach for process knowledge acquisition, and an expressively, yet easy-to-use, language for information capture and expression. Motives for the development of IDEF3 were the need: * to speed up the process of business systems modeling, * to provides mechanisms to describe this data life cycle information, * to supported project management techniques by an automated tool, * to provide the concepts, syntax, and procedures for building system requirements descriptions, and * to work well both independently and jointly with other methods which address different areas of concentration (e.g., the IDEF0 Function Modeling method) as a complementary addition to the IDEF method family.  History  The original IDEFs were developed since the mid-1970s for the purpose of enhancing communication among people who needed to decide how their existing systems were to be integrated. IDEF0 was designed to allow a graceful expansion of the description of a systems' functions through the process of function decomposition and categorization of the relations between functions (i.e., in terms of the Input, Output, Control, and Mechanism classification). IDEF1 was designed to allow the description of the information that an organization deems important to manage in order to accomplish its objectives. The third IDEF (IDEF2) was originally intended as a user interface modeling method. However, since the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) Program needed a simulation modeling tool, the resulting IDEF2 was a method for representing the time varying behavior of resources in a manufacturing system, providing a framework for specification of math model based simulations. It was the intent of the methodology program within ICAM to rectify this situation but limitation of funding did not allow this to happen. As a result, the lack of a method which would support the structuring of descriptions of the user view of a system has been a major shortcoming of the IDEF system. The basic problem from a methodology point of view is the need to distinguish between a description of what a system (existing or proposed) is supposed to do and a representative simulation model that will predict what a system will do. The latter was the focus of IDEF2, the former is the focus of IDEF3.  IDEF3 basic concepts  = Descriptions and models = IDEF3 want to offer alternative descriptions of the same process from multiple viewpoints on the process. The distinction between descriptions and models, though subtle, is an important one in IDEF3, and both have a precise technical meaning. * The term description is used as a reserved technical term to mean records of empirical observations; that is, descriptions record knowledge that originates in or is based on observations or experience. * The term model is used to mean an idealization of an entity or state of affairs. That is, a model constitutes an idealized system of objects, properties, and relations that is designed to imitate, in certain relevant respects, the character of a given real-world system. Frictionless planes, perfectly rigid bodies, the assumption of point mass, and so forth are representative examples of models. The power of a model comes from its ability to simplify the real-world system it represents and to predict certain facts about that system by virtue of corresponding facts within the model. Thus, a model is a designed system in its own right. Models are idealized systems known to be incorrect but assumed to be close enough to provide reliable predictors for the predefined areas of interest within a domain. A description, on the other hand, is a recording of facts or beliefs about something within the realm of an individual‚Äôs knowledge or experience. Such descriptions are generally incomplete; that is, the person giving a description may omit facts that he or she believes are irrelevant, or which were forgotten in the course of describing the system. Descriptions may also be inconsistent with respect to how others have observed situations within the domain. IDEF3 accommodates these possibilities by providing specific features enabling the capture and organization of alternative descriptions of the same scenario or process, see figure. = Description capture = IDEF focus on Description Capture enabling reuse. Modeling necessitates taking additional steps beyond description capture to resolve conflicting or inconsistent views. This, in turn, generally requires modelers to select or create a single viewpoint and introduce artificial modeling approximations to fill in gaps where no direct knowledge or experience is available. Unlike models, descriptions are not constrained by idealized, testable conditions that must be satisfied, short of simple accuracy. The purpose of description capture may be simply to record and communicate process knowledge or to identify inconsistencies in the way people understand how key processes actually operate. By using a description capture method users need not learn and apply conventions forcing them to produce executable models (e.g., conventions ensuring accuracy, internal consistency, logical coherence, non-redundancy, completeness). Forcing users to model requires them to adopt a model design perspective and risk producing models that do not accurately capture their empirical knowledge of the domain. = Scenarios = The notion of a scenario or story is used as the basic organizing structure for IDEF3 Process Descriptions. A scenario can be thought of as a recurring situation, a set of situations that describe a typical class of problems addressed by an organization or system, or the setting within which a process occurs. Scenarios establish the focus and boundary conditions of a description. Using scenarios in this way exploits the tendency of humans to describe what they know in terms of an ordered sequence of activities within the context of a given scenario or situation. Scenarios also provide a convenient vehicle to organize collections of process-centered knowledge. = Process-Centered Views = IDEF3 Process Schematics are the primary means for capturing, managing, and displaying process-centered knowledge. These schematics provide a graphical medium that helps domain experts and analysts from different application areas communicate knowledge about processes. This includes knowledge about events and activities, the objects that participate in those occurrences, and the constraining relations that govern the behavior of an occurrence. = Object-Centered Views = IDEF3 Object Schematics capture, manage, and display object-centered descriptions of a process‚Äîthat is, information about how objects of various kinds are transformed into other kinds of things through a process, how objects of a given kind change states through a process, or context-setting information about important relations among objects in a process.  IDEF3 process description language  IDEF3 descriptions are developed from two different perspectives: process-centered and object-centered. Because these approaches are not mutually exclusive, IDEF3 allows cross-referencing between them to represent complex process descriptions. = Process Schematics = Process schematics tend to be the most familiar and broadly used component of the IDEF3 method. These schematics provide a visualization mechanism for process-centered descriptions of a scenario. The graphical elements that comprise process schematics include Unit of Behavior (UOB) boxes, precedence links, junctions, referents, and notes. The building blocks here are: Symbols Used for IDEF3 Process Description Schematics. * Unit of Behavior (UOB) boxes * Links : Links are the glue that connect UOB boxes to form representations of dynamic processes. * Simple Precedence Links : Precedence links express temporal precedence relations between instances of one UOB and those of another. * Activation Plots : Activation plots are used to represent activations. * Dashed Links : Dashed links carry no predefined semantics. * Link Numbers : All links have an elaboration and unique link numbers. * Activation Semantics for Nonbranching Process Schematics. * Junctions : Junctions in IDEF3 provide a mechanism to specify the logic of process branching. * UOB Decompositions : Elaborations capture and structure detailed knowledge about processes. * UOB Reference Numbering Scheme : A UOB box number is assigned to each UOB box in an IDEF3 Process Description. * Partial Descriptions : UOB boxes are joined together by links. Since the description capture is the focus of IDEF3, it is possible to conceive of UOBs without links to other parts of an IDEF3 schematic. * Referents : Referents enhance understanding, provide additional meaning, and simplify the construction (i.e., minimize clutter) of both process schematics and object schematics. = Object Schematics = IDEF offers a series of building blocks to express detailed object-centered process information; that is, information about how objects of various kinds are transformed into other kinds of things through a process, or how objects of a given kind change states through a process. * Objects : An object of a certain kind, like a chassis, will be represented simply by a circle containing an appropriate label. * Object States : A certain kind of object being in a certain state will be represented by a circle with a label that captures the kind itself and a corresponding state, representing thereby the type, or class, of objects that are in that state. * Object schematics : The construction of complex representations built from kind symbols and object state symbols. * Transition Schematics : The first and most basic construct is the basic state transition schematic or simply, transition schematic.

These flamethrowers were used in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. Construction Design work upon a simple flamethrower for the Polish underground, suitable for clandestine production in ordinary workshops, of readily available materials, started in 1942 on request of the Home Army main headquarters. Its main purpose was to be used against armoured vehicles. There were several designs produced, of which the most popular was the K pattern, becoming a sort of standard weapon of the Polish underground.Skotnicki, M. Miotacz ognia wz√≥r \\"K\\" The exact number produced is difficult to estimate, but it was several hundreds (in one workshop of Antoni Wiƒôckowski in Warsaw alone, there were about 400 produced). Its production was concentrated in Warsaw. Due to production conditions, many flamethrowers differed in details. The main parts of the flamethrower were two interconnected cylindrical steel fuel tanks (15 l capacity total, height 45 cm, diameter 16 cm), and a compressed air bottle (6 l, height 60 cm, diameter 12 cm). This tank assembly was fitted with straps to permit it to be carried on the operator's back. Fuel was a mixture of diesel fuel (75%) and gasoline (25%). There was a valve between the fuel and air tanks. A rubber fuel hose connected the assembly with a fuel gun, which was a pipe 114-cm long, fitted with a valve at the muzzle, operated with a handle. After opening a fuel gun valve, the fuel was propelled with compressed air and ignited by a simple mesh basket wrapped with a flaming rope, at the muzzle of the fuel gun (the rope had to be ignited before the weapon could be used). Normal way of operation were short 1-second bursts - about 30 could be fired. The mesh basket with the rope was extinguished, putting a tin can on it. The K-pattern flamethrower appeared a successful weapon, considering its primitive design and conditions of manufacturing. Its main flaw was that the air pressure decreased during operation, and so successive bursts had a progressively shorter range. The weapon could be refuelled by fuel carriers and the compressed air bottle replaced with a new one, in a procedure that took about 4 minutes. A flamethrower in action Combat usage A flamethrower section consisted of 4 soldiers: a commander, a gunner carrying the flamethrower and two carriers of fuel cans and spare air bottles. At the outbreak of Warsaw Uprising the Polish forces had only 30 flamethrowers - many had been lost in secret stores discovered by the Germans, and a number remained in stores that were not available for insurgents. Nonetheless, they were actively used in sectors of most fierce street fighting during the uprising. A number of flamethrowers were also produced during the uprising. Most sections acted alone, but there was also one flamethrower company formed. Sources * Skotnicki, Mariusz (in Polish): Miotacz ognia wz√≥r \\"K\\", in: Nowa Technika Wojskowa 7/1998, p. 59\\\\.

First as Head of the Municipal Department of Arts & Culture of the Bavarian state capital Munich. Then he held a ministerial office as the State Minister for Culture and Media and was thus a member of the national government of Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. During his time in office, Nida- R√ºmelin voiced criticism on the implementation of the Bologna Process, the European reformation process of the higher education. He recently criticized German policies aiming to increase the tertiary education rates and recommended instead to further foster the German \\"dual system\\" of vocational training. His book How the rush to universities is leading to a crisis of professional and academic education stimulated a nationwide debate on education policy.Nida-R√ºmelin, J., Der Akademisierungswahn. Zur Krise beruflicher und akademischer Bildung, Hamburg: edition K√∂rber-Stiftung, 2014. Nida-R√ºmelin publishes inside and outside of academia. His non-academic articles are regularly published in major German and European newspaper such as S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Zeit, Le Monde, La Repubblica on a range of topics including Europe, economics and ethics, as well as the digitalisation of our society. The article The Case for a Change of Course in European Policy, co-authored with Peter Bofinger and J√ºrgen Habermas, was translated and published in 12 languages.  Philosophy  Nida- R√ºmelin propounds an approach to practical philosophy based on his theory of \\"Structural Rationality.\\" As an alternative to consequentialism, it avoids the dichotomy between moral and extra-moral rationality that is typical in Kantian approaches, and is thus able to integrate a vast complexity of practical reasons that result in coherent practice. Whereas for Kant, rule orientation is constitutive for moral agency, the structural account of rationality extends to the more general idea that rationality consists in embedding situated or point-wise optimization within the broader structure of agency. The intimate connection between morality and rationality that Kant postulates becomes one aspect of the broader, all-encompassing account of acting in such a way that fits into a desirable structure of agency. The practice of giving and taking reasons is understood as aiming at both interpersonal and intrapersonal structural coherence. In this way, the account of structural rationality avoids the dichotomy of reasons ‚Äì moral versus extra-moral ‚Äì and allows us to make use of the conceptual frame of decision and game theory in order to clarify some essential aspects of practical coherence. For example, the postulates of the von Neumann/Morgenstern utility theorem are now interpreted as rules of practical coherence and not as axioms of consequentialist optimization. The utility function becomes a mere representation of coherent preferences and expected utility maximization can no longer be interpreted as optimizing the consequences of one's actions. The term ‚Äúutility‚Äù is misleading and should be replaced by ‚Äúsubjective valuation.‚Äù The deontological character of structural rationality is compatible with using the conceptual framework of decision theory. This may come as a surprise, but is only due to a logically stringent interpretation of the utility theorem and other theorems of decision and game theory. The usual economic interpretation is only one among many others and in fact, this interpretation is incompatible with most of the practical reasons that we take to be indispensable. The structural account of rationality is embedded in the everyday practice of giving and taking reasons. Drawing on these considerations, Nida-R√ºmelin deals with the relationship between philosophy and Lebenswelt (life-world)/ Lebensform (form of life). His position is inspired by Wittgenstein's philosophy. In contrary to Wittgenstein, Nida-R√ºmelin emphasizes the unity of practice, viz. the unity of the person (the agent) and societal interactions. Individuals strive for coherence regarding their beliefs, epistemic attitudes, actions and emotive attitudes. Taking this as a starting point any incoherences can be criticized and are the impetus for philosophy in general, and for ethical theory more specifically. Philosophical theory has to be careful not to leave the common ground of the human practice of giving and taking reasons. It cannot reinvent reasons; it cannot postulate some principles and deduce moral duties from them. Ethical principles can only be systematizations of a given practice of reasoning. Nida-R√ºmelin takes the side of pragmatism in its conflict against rationalism.Nida-R√ºmelin, J., Philosophie und Lebensform, Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2009. His theory is characterized as humanism that starts from the conditio humana, i.e. the common elements of the human condition over time and between cultures. Humanism has both an anthropological and an ethical dimension. The anthropological dimension is presented in core normative concepts like (structural) rationality, freedom and responsibility. Humanists think that the ability to act and believe and feel based on reasons is essential in order to understand the human condition. This does not however directly imply humanistic ethics. Human agency requires the ability to weigh reasons and act upon the result of weighing reasons, but it does not ensure morally acceptable agency. Even an officer in a Nazi concentration camp may act by weighing reasons. Humanistic ethics must discriminate between good and bad reasons, good and bad forms of reasoning, good and bad forms of emotive attitudes. Hating somebody because he lives a different life is irrational, as seen in the hatred of homosexuals in a majority heterosexual community, or hatred based on skin colour. The structural account of rationality is optimistic insofar as it assumes that clarifying reasons that strive towardsat intra- and interpersonally coherent agency and belief allow the elimination of bad, misleading reasons of all the three kinds mentioned above (practical, theoretical, and emotive reasons). Therefore, the relationship between anthropological humanism and ethical humanism is not deductive, but pragmatic. Those who take anthropological humanism seriously tend to embrace a humanistic ethos and those who reject humanistic principles of agency tend to fight against anthropological humanism, expressed in different forms: social Darwinism, racism, reductionist naturalism, chauvinist nationalism, discriminating sexism and other forms of anti-humanism. Since communication plays a central role in this form of humanism, Nida-R√ºmelin presented an account of humanistic semantics. Nida-R√ºmelin defends a basic, non- ontological, non-metaphysical realism against instrumentalism in the philosophy of science, positivism, and post-modernism in practical philosophy, the humanities and the social sciences. Realism is not a metaphysical postulate but it is part of our everyday practice of giving and taking reasons (form of life). This practice requires facts that individuals find by developing arguments for and against certain hypotheses. Realism is part of our way of life and this makes it implausible to assume that the sciences and humanities can be understood in an anti-realist manner, as is assumed by instrumentalists, constructivists and post-modernists. It is the continuity between everyday life (form of life) and science that speaks in favor the existence of facts. They are not constituted by beliefs, neither by the beliefs of an individual (solipsism), nor by the beliefs of collectives (cultures) or even ideal discourse communities as seen in the work of J√ºrgen Habermas, or in Hilary Putnam's so-called internal realism, which is in fact a version of idealism.Nida-R√ºmelin, J, ‚ÄûMoralische Tatsachen.‚Äú in Moralischer Realismus? Zur koh√§rentistischen Metaethik Julian Nida-R√ºmelins, hrsg. von von der Pfordten, Dietmar, 17‚Äì57. M√ºnster: Mentis, 2015. Naturalism is the dominant metaphysical attitude in the natural sciences as well as in a good part of the social sciences and even in the humanities (sometimes seen in a combination of post-modernism and naturalism). Nida-R√ºmelin shows that this implicit or explicit naturalism cannot be maintained. The impetus behind most of his arguments against naturalism is pragmatist: he takes the constituency of human agency as given and tries to show that these constituents are incompatible with naturalism. There is no plausible naturalistic interpretation of reason, freedom, and responsibility. Nida-R√ºmelin first presented his arguments in a trilogy of books: the first about practical reason (2001), the second about freedom (2005), and the third about responsibility (2011).Nida-R√ºmelin's books are titled in German: √úber menschliche Freiheit. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2005; Strukturelle Rationalit√§t: Ein philosophischer Essay √ºber praktische Vernunft. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2001; Verantwortung. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2011. Practical reason, epistemic and practical freedom, epistemic, practical and emotive responsibility are interpreted as three aspects of the same phenomenon: being affected by reasons. This does not mean that the chain of reasoning does not come to an end. On the contrary, here again Nida-R√ºmelin is close to Wittgenstein in claiming that all reasoning ends in the indisputable elements of our shared form of life. It is irrational to doubt everything, or as Wittgenstein claims, there are some things that a sensible human man will not doubt.Wittgenstein, On Certainty, Basil Blackwell, 1969. Moreover, reasoning is relevant for actions. To doubt it would mean that human beings can transcend their human condition. As Peter Strawson argued in an influential article 'Freedom and Resentment,' being reasonable means that individuals do not exclusively depend on factors beyond their control. What individuals think to be right is relevant for what they do.Strawson, P., Freedom and resentment and other essays. Routledge, 2008. There cannot be any form of naturalistic determination that excludes reasoning itself. Nida-R√ºmelin takes the argument against the reduction of logic to psychology (Frege, Husserl) as an argument in favor of the gradual autonomy of reason. In being able to reason logically, individuals follows logical laws that cannot be identified with psychological or neurophysiological data. Additionally, Nida-R√ºmelin takes the insights of Alonzo Church and Kurt G√∂del from the 1930s regarding non-computability showing that reasoning cannot be exclusively algorithmic.G√∂del, K, ‚Äû√úber formal unentscheidbare S√§tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I.‚Äú Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik und Physik 38, Nr. 1 (1931): 173‚Äì198. As a naturalist position takes causal processes to be algorithmic, reasoning cannot be naturalized. Humanism in Nida-R√ºmelin's sense therefore excludes deductionist naturalism.Nida-R√ºmelin, J, Humanistische Reflexionen, Berlin: Suhrkamp, 2016.  Works  * 1993 Kritik des Konsequentialismus.

He is portrayed by Vincent Kartheiser. Kartheiser has won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series twice along with the cast of Mad Men. Biography Pete Campbell was born to an upper-crust White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Manhattan family in 1934. His mother, Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Campbell (n√©e Dyckman) (Channing Chase), descended from an old Dutch family that had arrived in New Amsterdam and at one point \\"owned pretty much everything north of 125th Street\\". Pete has a strained relationship with his parents, who are emotionally distant and disapprove of their son's decision to go into advertising. In Season 2, after his father dies on American Airlines Flight 1 over Jamaica Bay, Pete is unable to cry. Upon their father's death, Pete's older brother, Bud (Rich Hutchman), examines their father's finances to determine their inheritance from the family trust. Bud discovers their father, through years of a lavish lifestyle, depleted the money put into the trust. Bud tells Pete this news, and both seem unsurprised. Following this revelation, Pete states that he, in fact, hated his father. Later in Season 2, Pete reveals that he also hates his mother. Bud also resents their parents, but is treated and regarded by both parents as the favored son. Displaying a mutual resentment of their mother, Bud and Pete reminisce over Alfred Hitchcock's film Rope, loosely based on the story of Leopold and Loeb. When Pete's mother suggests that any possibility of Pete and his wife Trudy's (Alison Brie) adopting a child would be unacceptable and lead to his being disinherited, Pete retaliates by telling her his father squandered the family's life savings. (This fact originally was intended as a secret that Pete and Bud meant to keep from her.) In Season 6, when Pete's mother is forced to live with him in his apartment, he takes pleasure in exploiting her developing Alzheimer's disease to control her. In Season 1, Pete often expresses a desire to be treated seriously in business. He displays a genuine knack for it, but is unwilling to put in work and seems to be both overly willing to get by on his family name and unwilling to accept that it's his family name, not his own merits, that have gotten him as far as he has come. He can also appear spiteful and cold to people he feels have mistreated him in some way. For example, he attempts to destroy Don Draper‚Äôs (Jon Hamm) life by revealing that Don stole another man‚Äôs identity; in later seasons, however, Pete saves Don from being exposed as an imposter. Pete is said to have attended The Buckley School, Deerfield Academy, and Dartmouth College, and it is implied that he was in the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at the latter. He is one of only two main characters who is a nonsmoker (apart from marijuana on only one occasion), the other being Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse). =At Sterling Cooper= Pete is an account executive at Sterling Cooper until December 1963, when he leaves to join Don Draper's new firm. His position at Sterling Cooper entails arranging meetings with clients, as well as wining and dining them (and occasionally, arranging meetings for them with prostitutes). Early in the show, he appears to be unsatisfied with his position and would rather work on the creative end. To this end, he attempts to undermine Draper several times by pitching his own copy to clients. One of these occurrences nearly gets him fired, but Bert Cooper forestalls that because, regardless of Pete's skills or lack thereof, his family connections are important for bringing in new business for the firm. At the beginning of Season 3, the new British management promotes Pete to Head of Accounts. He is overjoyed until he discovers that he is actually a \\"co-head\\" of the department, sharing the position with Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton). Pete becomes enraged and lashes out at Cosgrove, despite the fact that the new management clearly intends to play the two off each other. Pete later distinguishes himself in the position, however, particularly by helping the firm appeal to the previously untapped \\"Negro market\\". Pete later joins the new agency formed by Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and Lane Pryce (Jared Harris), with the understanding that he is to become a partner, bringing his Sterling Cooper clients with him to their new company. =At McCann-Erickson= After the absorption of SC&P; into McCann, Pete successfully brings over his clients and becomes well liked at the new office. In the series finale, Duck Phillips (Mark Moses) approaches Pete with a lucrative job offer in Wichita with Lear Jet, which Pete flatly refuses at first but later accepts. =Marriage and relationships= Pete marries Trudy Vogel, a young woman from a nouveau riche family, in March 1960. It is implied that Pete does not know her very well before he marries her; after their honeymoon, he tells his coworkers that she is much funnier than he imagined her to be. The two purchase an apartment on Park Avenue in New York City's Upper East Side. Pete's parents refuse to help the couple pay for the apartment, but Trudy's parents eventually pitch in, much to Pete's discomfort. Trudy's parents also pressure the couple to try to have a baby, which Pete is reluctant to do. After 18 months of trying to conceive, the two attend a fertility clinic, where it is discovered that Trudy has fertility problems. Trudy and her parents pressure Pete to look into adoption. Pete is at first uncomfortable with the idea but agrees to think about it, and mentions this to his brother. Bud tells their mother, who disapproves, stating that people of Pete's social status should not be picking from \\"discards\\". When Pete finds out that Trudy has put their name on a list to meet with a prominent local adoption agency, he shouts at her, throws the dinner she cooked off their balcony, and forbids her from going through with the adoption. The situation worsens. This leads to a rift in the marriage, which worsens when Pete is forced to drop an account from Clearasil, which was given to him by Trudy's father Tom (Joe O'Connor), an executive in the company who already disliked Pete. Trudy decides to stay at her parents' house during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Pete refuses to go with her, stating that if he is going to die, he wants to die in Manhattan. Pete and his mother are unaware that Pete has already fathered a child with his co-worker, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss). Pete initially meets Peggy on her first day as Don's new secretary, in March 1960. A lower middle class Catholic from Brooklyn, Peggy tells Pete that she has just graduated from Miss Deaver's Secretarial School. Pete makes rude comments about her dowdy appearance, for which Don scolds him. Later that night, however, after his bachelor party, Pete shows up at Peggy's apartment drunk. Despite his offensive remarks earlier that day, the two sleep together. Months later, Peggy and Pete again have a sexual encounter on Pete's office couch, early in the morning before the other employees arrive. Though Peggy begins to arrive early for work regularly, the two have no further sexual liaisons. During the Season 1 finale, it is revealed that Peggy  who has put on a considerable amount of weight over the course of the season  is pregnant with Pete's child. She gives birth to a boy. Early in Season 2, Peter meets Susie (Sarah Wright) after a casting call for Playtex, and they talk in the elevator. Much to Pete's surprise, she lives with her mother, but that doesn't stop them from sleeping together. During the Season 2 finale, when everyone in the office has left for the day, Pete asks Peggy to come sit down with him. Pete tells Peggy he thinks she is \\"perfect\\", and then confesses that he is in love with her and wishes he had married her. This declaration prompts Peggy to finally admit that she had his baby and gave it up for adoption two years before. After Peggy reveals this, Pete sits in shock. Pete is last seen sitting alone in his dark office, holding a rifle on his lap. It is the same rifle he bought on store credit in Season 1, when he returned a ceramic chip- and-dip he and Trudy received as a wedding gift. At the start of Season 3, which takes place about six months later, Pete and Trudy seem much closer: he immediately calls her when he gets a promotion, and there is no mention of adoption. They seem like a very happy couple dancing the Charleston at Roger Sterling's (John Slattery) garden party, and Harry Crane's (Rich Sommer) wife is jealous of them. When Trudy goes out of town weeks later, though, Pete feels very lonely and coerces his neighbor's young German au pair Gudrun (Nina Rausch) into sleeping with him; actor Vincent Kartheiser said that the script said that the \\"au pair\\" was supposed to kiss his character back, but the actress portraying her didn't do it, which led some people to say Pete raped her. The man she works for comes over to confront Pete in their apartment. When Trudy kisses Pete after returning home, he is noticeably distraught, and he later tells Trudy, \\"I don't want you to go away anymore without me.\\" By the end of Season 3, it is apparent that some form of fence-mending has taken place between Pete and Tom, revealed in Season 4 to be Trudy's doing. Pete is able to bring the Clearasil account to the newly formed firm Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and Pryce. In Season 4, the agency drops Clearasil because of a conflict with another account, but Pete is able to manipulate his father-in- law into giving him several larger accounts from that company. In the Season 4 episode \\"The Rejected,\\" Pete finds out that Trudy is pregnant, much to his delight. Trudy gives birth in the 11th episode of the season to their daughter, Tamsin Vogel Campbell, known as \\"Tammy\\" (an obvious gesture to his father-in-law). In the early years of their marriage, Pete had trouble reconciling his own ambitions with that of his wife. Pete was a domineering husband, such as when he scolded Trudy for signing up for an adoption agency without his permission. Also, he was angry at her for not sleeping with her ex-beau, who, now a publishing executive, could have gotten a story Pete published in a prestigious publication. Pete engaged in at least three extramarital affairs in the first years of their marriage. However, after being caught by a neighbor, Pete confesses his infidelity to Trudy. After a short period of tension their marriage seemed to improve, something that aligned with a corresponding improvement in Pete's work status. However, in Seasons 4 and 5, Pete seemed to lose his dominance in the relationship, such as when Trudy \\"forbids\\" him to give their money to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. By the start of Season 5, Pete and Trudy have moved with their baby daughter to a new home in Cos Cob, a village in the affluent commuter city of Greenwich, Connecticut, which sits on the New Haven Line. Having never learned to drive, Pete commutes by rail to the city. By July 1966, he has enrolled in a driver education course in order to gain a license. Living in Greenwich has a negative effect on the Manhattan-raised Pete, who begins to feel restless in his marriage, homelife, and career. He begins an affair with Beth Dawes (Alexis Bledel), the unhappy wife of a co-commuter, which ends after she has a round of electroshock therapy to cure her undiagnosed depression and, as a result, forgets who he is. In Season 6, Pete indulges in a fling with a neighborhood woman, whose husband finds out and beats the woman at the Campbells' doorway. As a result, Trudy tells Pete she knows about his infidelities, and she therefore let him have a bachelor pad in Manhattan, so he would have his affairs there, and not in their home turf. She throws him out, although she refuses to divorce, which she deems would acknowledge failure. However, in a later episode, \\"For Immediate Release\\", Pete loses his father-in-law's account after they run into each other at a brothel. In revenge, Pete tells Trudy what he saw. She makes it plain she doesn't believe him and wouldn't care if he were telling the truth, after which she throws him out. In the season 6 finale, he comes by to get a few things, as he is driving out west to open up a new branch of the agency in California. He offers a sincere apology to Trudy, who accepts and lets him say goodbye to his daughter. Beginning in Season 7, Pete debuts his relationship with Bonnie, a real estate agent based in Los Angeles. However, when Pete makes a visit to New York City in Season 7, Tammy does not recognize him and seems scared by his presence. Pete later, hypocritically, accuses Trudy of being a bad parent when she stays out late on a date, after which Trudy coldly retorts: \\"you're not part of this family anymore.\\" Pete reacts by pushing the bottle of beer he was drinking into a cake Trudy had baked and walks out the house without further comment. In the latter part of the season Pete seeks reconciliation and asks Trudy to relocate with him to Wichita, with their daughter. Trudy at first refuses his heartfelt request, admitting she still loves Pete but can't forget his adultery. Eventually, however, she agrees to renew their marriage. The reunited Campbell family is last seen happily boarding a Lear Jet for their new life in Kansas.

Watching on are, from left, Laura Bush, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President George W. Bush and an unidentified family member. Condoleezza Rice served as United States Secretary of State under George W. Bush. She was preceded by Colin Powell and followed by Hillary Clinton. As secretary of state she traveled widely and initiated many diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Bush administration. Confirmation hearings On November 16, 2004, Bush nominated Rice to be Secretary of State. On January 26, 2005, the Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 85-13. The negative votes, the most cast against any nomination for Secretary of State since 1825, came from Senators who, according to Senator Barbara Boxer, wanted \\"to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism.\\" Their reasoning was that Rice had acted irresponsibly in equating Hussein's regime with Islamist terrorism and some could not accept her previous record. Senator Robert Byrd voted against Rice's appointment, indicating that she \\"has asserted that the President holds far more of the war power than the Constitution grants him.\\" Staff Rice's senior advisor was Shirin R. Tahir-Kheli. Major initiatives As Secretary of State, Rice championed the expansion of democratic governments. Rice stated that 9/11 was rooted in \\"oppression and despair\\" and so, the US must advance democratic reform and support basic rights throughout the greater Middle East. Rice has also reformed and restructured the department, as well as US diplomacy as a whole. \\"Transformational Diplomacy\\" is the goal that Rice describes as \\"work[ing] with our many partners around the world ... [and] build[ing] and sustain[ing] democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.\\" Rice's Transformational Diplomacy involves five core elements: *Relocating American diplomats to the places in the world where they are needed most, such as China, India, Brazil, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, and Lebanon. *Requiring diplomats to serve some time in hardship locations such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, and Angola; gain expertise in at least two regions; and become fluent in two foreign languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, or Urdu. *Focusing on regional solutions to problems like terrorism, drug trafficking, and diseases. *Working with other countries on a bilateral basis to help them build a stronger infrastructure, and decreasing foreign nations' dependence on American hand-outs and assistance. *Creating a high-level position, Director of Foreign Assistance, to oversee US foreign aid, thus de-fragmenting US foreign assistance. Rice said that these moves were needed to help \\"maintain security, fight poverty, and make democratic reforms\\" in these countries and would help improve foreign nations's legal, economic, healthcare, and educational systems. Another aspect of Transformational Diplomacy is the emphasis on finding regional solutions. Rice also pressed for finding transnational solutions as well, stating that \\"in the 21st century, geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically, politically and culturally. This creates new opportunities but it also presents new challenges, especially from transnational threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation and drug smuggling and trafficking in persons and disease.\\" Rice unveils her plan for restructuring American foreign policy, which she calls \\"Transformational Diplomacy,\\" during a January 18, 2006 speech at Georgetown University. Another aspect of the emphasis on regional solutions is the implementation of small, agile, \\"rapid-response\\" teams to tackle problems like disease, instead of the traditional approach of calling on experts in an embassy. Rice explained that this means moving diplomats out of the \\"back rooms of foreign ministries\\" and putting more effort into \\"localizing\\" the State Department's diplomatic posture in foreign nations. The Secretary emphasized the need for diplomats to move into the largely unreached \\"bustling new population centers\\" and to spread out \\"more widely across countries\\" in order to become more familiar with local issues and people. Rice restructured US foreign assistance, naming Randall L. Tobias, an AIDS relief expert, as administrator of USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development). Tobias, as a deputy secretary of state, had the job of focusing foreign assistance efforts and de-fragmenting the disparate aid offices to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Rice says these initiatives are necessary because of the highly \\"extraordinary time\\" in which Americans live. She compares the moves to the historic initiatives taken after World War II, which she claims helped stabilize Europe as it is known today. Rice states that her Transformational Diplomacy is not merely about \\"influencing\\" or \\"reporting on\\" governments, but \\"changing people's lives\\" through tackling the issues like AIDS, the education of women, and the defeat of violent extremism. In early 2007, Rice indicated that State Department employees were \\"volunteering in large numbers,\\" yet Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed concerns regarding a request from Rice that military personnel fill jobs in Iraq that are the responsibility of the State Department. Rice meets with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at a trilateral meeting in Jerusalem, February 2007. Travels and aspirations Condoleezza Rice visits Governor General of Canada, Micha√´lle Jean in Ottawa, Ontario the Canadian capital. As of September 7, 2008 Secretary Rice has visited 83 countries, traveling for 2118.19 hours (88.26 days) over a total distance of . On October 30, 2005, Rice attended a memorial service in Montgomery, Alabama, in Rice's home state, for Rosa Parks, an inspiration for the American Civil Rights Movement. Rice stated, that she and others who grew up in Alabama during the height of Parks's activism might not have realized her impact on their lives at the time, \\"but I can honestly say that without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here today as secretary of state.\\" On October 1, 2007, Rice told children (at New York's Public School No. 154, the Harriet Tubman Learning Center) that she would not run for president, slept for 6¬Ω hours a night and was not afraid of war zones. Asked how it felt \\"to be a lady with such a powerful job,\\" she said: \\"Sometimes you don't feel all that powerful.\\" Rep. Charlie Rangel, who was visiting the school with Rice, teasingly suggested Rice aim for the White House. Middle East =Gaza withdrawal= Rice worked to persuade Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories and free up commerce and travel between the two areas. During the summer of 2005, Rice encouraged Israeli leadership to withdraw from settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. Rice spent April 2005 raising support among Arab leaders. In July, she visited the region to \\"help bring the weight of the United States\\" to the discussions. In September, Rice hailed the successful withdrawal as a victory for both Israel and Palestine, saying, \\"This is a historic moment for both sides, and the commitment of both sides to a successful disengagement process has been impressive.\\" Gaza is now under Palestinian control once again. However, Palestinians complained that they were not able to travel through border crossings in and out of Gaza, which had stifled commerce. =Border Crossings Deal= Rice announces brokering of the deal to open Gaza border crossings after a sleepless 48-hour negotiation. In November 2005, Rice renegotiated an opening of the Gaza border crossings. Secretary Rice extended her visit to Jerusalem for a mediation session November 14, meeting alternately with Israel and Palestinian delegations. Rice negotiated differences between Israel and Palestine that included a proposed blacklist of Palestinians that had been detained by Israel and a concern that future violence would induce a renewed closure of the border crossings. By November 15, Rice announced an agreement to open Gaza's borders, with a system of transportation between Gaza and the West Bank, defining operations for transporting cargo and people across the border and allowing Gaza to reopen its international airport and begin work on a seaport. This included the Rafah border crossing, Palestine's only land link to a country other than Israel. It also included monitoring of the crossings by officials from the European Union. Gideon Levy, reporter for an Israeli newspaper, complained Rice had accomplished little: \\"in what was considered the 'achievement' of the current visit, Israel also promised to open the Karni crossing. Karni will be open, one can assume, only slightly more than the 'safe passage,' which never opened following the previous futile visit.\\" =Israeli-Palestinian conflict= Map showing electoral districts and areas of formal Palestinian control (green) Rice pushed for peaceful, democratic elections in Palestine following the death of Yasser Arafat. Rice asserted that \\"there should be the ability of Palestinian people to participate in the elections\\" and claimed that democratic elections would represent \\"a key step in the process of building a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state.\\" Rice, alluding to the US-labeled terrorist organization Hamas, stated that \\"there should be no place in the political process for groups or individuals who refuse to renounce terror and violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and disarm,\\" saying, \\"You cannot have one foot in politics and the other foot in terror.\\" However she said that holding the elections had been the right choice, even after Hamas' victory.Heilman, Uriel. \\"Would Condoleezza Rice as Veep choice undercut GOP‚Äôs Israel argument?\\" JTA, July 15, 2012. Rice persuaded Israel to allow Israeli Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote in the Palestinian Authority elections. Israel allowed Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote in the January 25, 2006 parliamentary elections, while banning Hamas, which officially calls for Israel's destruction, from campaigning there. Rice lauded the turnout and congratulated President Abbas, while informing the victorious Hamas that it would \\"have to make some difficult choices,\\" saying, \\"Those who win elections have an obligation to govern democratically ... It now inherits the obligations of a Palestinian government, authority, that go back now for more than a decade to recognize the right of Israel to exist, to renounce violence, to disarm militias, as is the case in the roadmap, and to find a peaceful solution in two states.\\" In response to the Hamas victory, Israel withheld funds belonging to the Palestinian Authority, and reinforced restrictions on movement in and out of the Gaza Strip and within the West Bank. Rice stated: \\"Clearly, [Hamas] cannot govern in a circumstance in which they cannot represent a responsible government before the international system.\\" Rice told her Israeli counterpart that \\"the economic boycott on the Hamas-led Palestinian government is effective and in the international community will continue to maintain the boycott.\\" George Soros faulted Rice for refusing to deal with Hamas. \\"[N]o progress is possible as long as the Bush administration and the Ehud Olmert government persist in their current position of refusing to recognize a unity government that includes Hamas.

This was playing into the hands of the hard-liners in Hamas, increasing the influence of Syria and Iran, and would escalate the fighting, Soros said. Immediately following Hamas' victory in the elections, Rice attempted to garner international support in demanding that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist. By April, Hamas officials appeared to publicly state that they are willing to work toward recognizing Israel. Under their terms, Israel would have to fully withdraw from occupied territories,Israel and the Palestinians: Key terms, BBC including Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/254A8588-3089-495E-9D54-FE87479080DB.htm Hamas 'willing' to recognise Israel.

Rice arrived in Cairo, Egypt, March 4, 2008, in the latest diplomatic effort to revive a Middle East peace process sidetracked by violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Rice was scheduled to meet with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on March 5, 2008. In late December 2008, after Israel broke the Gaza Strip ceasefire with an incursion into the Gaza Strip, Rice kept outgoing President George W. Bush abreast of the situation. \\"The United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and holds Hamas responsible for breaking the cease-fire and for the renewal of violence in Gaza,\\" Rice said in a statement. \\"The cease-fire should be restored immediately. The United States calls on all concerned to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the innocent people of Gaza.\\" In early January 2009, Rice went to New York and personally negotiated United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860 supporting a ceasefire, but then abstained on its 14-0 passage. Explaining the abstention, Rice said the US wanted to first see the outcome of the Egyptian peace efforts, but allowed the resolution to go forward because it was a step in the right direction. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert later claimed he humiliated Rice by persuading U.S. President Bush to instruct her not to vote for it. Rice spokesman Sean McCormack has called Olmert's claims \\"100-percent, totally, completely not true,\\" but on January 14, Olmert aides said the Israeli leader told the story as it happened. Olmert has also claimed that Bush broke off a speech he was giving in Philadelphia to take his call, and that the abstention embarrassed Rice. =2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict= Rice delivers a special briefing on Middle East Peace in the State Department Briefing Room, July 21, 2006. In mid-July 2006, the Middle East peace process encountered a new obstacle on a different front when Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon launched rocket attacks into Israel and ambushed Israeli convoys, kidnapping two soldiers and killing three, sparking what has become known as the 2006 Israel- Lebanon conflict. Rice immediately condemned the act, calling Hezbollah a \\"terrorist organization\\" and saying that the action \\"undermines regional stability and goes against the interests of both the Israeli and Lebanese people,\\" specifically calling on Syria to \\"use its influence to support a positive outcome.\\"\\"Actions in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon\\", United States Department of State, online posting, state.gov, July 12, 2006. That day, Rice was one of the first to speak directly to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni concerning the incident. Israel initiated aerial bombardments against Lebanon on July 13 and sent in land troops on July 23 to take out rocket launching sites that were shelling Northern Israeli cities, as well as to look for and recover the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers. During the conflict, Rice supported Israel's right to defend itself from Hezbollah attacks, she repeatedly cautioned Israel to be responsible in minimizing collateral damage. Before the major fighting began, Rice demanded that both Israel and Lebanon \\"act with restraint to resolve this incident peacefully and to protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure.\\" She also continued to pressure Syria to take a more active positive role throughout the crisis, accusing Syria of \\"sheltering the people who have been perpetrating these acts\\" and calling on it \\"to act responsibly and stop the use of its territory for these kinds of activities[,] to bring all pressure on those that it is harbouring to stop this and to return these soldiers and to allow the situation to be de-escalated.\\"\\"US's Rice urges Israel to exercise restraint\\", July 14, 2006, oneindia. Rice, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi work to lay the foundation for Resolution 1701, which ultimately imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. When Rice arrived in the Middle East in July 2006, one of her first moves was an unannounced visit to Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora to praise Siniora's \\"courage and steadfastness\\" and show US support for the Lebanese people.Rice holds key talks in Lebanon. July 24, 2006.

At a time when progress appeared possible in the region, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a suspected Hezbollah hideout in Qana, Lebanon, that killed 20‚Äì60 civilians. The airstrike seemed to sour support for Israel's endeavor and Lebanon cancelled a visit by Rice as a result.Israel strike kills at least 54, Lebanon shuns Rice. July 30, 2006. While the tragedy was a setback in the negotiation process, it seemed to be a turning point for Israel, who, afterward, began taking a path toward a cease-fire. Before Rice left the region on July 27, she was able to negotiate a 48-hour halt on Israeli air-raids. Rice appears with former UN Secretary General Annan to announce the successful passage of Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Rice returned to the Middle East on July 29, when the outlines of the ceasefire to come began to take shape. Rice demanded that the global community do what it could to ensure that the Mideast region would never again return to the \\"status quo ante.\\" Rice saw the situation as an opportunity to create a new environment in which Israel and Lebanon could live in peace, and in which Lebanon could have full control over all its territories without Hezbollah acting as a \\"state within a state,\\" being able to launch terrorist attacks on Israel. Building on the two resolutions that came out of the G8 summit and the steps that had been taken at the conference in Rome, Italy in late July, Rice worked with other leaders at the United Nations to pass UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on August 11, 2006, which sought to resolve the crisis. The ceasefire went into effect on August 14. The ceasefire that Rice helped broker provided for a full cessation of hostilities, a Lebanese- led international force to take the place of the Israeli forces, the disarmament of Hezbollah, full control of the Lebanese government to Lebanon, and an absence of paramilitary forces (including and implying Hezbollah) south of the Litani River; it also emphasizes the need for the immediate release of the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Rice lauded the outcome and expressed pleasure that the hostilities in the area had been brought to an end. Though there were sporadic, but small, spurts of violence after the ceasefire took effect, it has ultimately sustained, while international peacekeeping forces began to replace Israeli forces. On October 2, 2006, the last Israeli forces were withdrawn, allowing the UN and the Lebanese military to take over.\\"Israel Leaves Lebanon to UN\\", online posting, metro.co.uk, July 24, 2006.

Egypt In February 2005, Rice abruptly postponed a visit to Egypt, reflecting displeasure at the jailing of a leading opposition figure, Ayman Nour. Nour, head of the liberal Tomorrow Party, was reported to have been brutally interrogated. Nour was freed by Egyptian authorities in March 2005, and began a campaign for the Egyptian presidency. In June 2005, Rice addressed democracy in the Middle East at the American University in Cairo. She stated: \\"There are those who say that democracy leads to chaos, or conflict, or terror. In fact, the opposite is true. ... Ladies and Gentlemen: Across the Middle East today, millions of citizens are voicing their aspirations for liberty and for democracy ... demanding freedom for themselves and democracy for their countries. To these courageous men and women, I say today: All free nations will stand with you as you secure the blessings of your own liberty\\" Nour finished second in Egypt's presidential race, held in 2005. In December 2005, Egypt imprisoned Nour on forgery charges that were disputed by human-rights groups. In February 2006, Rice visited Hosni Mubarak yet never spoke Nour's name publicly. When asked about him at a news conference, she referred to his situation as one of Egypt's setbacks. Days later, Mubarak told a government newspaper that Rice \\"didn't bring up difficult issues or ask to change anything.\\" Mohammed Habib, an Egyptian Brotherhood official, stated: \\"Hamas's victory made the U.S. take a contrary position to promoting democracy in Egypt and favor a hereditary succession.\\" In 2005, Egypt acknowledged that the US had transferred 60 detainees to Egypt as part of the war on terror. In 2007, Amnesty International reported that Egypt had become an international center for interrogation and torture for other countries. The second largest recipient of US Foreign Aid is Egypt, with $1.8 billion scheduled for fiscal 2006.

In recent years, Iran has also begun to pursue nuclear technology through uranium enrichment, which has been one of the most pertinent issues that Rice has dealt with during her tenure at the State Department. Iran maintains that its nuclear program only seeks to develop the capacity for peaceful civilian nuclear power generation. Rice, along with other nations, has contended that Iran's record of sponsoring terrorism and threatening the safety of other nations, along with its defiance of its treaty obligations, of the United Nations Security Council, and of the International Atomic Energy Agency, have not proven Iran to be responsible enough to conduct uranium enrichment without outside supervision. Under Rice, the official State Department consensus on the matter is that \\"[t]he United States believes the Iranian people should enjoy the benefits of a truly peaceful program to use nuclear reactors to generate electric power ... [and] support[s] the Iranian people's rights to develop nuclear energy peacefully, with proper international safeguards.\\"Iran at a Crossroads: An Historic Opportunity for A Better Future.

In the following months, there was uncertainty over whether Rice could convince Kim Jong-Il to re-enter the negotiations, but in July 2005, North Korea announced that they had been convinced to return to the discussion. After the first phase of the 5th round of talks, which took place November 9‚Äì11, 2005, North Korea suspended its participations in the negotiations because the United States would not unfreeze some of its financial assets in a Macau bank.N Korea offers nuclear talks deal. April 13, 2006. Rice has consistently called for the regime to return to the talks. On May 1, 2006, Rice stated that North Korea needs \\"to return expeditiously to the talks without preconditions, to dismantle its nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease all illicit and proliferation activities.\\"\\"Joint Statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Aso, and Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga\\", United States Department of State, online posting, state.gov, May 1, 2006. On June 19, 2006, matters with North Korea were further complicated when it finished fueling an intercontinental ballistic missile that the regime said it would test fire. North Korea had previously self-imposed a missile-firing moratorium, but threatened to launch the missile anyway. Rice stated that \\"it would be a very serious matter and indeed a provocative act\\" for the North to follow through on the act, and that if the North decided to do so, \\"it would be taken with utmost seriousness.\\"\\"U.S.: North Korea Readies Missile for Test\\", Fox News, June 19, 2006.

Rice, in a press conference held on the same day, stated that she couldn't even begin to try to judge what motivated the North Koreans to act in such a way. Rice felt that North Korea had \\"miscalculated that the international community would remain united [in their opposition to the missile test-firing]\\" and \\"whatever they thought they were doing, they've gotten a very strong reaction from the international community.\\" Following the missile test, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting and strongly condemned the actions, though no official sanctions resulted at the time.\\"Remarks with Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gul After Their Meeting\\", United States Department of State, online posting, state.gov, July 5, 2006. Then, in early October 2006, North Korea claimed that it was preparing to test a nuclear explosive device.\\"North Korea Threatens Nuke Test\\" , The National Post, online posting, Canada.com, October 3, 2006. While the rumors could not be substantiated by satellite surveillance beforehand, the test was actually carried out on October 9, 2006 with only twenty minutes warning. The nuclear detonation test was, purportedly, in response to the United States's decision to not hold direct bilateral talks with the regime, as well as America's increasing pressure on the government, which North Korea claims is evidence that the United States wishes to attack or invade their country. Rice disputes North Korea's claim that the nuclear test was committed to deter America from invading, saying, \\"We shouldn't even allow them such an excuse ... It's just not the case ... [T]here is no intention to invade or attack them. [T]hey have that guarantee.\\"Transcript of Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN, United States Department of State, online posting, state.gov, October 10, 2006.

Rice has also repeatedly offered direct negotiations with North Korea in the context of the Six Party Talks, but she has held her ground in her decision not to hold bilateral talks with the dictatorship, stating, \\"We've been through bilateral talks with the North Koreans in the 1994 agreed framework. It didn't hold ... The North Koreans cheated [by] pursuing another path to a nuclear weapon, the so-called 'highly enriched uranium' path ...

It's not because he wants a bilateral deal with the United States. He doesn't want to face the leverage of China or South Korea or others.\\" Following the nuclear test, Rice made numerous calls to foreign leaders to consolidate support for taking punitive action against North Korea. Rice was able to draw condemnations from even some of North Korea's closest defenders, including China, who admitted the test was \\"flagrant\\" and \\"brazen.\\"China backs punishing N. Korea.

In mid-June 2008, Rice defended U.S. diplomacy toward North Korea, saying an agreement earlier in 2008 for Pyongyang to disable its nuclear reactor and provide a full accounting of its plutonium stockpile, \\"acknowledge\\" concerns about its proliferation activities and its uranium enrichment activity, and continue cooperation with a verification process to ensure no further activities are taking place, made Asia and the U.S. safer. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, Rice said that \\"North Korea will soon give its declaration of nuclear programs to China.\\" In a mid-January 2009 interview, Rice made the case that the Bush administration has made unappreciated strides in eliminating that country's nuclear weapon programs. Rice argued that events turned out for the best. \\"Yes, it's unfortunate that they reprocessed in that period of time, creating some stockpile of plutonium, but, frankly, given the attention now on their program ...

Even her and President Bush's critics, credit Secretary Rice, and President Bush, with stabilizing and improving the relationship between these two countries. From 2005, India and the US, negotiated about a civilian nuclear energy partnership. This deal was controversial, because India is not a signatory of the NPT, despite possessing nuclear weapons. However it was endorsed by Mohammed ElBaradei, head of the nuclear watchdog, IAEA. After overcoming domestic opposition, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, won the 2008 Lok Sabha Vote of Confidence. The Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement, was then passed by the IAEA board of governors and by the Nuclear Suppliers Group.By Sharad Joshi, A Pause in the Indo-US Nuclear Agreement, May 2, 2008, Retrieved November 28, 2013 It was then passed with bipartisan support in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, and Secretary Rice, and Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, signed it in October 2008.

Secretary Rice was scheduled to travel to India on December 3, 2008, at the request of President Bush in the wake of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the White House said. \\"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable,\\" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement.

The politician's fallacy was identified in a 1988 episode of the BBC television political sitcom Yes, Prime Minister titled \\"Power to the People\\", and has taken added life on the Internet. The syllogism, invented by fictional British civil servants, has been quoted in the real British Parliament.House of Commons (19 January 2005). Column 850: http://www.parliament.the-stationery- office.co.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050119/debtext/50119-14.htm The syllogism has also been quoted in American political discussion. In Yes, Prime Minister, the term is discussed between two high-ranking civil servants who are concerned that the prime minister wants to implement a scheme to reform local government due to political opposition there. In this issue, as with many other issues humorously explored by the show, the civil servants believe that doing anything is worse than doing nothing because actions tend to undermine the dominance of the civil service. They identify the politician's logic as a fallacious categorical syllogism: #All cats have four legs #My dog has four legs #Therefore, my dog is a cat. This invalid form of argument, labeled AAA-2 among syllogisms, commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle: it says nothing about all things having four legs (the middle term) and thus the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, even if the premises are true. The politician's syllogism similarly says nothing about all known \\"somethings\\" that could be done. As is common with fallacious undistributed middle arguments, it can also be seen as the fallacy of affirming the consequent when restated as an equivalent hypothetical syllogism: #To improve things, things must change #We are changing things #Therefore, we are improving things.

It was established in 1935 and occupies most of 9 Fitzmaurice Place, a street connecting Berkeley Square to Curzon Street in Mayfair. History The club formed later than many London clubs, and it permitted women from its inception. It has always had a relatively young membership, with an active social scene. The building's main Adam and otherwise 1930s Art Deco interiors, with some authentic frontages, mean it has been Grade II* listed since its first assessment in 1970. This is the mid-category of listed building, a statutory scheme of protection which has a pyramidal hierarchy. In 1930, Westminster City Council decided to improve access to Berkeley Square by creating an extra road into the square. This was accomplished by demolishing half of the main range of Lansdowne House, which stood since the 1760s. What remained was given a new frontage and a newly renovated interior, and became the Lansdowne Club. The 'First Drawing Room' was thus taken to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the 'Dining Room' exists in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The venue was founded as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing' and their families, and unlike many rivals, it had no vocational, artistic, or political 'theme'. Its facilities include a ballroom, a terrace, a fencing Salle and a basement gym with Art Deco swimming pool. Internally architecture is extremely unusual; some is modern for its type, being significantly Art Deco, as opposed to Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian styles.

The quotation may be from the same composer's work (self- referential), or from a different composer's work (appropriation). Sometimes the quotation is done for the purposes of characterization, as in Puccini's use of The Star-Spangled Banner in reference to the American character Lieutenant Pinkerton in his opera Madama Butterfly, or in Tchaikovsky's use of the Russian and French national anthems in the 1812 Overture, which depicted a battle between the Russian and French armies. Sometimes, there is no explicit characterization involved, as when Luciano Berio used brief quotes from Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Alban Berg, Pierre Boulez, Gustav Mahler, Claude Debussy, Paul Hindemith, Maurice Ravel, Arnold Schoenberg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, and others in his Sinfonia. Quotation vs. variation Musical quotation is to be distinguished from variation, where a composer takes a theme (their own or another's) and writes variations on it. In that case, the origin of the theme is usually acknowledged in the title (e.g., Johannes Brahms's Variations on a Theme by Haydn). In the case of quotations, however, an explicit acknowledgment does not generally appear in the score. Some exceptions are found in Robert Schumann's Carnaval: * in the section \\"Florestan\\" he quotes a theme from his earlier work Papillons, Op. 2, and the inscription \\"(Papillon?)\\" is written underneath the notes (he quotes the same theme in the final section \\"Marche des Davidsb√ºndler contre les Philistins\\", but without acknowledgement) * in the final section, he also quotes another theme first used in Papillons, the traditional Grossvater Tanz (Grandfather Dance), but this time the inscription is \\"Th√®me du XVII√®me si√®cle\\". Examples Examples of musical quotations in classical music include: * Arnold Bax quoted a theme from Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde in his 1919 symphonic poem Tintagel Baxworks Bach's quoted chorale setting * Alban Berg quoted Johann Sebastian Bach's setting of the chorale \\"Es ist genug\\" (It is enough), the closing chorale of Bach's cantata O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60, with variations in the final movement of his Violin Concerto, subtitled \\"To the memory of an Angel\\" in memory of Manon Gropius who died at age 17. In the fourth movement of his Lyric Suite for string quartet, Berg quoted a phrase from the third movement of Alexander Zemlinsky's Lyric Symphony that originally set the words \\"Du bist mein eigen, mein eigen\\" (Thou art mine own, mine own). * Georges Bizet used a song \\"El Arreglito\\" by Sebasti√°n Iradier as the basis for the \\"Habanera\\" (L'amour est un oiseau rebelle) in his opera Carmen, believing it to be an anonymous folk song. When he discovered its true author, who had died only ten years earlier, he made an acknowledgment in the vocal score. * Johannes Brahms quotes Gaudeamus igitur and other popular university songs in his Academic Festival Overture. * Benjamin Britten quoted many other works (e.g., Wagner's \\"Tristan chord\\") in his opera Albert Herring * Fr√©d√©ric Chopin quoted the tenor aria \\"Vieni fra queste braccia\\" from Rossini's opera La gazza ladra in his Polonaise in B-flat minor, \\"Adieu a Guillaume Kolberg\\", Op. posth; Chopin and Kolberg had seen the opera together * Brett Dean's work for violin and orchestra, The Lost Art of Letter Writing (2006), includes two quotations from Johannes Brahms: the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony and the Variations on a Theme of Robert Schumann.Boosey & Hawkes * Claude Debussy quoted the opening of Tristan und Isolde disparagingly in the Golliwogg's Cakewalk from his Children's Corner suite for piano * Sir Edward Elgar quoted The First Nowell and some of his own earlier music in The Starlight Express * Manuel de Falla quoted the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony in his ballet The Three-Cornered Hat.{http://www.mansfieldtickets.com/files/musicnotes/Hot%20Latin%20Nights/index.htm Mansfield Tickets] * Alberto Franchetti quoted widely from German popular songs and from the work of several German composers in his opera Germania, in order to lend the score a German color * Umberto Giordano quoted the French national anthem La Marseillaise in his opera Andrea Ch√©nier * Charles Ives was particularly fond of quoting other composers' themes in his works. They can be found in works such as Three Places in New England and his Piano Sonata No. 2 * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart quoted a theme by his recently deceased mentor Johann Christian Bach in his Piano Concerto No. 12 * Giacomo Puccini quoted the U.S. national anthem The Star-Spangled Banner in his opera Madama Butterfly * Sergei Rachmaninoff based his song \\"Fate\\" on the first two measures of the opening movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony * Robert Schumann quoted La Marseillaise in his song The Two Grenadiers and his Carnival Jest from Vienna; he also quoted two themes from his Papillons, Op. 2 in his later work Carnaval, Op. 9 (one of which was the traditional Grossvater Tanz); further, he quoted Beethoven's An die ferne Geliebte and (more distantly) Seventh Symphony in his Fantasie in C, Op. 17 * Dmitri Shostakovich ‚Äì various examples, for instance the Can-Can from Jacques Offenbach's opera Orpheus in the Underworld * Richard Strauss quoted the funeral march from Beethoven's Eroica symphony (No. 3) in his Metamorphosen for 23 solo strings * Strauss used many quotes from his own works in his symphonic poem A Hero's Life * Strauss quoted Luigi Denza's song Funicul√¨, Funicul√† in his symphonic poem Aus Italien, believing it was a folk song * Igor Stravinsky quoted a theme from Franz Schubert's Marche Militaire No. 1 in D in his Circus Polka. * Sir Arthur Sullivan did quote actual melodies by Franz Schubert and Johann Sebastian Bach, but he was more adept at deliberately imitating the styles of other composers without actually quoting their works. The styles of Bellini, Bizet, Donizetti, Dvo≈ô√°k, Gounod, Handel, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Rossini, Verdi, Wagner and others can all be found in his works. * Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky quoted the Russian national anthem (God Save the Tsar!), La Marseillaise, a Russian Orthodox plainchant (God Preserve Thy People), and some Russian folk songs, in his 1812 Overture. He used folk material in other compositions, such as the 4th Symphony and the 1st Piano Concerto. He quoted the traditional Grossvater Tanz in Act I of The Nutcracker. And in Act 2, Scene 2 of The Queen of Spades, he has the Countess sing Laurette's aria \\"Je crains de lui parler la nuit\\" from Andr√© Gr√©try's opera Richard Coeur-de-Lion. * Ralph Vaughan Williams quoted the theme from the Epilogue of the third movement of Arnold Bax's Symphony No. 3 in his Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra. * Heitor Villa-Lobos quoted Yara, a schottische composed in 1896 by Anacleto de Medeiros, in his Ch√¥ros No. 10 (1926), as well as the text added in 1907 by Catullo da Paix√£o Cearense, from which Villa-Lobos took the subtitle of his work, \\"Rasga o cora√ß√£o\\" (It Rends Your heart\\").Robert Maycock, \\"Heitor Villa- Lobos (1887‚Äì1959): Ch√¥ros No. 10, ‚ÄòRasga o cora√ß√£o‚Äô (1926)\\". Proms 2009: What's On / Programme Notes: Prom 76. BBC Radio3 website (Accessed 13 July 2012). Quotation is also a tradition in jazz performance, especially of the bebop era. Charlie Parker, for instance, quoted Stravinsky's Rite of Spring in his solo on \\"Repetition\\", and \\"Country Gardens\\" on his Verve recording of \\"Lover Man\\"; Dizzy Gillespie quotes David Raksin's \\"Laura\\" on \\"Hot House\\" during the Massey Hall concert. Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins are especially famed among jazz fans for their addiction to quotation. Often the use of musical quotation has an ironic edge, whether the musician is aiming for an amusing juxtaposition or is making a more pointed commentary (as when a youthful Rollins, playing alongside Charlie Parker on Miles Davis's Collector's Items, throws in a snippet of \\"Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better,\\"MILES DAVIS Collector's Items (Original Jazz Classics) Review by Ron Saranich, October 2000 or when the avant-garde saxophonist Ornette Coleman rebuffs a skeptical heckler at the Croydon Hall concert with a snippet of the jazz standard \\"Cherokee\\").Free radical Andrew Purcell, The Guardian, Friday 29 June 2007 Sources * Nicolas Slonimsky, Richard Kassel eds., Webster's New World Dictionary of Music See also * Contrafact * Quodlibet * Variation (music) * List of variations on a theme by another composer * Sampling (music) * Composer tributes (classical music) *Interpolation (popular music) Musical terminology Quotation Quotation ","title":"Musical quotation"},{"id":"21185062","text":"Juhor ad-Dik () is a Palestinian village in the Gaza Governorate, south of Gaza City, in the central Gaza Strip.

Little or no scholarly research has been done about the Quennells, but as Tony Woolrich writes: :[The books] sold in thousands and were reputed to have been used by more than eight hundred schools in Britain alone and more were in use in overseas in English-speaking schools. Translations of a number of titles have been made into Russian, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and Danish. The books were illustrated with some coloured drawings of mostly costume, half tones and a profusion of line drawings made by the authors. All the books went into numerous revisions, with the information upgraded to take account of modern knowledge.\\"C. H. B. and Marjorie Quennell\\". Archived link here. The books were especially strong on housing, agriculture and the way people earned their livings. They were described by Hector Bolitho as ‚Äútransforming teaching‚Äù. In an era when history focused on the Great Man and political forces as the drivers of history, these books about the day to day life of the common person were ahead of their time, which would not come into the fore until the 1970s (see microhistory). In 1935 the Quennell's published The Good New Days (1935), where modern industrial and agricultural processes, together with the problems of the future, were considered. In 1968 author S. E.

It is primarily used as a green table olive. It can also produce high quality oil, but this is hard to extract. Though vulnerable to certain pests, it is relatively resistant to cold and drought. Extent The Lucques owes its French name to the tradition that it originated in the Italian province of Lucca (Lucques in French). Today it is primarily associated with southern France, particularly in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. It can also be found in Northern Africa, Turkey, the United States and Australia.Ron Herbst, Sharon and Tyler Herbst, The Deluxe Food Lover's Companion, 2nd edition, Barron's Educational Series, 2015 Synonyms Locally, this cultivar is known under a number of different names, including Lucquoise or Luquoise, Oliva Lucchese, Oliverolle, Olivier de Lucques, Olivier Odorant and Plant du Languedoc. Characteristics It is a cultivar of good strength, with a spreading growth form in a shape described as \\"a vase or a parasol\\". The leaves are elliptic- lanceolate, with a medium length and width. The olives are of medium to high weight, with an average commercial caliber of 20 to 24 fruits/hecto. They have an elongated, asymmetrical shape, with a pointed apex and a truncated base. The stone is pointed at both ends, with few groves and no mucro. Though the fruit comes into bearing early, its ripening is late. Picking is at the end of October or beginning of November, while the skin is a light green. It matures in December, and when fully mature the colour of the fruit is green. Processing The Lucques is primarily used as a green table olive, and the fruit tastes meaty and sweet. Some compare it to fresh almonds and avocados. It is a highly valued olive among gourmets. It can also be used for oil, and the oil it produces is of excellent quality, but it is difficult to extract. It gives a medium oil yield, of about 17%. The smell of the oil has alternately been described as \\"almond\\", \\"green apple\\", and \\"tomato\\". The taste is sweet; to some, excessively so. Agronomy It is considered a productive cultivar, but depends on good quality soil and regular irrigation to give a high yield. The cultivar is self-sterile, so it depends on other pollinators. It is vulnerable to certain pests, including the olive fruit fly, sooty mold and Verticillium dahliae. On the other hand, it has a moderately good tolerance to cold and drought.

This is a list of characters on the animated television series The Mighty B!. __TOC__ The Higgenbottoms =Bessie Higgenbottom= Bessie Kajolica Higgenbottom is a 9¬æ-year-old, geeky, bespectacled \\"Honeybee Scout\\" characterized by her extreme hyperactivity and unshakably dedicated work-ethic. Ambitious, infuriatingly- persistent, and highly sociable, Bessie is determined to earn every badge in existence on the firm belief that achieving this goal will transform her into a superhero known as the Mighty Bee (and it was implied in one episode involving a meeting between Bessie and the founder of the Honeybee Scouts that this theory actually may be true), showing obsessive devotion to the scouting troop and any mission that she establishes for herself in attaining her goal. Pure-hearted and friendly, Bessie is oblivious to other people's dislike of her, blind to the bratty Portia Gibbons's exclusion and belittling of her regardless of the severity of her insults. In spite of this factor, Bessie displays extreme precociousness and intellect, constructing both a robot and an atom smasher for the upcoming Honeybee Science Fair and showing the business and negotiation skills of someone twice her age. Nonetheless, she shows vulnerability to her weak eyesight, unicorns, cute animals, and stereotypically-feminine interests such as sparkles and glitter. Bessie also has a lisp; this can be noticed whenever she says a sentence that has the letter S. She is voiced by former SNL cast member Amy Poehler. =Happy Walter Higgenbottom= Happy Walter Higgenbottom is Bessie's cherished pet dog adopted in the pilot episode as a scraggly stray hanging around near the community fisherman's wharf. Albeit Happy was originally reluctant to be so forcibly adopted and lived in resentment with his new owner, he gradually grew to further appreciate her, albeit he is depicted as something of a sly character with manipulative mannerisms. Although Happy is incapable of speech, he communicates through barking that can somehow be comprehended by fellow characters in the series, though the exact wording of Happy's conversations with other characters is not translated or understood by audiences. He is gifted with partial anthropomorphism, as he demonstrates capabilities of walking on two legs, driving, gambling, or interaction with human characters. It was revealed in one episode that Happy was somehow mysteriously separated from his biological mother at a young age and that Mother's Day formerly presented unhappy connotations for him, though after a dog named Rose claiming to be his mother was revealed as a deceptive impostor, he grew to appreciate his adoptive family with the Higgenbottoms further. Happy appears to have a shady background, as he was formerly trained by a secret agency as an undercover dog and was treasured as an agent, though later wound up leaving this past behind. It also has been revealed that he enjoys gambling in his spare time in a secret casino intended for canines. He is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. =Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Higgenbottom= Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Higgenbottom, voiced by Andy Richter, is Bessie's 6-year-old younger brother. He hopes to be Bessie's sidekick when she becomes the Mighty B. He isn't quite there yet, so Bessie often refers to him as her \\"trial sidekick\\" or says that she'd \\"possibly consider him for sidekick candidacy\\". Ben had a fear of foods touching each other because Bessie used to mash his food together when Bessie was a toddler and Ben was a baby. In \\"Hen and Bappy\\", Ben and Happy switched bodies by eating the Hippie's magical taquitos by mistake. In the episode O, Brother What Are Thou, Ben was briefly known as Bessie's nemesis the Hurtful Hornet due to jealousy brought by Happy being Bessie's substitute training sidekick. He also has a teddy bear called Mr. Pants, which wears vintage orange plaid pants. Andy Richter, the voice of Ben, is also the voice of Mort on the Nick show The Penguins of Madagascar. Richter talked about The Mighty B!, quoting: \\"[...] another dream come true, to be able to do cartoon voices. And, also, to get to do cartoon voices for [Ben and Mort] two really funny, cool cartoons that my kids love and that I'm proud to have them love. It's pretty great.\\" =Hilary Higgenbottom= Hilary Higgenbottom, voiced by Megan Cavanagh, is the single hippie mother of Bessie, Happy and Ben. She owns and operates a coffee shop called Hilary's Caf√©. She can be bowled over by Bessie just as much as everyone else is, but tends to handle her role as a parent in a free-spirited way. She's always full of good karma and positive energy and lets Bessie and Ben's imaginations run wild; unless they make a mess in the house or put themselves in danger. She is absent in many episodes. The Honeybees The Honeybees are a troop of scouts founded by Miriam Breedlove. The troop the series focuses on is #828 in San Francisco, California. Every spring, the Honeybee troop is assigned the task of selling taffy. The leader of the troop is Mary Frances Gibbons, Portia's mother. The scouts seem to be very widespread, as a girl named Sissy Sullivan is in a Honeybee troop in Boston, Massachusetts. =Penny Lefkowitz= Penny Lefkowitz, voiced by Dannah Feinglass, is Bessie's awkward, dull, obese best friend. Though Penny is friends with Bessie, she also sometimes assists Portia Gibbons and her friend Gwen in torturing Bessie, so she goes against Bessie sometimes. In the episode \\"Penny Hearts Joey\\" she befriends a robotic kangaroo named Joey from a Chuck E. Cheese's-parodying pizza restaurant/arcade called \\"Jumpin' Joey's\\" where Joey is the restaurant's mascot and spokesperson. Penny's low intelligence causes her to believe that Joey is alive, and it is revealed at the end of the episode that he does have some feelings and is aware of the activities Penny is doing with him. Penny can communicate with sea lions and has asthma, and she also seems to have a love for chickens, and this is shown through her being seen sleeping with a toy chicken at night and her father's nickname for her, which is \\"Chicken.\\" Penny also loves Honeybee Scout taffy, which is what Honeybee Scouts sell in the spring, and she often eats more taffy than she sells. She also eats glue and is afraid to walk across the streets by herself. In \\"We Got the Bee\\", Penny played triangle as a member of the Pretty Pretty Princesses. She fainted due to stage fright, so Bessie had to step in and play drums for them instead. In \\"An I See Bee\\", it is revealed that Penny is 10 years old, making her 6 months younger than her mean, snobby friend Portia. It is said she once went undercover so well she got elected president of Venezuela. =Portia Gibbons= Portia Gibbons, voiced by Grey DeLisle believes she should be waited on and treated like a celebrity. She often addresses Bessie as \\"Messie\\" or just Bessie. She exercises her sense of entitlement on people like Bessie, who she knows would never do anything mean- spirited in return. As a stereotypical preteen socialite, she is interested in makeup, clothes, and Rocky. She typically has Penny, when she isn't with Bessie, and right-hand woman Gwen at her side. Portia constantly belittles and attempts to humiliate Bessie, dragging Gwen and Penny into the schemes as well and often going out of her way to do so. Her schemes against Bessie vary from harmless such as attempting to ruin her chances of getting a badge, to downright evil, like luring Bessie into a tank of hungry piranhas when she misplaced her glasses. She also likes sushi and gelato, often seen going to gelato shops in her free time. It is revealed in \\"Dang, It Feels Good to be a Gamester\\" that she is very good at video games, hence facing off with a rival boys troop playing \\"Raspberry Shortcake Attack V\\". When Portia got laryngitis in \\"Woodward and Beesting\\", Bessie thought she was an alien for a short period of time due to strange behaviors she only exhibits in private, such as dancing weirdly to techno music, liking squishy stickers, having her meals blended in a blender and drank like a milkshake, and wearing an ugly green scarf to protect her neck. In \\"So Happy Together\\", Portia briefly went insane when she discovered that her pet chihuahua was actually a rat, hence the breed's nickname, \\"Rat\\". In \\"Ten Little Honeybees\\", Portia received a gold locket as a birthday present. But shortly after she put it on, the lights strangely shut off and the locket disappeared right from her neck. It was later found stuck on Bessie's back pocket. It is also revealed that Portia is 10 years old. She has a cousin named Chelsea, who is meaner and more stuck-up than Portia. She is the only character that Portia is afraid of, which got her to reveal her soft side when Bessie and Penny helped her. She was the lead singer of the Pretty Pretty Princesses in \\"We Got the Bee\\". The Pretty Pretty Princesses' only known song was \\"Running with the Rainbow Unicorn\\", being the first known song in the series, besides the title song. Another part of her soft side is revealed in this episode when Bessie helps her and Gwen. Grey DeLisle was praised for her performance as Portia by the Animation Insider, calling her \\"hilarious\\" and that Portia is \\"obviously meant to be an annoying character, but her posh, pure-blooded arrogance is as fun as it is absurd. Portia calls Bessie Higgenbottom \\"Messy Stinkinbottom\\". =Gwen Wu= Gwen Wu, voiced by Jessica DiCicco, Portia's best friend, is \\"totally tuned into hip hop and urban culture, music and fashion.\\" She has a plan of dominating the music and fashion worlds, as soon as she can get out of babysitting her five younger brothers. Gwen is Portia's lieutenant, and does whatever she says. She's always equipped with a witty comeback, which usually entails calling Bessie a nerd or dork. Despite this, she has a much larger tolerance for Bessie than Portia does and is somewhat nicer to her when Portia isn't around. She has a head for business and very clever. She played the guitar as one of the Pretty Pretty Princesses. =Mrs. Gibbons= Mary Frances Gibbons, voiced by Sarah Thyre, is the Honeybee troop leader and Portia's mother. She forced Portia to join the Honeybees and considers the troop \\"a mother-daughter bonding activity\\". During troop meetings, she shows blatant favoritism towards Portia and gets frustrated with Bessie when her achievements, zest, and zeal outshine Portia's. She has a very low tolerance for Bessie's energy level, often getting very frustrated with her. It is revealed in \\"Something's Wrong with this Taffy\\" that Mary Frances has been eating two boxes of taffy every day for twenty years. In \\"The Apprentice\\", Mary Frances hires Bessie as an apprentice, in the idea that her Patty Faye sales numbers will boost, but in the end, Bessie just winds up to be a big fat pain in the neck. In \\"Ten Little Honeybees\\", she gave Portia a golden locket as a birthday present. =Millie Millerson= Millie Millerson, voiced by Grey DeLisle, is a Honeybee scout with a slow way of talking, and loves shiny or reflective objects, such as tinsel or confetti. She has a pet turtle named Chester Turtleton. Millie is hypoglycemic. She used to have braces throughout the show, but in the episode Children of the Unicorn, her braces were removed. in \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" she framed Bessie for disgracing the Troop828 Recreation Centre, and it's revealed she is known only as \\"The Gasslie Graff\\", after a brawl with her she apologized to Bessie that she was sorry she framed Bessie and to her friend she admits it, also in \\"The League of Ordinary Gentlemen\\" she is one whom however along with Bessie and Penny taunt Ben and the boy's club, while in \\"Irritable Blowing Syndrome\\" Millie is mentioned to be like a psychologist and much to that she helped Bessie out while she became stressed with Blowing, Millie tends to be a nice girl and much will do anything to help Bessie out, =Miriam Breedlove= Miriam Breedlove, voiced by Niecy Nash, is the founder of the Honeybees. She once went to brunch with Bessie, after Bessie won a competition. Miriam also confronts Honeybee taffy makers in San Francisco when Bessie contacts Miriam, telling her that the taffy is not being made with real honey. =Mona= An elderly woman who was a former honeybee. She tried to win the Sock Hop Badge to steal away from Bessie, but Bessie decides to give her a chance to dance and gets the badge. =Satha Thomas= Satha Thomas' is a short honeybee scout whom is African American and apparently is an unidentified Honeybee with crimson red hair and puffed hair, she spoke in \\"Apoxalypse Now\\" only, and in \\"Irritable Bowling Syndrome\\" she is revealed to be good friend with Penny since she is seen high-fiving Penny. =Tigerlily Roberts= Tigerlily Roberts is a young Honeybee Scout whom unlike all but with the exception's of Bessie, Penny, Portia, Gwen, and Millie, have no speaking roles, she has tiger lily color hair, her name was revealed in \\"O Brother What Art Thou\\" as Tigerlily is perhaps her real name after a color, =Nisa Reddy= Nisa Reddy is a young Indian Honeybee Scout, unlike Bessie, Penny, Portia, Gwen, and Millie, she has no speaking roles, but although barely could be seen talking in \\"Dang It Feels Good to Bee a Gamester\\" she would not be heard speaking that she talked, Nisa however is likely a nice Honeybee since she possibly originates from India and maybe her first name is Indian as well, throughout the show she is possibly good friends along with Tigerlily since sometimes seen often together, =Molly O'Connell= Molly O'Connell is a young Honeybee Scout and a very short tiny girl, she has crimson red hair and a pink nose, unlike all honeybees with the exception of Bessie, Penny, Portia, Gwen, and Millie does not speak, she also has a blue ribbon in her hair unlike Millie has a pink one, =Jean Tatum Parklands= Jean Parklands real name Tatum as revealed in \\"O Brother What Art Thou\\" is her real name but prefers Jean better than Tatum, is a British Honeybee Scout, she has puffed brunet hair and freckles on her cheeks, and often in the show is one whom is a girl whom seems to be tough, unlike all Honeybees but Bessie, Penny, Portia, Gwen, and Millie do not speak, =Marie Malarkey= Marie Malarkey is a young Honeybee Scout and a new rookie on the Troop 828, she has violet hair and possibly is of South American descent due to her skin color, has yellow eyes and of course the most lowest of the grade of Honeybees, she tends to be friendly but however is seems to be caring between the girls, Marie however due to her last name sounds Irish but perhaps her mother is married to an Irishman, unlike all Honeybees with but the exception out of only Bessie, Penny, Portia, Gwen, and Millie, Marie does not speak, originally was to have a speaking role like the rest of the Honeybees but never came to be, Other characters *Finger is Bessie's left-hand index finger and imaginary friend. First thing every morning, she draws a smiley face on him, and every night before bed, she washes off his \\"awake\\" face to put on his \\"asleep\\" face. Whenever Bessie needs some advice, she seeks Finger's perspective of the matter. Bessie often restates Finger's imaginary question for others to understand what he is saying. Finger may seem like a figment of Bessie's imagination, but sometimes, it seems as if he has a mind of his own. In one episode, he is said to have a French cousin (portrayed by Bessie's right-hand index finger) named Fing√©r *Rocky Rhodes, voiced by Kenan Thompson, is a skater who works part-time as a waiter at Hilary's Caf√©. Rocky is in a rock band called The Integritones and loves The Ramones. His hair covers his eyes. Portia also has a crush on him in \\"We Got the Bee\\". Where he seems more interested in Bessie, which worsens Portia's hatred for her. *Anton St. Germain, voiced by Matt Besser, was the dog show judge in the first episode, but he has also been shown as the science fair judge and the head of city council. He is a good friend of Mary Frances'. Bessie usually gets his last name wrong. *Mr. Wu, voiced by Keone Young, is the owner of a Chinese restaurant. Despite being Gwen Wu's father, he is good friends with the Higgenbottom family, especially Bessie. He very sweetly humors Bessie in all of her crazy schemes and the Mighty Bee imagining. *Hippie, voiced by Matt Besser, is a nameless hippie who roams around town without a care in the world. When he's not painting murals or riding his unicycle, he operates a magic shop. At times when no other adult will understand Bessie and her friends, the Hippie will, and usually can help in some way. He and Happy seem to be on the same wavelength. *Chelsea Gibbons, voiced by Jessica Chaffin, is Portia's even more conceited, bratty, and snobby cousin. She is the only character that intimidates Portia. She used to be in the Dragonflies troop, but quit because she thought it was lame. *Donald, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, is a resident mailman. A well-to-do individual, but also very edgy when it comes to delivering mail to Bessie, who often frightens him. *Chai Gallagher, voiced by Grey DeLisle, is a cynical news anchorwoman, who turns up in several episodes reporting on assorted major events in San Francisco, such as reporting on the phenomena of Bessie's unfortunately cursed middle name, and reporting on the crowds waiting in line for the long-awaited Raspberry Shortcake Space Attack V video game. *Sissy Sullivan, voiced by Amy Poehler, is Bessie's pen pal from Boston, Massachusetts. She talks in a Boston accent and is similar to Bessie in behavior. Sissy makes Bessie extremely jealous because she is better than her at everything including surfing, speaking Chinese, and taffy selling. *Mr. Pants/Mr. Evil Pants is Ben's teddy bear named Mr. Pants. From Ben's perspective he is very persuasive and wants to go to Spain. Later in the series he some how turned evil along with Ben, and after launching a teddy bear attack all wearing evil pants, they take the pants off (expect for him) then chain him up and build a wall. *Ronnie, voiced by Grey DeLisle, is a young Beaver scout who is the best known of all. He is a fat, pudgy kid who leads the Beavers. He has appeared the most out of all the Beavers, but most times, as a background character. His finger, Digit, rivals Finger, Bessie's finger. He appeared in \\"Name Shame\\", \\"Hen and Bappy\\", \\"Dang it Feels Good to Be a Gamester\\", \\"Dragonflies\\" and \\"Finger Pickin' Bad\\". =Scout troops= *The Beavers are a troop of blue-uniformed boys with massive overbites, beaver tails, and childish male chauvinism. The Beaver troop seem to be categorized as clumsy, non-athletic, and somewhat geeky. The Beavers won the Beeathalon, beating the exhausted Honeybees, to which they lost in a subsequent multi-player contest on the Raspberry Shortcake Space Attack V. The best known of all the Beavers is Ronnie. He's the fat, pudgy kid who leads the Beavers. Ronnie has appeared the most out of all the Beavers, but most times, as a background character. His finger, Digit, rivals Finger, Bessie's finger. The Beavers are among the scout troops to have fallen victim to the Dragonflies. *The Dragonflies are a troop hailing from Oakland, California. The troop, like the Honeybees, is made up of young girls, but the Dragonflies are much more mischievous and ill-mannered, also mentioned as the most fierce troop in the San Francisco Bay Area. According to Bessie, each Dragonfly scout is handpicked from birth and trained in 64 types of combat including long division, although this may be an exaggeration on Bessie's part. The Dragonflies act on their own accord, claiming other troops' territories as their own. The most notable Dragonfly is Cherry, voiced by Maya Rudolph, a petite, red-haired girl who acts as the leader of her group. Other notable Dragonflies are the hulking Maude, voiced by Grey DeLisle, the enthusiastic dark-skinned Bibi, voiced by Audrey Wasilewski, Laurie, a long- faced dark-skinned girl skilled at unscrambling Scrabble letters. (she doesn't talk or have a name she was Called Laurie by Fans On the Internet,) and a purple female dog, Cha-Cha, who seems to be very fond of Happy. Chelsea Gibbons was formerly a Dragonfly, but she quit because she thought it was lame. *The Black Widow Spiders are a troop that frequently meets at the abandoned, rusted warehouse of Pier 13. This troop appears to be hostile, as they attacked Bessie and her friends when they accidentally stumbled into the wrong pier. The girls who are in the Black Widow troop wear dark eyeshadow, purple shirts adorned with skull patterns, red and white striped stockings, frayed black skirts, and buckled shoes. They are sensitive to light, which they avoid. *The Butterflies - A troop that hails from Berkeley, California. The Butterflies excel in wholesome activities such as picnics and maypoles. This troop's picnic was under siege by the Dragonflies as the Butterflies were swarmed and tied to their maypole, despite their protest, \\"No! We were having nice, clean fun!\\". * The Gorillas - A boys troop from Southern Canada. Their uniforms are brown with reddish orange handkerchief. They are a very tough boys troop. According to Bessie, they are the most elite and ruthless boy troop in Southern Canada. Even though there are troops in America in this show, there are some that are in Canada. The leader of the Gorillas is Murdock who sells a Beef Jerky Energy Drink to Bessie since the Gorillas need money for a volcano trip. Murdock convinces Ben to be a Gorilla. But Bessie disguises as Ben since Ben is too scared to be a gorilla. Bessie, disguised as Ben does very successful with the Gorillas. References Mighty B!

The 'Aglandau' is primarily used for production of oil, but can also be eaten. When used as table olives, the fruit is normally called Beruguette. The oil is highly valued for its fruity taste. Extent The 'Aglandau' is common in Provence, particularly in the counties of Aix-en-Provence and Salon-de- Provence. It can also be found in Australia, as well as in Azerbaijan and Ukraine. Synonyms Locally, this cultivar is known under a number of different names, including Beruguette, Blanquette, Plant d'Aix, Verdale de Carpentras. In Azerbaijan and Ukraine it is known as Nichitskaia 7. Beruguette is the common name when the 'Aglandau' is served as a table olive. Characteristics The 'Aglandau' is a cultivar of medium-to-weak vigour. Its growth form is spreading with a dense canopy, and the leaves are flat and elliptic-lanceolate, of medium length and width. The olives are of relatively low weight, with a rounded apex and a truncated base. They are slightly asymmetrical, and ovoid in shape. The stone has a rugose surface, with a rounded apex and a pointed base. The cultivar is harvested in November and December, before the frost, which can harm the fruit. The trees are often maintained quite low, for ease of access at harvest. This is necessary because the olives are firmly attached to the branches. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is green. The olive is clingstone ‚Äì the stone clings to the flesh. Processing A dual-use cultivar, the 'Aglandau' is primarily used for extraction of oil, and gives a good yield (19-23%). The taste of the oil is highly valued, and is considered to have a particularly fruity taste. The smell of the oil has alternately been described as \\"almond\\", \\"green apple\\", and \\"artichoke\\". The cultivar is used in several officially approved appellations: such as \\"AOC Haute Provence\\", \\"AOC Pays d'Aix\\" and \\"AOC Vall√©e de Baux\\". Agronomy It is considered a cultivar of medium productivity, with good rooting ability. It has a tendency towards biennial bearing, i.e. that a good yield is followed by a weaker one the next year. This can to a large extent be controlled through pruning. There is a certain disagreement over the fertility of the 'Aglandau' trees, but generally they are considered self-sterile, so it can take advantage of other local varieties as pollinators. It is vulnerable to certain biological pests, such as the black scale insect of olives Saissetia oleae, sooty mold and the olive leaf-spot fungus Spilocaea oleaginea. Its resistance to the Verticillium dahliae and the Pseudomonas syringae, on the other hand, is good. It has a good tolerance to drought; less so to cold.

Though it is used for producing oil, and gives a good yield, it is valued primarily as a table olive. It is produced as a so-called cracked olive, which means that the fruit is cracked to speed up the curing process. Extent The Salonenque is particularly common in Provence, especially in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. In the Vall√©e des Baux it makes up over 60% of planted trees (as of 2004). It is also grown in South Australia, primarily in the area around Adelaide. Synonyms The cultivar is also known locally under several other names, including Courgeole, Plant de Salon, Salonen, Sauren, Sauzen, Selounen and Varagen. Characteristics It is a cultivar of weak vigour, with an erect growth form. The leaves are short and narrow, with an elliptic-lanceolate form. The olives are of medium-high weight, and of an ovoid quite symmetrical shape. They are rounded both at the apex and the base. The stone has a rugose, or wrinkled surface, with a rounded apex, a pointed base, and a mucro. For use as table olives, the fruit is harvested relatively early, around 10 September. For oil production the harvest is later, in early November. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is bright green. Processing The primary use of the Salonenque is as a table olive, more specifically as cracked olives (olives that are slit during the curing for the process to go faster). They cured olives are \\"fresh with a firm, meaty texture and a whiff of aromatic fennel\\". It is also used for production of oil, and gives a high yield (22-25%). The taste of the oil is sweet and delicate, and quite strong. The olive is freestonethe stone does not cling to the flesh. The Salonenque is used in several officially approved appellations: such as \\"AOC Vall√©e des Baux\\" and \\"AOC Pays d'Aix\\". Agronomy Salonenque is considered a cultivar of high and constant production, but has a low rooting ability. The Salonenque is partially self-fertile, but it can take advantage of nearby pollinators, among which are the Grossane and the Berruguette. It has a high level of resistance to the major pests, with the exception of grubs of the olive moth Prays oleae and of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae. It has a good resistance also to cold, and can sustain temperatures down to ‚àí15 ¬∞C, but it is highly sensitive to wind.

It is the most widely available cultivar in France. Though originally from Gard in southern France, it is today grown all over the world. The Picholine is best known as a cocktail olive, though it is also used to make olive oil. It is the most common variety of olive used for oil from Morocco. Extent The Picholine olive is originally from the region of Gard in southern France. Even though it is today most common in Provence and other parts of France and Italy, it is also grown in Morocco, Israel, Chile, the United States and other places around the world. Synonyms The Picholine has many different names of local variety. In Gard and southern France it is referred to as Coiasse, Colliasse, Piquette, Plant de Collias, Fausse Lucques (false Lucques) or Lucques Batarde (bastard Lucques). In Tunisia is it called Judoleine, while in other countries it is often named Picholine de Languedoc after its historic region of origin (Gard is part of Languedoc). Characteristics It is a cultivar of middle strength, with a spreading growth form, and medium size, and a crown of an open shape. The leaves are elliptic-lanceolate, of a medium length and width. The olives are of medium weight (3-5 g), ovoid shape and slightly asymmetrical. The stone is pointed at both ends, with a smooth surface and a mucro. The fruit is harvested in October and November, while still green, for use as table olives. For the purpose of producing oil, the olives are picked later, once they have turned black. The exact time of harvest for oil is a matter of judgement for the individual farmer; an early harvest gives a fruity taste, while a later harvest brings out more sweetness. Processing The Picholine is most notable for its use as a cocktail olive. For this purpose they are lye cured, then fermented in brine for up to a year, giving them a slightly salty taste. It is also used for extraction of oil, but gives only a medium yield. Normally 20-22% can be extracted, but plants under irrigation sometimes produce as little as 15-18%. The taste of the oil is fruity with a hint of bitterness. Agronomy It is considered a cultivar of good, constant production. The tree is of medium size, and assumes a low, spread-out form when carrying fruit. It adapts well to different forms of soils and climates. It is generally agreed that the cultivar is only partially self-fertile, so it can take advantage of a certain presence of pollinators. Among the olive cultivars used for pollination are the Bouteillan, Leccino, Lucques, Manzanillo, and Sigoise. It is vulnerable to certain organic pests, including Gloeosporium olivarum, Palpita unionalis and Liothrips oleae. It is also vulnerable to cold; while an adult tree can sustain temperatures down to ‚àí12 ¬∞C to ‚àí14 ¬∞C (+10 to 14 ¬∞F), young trees need much higher temperatures to survive. This can be a problem in the Gard and Provence regions, where winters can often be fierce. Cross breeding Hybridization of the Picholine and Manzanillo (Bellini et al 2002b) resulted in the newer cultivars Arno, Tevere, and Basento.

It is highly valued for its exceptionally high tolerance to cold. The Olivi√®re is primarily used for oil, and even though the fruit yields a low percentage, the trees carry large quantities of olives, and the oil is of high quality. Extent The Olivi√®re is particularly common in the Pyr√©n√©es- Orientales, but also in Aude and H√©rault. It can also be found in Italy, Algeria, and as far away as China. Synonyms The Olivi√®re is known under a number of different names locally. The local varieties in southern France include B√©caru, Galinenque, Laurine, Michelenque, Ouana, Palma, Pointue and Pounchude. In Italy it is referred to as Olivio Galliningo or Olivio Laureolo. Characteristics It is a cultivar of very good strength, and can grow to great heights. It has a drooping growth form and elliptic leaves. The olives are of high weight, of a bulging, pointed shape, and asymmetrical. The stone has a pointed apex and a rounded base, with a rough surface and a mucro. It is an early cultivar, and matures in the month of October. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is brown. Processing The Olivi√®re is used almost entirely for the extraction of oil, though it can also be eaten. It gives a relatively poor yield of oil (13-15 %), but it compensates for this with an extremely good yield of fruit. Trees start bearing fruit after only two or three years, and an adult tree can carry as much as 100 kg (220 lb) of fruit a year. The aroma of the oil is described as \\"fruit, almond and fresh apricots with a background hint of spicy green mint\\". Agronomy The cultivar's vigour and productivity contribute to its popularity. It is a self-sterile cultivar, so it needs the presence of pollinators. Among the olive cultivars used for pollination are the Cayon, Picholine, Verdale and Arbequina. A major drawback with this cultivar is its vulnerability to certain biological pests, such as the Bactrocera oleae, Pseudomonas syringae, Saissetia oleae, and Sooty moulds. On the other hand, it has an exceptional resistance to cold; after the devastatingly hard winter of 1956, when most French olive orchards were destroyed, many Olivi√®re trees survived. That means that some of the trees of this variety are over 400 years old.

It is often referred to as a perle noire, the \\"Black Pearl of Provence\\". The Tanche is said to have been introduced to France by the Greeks of Massilia, around the fourth century BC. Extent The Tanche is grown mostly in Dr√¥me and northern Vaucluse regions of southern France. Attempts to grow this variety outside of its native region are rarely successful. Synonyms Since the cultivar is largely local in scope, it also has few synonyms. The olives grown in the region around the town of Nyons are normally referred to as Olive de Nyons, or simply Nyons, and this is the name under which the olive is best known to the rest of the world. Another synonym, used in parts of Vaucluse, is Olive de Carpentras. Characteristics It is a cultivar of medium vigour, with a spreading growth form, elliptic leaves, an expansive global crown, and large size. The olives are of medium-to-high weight (5-6 g), elliptic in shape with a rounded tip and slightly asymmetrical. The stone is ovoid, rounded on both ends, with a rough surface and a mucro. The fruits can be harvested at smaller size in late November, while for larger olives it is better to wait until December or January. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is a violet black. Processing The Tanche is a dual-use cultivar, used both as a table olive and for extraction of oil. It is very productive and gives a yield of 22-25%. The oil has a \\"smooth taste and an aroma of crisp green apples and freshly cut grass\\". The very sweet taste is normally associated with the late harvest. Olives picked at a later maturity give an oil with much more character. This cultivar is the only one to enjoy the appellation of Nyons, which it was granted in 1994. Oils of this denomination must contain at least 95% Tanche. The Tanche is also popularly used to make the dish tapenade. Agronomy The cultivar is slow to get into production, but after that production is high. It is a self-sterile variety, so it needs a pollinators for fertilisation. The most common pollinator is the Cayon. There are today more than 230,000 Tanche olive trees, representing an annual production of around 400 tons of table olives and 200 tons of olive oil. Tanche is vulnerable to certain pests, in particular Spilocaea oleaginea, Verticillium dahliae and Bactrocera oleae. Other than this, the main threat to the plant is wind, to which it is highly susceptible. It is quite resistant to cold.

Originally from the town of Aups in the Var d√©partement, it is today grown also in Australia and the United States. It is mostly used for the production of oil. The Bouteillan is vulnerable to certain pests, but has a good resistance to cold. Extent The Bouteillan is originally from the town of Aups in southern France. It is today grown primarily in the region of Var in Provence. It can also be found in Egypt, and as far away as Australia and the United States. Synonyms The cultivar has several different local name varieties: Benesage, Redounan, Cayanne, Plant d'Aups and Plant de Salernes. Characteristics It is a cultivar of medium-to-weak vigour, with a spreading growth form, and elliptic-lanceolate leaves of medium length and width. The olives are of medium weight, and ovoid, slightly asymmetrical in shape. The stone is rounded at both ends, with a rough surface and a mucro. Depending on the region, this cultivar is picked from the end of October until New Year. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is Burgundy. The olive is clingstonethe stone clings to the flesh. Processing Descriptions of the Bouteillan vary between a dual-use cultivar and a pure oil cultivar. Though it can be eaten, it is in reality mainly used for extraction of oil. The yield depends to a large extent on the date of harvest, and goes from about 15% to as much as 25%. The taste of the oil, if the fruit is harvested early, is strong and herbal. With a later harvest the taste becomes more fruity, reminiscent of ripe pears. Agronomy It is considered a highly productive cultivar, and shows little tendency towards biennial bearing, (i.e. that a good yield is followed by a weaker one the next year) a common problem in many other olive cultivars. It requires light but frequent pruning and irrigation. The Bouteillan is self-fertile, but it can still benefit from the presence of certain other pollinators. Among the olive cultivars used for pollination are the Picholine, Corniale and Grossane. It is vulnerable to certain biological pests, in particular the Bactrocera oleae (Olive fruit fly), Prays oleae and Saissetia oleae. It is also sensitive to soil salinity, but has a high resistance to cold.

It is best known under the name Ni√ßoise, which signifies its curing method, in which form it is an important ingredient in the salade ni√ßoise. It can also be used for the production of oil. This cultivar is particularly susceptible to the olive fruit fly. Extent The Cailletier is particularly common in the Alpes-Maritimes region of southern France, where it is the main variety, and also in nearby Liguria in Italy. It can also be found as far away as Japan, Australia and the United States. Synonyms In Italy the cultivar is known under the name of Taggiasca, which derives from the town of Taggia. Locally it is known under a number of different synonyms, including Cayet or Cayon, Grassenc, Olivier de Grasse, Pendoulier and Pleureur. The name Ni√ßoise is not a synonym, but the name of the olive after a particular processing (see below). Characteristics It is a cultivar of good strength and large size, with an erect growth form, and elliptic-lanceolate leaves of medium length and width. The olives are of low weight, ovoid shape and symmetrical. The stone has a rounded apex and base, with a rugose surface and a mucro. For use in oil production the olive is harvested in mid-November. Fruits for use as table olives, on the other hand, can be harvested up until May. The fully ripe olives have \\"a dark colour that ranges from black brownish-purple to brownish-black\\". Processing Cailletier cultivar near Contes, Alpes-Maritimes, with an olive harvest net on the ground The Cailletier is a dual use cultivar, used both for the extraction of oil and as a table olive. In spite of the fact that the stone is relatively large, it gives a yield of oil (20-25%). The oil has a sweet delicate quality, and is appreciated by novice olive oil consumers. It has a taste of fresh almond and hazelnut. For a more bitter, strong taste, a harvest before the end of the year is preferable. In France the cultivar is used in three officially approved appellations: the \\"AOC Huile d'Olive de Nice\\", \\"AOC Olive de Nice\\" and \\"AOC P√¢te d'Olive de Nice\\"; in Italy the quality of the Taggiasca cultivar is granted by Protected Designation of Origin - PDO regulations. The best-known application of the Cailletier is for Ni√ßoise salads. For this purpose the olives are cured black, a process carried out in the Nice area, hence the name. Agronomy It is considered a productive cultivar, but with a tendency towards biennial bearing, i.e. that a good yield is followed by a weaker one the next year. It is generally agreed that the cultivar is self- fertile, but some authorities still recommend the presence of other pollinators. It is vulnerable to certain organic pests, primarily the Bactrocera oleae (Olive fruit fly). Other risks are the Saissetia oleae, Spilocaea oleaginea and Sooty moulds. Also starlings are particularly fond of the Cailletier. While somewhat vulnerable to cold, it has high resistance to drought.

Among the names used locally for the Cayon, are Entrecastellen, Plant d'Etranger, Nasies, Montfortaise and Race De Montfort. In Algeria it is known as Roulette de S√≥umam. Characteristics It is a cultivar of good strength, with a spreading growth form and elliptic leaves that are short and of medium width. The olives are of medium weight, ovoid shape and asymmetrical. The stone has a rounded apex and pointed base, with a smooth surface and the presence of a mucro. It is an early cultivar, and harvesting starts in early November. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is black. Processing The Cayon is mainly used for extraction of oil, and gives a medium yield (18-22%). Oil extraction is a relatively easy process in this cultivar. The taste of the oil is described as \\"fruity and balanced, finish with the softness of almond\\". The Cayon can also be mixed with the Grossane for olive oil production. Agronomy It is considered a productive cultivar, with a tendency towards biennial bearing, i.e. that a good yield is followed by a weaker one the next year. Its rooting ability is medium-to-high. There is some disagreement over the fertility of the Cayon, though most authorities agree that it is self- sterile, and depends on the presence of other pollinators. The Cayon is also highly valued for its use as a pollinator of other olive tree. Among the cultivars it helps pollinate are the Olivi√®re, and the Tanche. It does not show any particular vulnerability to the major pests, with the exception of the Bactrocera oleae (Olive fruit fly). It is also relatively vulnerable to cold, but sustains drought quite well.https://web.archive.org/web/20140225164131/http://www.allaboutoliveoil.com/ References Olive cultivars ","title":"Cayon olive"},{"id":"21185598","text":"The Winemiller Family Farm is a historic home and farm complex located at Taneytown, Carroll County, Maryland, United States.

The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, Being the first part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was published in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls. He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America, before he had seen a coral island, and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans. The book was the first volume of three Darwin wrote about the geology he had investigated during the voyage, and was widely recognised as a major scientific work that presented his deductions from all the available observations on this large subject. In 1853, Darwin was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal for the monograph and for his work on barnacles. Darwin's theory that coral reefs formed as the islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided has been supported by modern investigations, and is no longer disputed, while the cause of the subsidence and uplift of areas of crust has continued to be a subject of discussion. Theory of coral atoll formation Reefs were formed by corals living in shallow depths of water. Darwin's theory set out a sequence of coral reef formation around an extinct volcanic island, becoming an atoll as the island and ocean floor subsided. Courtesy of the US Geological Survey When the Beagle set out in 1831, the formation of coral atolls was a scientific puzzle. Advance notice of her sailing, given in the Athenaeum of 24 December, described investigation of this topic as \\"the most interesting part of the Beagle's survey\\" with the prospect of \\"many points for investigation of a scientific nature beyond the mere occupation of the surveyor. In 1824 and 1825, French naturalists Quoy and Gaimard had observed that the coral organisms lived at relatively shallow depths, but the islands appeared in deep oceans. In books that were taken on the Beagle as references, Henry De la Beche, Frederick William Beechey and Charles Lyell had published the opinion that the coral had grown on underwater mountains or volcanoes, with atolls taking the shape of underlying volcanic craters. The Admiralty instructions for the voyage stated: As a student at the University of Edinburgh in 1827, Darwin learnt about marine invertebrates while assisting the investigations of the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant, and during his last year at the University of Cambridge in 1831, he had studied geology under Adam Sedgwick. So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the Beagle expedition, as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy's aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while the ship's complement carried out its hydrographic survey. FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell's Principles of Geology before they left. On their first stop ashore at St Jago island in January 1832, Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell's uniformitarian concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time, and thought that he could write his own book on geology. Lyell's first volume included a brief outline of the idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters, and the second volume, which was sent to Darwin during the voyage, gave more detail. Darwin received it in November 1832. While the Beagle surveyed the coasts of South America from February 1832 to September 1835, Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising. After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship, he experienced the 1835 Concepci√≥n earthquake. In the following months he speculated that as the land was uplifted, large areas of the ocean bed subsided. It struck him that this could explain the formation of atolls. Darwin's theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where the level of the underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth. Darwin's investigations to test his theory Darwin saw the coral reef and lagoon around Tahiti. By the time that the Beagle set out for the Gal√°pagos Islands on 7 September 1835, Darwin had thought out the essentials of his theory of atoll formation. While he no longer favoured the concept that atolls formed on submerged volcanos, he noted some points on these islands which supported that idea: 16 volcanic craters resembled atolls in being raised slightly more on one side, and five hills appeared roughly equal in height. He then considered a topic which was compatible with either theory, the lack of coral reefs around the Gal√°pagos Islands. One possibility was a lack of calcareous matter around the islands, but his main proposal, which FitzRoy had suggested to him, was that the seas were too cold. As they sailed on, Darwin took note of the records of sea temperature kept in the ship's \\"Weather Journal\\". He had his first glimpse of coral atolls as they passed Honden Island on 9 November and sailed on through the Low or Dangerous Archipelago (Tuamotus). Arriving at Tahiti on 15 November, Darwin saw it \\"encircled by a Coral reef separated from the shore by channels & basins of still water\\". He climbed the hills of Tahiti, and was strongly impressed by the sight across to the island of Eimeo, where \\"The mountains abruptly rise out of a glassy lake, which is separated on all sides, by a narrow defined line of breakers, from the open sea. ‚Äì Remove the central group of mountains, & there remains a Lagoon Isd.\\" Rather than recording his findings about the coral reefs in his notes about the island, he wrote them up as the first full draft of his theory, an essay titled Coral Islands, dated 1835. They left Tahiti on 3 December, and Darwin probably wrote his essay as they sailed towards New Zealand where they arrived on 21 December. He described the polyp species building the coral on the barrier wall, flourishing in the heavy surf of breaking waves particularly on the windward side, and speculated on reasons that corals in the calm lagoon did not grow so high. He concluded with a \\"remark that the general horizontal uplifting which I have proved has & is now raising upwards the greater part of S. America & as it would appear likewise of N. America, would of necessity be compensated by an equal subsidence in some other part of the world.\\" =Keeling Islands= An 1889 map of the Keeling Islands based on the Admiralty Chart includes a section across the atoll showing the steep slopes FitzRoy's soundings found outside the reef. Aerial view of the Keeling Islands. Image courtesy of the Image Science & Analysis Laboratory, NASA Johnson Space Center. FitzRoy's instructions set detailed requirements for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly if they rose from the bottom of the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand. These soundings were taken personally by FitzRoy, and the tallow from each sounding was cut off and taken on board to be examined by Darwin. The impressions taken on the steep outside slope of the reef were marked with the shapes of living corals, and otherwise were clean down to about 10 fathoms (18 m); then at increasing depths, the tallow showed fewer such impressions and collected more grains of sand until it was evident that there were no living corals below about 20‚Äì30 fathoms (36‚Äì55 m). Darwin carefully noted the location of the different types of coral around the reef and in the lagoon. In his diary, he described, \\"examining the very interesting yet simple structure & origin of these islands. The water being unusually smooth, I waded in as far as the living mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks. In some of the gullies & hollows, there were beautiful green & other colored fishes, & the forms & tints of many of the Zoophites were admirable. It is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of organic beings with which the sea of the tropics, so prodigal of life, teems\\", though he cautioned against the \\"rather exuberant language\\" used by some naturalists. As they left the islands after eleven days, Darwin wrote out a summary of his theory in his diary: Publication of theory When the Beagle returned on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism, and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was \\"very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first, for it accounted for so much... the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs.\\" Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837. Darwin's first literary project was his Journal and Remarks on the natural history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how the presence or absence of coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs. His tasks included finding experts to examine and report on his collections from the voyage. Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of ¬£1,000 was allocated at the end of August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands. In January 1838, Smith, Elder & Co. advertised the first part of Darwin's geology book, Geological observations on volcanic islands and coral formations, as a single octavo volume to be published that year. By the end of the month Darwin thought that his geology was \\"covering so much paper, & will take so much time\\" that it could be split into separate volumes (eventually Coral reefs was published first, followed by Volcanic islands in 1844, and South America in 1846). He also doubted that the treasury funds could cover all the geological writings. The first part of the zoology was published in February 1838, but Darwin found it a struggle to get the experts to produce their reports on his collections, and overwork led to illness. After a break to visit Scotland, he wrote up a major paper on the geological \\"roads\\" of Glen Roy. On 5 October 1838 he noted in his diary, \\"Began Coral Paper: requires much reading\\". In November 1838 Darwin proposed to his cousin Emma, and they married in January 1839. As well as his other projects he continued to work on his ideas of evolution as his \\"prime hobby\\", but repeated delays were caused by his illness. He sporadically restarted work on Coral Reefs, and on 9 May 1842 wrote to Emma, telling her he was =Publication and subsequent editions= The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was published in May 1842, priced at 15 shillings, and was well received. A second edition was published in 1874, extensively revised and rewritten to take into account James Dwight Dana's 1872 publication Corals and Coral Islands, and work by Joseph Jukes. =Structure of book= The book has a tightly logical structure, and presents a bold argument. Illustrations are used as an integral part of the argument, with numerous detailed charts and one large world map marked in colour showing all reefs known at that time. A brief introduction sets out the aims of the book. The first chapters of the book describe the kinds of corals forming each part of the various types of reef. The first three chapters describe the various types of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving a detailed description of the reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon. The fourth chapter on the distribution and growth of coral reefs examines the conditions in which they flourish, their rate of growth and the depths at which the reef building polyps can live, showing that they can only flourish at a very limited depth. In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level. In the sixth chapter he examines the geographical distribution of types of reef and its geological implications, using the large coloured map of the world to show vast areas of atolls and barrier reefs where the ocean bed was subsiding with no active volcanos, and vast areas with fringing reefs and volcanic outbursts where the land was rising. This chapter ends with a recapitulation which summarises the findings of each chapter and concludes by describing the global image as \\"a magnificent and harmonious picture of the movements, which the crust of the earth has within a late period undergone\\". A large appendix gives a detailed and exhaustive description of all the information he had been able to obtain on the reefs of the world. This logical structure can be seen as a prototype for the organisation of On the Origin of Species, presenting the detail of various aspects of the problem, then setting out a theory explaining the phenomena, followed by a demonstration of the wider explanatory power of the theory. Unlike the Origin which was hurriedly put together as an abstract of his planned \\"big book\\", Coral Reefs is fully supported by citations and material gathered together in the Appendix. Coral Reefs is arguably the first volume of Darwin's huge treatise on his philosophy of nature, like his succeeding works showing how slow gradual change can account for the history of life. In presenting types of reef as an evolutionary series it demonstrated a rigorous methodology for historical sciences, interpreting patterns visible in the present as the results of history. In one passage he presents a particularly Malthusian view of a struggle for survival ‚Äì \\"In an old-standing reef, the corals, which are so different in kind on different parts of it, are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy, and hold their places, like other organic beings, by a struggle one with another, and with external nature; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow, except under peculiarly favourable circumstances.\\" =Reception= Having successfully completed and published the other books on the geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles. Two volumes on Lepadidae (goose barnacles) were published in 1851. While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles, Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the Royal Society had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science. Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote telling him that \\"Pordock proposed you for the Coral Islands & Lepadidae, Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone, & then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles that you would have [smiled] to hear.\\" =Late 19th-century controversy and tests of the theory= A major scientific controversy over the origin of coral reefs took place in the late 19th century, between supporters of Darwin's theory (such as the American geologist James Dwight Dana, who early in his career had seen coral reefs in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838‚Äì42 United States Exploring Expedition), and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer John Murray, who participated in the 1872‚Äì76 Challenger expedition. Murray's theory challenged Darwin's notion of subsidence, proposing instead that coral reefs formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals. Amongst Murray's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist Alexander Agassiz, who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine coral reefs in search of evidence to support Murray's theory, and to discredit Darwin.Dobbs, D. (2005): Reef Madness: Charles Darwin, Alexander Agassiz, and the Meaning of Coral. Pantheon Books, New York. A series of expeditions to test Darwin's theory by drilling on Funafuti atoll in the Ellice Islands (now part of Tuvalu) was conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating whether basalt or traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898, attaining a final depth of , still in coral. Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 expedition and leader of the 1897 expedition.Branagan, D.F. (2005): T.W. Edgeworth David: A Life: Geologist, Adventurer and \\"Knight in the Old Brown Hat\\", National Library of Australia, Canberra, pp. 85‚Äì105. David, Mrs Edgeworth, Funafuti or Three Months On A Coral Atoll: an unscientific account of a scientific expedition, London: John Murray, 1899 At the time these results were regarded as inconclusive and it was not until the 1950s when, prior to carrying out nuclear bomb tests on Eniwetok, deep exploratory drilling through of coral to the underlying basalt finally vindicated Darwin's theory. However, the geologic history of atolls is more complex than Darwin (1842) and Davis (1920 & 1928) envisioned. Darwin's findings and later views Darwin's interest on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, he was looking for confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20 fathoms (37 m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30 fathoms (55 m). Later findings suggest a limit of around 100 m, still a small fraction of the depth of the ocean floor at 3000‚Äì5000 m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues. Darwin's investigations showed how coral eating organisms such as parrotfish controlled the growth of coral, and formed mudbanks. In assessing the geology of the reef, Darwin showed his remarkable ability to collect facts and find patterns to reconstruct geological history on the basis of the very limited evidence available. He gave attention to the smallest detail. Having heard that parrotfish browsed on the living coral, he dissected specimens to find finely ground coral in their intestines. He concluded that such fish, and coral eating invertebrates such as Holothuroidea, could account for the banks of fine grained mud he found at the Keeling Islands; it showed also \\"that there are living checks to the growth of coral-reefs, and that the almost universal law of 'consume and be consumed,' holds good even with the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks, which are able to withstand the force of the open ocean.\\" His observations on the part played by organisms in the formation of the various features of reefs anticipated later studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000 ft (1,500 m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610 ft (1,405 m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000 ft (1,000 m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level. In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast areas where the seabed was being elevated were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge areas where the ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by plate tectonics, which he did not anticipate.

Bio-energy with carbon storage, afforestation projects, and ocean nourishment (including iron fertilization) could be considered examples of bio-geoengineering. Biogenic aerosols can be grown to replace those beneficial aerosols lost as the result of the death of 50% of Earth's boreal forests. Agricultural production of atmospheric aerosols called \\"monoterpenes\\" is possible if crops that are rich in monoterpenes are grown. Introduction Geoengineering is conventionally split into two broad categories. Carbon geoengineering tries to expel carbon dioxide from the environment, which would address the underlying driver of environmental change ‚Äî the collection of carbon dioxide in the climate. In the chain from outflows to focuses to temperatures to impacts, it breaks the connection from discharges to fixations. Sun powered geoengineering tries to mirror a little part of daylight once more into space or increment the measure of sun oriented radiation that escapes once again into space to cool the planet. Rather than carbon geoengineering, sun based geoengineering does not address the underlying driver of environmental change. It rather expects to break the connection from fixations to temperatures, along these lines diminishing some atmosphere harms. The quick increment in the centralization of air CO2 proceeded with anthropogenic emanations of this gas is the fundamental factor driving worldwide environmental change. Due to many different causes global temperatures are to increase by 3-5 degrees celsius or 5.4 - 9 degrees fahrenheit within this century. Bio-geoengineering solutions to climate change Carbon Capture and storage. The CO2 is ordinarily caught before the emissions leave the smokestack, for the most part with a sorbent concoction. The liquified CO2 is then siphoned into underground aquifers for long haul storage. Removal of atmospheric C02 - Synthetic trees Sorbents catch CO2 from free-streaming air and discharge those atoms as an unadulterated stream of carbon dioxide for sequestration. 100 m2 can extract about 1000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 11 million devices would be required to remove 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide Stratospheric Aerosols. Amid major volcanic ejections, the Earth regularly experiences huge cooling because of sulfur shot out into the stratosphere. Paul Crutzen, a Dutch chemist, proposed creating a 'blanket' of sulphur that would block the Sun's rays from reaching Earth.https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%252Fs10584-006-9101-y.pdf%20%20 Seeding the atmosphere to increase reflection of sunlight is also a solution however such approaches are still not being adopted since they have not been proven feasible and have many social, economic, and technical issues before they could be widely adopted. Downside of bio-geoengineering Mirroring the sun's beams into space would modify precipitation designs and reforesting the deserts could change wind designs and could even lessen tree development in different regions. If we are not able to sustain such technology many wildlife can possibly die due to the rapid change in the earth's climate.

To the surprise of many, Blagojevich said in 2008 that he agreed with the idea of commuting Ryan's federal prison sentence. Feud with father-in-law A major event of 2005 was Blagojevich's dispute with his father-in-law, Chicago Alderman Richard Mell. Although Blagojevich had been elected largely with Mell's help, the two had a contentious relationship since Blagojevich was elected governor. The feud went public in January 2005 when Blagojevich shut down a landfill owned by a distant cousin of his wife Patti for allegedly accepting waste it was not licensed to take, and it was revealed that Mell had served as an advisor to the cousin. A Cook County grand jury investigated whether Blagojevich's administration overstepped authority in closing the landfill. Legislation was eventually passed giving the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency more authority over landfills and preventing relatives of top Illinois officials from owning landfills. Mell said that Blagojevich \\"used me\\" and that he \\"uses everybody and then discards them.\\" Regarding his decision to shut down the landfill despite the fact the landfill was owned by a relative, Blagojevich said, \\"This is the kind of thing that I think frankly separates the men from the boys in leadership. Do you have the testicular virility to make a decision like that knowing what's coming your way? I say I do.\\" This remark was both ridiculed as an undignified comment for a governor as well as criticized for being sexist. Mell said publicly at the time that Blagojevich's chief fundraiser had traded state jobs for campaign contributions, but recanted after threat of a lawsuit. Federal investigations Since 2005, Blagojevich has been the subject of at least a dozen separate federal investigations, involving accusations against at least 14 other people, including Blagojevich's former fundraiser Tony Rezko. In 2006, Blagojevich said that he has been targeted for investigation by \\"scoundrels\\" due to the change he brought as governor, such as his ethics reform bill. On December 30, 2005, it was reported that a leasing deal reached for occupants of the rebuilt Illinois Tollway oasis had come under investigation by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. Those who signed the fast food contracts were reported to be connected to Blagojevich campaign fundraising. This was is in addition to other investigations in the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Department of Corrections and the Department of Children and Family Services. On June 30, 2006, it was revealed that state Attorney General Lisa Madigan had received a letter from United States Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, stating that Fitzgerald is looking into \\"very serious allegations of endemic hiring fraud\\" in the Blagojevich administration, and thanking Madigan for turning over her office's investigation to the federal authorities.Feds Probing Illinois Gov.

The governor repeatedly denied that he was Public Official A, but on February 26, 2008, the judge in the case issued a ruling which confirmed his identity. A pretrial ruling in the case from U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve named the Blagojevich campaign and confirmed that Blagojevich was the intended beneficiary of at least one of Rezko's extortion attempts. Blagojevich was not charged in the indictment, although prosecutors have asserted in other court filings that he told a top Democratic fundraiser that he could steer contracts, legal work and investment banking in order to help with fundraising.Judge reveals Blagojevich is 'Public Official A', Chicago Tribune, 26 February 2008.Feds link governor to probe, Chicago Tribune, 21 December 2007. During the Rezko trial, Blagojevich's name came up frequently - first during testimony from Levine, who testified of Rezko's influence with the governor. Blagojevich was not charged in the case, but prosecutors sought to prove that his top advisers were involved in widespread kickback schemes. Levine mentioned Blagojevich by name at least 30 times in one day of testimony, and said under oath that the governor told him, \\"[Y]ou stick with us and you'll do very well for yourself\\". Levine took the comment to mean that there was money to be made if he did the administration's bidding. A Blagojevich spokesperson denied that the governor was involved in any illegal activity, saying \\"Stuart Levine's assertions about the governor are wrong. As we've said before, that's not how the governor does business.\\"Name on Levine's lips at trial: Blagojevich, Chicago Tribune, 20 March 2008. On April 3, 2008, Levine testified that Blagojevich was aware of a shakedown involving businessman and movie producer Tom Rosenberg in 2004. Levine said that when Rosenberg threatened to go to the authorities over what he saw as an extortion attempt, Rezko and the governor worked out a \\"damage control\\" plan. Rosenberg would get the contract, but would get no further business from the state. Levine told the jury that Blagojevich approved of this plan and told Rezko that the contract was \\"the last thing that Mr. Rosenberg should get from the state\\".

His stated reasons for considering Winfrey were that he viewed her as the person most instrumental in electing Obama as president, and that he viewed her as having more influence than all 100 senators combined which would make her especially formidable in advancing Obama's agenda. However, when Blagojevich became embroiled in a controversy, he was reluctant to contact Winfrey about his idea out of fear she would turn him down and out of fear that she would perceive his offer as a gimmick and instead decided to appoint former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to the seat. When Winfrey learned she was a candidate after the fact, she reacted with amusement, noting that while she was absolutely not interested, she did feel she could be a Senator. $25,000 Club In the midst of the Rezko trial, the Chicago Tribune reported on what it called a \\"$25,000 Club\\" in which 75% of businesses, unions and individuals that gave a $25,000 donation to Rod Blagojevich's political campaign received benefits from the State of Illinois, including state contracts and appointments to state boards.Meitrodt, Jeffrey; Ray Long and John Chase.

Christensen was appointed as Chairman of the Illinois Elevator Safety Board by Governor Blagojevich. Christensen was eligible to serve as Chair because he was also appointed as a representative of a municipality between 25,000 and 50,000. Christensen is a resident of Tinley Park, IL that had a population of 48,401 in the official 2000 census. Critics challenged his eligibility because at the time of Christensen's appointment in 2003, the village of Tinley Park had a population in excess of 53,000. Christensen and the Business Manager of Elevator Constructors Local 55, Roderick Gillis were reappointed to their same board positions in 2007 by Governor Blagojevich.

However, he and his family opted to remain in the Ravenswood Manor neighborhood on Chicago's Northside. Blagojevich cited an unwillingness to move his older daughter away from home, and a Chicago Sun-Times columnist speculated that another reason might be Blagojevich's wife's Chicago real estate business. As Springfield state agencies became populated with workers who commuted from Chicago during the week, and the Blagojevich family shunned the use of the Mansion even for one-night stays, onlookers wrote that Blagojevich \\"disdains\\" Springfield and that Blagojevich \\"ignored\\" southern Illinois \\"more than any governor in Illinois history.\\" Past governors lived in Springfield or have at least stayed there during legislative sessions, while Blagojevich stayed in Chicago during legislative sessions. He spent little time at the Illinois State Capitol. The decision not to live in the governor's mansion \\"offended many Illinoisans\\" and \\"infuriated just about every legislator\\"; Blagojevich also upset many by canceling the annual Halloween trick-or-treating at the mansion. Commute During July and part of August 2007, Illinois lawmakers were in a deadlock over approving a state budget. In light of this, Blagojevich faced \\"immense\\" criticism for choosing to take daily commutes between Chicago and Springfield rather than stay in Springfield. The round trip on a state plane costs nearly $6,000, and Blagojevich made the trip nine times during the 2007 budget crisis between May 22 and June 7, costing Illinois taxpayers more than $75,000 according to state transportation records. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted that a commercial round-trip flight between Springfield and Chicago can be had on short notice for between $500 and $700. State senator Chris Lauzen, head of the legislature's audit committee, noted that the cost was more than a teacher's annual salary. After ridicule from lawmakers, voters, and editorial cartoonists, Blagojevich stopped the daily flights home. In December 2007, the Associated Press released an analysis of Blagojevich's 2007 state travel and found that $225,000 of it had been for personal reasons, rather than official business. On his last day in office, while the Senate was still deliberating, he flew back to Chicago in a state plane and was driven home by a caravan of state vehicles. Work hours During the 2007 budget crisis, Blagojevich had criticized state lawmakers for not working five days a week, with his spokeswoman saying, \\"Everyone in America works five days a week and is expected to put in full-time work in order to complete their jobs\\" on June 4. Travel records showed that Blagojevich had flown into Springfield in May and June an average of three days a week, arriving about noon and sometimes staying for as little as three hours before returning to Chicago, less than 200 hours in total during the three months. Blagojevich was criticized by even Democratic lawmakers for what they saw as hypocrisy. Rep. John Fritchey called Blagojevich's criticism \\"tantamount to lunacy\\" once his own work schedule was examined, and Fritchey also raised the issue of Blagojevich's lack of time spent in his Chicago office in the James R. Thompson Center, saying: \\"He governs out of his house or out of his campaign office. That's an odd way to govern.\\" In November 2007, Chicago television station WBBM-TV watched Blagojevich's home during normal business hours, \\"repeatedly finding the governor at home during normal business hours with no one other than his family coming and going.‚Äù Former employees assert that Blagojevich did not appear at his Chicago office that often. Later, during federal corruption charges against Blagojevich, Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn questioned the effect of this isolation on Blagojevich's mental health. Federal arrest on corruption charges At 6:15 a.m. on December 9, 2008, FBI special agents arrested Blagojevich and John Harris, the governor's chief of staff.\\"Breaking News: Gov. Blagojevich Arrested\\", WSIL-TV, Associated Press, December 9, 2008, accessed December 9, 2008. After the simultaneous arrest at their homes, they were transported to FBI headquarters in Chicago. According to a criminal complaintUnited States v. Rod Blagojevich and John R. Harris filed in US District Court, Blagojevich is accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, as well as soliciting bribes. It is specifically alleged that he attempted to benefit financially from his sole authority to fill the US Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama. The complaint alleged that Blagojevich went on a profanity-laced tirade, saying that the Senate seat \\"is a fucking valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing\\". The affidavit says that in exchange for the Senate appointment, Blagojevich sought to be appointed as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Energy, or ambassador, or alternatively, that he could receive a lucrative job offer from a union in return for designating a pro-union appointee. He allegedly also mentioned corporate boards his wife could be appointed to, for which she could receive $150,000 a year compensation. If he could receive nothing for the seat, the complaint says, Blagojevich considered appointing himself, to position himself for a 2016 presidential run and to give himself increased resources to mount any potential legal defense. According to U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, Blagojevich threatened to revoke funds to Children's Memorial Hospital after its chief executive officer did not give a $50,000 contribution to the governor's campaign.

He served as the last Chief Engineer of the old New York City Fire Department, the original colonial-era volunteer firefighters of New York City, from 1860 until 1865. He led the fire department during the New York Draft Riots, for which he gained national attention, and later founded the Volunteer Fireman's Association.

Gratefully Remembered For The Service He Rendered New-York's Citizens By His Bravery During The Draft Riots ‚Äì He Loved The Fireman's Life.\\" New York Times, November 19, 1892. 125px At age 17, Decker began working with Engine Company No. 14 of the old volunteer fire department and, when he became of age, officially joined the department in October 1844. That same year, he became married to Mary Margaret Barton with whom he would have three children. Two of these would die in infancy while a third, their son, drowned while attending school at Norwalk, Connecticut. In 1847, he was made an assistant foreman of the company, serving three consecutive terms, elected foreman in 1850 and assistant engineer two years later. He was elected Chief Engineer in 1860 and re-elected in 1863. During his time as Chief Engineer, he was responsible for establishing the First Fire Zouaves and, when the Second Regiment of Zouaves was organized, he maintained them out of his own finances and later became its first colonel. =New York Draft Riots= During the New York Draft Riots, Decker commanded the fire department, coordinating its operations throughout Manhattan. He was present at Third Avenue and 47th Street, on Monday, July 13, 1863, when the draft protests turned violent outside the Ninth District Provost Marshal's office. The volunteer firemen of Engine Company No. 33 (called \\"Black Joke,\\" after an 1812 warship) halted the draft selection by smashing the window of the office and breaking the rotating lottery bin. When a gathering mob set the office on fire, Decker and Black Joke foreman Peter Masterson (a sometime city alderman and state representative) cleared a passage through the mob and enabled the Black Joke to put out the blaze before it burned down neighboring tenements.Bernstein, Iver, The New York City Draft Riots: Their Significance for American Society and Politics in the Age of the Civil War. 1992. pp. 18-19. John Decker being threatened by a mob during the New York Draft Riots That evening, Decker confronted the mob looting the Colored Orphan Asylum. Decker arrived almost immediately after the orphanage was set on fire and did everything he could to prevent it. Despite having no police protection, Decker and his men made several attempts to break through the rioters. The rioters far outnumbered the firefighters and were turned back. A second attempt was made in three different parts of the building, Decker succeeding in confusing the rioters. The mob became angered at Decker for his repeated attempts to interfere and threatened his life if he tried another attempt to put out the fire. With this, Decker went up to the steps of the building and spoke to the 2,000 rioters and \\"declared it would be disgraceful to humanity and to the City of New-York to destroy a building whose only purpose was benevolence, and which had for its object nothing but good.\\" The half-drunken mob ignored Decker and set fire to the building once more. When Decker and his men put out the fire, which had been set in different parts of the building, the mob rushed towards Decker with the intention of killing him. Decker's life was saved only when his men, who quickly surrounded Decker, told the crowd that their fire chief would not be taken \\"except over their dead bodies.\\" He and 15 of his men were eventually forced from the building and thrown out into the street where they once again stood by to watch the orphanage burn down. Decker was on duty throughout the five-day period and, at one point, narrowly escaped from being lynched. Moments before he was to be hanged, Decker told his attackers that they might \\"stop his draft, but could not stop the government drafts.\\" He was rescued at the last moment by his men. The New York Times later described Decker as having \\"showed himself one of the bravest of the brave.\\" =Retirement and political career= Upon the reorganization of the fire department in June 1865, which effectively replaced the old volunteer firefighter service with the modern New York City Fire Department, he was legislated out of office. Although the city attempted to retain Decker as the working head of the new organization, Decker declined declaring that if the Commissioner proposed to superintend the work of the firefighters at the fires, there would be, with himself, five Captains, \\"enough to sink any ship\\". No one was appointed in his place as a result and, on the night of August 31, 1865, Decker locked the doors of his office for the last time and went home. His last fire was that same day at a stable on Mulberry Street, in the rear of the canal. Decker moved to Staten Island in 1867 and later relocated to Port Richmond where he became involved in real estate. Entering local politics, he represented Richmond County in the state assembly, receiving 2,336 votes and winning the majority vote, and later held a position at Castle Garden. He was also a member of the committee on State Prisons, the Sub-Committee of the Whole, and was regarded as a popular state representative. At the 100th anniversary of the British evacuation of New York in 1883, Decker reorganized the surviving members of the old volunteers and assigned them a place in one of the divisions of the Centennial parade. Shortly thereafter, he founded the Volunteer Fireman's Association and served as its first president. Under his energetic leadership, the organization was established as one of the most prominent institutions in the city. =Death= On May 17, 1892, Decker developed symptoms related to blood poisoning in his leg and was confined to his Vreeland Street home. He last left his residence, walking two blocks to the nearest polling station with the aid of a cane and crutch, to vote for Grover Cleveland in the presidential election of 1892. In early-November, Decker contracted a heavy cold which soon turned into pneumonia. He died less than a week later at his home on the afternoon of November 18, 1892. At the time of his death, his brother, four sisters and other relatives were present. His funeral was held at his home the following week, organized by the Volunteer and Exempt Fireman's Associations, and was buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery at New Springville. Decker was portrayed in the 2006 historical novel The Volunteers: A Historical Novel of New York City's Firemen, 1830-1865 by Donald L. Collins. References Further reading *Brandt, Nat.

The General Secretary of Krajowa Izba Gospodarcza Marek K≈Çoczko, said in his 2007 interview that the divisions are more spread out and forming three separate categories, Poland \\"A\\" is the metropolitan cities, Poland \\"B\\" is the rest of the country, and Poland \\"C\\" is the plains and the landscape parks east of the Vistula (Poland \\"Z\\", according to K≈Çoczko), which require a different treatment. Reportedly, Poland's well-off cities are Warsaw, Gda≈Ñsk, Wroc≈Çaw, and Pozna≈Ñ, and the ones struggling with less investment are in the east: Rzesz√≥w, Lublin, Olsztyn and Bia≈Çystok. However, current unemployment statistics for Poland in general fail to show that distinction and even indicate an opposite trend in recent years, with the northwest reporting rates of unemployment higher than east-central Poland. In 2014, among the highest in the nation were the Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Zachodniopomorskie (compare the historic railroad map and the administrative map, right, with the 2014 unemployment map, from business portal eGospodarka.pl); while among the lowest in the country was the east-central Mazowieckie.

Introduction.  Distinction  The distinction is unofficial and in some ways oversimplified, but it is widely acknowledged and discussed in Poland. A map of the major Polish dialects. Historically, the source of Poland \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" can be traced to the period of the partitions of Poland, and different policies of the partitioners, which resulted in a much larger industrial development of the Prussian partition, compared to the Austrian and Russian partitions (including the so-called eastern Kresy) where the imperial exploitation policies were rampant.Iwona Borkowska, Polska Polsce nier√≥wna, Raport Polska.pl 2008-06-04. Internet Archive. Retrieved December 16, 2014. In this divide it has to be noted that Poland's borders were changing over the centuries. They moved westward after 1945, to reflect the Poland of the Piasts and the Poland of Jagiellonians. For instance, Warsaw was initially a settlement in eastern Poland. When it became a capital city in the 16th century, and historically in the developed as a central part of the Kingdom of Poland (the Crown), later western-central part of the Commonwealth. Now is situated in the central-eastern part of it. The slower growing western provinces are often former German regions which were already densely populated and well-developed in terms of infrastructure and industry before 1945, now populated mostly by Poles from the former Eastern Polish regions. For example, the above-mentioned Olsztyn was part of Prussia since the times of the Teutonic Order. =Politics= Administrative map of Poland with results of the 2007 elections to the Senate of Poland; orange: Civic Platform, navy blue: Law and Justice The difference between Poland's \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" is particularly evident in the voting patterns of the two regions. During the 1990s, Poland \\"A\\" tended to favour the Democratic Left Alliance (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej, or SLD), as a secular, socially liberal de facto successor in post-1989 politics to the former communist party. Poland \\"B\\" on the other hand voted either PSL (economically liberal but socially conservative) or the Solidarity (‚Ä≥right-wing‚Ä≥) camp (socially conservative).

He was an activist and the Chairman of ITB Students Council in 1977. Ramli and 3 of his friends were the authors of the \\"White Book\\". In the book, he wrote about many criticism against the system of authoritarian rule in Indonesian government under the Soeharto regime. The white book also explores the practice of corruption, collusion and nepotism in Indonesian Government, particularly the family of President Suharto. Although the white book was eventually banned in the campus, copies were circulated around Java. The popularity also received media attention at that time. The book was then translated into 8 languages by Ben Anderson, a scholar from Cornell University, USA. One of the first critics to Soeharto in Indonesia at that time, Ramli was jailed for 6 months. Ramli graduated from Boston University with a Ph.D. degree in economics in 1990. After his return from the United States, he founded ECONIT Advisory Group, an independent economic think-tank, with some of his colleagues. Ramli and his team have been very critical on the government policies, particularly those with little emphasis on public and national interests, such as: national car policy, urea- tablet fertilizer, Freeport mining, etc. Political career Ramli's career in government started when he was appointed as the Chairman of Bulog (Indonesia's large rice procurement agency) in Gus Dur's Administration in March 2000. He was the chairman of Bulog for less than a year but he was regarded by some as making notable breakthroughs during the period. He introduced steps to improve Bulog's performance. He made efforts to reform Bulog into a more transparent and accountable institution such as transforming off-budget accounts of Bulog to on-budget ones. During Dr Ramli's period with Bulog there were reports of significant cost savings and efficiencies in the operation of the agency. As result, Bulog had a surplus on its account. Dr Ramli simplified and consolidated Bulog's accounts from 117 to only 9 accounts. On August 12, 2015, Ramli was appointed by President Joko Widodo as the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs, replacing Indroyono Soesilo. However, Ramli's time as Coordinating Minister was marked by a series of public disagreements with other ministers. On July 27, 2016, in a cabinet reshuffle, Jokowi replaced Ramli as the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.Jokowi's new Cabinet: Who's the boss now? Recent activities Nowadays, Ramli has continued to play an active role in public policy discussion in Indonesia. He is an active critic of the government, often providing media comment and arguing that further reform is needed in various areas in Indonesia.Rizal Ramli, 'Indonesia's tainted democracy calls for changes', The Jakarta Post, 29 March 2011 References 1953 births Living people People from Padang Minangkabau people Finance Ministers of Indonesia Indonesian economists Sophia University alumni Boston University College of Arts and Sciences alumni Working Cabinet (Joko Widodo) ","title":"Rizal Ramli"},{"id":"21186302","text":"Skip-link chain is an obsolete roller chain for bicycles in which side plates are alternately short and long, and so rollers are alternately close together and far apart. A skip-link chain running over the rear sprocket on a bicycle. In bicycle chains, skip-link chain has the same one-inch spacing as the earlier block chain. Due to the asymmetry, the rollers fit over long teeth used with earlier block chain, but due to the use of rollers, efficiency is better than block chain. Skip-link chain is typically arranged with the long plates also the wide-spaced outer plates, which mimics the visual effect of block chain. Since sprocket teeth run on rollers, they cannot be usefully wider than the width of the narrow-spaced links, so the tooth can be no wider than with a symmetrical chain. Thus, skip-link chain spreads wear over half the number of teeth and has worse sprocket durability than a symmetrical roller chain. Chain wear is dominated by wear between pins and bushings, and this is the same as a modern roller chain. Skip-link chain is specific to bicycles and is not otherwise widely used. Skip link chain became obsolete sometime in the 1950s because roller chain was becoming more widely used in the manufacturing of bicycles.

They mainly occur in Central America and northern South America (including Trinidad), although some species inhabit forested areas of Brazil, and range as far as northern Argentina. In the Rio Grande Do Sul area of Brazil, one species, H. leucocelaenus, has been found carrying yellow fever virus. Several species have a distinct metallic sheen. Species of this genus are vectors in the transmission of sylvan or \\"jungle\\" yellow fever which is often carried by monkeys in the forest canopies. Haemagogus species have also been found to carry the Mayaro virus and Ilheus virus.The Arthropod-borne Viruses of Vertebrates: An Account of The Rockefeller Foundation Virus program 1951-1970. 1973, pp. 133, 153. Max Theiler and W. G. Downs. Yale University. . As these mosquitoes, in general, have relatively long lives, they can transmit viruses for long periods. They tend to live in the canopy of forests where the female lays eggs in between layers of tree bark or in cut bamboo. The eggs adhere to the surface and when submerged by rain water develop into larvae.

Blood specimens taken from over 4,500 humans in late 1953 and early 1954 and checked to detect the presence of a wide variety of known viruses showed that 15% had antibodies to the yellow fever virus. A form of the disease, termed \\"jungle yellow fever\\", was shown to be carried by Red Howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus insulanus Elliot) that provided a continuous reservoir for the disease, which was then spread by the Haemagogus s. spegazzini mosquito which normally inhabits rainforest regions, both at ground level and in the treetops. After government felling of large stands of native forest, yellow fever was isolated from a patient from Cumaca in the northern range in 1954. The infection soon spread to other humans and into the Aedes aegypti mosquito population, greatly increasing transmission. Warnings were made that an epidemic was imminent and Dr. Wilbur Downs and Dr. A. E. (Ted) Hill, a specialist in tropical medicine, began a program of inoculating health workers and stockpiling vaccine. Trinidad health authorities followed up with large-scale vaccination and intensive anti- aegypti measures including public education, regular inspection for breeding sites, and spraying of domestic residences with DDT. In spite of these measures, and the fact that an estimated 80% of the population of Port of Spain were immune to yellow fever and dengue, several more cases were soon reported. Most probably due to the health measures taken, it did not develop into a widespread epidemic in Trinidad itself. An attempt was made to totally quarantine the island just before Christmas, 1954, but the disease spread to the nearby mainland of Venezuela and, from there, all the way to southern Mexico, probably killing several thousand people in the process.The Arthropod- borne Viruses of Vertebrates: An Account of The Rockefeller Foundation Virus program 1951-1970. 1973, pp. 155-157.

It ran for nine years and was aimed at a mainly teenage market. Overview The magazine was published weekly and ran from 7 May 1983 to February 1992. It was intended as direct competition to Smash Hits, which was at its peak at the time. Although Number One contained fewer pages and less colour (at a similar price), the magazine claimed \\"our strength is our weekliness\\". One of the most popular aspects was that it published the singles and albums charts every week (obviously not possible for the fortnightly Smash Hits). Until 1990 however, these were the unofficial Network Charts (1985 - 1990). Previously the magazine had used the NME Top 75 singles & albums (March 1983 - December 1984). From October 1990, the full official Top 75 Chart was used until the magazine's demise. It was at this time that BBC Magazines took over publishing from IPC Magazines. When Number One came to an end in 1992, it was incorporated into the BBC's Fast Forward. The magazine's demise went unannounced - the final issue carried details of the features and interviews that would appear in the next issue, but remained unpublished.  Features  As well as the Charts, the magazine included interviews with pop stars of the day as well as centre pin-ups. Songwords to current pop songs were also featured. Other features were Single and album reviews, competitions and a letters page. Colomnists were used also throughout the magazine with their own pages. These were sometimes by well known people in the industry such as producer Pete Waterman or DJ Bruno Brookes or by staff writers who went under pseudonyms such as 'Lola Lush' (a glamorous woman with bitchy comments) or 'Snabber' (a depressive dog who answered the letters). At the end of each year, the magazine would run a reader's poll of the top pop acts of the year. These would include best group, best single and most fanciable pop star among others. Number One was the first magazine to champion pop group Take That and featured them many times on the cover in 1991 before they became famous. Ultimately, the magazine didn't survive to see the group achieve their first top 10 hit.  Competition with Smash Hits  Unlike Smash Hits, Number One made no secret of the fact the two were in direct competition and would very often refer to said magazine as \\"Sm*shed Tw*ts\\" and other less flattering terms. The approach it took to feature writing was more personal, in that the writers would show more of their own character and were not afraid to criticise their interviewees, where Smash Hits would remain more neutral. In the end Smash Hits won out due to its higher page count and glossier appearance, while remaining at a similar price to Number One. By early 1990 Number One was selling in excess of 130,000 copies per issue, but this paled in comparison to Smash Hits' 780,000 per issue.

The music was composed by Koti with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by Marthand K. Venkatesh. Released on 16 January 2009, the film was a commercial success and went onto highest-grossing Telugu film of that year. Plot Arundhati is a beautiful heavenly princess and the great-great- granddaughter of the Raja of Gadwal, Mahasamsthan. Arrangements are being made for her wonderful marriage. The sweet Arundhati is the first female to be born since her great-grandmother and is especially revered in the family. She then goes to Gadwal where her grandfather resides, to visit him. Her grandfather, the head of the family, talks to her with respect as if she were older than him. She receives a misleading phone call in her fianc√© Rahul's voice asking her to come to the fort of Gadwal, where she faces a horrible revelation. Learning the story from an aged servant maid named Chandramma, Arundhati comes to know that she is a doppelg√§nger of her great-grandmother Arundhati/Jejamma. Jejamma is an expert in painting, dancing, and martial arts. Her elder sister is married to her cross-cousin Pasupathi. Pasupathi, a womanizer, rapes the women he likes and kills those who object. While Jejamma was still a young girl, he raped and killed her blind dance teacher while a horrified Jejamma watched through the peephole. Jejamma, furious, demands that he be killed, but the King tells her that this would ruin her sister's life. Hearing this, Jejamma's sister commits suicide to save her family reputation. The people of Gadwal furiously thrash Pasupathi and tie him to his horse. Though Gadwal celebrates his death, he is saved by Aghoras (saints who practice the dark arts). Pasupathi masters the Tantric arts and returns to Gadwal many years later to exact his revenge. He unleashes carnage as he uses his powers to torture innocent people, something that the Aghoras do not do. Meanwhile, Jejamma has grown up to be a gorgeous woman and is set to be married. Pasupathi arrives on Jejjama's marriage day and magically starts removing her clothes, but Jejamma lures him away into a room. She performs a special dance imbued with martial arts to lull Pasupathi. She then cuts off his tongue (thus ending the incantations) and pins his hands, allowing a chandelier to fall on his body. She spares him from being killed to prevent him from becoming a 'pretatma' (a demonic poltergeist). Pasupathi is buried alive in a tomb, and powerful 'yantras' (defensive spells) are put on it to prevent him from coming out. Though Pasupathi's corpse is buried, he uses his powers from his tomb around Gadwal to destroy peoples' lives by causing famine and diseases. Jejamma then visits many temples and sages for the solution, but no one is able to solve the problem. She finally meets some Aghoras, who tell her that she can only destroy Pasupathi's vengeful spirit in her next birth. Hence to initiate her reincarnation, she agrees to give up her life. They instruct her to bid goodbye to everyone before the sacrifice. Before leaving, she tells everyone that the first girl who will be born in their family will be a replica of her, having born with her face, and they all ought to respect the child as they respect her. She then returns to the Aghoras, asking for a painful death as the torture that she undergoes in the process of being sacrificed magnifies her revenge on Pasupathi. She then dies a painful death by getting coconuts broken on her head. Later, her body is burnt on the stake and skeletonized for obtaining skull remains, ashes and other accessories which are then fashioned into a dagger, the one weapon that could destroy Pasupathi forever. Unfortunately, a mad person unknowingly breaks the tomb and releases Pasupathi's spirit - 'pretatma'. Anwar, who treats patients through sorcery, asks her to fight Pasupathi. Arundhati comes to know that her great- grandmother had prepared a 'weapon' with her own bones and had kept it with the sages. During their attempts to procure the weapon, their family is threatened, and she loses Chandramma. Later, the spirit seems to have killed Anwar by throwing him off a cliff. Arundhati, believing that Anwar is dead, returns to the fort to surrender herself to Pasupathi to prevent the death of her family members. However, Anwar, who had survived the fall, hands the weapon to the brave Arundhati after many painful trials. The weapon has to be soaked in Arundhati's blood before it can be used to kill the evil spirit. Before Anwar can tell her this, Pasupathi unfortunately kills him. As a last resort to save herself, Arundhati tries to kill herself with the same weapon, but the dagger begins to glow from her blood as an indication that her great- grandmother Jejamma had come. The brave maiden kills the evil Pasupathi, and the building sets fire and blasts. Arundhati is then shown walking out of the place as Jejamma. Cast * Anushka Shetty as Arundhathi and Jejamma (dual role)  Divya Nagesh as Young Arundhati * Sonu Sood as Pasupathi * Arjan Bajwa as Rahul * Sayaji Shinde as Anwar * Manorama as Chandramma * Kaikala Satyanarayana as Bhupathi Raja * Bhanu Chander as Arundhati's father * Subhashini as Pasupathi's mother * Ahuti Prasad * Chalapathi Rao * Bhel Prasad as Nilendra Varma, Bhupathi Raja's brother * Leena Siddu as Dance Teacher * Anita Raichurkar * Meena Kumari Production =Development= Shyam Prasad Reddy revealed that he got the idea of Arundhati while receiving National Awards for the film Anji (2004).. Being inspired from films like Chandramukhi and The Exorcist, he made it a female-oriented story \\"for a bigger appeal so that the entire family could watch it. I added classical dance to it. I wanted to mount the film on a grandeur scale.[sic] I wanted to play the film on 'fear of the evil spirit'. Arundhati is about good fighting evil. Hence I had to make sure that both the characters of Arundhati and Pasupati equally powerful [sic]\\". =Casting= Shyam wanted somebody with a 5'10\\" (5 feet 10 inches) height and \\"should look royal because she the queen, she rides on horses and elephants\\". Gemini Kiran suggested Shyam to choose Anushka for the role. After conducting her photoshoot, Shyam explained the story and Arundhati's characterisation. Sowmya Sharma had dubbed for the character of modern day Arundhati and Shilpa for Jejjama. Shyam wanted Tamil actor Pasupathy to enact the role of antagonist of same name but since the character has \\"a royal side to the character where he has to look princely\\", he had chosen Sonu Sood for the role after seeing his performance in Ashok (2006). Dubbing voice for Sonu Sood was provided by P. Ravishankar. Ravishankar completed the dubbing within 14 days and found it to be \\"most challenging work\\" and his voice \\"has gone sore for 5 times during this process\\". For the characterisation of Fakira who helps Anushka's character in present era, Shyam drew inspiration from the priest character in 1976 American horror film The Omen. Shyam considered Naseeruddin Shah, Nana Patekar and Atul Kulkarni for the role; however, none of their dates were available. Sayaji Shinde was finally chosen for the character. = Creative direction & visual effects = Rahul Nambiar was appointed as Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor by Shyam Prasad Reddy for this feature film. His work in Arundathi was widely appreciated. As a creative director, it was a challenging project. Showcasing a ghost as a main villain, throughout the film was challenging. With help of some dedicated scenes written, visualization and Visual effects Rahul and his team could achieve and what they had planned with Shyam. As the visual effects supervisor, this film and it's sequences were very complex, like Pre-title scene of palace transformation from old to new, Climax scene where both the key cast Anushka Shetty and Sonu Sood did tremendous job, they literately were covered in mud with shot end, even then they performed their best, shares Rahul Nambiar. Also, as a creative director, he revealed that he had directed \\"60% of the final film\\". Rahul also stated \\"We created all the action in computer dolls, animated all of them and added all the film cameras and made it like a film. We saw it as a rough edit and then we shot it. There was lot of meticulous work. The pre-production itself took about seven months\\". Music The music and background music of this film was composed by Koti. The soundtrack was critically acclaimed. Especially the tracks \\"Jejamma\\", \\"Chandamama\\" and \\"Bhu Bhu\\" were huge hits. The album featured eminent singers like K. S. Chithra, Kailash Kher, and N. C. Karunya. Koti, while speaking said that this film helped him to prove himself and in his career of 30 years this was his personal best. The track \\"Jejamma\\" required a majestic and ambient grandeur, so Koti selected Kailash Kher. The track \\"Bhu Bhu\\" took many days for Koti to compose and he felt it should be sung by an amazing singer who could aptly give the ferocious feel and hence went with Chithra. Lyrics were penned by Veturi Sundararama Murthy for \\"Bhu Bhu Bhujangam\\", Anant Sriram for \\"Chandamama\\", and C. Narayana Reddy for \\"Jejamma\\". This album features four songs and three instrumentals.

Legacy Arundhati's success turned Anushka into one of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema and catapulted her into the foray of leading Telugu actresses. Sonu Sood attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several South Indian films as an antagonist. After the release of Arundhati, people began recognising him as Pasupathi. P. Ravishankar who dubbed for him also became popular and was referred to as 'Bommali Ravi Shankar' by the media there after. According to writer Gopimohan, Arundhati made audience to \\"welcome creative content\\" and Magadheera started a trend of experimentation with period, socio-fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like Panchakshari (2010), Nagavalli (2010), Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011), Mangala (2011), Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) and Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara? (2012). Tammareddy Bharadwaja said \\"Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera did well at the box office, the rest of the industry started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. But what they don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe.\\" Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior.

The Saga tells the story of Halfdan Hroriksson, a young Viking trying to avenge his brother's murder. The series weaves the story of the fictional Halfdan into the lives of actual historical figures of the period, including famous Viking leaders Ragnar Lodbrok, Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside, and Hastein, as well as Frankish leaders King Charles the Bald and Count Robert the Strong. Actual historical events form a backdrop for parts of the story, including a Danish attack up the Seine River in the year 845 which was reported in several contemporary Frankish sources, including the Annals of St. Bertin. The series begins in Denmark around the year 845, but over the course of its projected 6 volumes the story's settings traverse much of the Viking world, including western Frankia in books two and three, Denmark and Sweden in book four, and Russia and Ireland in books five and six. The first four books are, Viking Warrior, Dragons from the Sea, The Road to Vengeance, and The Long Hunt. As of May 2018 Roberts has not revealed any kind of timeline for the release of the last two books, citing delays caused by a lack of historical data and health problems. The first three volumes of The Strongbow Saga were originally published between 2006 and 2008 as young adult fiction by HarperCollins.

In 2009, he was sentenced to two years in jail for his role in the Bank Bali scandal. Education Syahril studied at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, graduating with an economics degree from the Faculty of Economics in 1968. In 1972, he earned a scholarship from USAID to study at Williams College and graduated with Master of Arts in Development Economics in 1973. Under the USAID scholarship, he then continued to study at Vanderbilt University, earning a Ph.D in economics in 1979. Career Syahril joined Bank Indonesia in 1969. He later served a three-year term as Senior Financial Economist at the World Bank, Washington DC. In late 1997, Indonesian President Suharto summoned him back to Bank Indonesia, at which time the country was suffering from the Asian financial crisis. In February 1998, at the height of the economic and financial crisis, he was appointed Governor of Bank Indonesia, succeeding Soedradjad Djiwandono. Syahril oversaw the central bank's efforts to deal with the crisis under President Suharto until May 1998 and then under presidents BJ Habibie and Abdurrahman Wahid. He also oversaw the transformation of Bank Indonesia to an independent central bank in May 1999. He completed his term as Governor in May 2003. Legal case In 2000, Syahril had a dispute with President Wahid over banking issues, but as Bank Indonesia had become an independent central bank, the president did not have the legal authority to remove the central bank governor. The Attorney General then accused Syahril of involvement in the Bank Bali fraud scandal. In March 2002, Central Jakarta District Court sentenced him to three years' imprisonment, but he remained free pending an appeal and retained his position as central bank governor. In August 2002, Jakarta High Court overturned the conviction. The Supreme Court in 2004 upheld his acquittal. Then in 2009, in a controversial procedure, the Supreme Court re-examined the case and sentenced Syahril to two years' imprisonment.

Dynamic reaction cell The collision reaction cell known by the trade name dynamic reaction cell was introduced by Perkin-Elmer on their Elan DRC (followed by Elan DRC II and Elan DRC-e) instrument. The dynamic reaction cell is a chamber placed before the traditional quadrupole chamber of an ICP-MS device, for eliminating isobaric interferences. The chamber has a quadrupole and can be filled-up with reaction (or collision) gases (ammonia, methane, oxygen or hydrogen), with one gas type at a time or a mixture of two of them, which reacts with the introduced sample, eliminating some of the interference. The DRC is characterized by the following parameters, that can be modified: RPq (the corresponding q parameter from the Mathieu equation), RPa (the corresponding a parameter from the Mathieu equation), which refer to the voltage applied to the quadrupole rods and the gas flow of the reaction gas. Ammonia gas is the best solution for the majority of interferences, but it is far for being the perfect gas. Sometimes, for specific isotopes, other gas must be used for better results or even mathematical correction, if no gas offers a satisfactory advantage. Collisional reaction interface (CRI) or mini-Collision/Reaction Cell The proprietary collisional reaction interface (CRI)I. Kalinitchenko, Patent Application under the Patents Cooperation Treaty WO 2004/012223 A1 used in the Bruker ICP-MS Aurora M90 destroying interfering ions. These ions are removed by injecting a collisional gas (He), or a reactive gas (H2), or a mixture of the two, directly into the plasma as it flows through the skimmer cone and/or the sampler cone. Supplying the reactive/collisional gas into the tip of the skimmer cone induces extra collisions and reactions that destroy polyatomic ions in the passing plasma. Fundamentally CRI is a mini- Collision/Reaction Cell installed in front of the parabolic Ion Mirror optics. Axial field technology Axial field technology (AFT) is a patented improvement of DRC made by Perkin-Elmer, which consists in two supplementary rods placed in the DRC cell, smaller than normal quadrupole's rods, with the purpose of \\"pushing\\" the ions faster to the exit by generating a supplementary electric potential, minimizing the time needed for the gas to be in the DRC and improving analysis speed. The suplimetary potential of the AFT rods does not contribute significantly to the global energy, but drastically improve ion passage time. Collision cell technology with kinetic energy discrimination Thermo Scientific's XSeries2 instrument utilizes a collision/reaction cell for interference removal, consisting of a non-consumable hexapole and chicane ion deflector, which takes the ion beam off-axis and leads to low instrument backgrounds of <0.5 integrated counts per second (icps) at vacant masses such as 5 and 220. This hexapole is inherently part of the Thermo lens system and is present in the ion path, regardless of the use of the collision cell. The collision/reaction gas mixtures can be 1% NH3 in He, 7% H2 in He and 100% H2, where the NH3 and H2 are reactive gasses and the He is a collisional gas. The 3rd generation cell utilizes kinetic energy discrimination, which employs running the quadrupole bias slightly less negative (more positive) than the hexopole bias. Polyatomic ions generated within the plasma can have larger atomic radii than analyte ions of similar mass, i.e. the interferent NaAr+ (mass 63) is larger than the analyte Cu+ (mass 63). Thus, when using a collisional/reactive gas mixture, these larger species undergo more collisions/reactions in the cell, in which they lose increasingly more energy, and are then excluded from the quadrupole mass filter by the kinetic energy barrier. Octopole reaction system Another implementation of this type of interference removal is an octopole (instead of a quadrupole) collision cell, implemented by Agilent's 7500 series. The octopole reaction system (ORS)) uses only helium or hydrogen and the volume of the cell is smaller than that of a DRC. The small molecules of helium and hydrogen collide with the large, unwanted polyatomic ions formed in the plasma and break them up into other ions that can be separated in the quadrupole mass analyser. However, unlike the DRC the OCR system is based only on collision reactions and not on chemical reactions.

Background Otunnu was born in Mucwini, among the Acholi people of northern Uganda. His father was a key leader in the East African Revival movement. Education He received his early education at Mvara, Mucwini, and Anaka primary schools. He received his secondary education at Gulu High School and King's College Budo. He then attended Makerere University, where he was president of the Students' Guild. Throughout his time as a student, he played an integral role leading the resistance movement against the Idi Amin regime, co-founding and serving as Secretary General of the Uganda Freedom Union, an organization that brought a number of patriotic Ugandans together in the struggle against Amin. Facing increasing threats from the government, Otunnu was forced into exile in 1973, evading arrest and escaping the country into Nairobi, Kenya. There, he received an Overseas Scholarship to attend Oxford University. In 1976, he attended Harvard Law School under a Fulbright Scholarship. Career From 1980 to 1985, Otunnu served as Uganda's representative at the United Nations. In 1980, he was appointed Uganda's permanent representative at the UN by President Milton Obote. During this period, he served in a variety of major roles. In 1981, he was named president of the UN Security Council, where he presided over the election of Secretary General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar and invented the system of straw balloting commonly known as the Otunnu Formula still in use today. From 1982 to 1983, he served as Vice President of the UN General Assembly, as well as Chairman of the Contact Group on Global Negotiations. The following year he worked as the Chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights. From 1985-1986, Otunnu served as Uganda's Minister of Foreign Affairs, and played a critical role in orchestrating the Nairobi Agreement of December 1985. Otunnu was appointed President of the International Peace Institute in 1990, and served in that role until 1998, transforming the profile of the organization, attracting major new funding, and expanding its operations. Otunnu was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as Under-Secretary General and Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict on 19 August 1997, taking office on 1 September 1997. Otunnu ran in 2010 to succeed Miria Obote, wife of former President Milton Obote, as president of the UPC. On 14 May, he defeated her son, Jimmy Akena, at a UPC delegates conference. UPC nominated him in November 2010 as its presidential candidate. On election day in 2011, however, he refused to vote, even for himself.

Eight songs in total have been attributed to the Vidame, though all but one with conflicting attributions to others. He is not to be confused with Raoul de Ferri√®res (fl. 1200‚Äì10), also a trouv√®re. Guillaume took part in the Third (1188-92) and Fourth Crusades (1201-4), and died in Romania as part of the latter. A reference in the Vidame's song Combien que j'aie demour√© to a forced sojourn in a \\"hated land\\" probably refers to Guillaume's stay in southwestern France in 1188, before the departure of the Crusade, while the leaders (Richard the Lionheart and Philip Augustus) were squabbling. Further evidence linking the trouv√®re with Guillaume includes a quotation of two stanzas of the Vidame's most popular song, Quant la saison du dous tens s'asseure, in the chivalric romance Guillaume de Dole, which was written probably in the 1220s. Quant la saison was, by implication, written some years prior. The rather garbled and uncertain melodies which accompany the Vidame's poems further support an early (pre-1200) date for the trouv√®re. One piece of evidence relating to the identity of the Vidame has not yet been adequately explained. The coat of arms with which the trouv√®re is depicted in his miniature portrait in the Chansonnier du Roi belonged mid-century to the Meslay family, who became vidames of Chartres only in 1224. Only one of the eight songs variously attributed to the Vidame is not also ascribed to another. Only three, however, are regularly doubted to be his, and only one of theseQuant foillissent li boscageis almost certainly not his. One of the remaining two, Desconsilliez plus que nus hom qui soit, which survives without music, is attributed in one manuscript to Li viscuens de Chartres (the viscount of Chartres), probably an error for vidame. Five of the Vidame's songs are basically isometric and decasyllabic. The remaining three are heterometric but mainly octosyllabic. With the sole exception of Li plus desconfort√©s du mont, all his melodies are preserved in bar form and cover more than an octave in range each. Though most survive with modal structures, these vary from manuscript to manuscript and are unreliable.

He was a member of the American Cinema Editors (ACE). Career Gibbs' editing career began in the mid-1950s as an assistant to Ralph Kemplen and to Alan Osbiston, and through them he became involved with the brief \\"New Wave\\" of British filmmaking at its beginnings. In particular Osbiston (and Gibbs) edited The Entertainer (1960), which was directed by Tony Richardson; Richardson was one of the most prominent of the British New Wave directors. Gibbs was then principal editor for several of the subsequent \\"New Wave\\" films, including Richardson's A Taste of Honey (1961), The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), and Tom Jones (1963), and also The Knack ...and How to Get It (1965), which was directed by Richard Lester. In his 1995 book, Film and Video Editing, Roger Crittenden notes the influence of this first phase of Gibbs' editing career, \\"The generation of American editors of which Dede Allen is a part has given considerable credit for the inspiration of their work to Antony Gibbs, the English editor of films directed by, amongst others, Tony Richardson, Nicholas Roeg, and Richard Lester. There is a daring and energetic quality to Tony Gibbs' work, especially in some sequences of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, Tom Jones, The Knack, and Performance, which must have given a shot of adrenaline to aspiring editors on both sides of the Atlantic at the time. Dede ascribes her work on Bonnie and Clyde directly to the influence of Tony Gibbs.\\" Allen's recollection that Gibbs cut Look Back in Anger (1958) appears to be erroneous; Richard Best edited that film. Bonnie and Clyde (1967) \\"marked a turning point in the editing of feature films that sent reverberations through the entire American cinema.\\" Gibbs was the \\"supervising editor\\" for Richardson's 1965 film, The Loved One, that was produced in Hollywood. Gibbs relocated from England to California in about 1970. Based on From 1971-1989 he had an extended collaboration with Norman Jewison that commenced with the well-received Fiddler on the Roof (1971) and ultimately extended over five films. Gibbs retired from filmmaking in 2001. Gibbs' editing of Tom Jones (1962) was nominated for an American Cinema Editors Eddie award. Tom Jones won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Richardson received the Academy Award for Best Director for it. Subsequent to his \\"New Wave\\" films, Gibbs was nominated four times for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing, for the films Performance (directed by Donald Cammell & Nicolas Roeg-1970), Fiddler on the Roof (Jewison-1971), Rollerball (Jewison-1975), and A Bridge Too Far (Attenborough-1975). Gibbs has never been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Editing. Gibbs was nominated again for ACE Eddie awards for Fiddler on the Roof and, much later in his career, he won Eddie awards for the television films George Wallace (Part II) (1997) and for James Dean (2001).

By the end of June, Uzuki was based at Truk, and assigned to escort convoys carrying airfield construction crews from Truk to Bougainville and Guadalcanal, and patrols around Rabaul. During the invasion of Buka (21‚Äì22 July), Uzuki was strafed by Allied aircraft, with loss of 16 crewmen. On 11 August, Uzuki sortied from Rabaul to rescue the survivors of the cruiser . At the end of August, while on a \\"Tokyo Express\\" transport run to Guadalcanal, Uzuki suffered damage from a near miss in an attack by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and returned via Rabaul, Truk and Saipan back to Sasebo for repairs on 14 September. Uzuki was assigned to the IJN 8th Fleet on 1 December 1942, and escorted the aircraft carrier from Yokosuka to Truk, and a troop convoy from Truk to Rabaul at the end of the year. However, at Rabaul on 25 December, Uzuki suffered heavy damage in a collision with the torpedoed transport Nankai Maru, and was taken in tow by the destroyers and back to Rabaul for emergency repairs. While at Rabaul, the ship was further damaged in an air raid on 5 January 1943. The destroyer towed Uzuki to Truk for further repairs, and then Uzuki returned to Sasebo under her own power by 3 July. Once repairs were completed in mid-October, Uzuki returned to Truk and escorted the cruisers and , both loaded with troops, back to Rabaul.

Uzuki continued to make \\"Tokyo Express\\" transport runs throughout the Soloman Islands to the end of November. On 24‚Äì25 November, Uzuki engaged US Navy destroyers at the Battle of Cape St. George, during the Japanese evacuation of Buka, but without damage. In December, Uzuki was assigned to escort tankers from Rabaul to Truk and Palau and back. In January 1944, Uzuki escorted the cruiser back to Japan. After refit at Sasebo Naval Arsenal, Uzuki escorted troop convoys from Yokosuka to Palau, Yap, Saipan and Truk through the end of June. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea (19‚Äì20 June), Uzuki was part of the Second Supply Force.

The battle took place 20 miles south of Norfolk, Virginia. Fordyce and many of his men died. The colonists suffered few casualties, and they allowed the British troops to retreat out of pity without continuing to fire. A similar force was raised in North Carolina, however, even after a small victory over some colonists this force was not seen as a great benefit to the British Military. General Henry Clinton began to realize that the loyalists would not be able to continue the fight against the rebels on their own, nor would they be able to defend themselves once the British troops were gone. General Henry Clinton decided to take his force North to attack and capture Charleston as well as the Fort on Sullivan's Island. The American Commander on Sullivan's Island was General William Moultrie who built a fort out of rudimentary supplies to defend Charleston.

Fumizuki returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs on 4 May. The ship departed Yokosuka on August 20 escorting convoys via Sasebo to Saipan, Truk and Rabaul. From September through January 1944, the destroyer made numerous ‚ÄúTokyo Express‚Äù runs to evacuate troops from Kolombangara and Vella Lavella and to land troops at Buka, Bougainville and various areas in New Guinea. On 2 November, Fumizuki was strafed during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft while at Rabaul, with six crewmen killed and four injured. The vessel was again damaged in an air raid near Kavieng on the night of 4 January 1944. While at Truk on 17 February 1944, Fumizuki received a near miss bomb from a Grumman TBF Avengers during Operation Hailstone, when carrier-based US Navy aircraft attacked the Imperial Japanese Navy fleet anchorage.Lindemann The near miss to port amidships disabled her only usable turbine and caused gradual flooding, which the crew could not control, and Fumizuki sank on 18 February at , with 29 crewmen killed.

In March, she was assigned to convoy escort duties in and around Malaysia and the Dutch East Indies until she was transferred to Rabaul in early 1943 to ferry troops around New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Design and description The Mutsuki class was an improved version of the s and was the first with triple torpedo tubes. The ships had an overall length of Watts & Gordon, pp. 265‚Äì66 and were between perpendiculars. They had a beam of , and a mean draft of . The Mutsuki-class ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley, p. 191 They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four Kampon water- tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ships at . The ships carried of fuel oil which gave them a range of at . Their crew consisted of 150 officers and crewmen.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 143 The main armament of the Mutsuki-class ships consisted of four Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the superstructure, one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of 61-centimeter torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other was between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Four reload torpedoes were provided for the tubes. They carried 18 depth charges and could also carry 16 mines. They could also fitted with minesweeping gear. Nagatsuki was one of six Mutsuki-class ships reconstructed in 1935‚Äì36, with their hulls strengthened, raked caps fitted to the funnels and shields to the torpedo mounts. In 1941‚Äì42, most of those ships were converted into fast transports with No. 2 and No. 3 guns removed. In addition, ten license-built Type 96 light AA guns and at least two Type 93 anti-aircraft machineguns were installed. The minesweeping gear was replaced by four depth charge throwers and the ships now carried a total of 36 depth charges. These changes reduced their speed to and increased their displacement to at normal load. Three more 25 mm guns were added in 1942‚Äì43.Watts & Gordon, p. 267 Construction and career Nagatsuki, built at the Ishikawajima Shipyards in Tokyo, was laid down on 16 April 1925, launched on 6 October 1926Chesneau, p. 192 and commissioned on 30 April 1927. Originally commissioned simply as Destroyer No. 30, the ship was assigned the name Nagatsuki on 30 April 1927. In the late 1930s, the ship participated in combat during the Second Sino-Japanese War, covering the landings of Japanese troops in central and southern China, and the Invasion of French Indochina. =Pacific War= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Nagatsuki was assigned to Destroyer Division 22 under Destroyer Squadron 5 of the 3rd Fleet. She sortied from the Mako Guard District in the Pescadores as part of the Japanese invasion force for Operation M (the invasion of the Philippines), during which time the destroyer helped screen landings of Japanese forces at Lingayen Gulf and at Aparri. While at Lingayen Gulf, Nagatsuki suffered light damage due to strafing attacks by USAAF aircraft, which left one crewman dead and five injured.Nevitt In early 1942, Nagatsuki was assigned to escorting troop convoys from French Indochina for Operation J (the invasion of Java, Netherlands East Indies), From 10 March 1942 Nagatsuki and Destroyer Division 5 were reassigned to the Southwest Area Fleet and escorted troop convoy from Singapore to Penang, and Rangoon. The destroyer returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for repairs on 19 September, and rejoined the fleet on 9 November, continuing escort patrol duties. At the end of January 1943, Nagatsuki escorted the seaplane tender from Sasebo via Truk and Rabaul to Shortlands, and remained throughout February to cover Operation KE (troop evacuations from Guadalcanal) and to escort convoys to Palau, Wewak and Rabaul. On 25 February, Nagatsuki was reassigned to the IJN 8th Fleet. The ship participated in several Tokyo Express troop transport missions throughout the Solomon Islands through the end of June, especially to Kolombangara and Tuluvu. On 4‚Äì5 July, while on a run to Kolombangara, Nagatsuki engaged the US destroyer , which she helped sink with her torpedoes.

First, arsonists burned down Hayes House on Academy Street and then the powder house on Butler Hill. Powderhouse Ski Area was formed by William Hardy of Eliot, Maine. An avid skier, he had previously run similar operations on Barnards hill in Eliot then leased the land for where Powderhouse is today.

After three decades of service the class were rebuilt incorporating Alstom's newer technology, and thus extending their life - these rebuilt machines were given the sub-class names 333.3 and 333.4 Background In the early 1970s, RENFE was looking for a new, diesel-engined locomotive capable of both hauling express trains and high-tonnage heavy freight trains nationwide at a steady speed of .:es:Serie 333 de Renfe At the time, RENFE's dieselization program, with the 316 and 318 series CC locomotives, later followed by the more numerous 319 and 321, had displaced steam powered traction and were responsible for much of the work requiring higher-powered locomotives. The Class 319, produced in collaboration between Macosa and General Motors, had shown good performance, which influenced the decision to choose a locomotive of the General Motors type GT 26, (). In this series of locomotives, instead of taking the typical single cabin General Motors design it was decided to use a two cabined design; the Scandinavian manufacturer Nohab had also been producing GM engined locomotives (having acquired a license to produce GM engined locomotives of its own designsHistory of the NOHAB Works), and a model was chosen based on the JT-26 with the Nohab bi-cabin box (See DSB class MZ) which was used by the Danske Statsbaner (DSB). RENFE chose the variant model MZ1 which had a power output of almost , they were also able to supply electrical train heating - a first in Spain. Technical left The locomotives were equipped with General Motors engines, generators, traction motors and electrical equipment. The diesel engines are 45-degree offset 16 cylinder V engined, two-stroke designs (EMD 645), with a compression ratio of 14.5:1, and an engine displacement of . The available power for traction is - produced at 600 V AC, and is rectified to DC through two groups of 30 silicon diodes, and eventually supplies six nose suspended traction motors which drive the wheels via a pinion gear at a ratio of 59:18. The maximum speed was rated at , though some of the class can travel at with appropriate modifications. The bogies are of the 'flexicoil' type. ASFA, a Spanish train safety system was also fitted (See Train protection system) Service history and operators The 93 units of the original series were ordered from Macosa for RENFE and delivered between 1974 and 1976. One of the first Class 333 hauled services was the legendary express train from Barcelona to A Coru√±a / Vigo via Roda de Bar√†, la Plana- Picamoixons and the station of Miranda de Ebro. Other notable services were the fast Madrid to Canfranc, and the locomotives use in dragging the Madrid to Vigo Pendular service until the line was electrified. Ourense-junction to Medina del Campo route was served by the Class 333s, which also were found in applications such as transporting coal from Samper de Calanda to thermal power stations in Andorra, and working in pairs to bring ore from Ojos Negros to the steel works at Sagunto. On 1 January 2005 a law came into effectSerie 333 y el fin del monopolio de Renfe Class 333's and the end of the RENFE monopoly (Spanish) that began the de- monopolisation of the Spanish railway systemLey 39/2003, de 17 de noviembre, del Sector Ferroviario. 17 November 2003 Law 39/2003 concerning the railway sector.(Spanish)  one effect of this new law was that private rail companies could now operate services in Spain alongside existing RENFE services. Two companies \\"Continental Rail\\" (part of ACS) and \\"Acciona Rail\\" bought Class 333.3 locomotives to operate freight services. Variants and rebuilds Part of this class were destined to have a second life, some were upgraded in the 1990s, and yet more were totally rebuilt in the early part of the 2000s to meet new demands and at the same some losing the locomotive's distinctly 'Viking' appearance. With the rebuilding complete none of the original type remain in service. =Subclass 333.0= These are the remainder of the original 93 locomotives, consisting of the locomotives that have remained unrebuilt, and un-upgraded.

The control electronics have been upgraded from the system of relays and contactors with a block rectifier with power electronics which are electronically controlled by microprocessors and software. The traction motors have been updated from the D-77 to D-78 type, additionally the fuel capacity has been increased from 4500 to 7200 l.(6000l?) The new designs have a top speed of 120 km/h, and are intended for freight traffic. The rebuild gives improvement of 8‚Äì10% in tractive effort over the original machines which is explained by the use of the power electronics system.

They appeared in Catalonia (Spain) in the 1850s, and have been widely used in Europe and America. They represented a revolution in flooring in their day because they were much cheaper, more durable and easier to make than the previous handmade glazed ceramic tiles and were therefore more universally available for houses, and they allowed for profuse decorative patterns, their age of splendour being the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th centuries, before they were gradually superseded by newer technology as of the 1960s, such as terrazzo, salt-glazed stoneware, etc. that didn't allow for such decorative embellishment but were cheaper. They are mostly known throughout the world as encaustic cement tile. Like their predecessors, encaustic clay tiles, they derive their name from the term \\"encaustic\\" which is an art term used for metal enameling that uses a type of lost wax procedure. They have this name because of the intricate patterns and designs that mimic the encaustic enameling process. Cement tiles are not fired; there is no glaze layer on the surface of the tile. They derive their durability from the combination of finely dehydrated ground Portland cement layer and a more coarse layer of sand and cement. The pigment layer is hydraulically pressed into the surface and becomes a part of the tile. History Cement tiles appeared in the 1850s in Catalonia, Spain. They were exhibited in the Paris (France) International Exposition of 1867 by the Catalan company Garret & Rivet. In the United States, several sources say the first tiles were made near the country's first Portland cement plant. Around the turn of the 20th century, the tiles were very popular and were considered a high-end floor covering. It was used in thousands of landmark public buildings and palaces. Their popularity began to wane in the 1920s, but spread again in the 40s primarily in California and Florida. Manufacture and quality Cement tile mold, France, 1920 Cement tiles are made by hand, one at a time, using mineral pigments, cement, a mold, and an hydraulic press. The metal mold is handmade following specific design drawings. The pigment composition is a mixture of high quality white Portland cement, marble powder, fine sand, and natural mineral colour pigments. Cement tiles being handmade are expected to have slight imperfections, which give them character and depth. There are numerous cement tile manufacturers worldwide. The primary difference between manufacturers is the hydraulic method used. Small companies employ a hand-operated hydraulic press; the quality of the tiles varies due to inconsistent pressure. Larger manufacturers use electric-powered hydraulic presses that produce a consistently higher quality product. The higher pressure (1,500 PSI) permits a thicker pigment layer to be embedded into the cement layer. The pigment layer is usually 3‚Äì4 mm thick. Another difference is the quality of the pigments used. High quality producers use mineral-based pigments only. Non-mineral based pigments fade with age. Quality of cement tile from manufacturer to manufacturer will be different, based on 3 major factors: 1\\\\. The Sharpness of pattern and color: It will depend on the skill and the component of color layer, the patterns in cement tile will be clear and sharp between details. Color variation in surface is less. 2\\\\. The thickness of color layer: Cement tile basically have 2 parts: color layer - based with white cement, and body layer - based with grey cement. The shrinkage and extension of both layers are different when they have force or weather/temperature effect on tile. It will create the hair cracking on the surface. Therefore, it would be great if you could choose the tile having thicker color layer- at least 2.5 - 3mm 3\\\\. The surface hardness of color layer: It comes from quality of white cement, water absorption and the strength of surface tile. If the tile has harder surface, it will be more shiny by time. In contrast, the soft tile's surface will get dull with more traffic.

Causes Under Charles II the state finances were in such a grievous condition that the Crown found itself no longer able to honour its debts. It was even unable to pay ¬£400,000 owed to Sir Robert Vyner, who had made the replacement for the lost St Edward's Crown.Hugh Chisholm, ed., \\"Viner, Sir Robert\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica vol. 28 (11th ed., Cambridge University Press, 1911), p. 97 The Stop occurred on Tuesday 2 January 1672. Payments were suspended upon: The period of the stop was to be one year, ending on 31 December 1672. In the interim the King intended that interest would be paid to all those who were owed payment of outstanding bonds that had become due \\"at the rate of six pounds per cent\\".Burnet, Gilbert, History of His Own Time Everyman Abridgement 1979 p.111 People, such as the \\"Goldsmith bankers\\" who had entrusted their gold to the government for safe keeping were not allowed their gold when they asked for it - effectively their gold had been stolen by the government. Further background information on the causes and effects of the Stop of the Exchequer were revealed in a letter from Richard Langhorne to Lord Hatton: *A total 82 ships were to be prepared for sail \\"in the cause of national defense\\", i.e. to attack the Dutch Republic in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. *The bankers of Lombard Street were asked for an 'advance' (loan) to the king to finance the fleet, they refused to make the loan. *Due to the pressing need for money the king and his council resolved to find the money for the fleet by cutting other parts of the treasury's budget - money that had been allocated for the repayment of bonds and securities were to be spent on the fleet and only interest paid with no repayment of principal that year. *There was great disruption and damage to the financial markets: \\"I believe it certain that the trade of bankers is totally destroyed by this accident\\".Burnet p.111 Legacy The short-term consequences of the Stop were disastrous. Gilbert Burnet wrote that \\"the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action\\".Burnet, Gilbert History of his Own Time Everyman Abridgement 1979 p.111 This seems to have been only a slight exaggeration: the goldsmith bankers were heavily hit, and some of the most prominent, including Edward Backwell and Robert Viner, went bankrupt. Danby, the Lord Treasurer, promised them compensation, but this was never forthcoming, leading to a lawsuit, The Goldsmith Bankers case, of almost unheard-of length.Kenyon, J.P. Stuart England Allen Lane 1978 p.223 Eventually the Court of Exchequer Chamber gave judgment in favour of the bankers, but in 1696 Lord Somers, the Lord Chancellor, reversed the judgment on technical grounds which left a general feeling that an injustice had been done.Rigg, James MacMullen \\"John Somers\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol. 53 p.224 The King himself came to regret it as a \\"false step\\". The sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694) One important legacy of the Great Stop of Exchequer was the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. The primary purpose of the Bank was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. A loan of ¬£1.2m was made to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The Royal Charter was granted on 27 July through the passage of the Tonnage Act 1694.H. Roseveare, /The Financial Revolution 1660‚Äì1760/ (1991, Longman), pp. 34 The Bank of England was founded 22 years after the Exchequer Stop - the actual consequence of the Exchequer Stop, at the time, was that banks such as Hoare's bank emerged - where the gold was physically kept on the premises rather than being entrusted to the government. Hoare's bank still exists to this day. Public finances were in so dire a condition at the time that the terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a service charge of ¬£4000 per annum for the management of the loan. The founding of the Bank of England put an end to defaults such as the Great Stop of the Exchequer. From now on, the British Government would never fail to repay its creditors.Ferguson, p.76 Kenyon argues that the Stop was a failure simply because it had never been tried in England before. The French and Spanish Governments periodically repudiated their debts without undue difficulty; but from the time of Elizabeth I the English Crown had earned a reputation for paying its debts, and in spite of Charles II's notorious extravagance and carelessness about money, the City of London was quite unprepared for the Stop.Kenyon p.52 References *Ferguson, Niall, The Ascent of Money - A Financial History of the World, Penguin Books, London (2008) Notes Economy of Stuart England 1672 in England 1672 in economics History of government debt ","title":"Stop of the Exchequer"},{"id":"21187730","text":"Bak Gyusu (Î∞ïÍ∑úÏàò, Êú¥Áè™Â£Ω, 1807-1877) was a scholar-bureaucrat, teacher, politician, and a diplomat of the Joseon Dynasty.

On the 9th of July 1866, the General Sherman entered the Keupsa Gate without permission. Gyusu gave the General Sherman's crew a warning to depart from Joseon. The ship's crew ignored his warning and captured the messenger adjutant-general Yi Hyon-Ik, a subordinate of Bak Gyusu. Gyusu was present during the rescue of Yi and the destruction of the General Sherman on the 24th of July 1866.

He was the eldest son of Frederick II, Duke of Legnica-Brzeg, by his second wife Sophie, daughter of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. Life After the death of his father in 1547, Frederick III succeeded him in Legnica. His younger brother George II (George II the Pious) took possession of Brzeg. Since the beginning of his reign he sided against the rule of Emperor Charles V, joined to the Coalition of Protestant rebel princes and made an alliance with the long-time enemy of the Habsburgs, King Henry II of France. This behavior motivated the invasion of Charles V to the Duchy of Legnica and the formal deposition of Frederick III in 1551. His eldest son Henry XI was made new Duke, but, still a minor, was cared under the regency of his uncle George II of Brzeg. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 changed Frederick III's situation; the new Emperor, Ferdinand I, restored him in Legnica after his formal promise of obedience and loyalty to him. Unfortunately, Frederick III's conduct forced the Emperor to depose him for a second time (27 October 1559), this time for good. Henry XI was placed again as a Duke of Legnica and Frederick III was placed under house arrest until his death in Legnica eleven years later.

He is known only through his own writings, but one lyric poem ascribed to him, Li departis de douce contree, mentions his involvement in a failed Crusade of 1239. Robert wrote two manuals of instruction on courtly behaviour: one for noblemen and one for noblewomen. The Enseignement des princes describes how men are to act in public and their moral and religious duties. The Chastoiement des dames (or Enseignements des dames), on the other hand, describes a woman's domestic role, concentrating on etiquette, manners, and modesty. Robert's values have been described as \\"conservative\\", but his tone is at times \\"bantering\\" and he displays \\"a measure of flair and wit\\" (Krueger). Floris et Lyriop√© (or Liriop√©) is a lengthy narrative poem drawn from Ovid. Robert relates the deeds of Narcissus's parents, how they met. His father Floris seduces Lyriop√© by dressing in woman's clothes. In one manuscript both enseignements and the Floris are incorporated into the unfinished Arthurian romance Beaudous. In a scene reminiscent of Chr√©tien de Troyes's Perceval, Beaudous is instructed by his mother before joining the court of King Arthur. Five lyric poems attributed to Robert survive, two of them with more than one melody. All the melodies are recorded in bar form. His lyric work, however, appears to have found a limited audience. Its manuscript tradition is slight and it had no influence on subsequent poets.

His reputation lies mostly on his work as a violin virtuoso. Biography Michael Christian Festing was born in London to parents John and Elizabeth Festing and christened at Saint Anne's Church, Soho, on 17 December 1705. Some evidence suggests that his family had ties to Gros Festin, near Stralsund in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. Michael's brother, John Festing, was a flautist and oboist who amassed a sizeable fortune through teaching music. His brother is most likely the musician depicted in William Hogarth's painting The Enraged Musician (1741, now in the Tate Britain, London).Melanie Groundsell: \\"Michael Christian Festing\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 19 January 2009), (subscription access) Festing first studied violin with Richard Jones and then later became a pupil of Francesco Geminiani. He made his professional debut on 6 March 1723 performing a concert at Hickford's Room, London. Not too long after that, Festing met a young Thomas Arne at the gallery of the Italian Opera to which Festing had access although Arne, still a boy, officially did not. Music historian Charles Burney wrote that Arne had crept into the gallery dressed as a liveryman to gain access to the fine collection of musical scores contained there. Upon befriending Festing, Arne became his pupil, studying violin for the first time and music composition. Festing, who was only four and a half years older, also broadened the young Arne's knowledge by taking him to numerous concerts, operas, and other performances. The teenagers were both present on 12 November 1725 to hear Thomas Roseingrave win the competition for the post of organist of St George's, Hanover Square. It is largely due to Festing's influence that Thomas's father allowed him to pursue a career in music instead of becoming a lawyer.Peter Holman, Todd Gilman: \\"Thomas Augustine Arne\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 19 January 2009), (subscription access) In the mid-1720s Festing began to compose music, mostly for the violin at the beginning but later works for orchestra, art songs, and a small amount of both sacred music and theatre music followed. The earliest mention of music composed by him is from a 1726 concert advertisement. That same year he helped found the Academy of Ancient Music, along with such composers as William Croft and Giovanni Bononcini, and participated in that group until he left over the Bononcini‚ÄìLotti affair in 1731. Festing remained active in concerts throughout London, notably replacing James Moore as a member of the King's Musick on 4 November 1726. His position at court led to the performance of three sets of his minuets for the birthdays of King George II and Queen Caroline, each \\"perform'd at the Ball at Court\\" in 1734 and 1735. Festing also performed several solo concerts in London, notably at the York Buildings, Villiers Street in 1729. In 1730 Festing published his first composition, Twelve Solos for a Violin and Thorough Bass op. 1, which was dedicated to the Earl of Plymouth. In 1993 a manuscript of three of his opus 4 violin solos was discovered, which musicologists believe belonged to one of Festing's pupils and dates from the early 1730s. Festing became the director of the orchestra at the Italian opera house in 1737. The following year, along with Edward Purcell (eldest son of Henry Purcell), Thomas Arne, William Boyce, Johann Christoph Pepusch, and George Frideric Handel, he founded the Fund for the Support of Decay'd Musicians and their Families, later known as the Royal Society of Musicians; of which for many years he acted as honorary secretary. In 1742 Festing was appointed musical director of the Ranelagh Gardens when they were first opened. While there he composed music for the entertainments in the pleasure garden and lead the band there until his death in London in 1752. He had two sons and two daughters, and his son Michael (born 1725) married Maurice Greene's daughter, Katherine. Compositions Festing was a moderately prolific composer producing a number of sonatas, minuets, concertos, chamber music, works for solo instrument, cantatas, vocal songs, catches, and odes. His music is often characterised by sudden and unusual modulations. His frequent use of key changes up or down a whole step and other dramatic modulations have caused several musicologists to compare his music to the Spanish harmonies of Domenico Scarlatti. As a composer, Festing began his career writing in the Baroque style and then later transitioned into the galant style that came to be associated with the early Classical period of music. His earliest works were entirely instrumental pieces and employed typical baroque elements such as ground basses, canons at the octave and fugal treatments. Although more ambitious and adventurous than his mentor, Francesco Geminiani, close parallels are often made between Festing's early works and those of Geminiani. Two such comparisons are the similarity between the virtuoso improvisatory passages and the use of elaborate and detailed ornamentation of the solo parts in their works. Also of note is both composers's use of bowing, phrasing and ornamental marks in the bass lines of their writing, particularly in trio sonatas. When Festing was appointed musical director of the Ranelagh Gardens in 1742, his work shifted more towards vocal works, although he did continue to produce several concertos and sonatas during this time. He had previously only written a handful of vocal compositions for performance at the Apollo Academy during the 1730s. At Ranelagh he became particularly known for his odes and cantatas which were unique in that they used extended aria forms, inventive orchestration, and dramatic gestures that were more English in character than in the Italian tradition. Of notable interest is his Ode on St Cecilia's Day which reflects the influence of Handel's oratorio Alexander's Feast, and his Ode on the Return of ‚Ä¶ the Duke of Cumberland which used a full Baroque orchestra including kettledrums, trumpets, oboes and horns. Festing also performed a number of vocal songs and cantatas at Ranelagh, the latter of which resemble those of John Stanley. The Complete Works, some 120, of Michael Christian Festing have been edited by Richard Divall and are freely available on application.

Andrews.The Wildflowers are about a group of four teen girls in court ordered group therapy and why they were ordered to attend. The first four novels serve as prequels to the therapy sessions while the last deals with what happened after. In the stories, they attend four group sessions in the home of therapist Dr. Marlowe, and they find through the four sessions that, while they come from very different lives, their shared hatred of their parents and their insecurities show they have more in common than they thought. The four girls eventually call themselves the 'OWPs' (Orphans With Parents).  The 'OWPs'  =Misty= The first OWP, Misty, is a pretty teen girl who lives with her upper-middle-class beauty-obsessed mother in Beverly Hills. Her mother and father are divorced and constantly fight over alimony payments and other petty articles. Misty is quickly torn apart between them and the stress gets to her, especially when it comes to her overbearing mother. She begins dating Charles Allen, a rich, handsome boy from her school who tells her that his parents are also going through a divorce. After losing her virginity to him, Misty finds out that in fact Charles Allen was using her, and his parents were still together. Saddened, she breaks up with him. Misty then meets Lloyd, a rebel whose parents really are divorced, and they fall in love. One day, Lloyd doesn't show up in school, and later he drops by Misty's house and asks her to run away with him on his motorcycle. She agrees despite the fact they have only a few dollars between them. On the way, Lloyd stops and asks Misty to stay outside while he goes into a gas station. Later, when a cop pulls them over, Misty learns Lloyd had robbed the store. When Misty told the police the stress over her parents' divorce was a cause that led her to run off, she was ordered to therapy with Dr. Marlowe. =Star= Star, a black girl from the poorer side of town, lived with her drunk mother and little brother Rodney (their father had walked out on them). Star's mother could barely hold down a job, and more often came home drunk with a new 'boyfriend,' while Star was left alone to care for her little brother. Soon, Star's mother and one of her boyfriends decide to go find work elsewhere and 'come back' for Star and Rodney, and they are left with Star's grandmother, who is more of a mother figure to Star than her real mother ever was. Star's mother never returns. Star begins to date and eventually loses her virginity to a boy named Steve Gilmore who lives with his abusive father. One night after Star leaves, he is beaten into a coma by his father and eventually dies in the hospital. This is what sends Star into therapy. =Jade= Jade, ridiculed for being the richest of the four girls, lived with her divorced parents in the midst of a fierce custody battle for her. Feeling alone in the world, her parents more obsessed with their battles than with their daughter, Jade finds solace with a mysterious man in a chat room called 'Loneboy.' Eventually, Jade can't take her parents' divorce anymore, and she runs away to see this man, who reveals his name to be 'Craig.' When she arrives on Craig's doorstep, she finds not a young man from the photo she was sent, but an older man who at first pretends to be Craig's father, but later locks Jade in a room and reveals that he is Craig, just older. He knocks Jade unconscious and ties Jade to the bed by her wrists and ankles and strips her naked (though she claims he never raped her but he did touch her). It takes Jade a whole day to escape, and she makes it home, where her parents are revealed to still not care. Jade's stress eventually takes over, and she swallows a whole bottle of sleeping pills, sending her to the hospital, and eventually into therapy. =Cat= Cathy (called Cat by Misty, and later, everyone else), a middle class girl, lived under her mother Geraldine's strict moral code. She went through puberty very early, and grew breasts by the fifth grade, because of which Geraldine forced her to wear loose clothes and send her to a single-sex parochial school. As a child Cat is frequently subject to sexual abuse at the hands of her father, Howard, but does not realize until later what had happened, instead believing that her father is really the only one who loved her. After being invited to a party by her friend Kelly, a group of boys trick Cat into getting drunk, and then fondle her in front of everyone else. In high school, Cat tells her mother she wants to go to a school dance, but the dress she buys for her is terrible. Howard takes matters into his own hands and promises to 'teach' Cat about high school boys. This ends up being a thinly- veiled plan for him to have sex with her, which he does over the course of three lessons. Confused and upset by this, Cat eventually has a panic attack and is put in a psychiatric ward. After learning the reason for her daughter's panic attack, Geraldine divorces Howard, and Cat is put in therapy. After telling her story, Cat learns that Geraldine is not her mother, but in fact her much older half-sister, and the woman she grew up believing to be her grandmother was really her mother, who became pregnant with her as the result of an affair with her younger brother-in-law. Into the Garden The final book, from Cat's point of view, brings the four young OWPs together after the therapy sessions are complete. Cat's half-sister turns up dead one morning, and Cat is faced with the constant pressures of living alone and the threat of her perverted adoptive father coming back to try and take her again. Jade, Misty, and Star help her bury Geraldine, because they fear Cat being shoved into foster care until she turns 18. Meanwhile, Misty deals with her father's remarriage to a much younger woman, and Star thinks she has found the man of her dreams, an army man named Larry. All the while, Cat begins to learn more about her past through letters from her real mother stowed away in her attic along with relics. She was the product of her older mother's love affair and adopted by Geraldine through pressure and married to Howard the same way. Cat also finds a hidden safe full of cash and legal documents in Geraldine's old room as well as sexy lingerie and pornography. Living with the secret of Geraldine's death and illegal burial eventually catches up with Cat, and Howard, her adoptive father, finds her and takes her away onto his houseboat. Misty, Star, and Jade are not left so much as a note. On the houseboat, Howard is about to rape Cat again, who is rendered defenseless, as Howard has been spying on her all along and knows her secret about Geraldine. Howard reveals that he switched Geraldine's pain pills with cyanide tablets and was waiting until they killed her. Just as he is about to advance on Cat, Dr Marlowe, the police, and the three girls appear in time to save Cat. Dr. Marlowe took Cat in herself until she came of age. Jade and Misty went to college, and Star married Larry right out of high school. The four of them still keep in touch. Novel series Novels by V. C.

It stars Pedro Infante, Irma Dorantes and Guillermina Grin. It also features a number of cameo roles from Mexican actors famous at the time, including Germ√°n \\"Tin Tan\\" Vald√©s, Fannie Kauffman and Pedro Vargas amongst others. It also takes a look inside the workings of cinema at the time, not always showing the nicer side. Plot The movie starts with Braulio Pel√°ez (Pedro Infante), a schoolteacher, having just fallen off his horse, representing the situation he and his family are in. The next scenes introduce the viewer to his family and their poor financial and social situation. As Braulio stumbles around looking for his glasses, he causes a famous film star, Alfonso de Madrazo (Rafael Alcaide) to crash his car. Braulio offers him to eat at his house as an apology. Braulio's sister and mother, big film fans, immediately recognise Alfonso and attempt to get him to bring the girl, Luisa Pel√°ez (Irma Dorantes) to Mexico City to become a film star. Alfonso agrees and tells them to come to the capital. Braulio and his sister duly come to the capital and go to a dinner reception which Alfonso is also attending. Luisa goes to talk to Alfonso but he pretends not to recognise them and calls them liars. As Luisa tells Braulio this, there is a competition held to see who can sing the best, with the winner winning a kiss from Elisa Miranda (Guillermina Grin), a famous actress who just finished a song. Braulio gets up to give out to Alfonso and is inadvertently picked to sing. It turns out he has a great singing voice and Elisa takes a shine to him immediately. After the song, he goes to Alfonso and gets in a fight, knocking down several men. Seeing this, Elisa states that he is the perfect man for her next movie. Braulio is invited to dine with her and the director and they agree to meet the following day. At the meeting, they convince an initially reluctant Braulio to take the part, but only after he insists that they pretend the part is actually going to his sister, who the executives don't want to hire because of her awful singing voice. The next day, Braulio turns up to do his job and is introduced the film business for the first time. As he wanders through the studio looking for where they're filming, he meets several famous Mexican actors, including Tin Tan, Leticia Palma and Antonio Bad√∫, who he punches thinking he was assaulting a woman, when it was actually just a film. Then, as he goes to record the songs for the movie, he accidentally insults, then does a duet with Pedro Vargas. As filming continues, though, it is clear that Braulio does not have what it takes to be a big star, as a result, the producer asks Braulio how much he wants to be released from his contract. Braulio says he wants nothing and, despite the pleas of Elisa, decides to go back to his town and his job as a schoolteacher. While on the train home, he and his sister discover that a lottery ticket he bought earlier was a winner and he can now afford to buy equipment for his father who is a dentist, so that he can get more patients. Braulio and his sister are welcomed back as heroes to the town. When he gets back to his school, he sees a picture drawn on the blackboard, when he asks who it was, a hand raises. He moves closer and discovers the hand in that of Elisa, the two embrace as the movie ends.

Lewis used the figure of Merlin Ambrosius in his 1946 novel That Hideous Strength, the third book in The Space Trilogy. In it, Merlin has supposedly lain asleep for centuries to be awakened for the battle against the materialistic agents of the devil, able to consort with the angelic powers because he came from a time when sorcery was not yet a corrupt art.

The last book of the trilogy, The Last Enchantment, and a related book, The Wicked Day, focus more on Arthur and Mordred, though the former is still told from Merlin's viewpoint. Stewart portrays Aurelius Ambrosius (brother to Uther Pendragon) as his father, and thus makes him Arthur's cousin.

The latter book's depiction of Merlin may be the most historically accurate of all since he lives after Arthur's death. The hero Beowulf even appears as an invader. *In Merlin (1989), a novel by Michel Rio, Merlin presented as a strategist and a wise man rather than a wizard, an adviser to the king and, later, Morgana's teacher. A hundred years old Merlin reflects upon the fate of Avalon and remembers people who surrounded him throughout his long life. There are also two connected novels, Morgane (1999) and Arthur (2002) told from the respective perspectives. *Merlin is one of the main characters in the Magic Tree House series of children's books by Mary Pope Osborne (the first novel published in 1992). He appears in the later volumes of the series, known as The Merlin Missions. *Merlin (1988) and Pendragon (1994), the second and fourth books of Stephen Lawhead's fantasy Pendragon Cycle series respectively, are narrated by Merlin (Myrddin) and seen through his viewpoint. Lawhead makes him a half-Atlantean king of Dyfed, who goes insane but recovers after years of living in the forest; he then assumes the roles of prophet, adviser, and bard. *Merlin is a central figure in Jack Whyte's nine-volume series The Camulod Chronicles (first published between 1992 and 2005). The series presents a full retelling of the Arthurian legend with entirely natural explanations of the magical abilities attributed to Merlin. *In A Logical Magician (1994), also published as A Modern Magician, and its sequel A Calculated Magic (1996) by Robert Weinberg the author portrays Merlin as a being brought into existence through belief. Thus, here Merlin possesses all the powers general belief grants him. *Fred Saberhagen's novel Merlin's Bones (1995) is told partly from the perspective of a young Merlin. *In Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Chronicles (first published between 1995 and 1997), Merlin is a Druid who rules over Avalon: all the land seen from the top of his hall in Ynys Wydryn. *T.A. Barron portrays Merlin as a young man in his The Lost Years of Merlin series (the first novel published in 1996), and as an adult in its sequel series, The Great Tree of Avalon. Merlin also figures prominently in Barron's Merlin Effect, which may be in the same fictional continuity. *The Young Merlin Trilogy by Jane Yolen (first published between 1996 and 1997), featuring the novels Passager, Hobby, and Merlin, re- imagines the story of Merlin in his boyhood. Abandoned by his parents and left to live in the woods at the age of eight, he discovers his powers at twelve. *J.K. Rowling portrays Merlin as a famous or almost God-like wizard in her Harry Potter series (first published between 1997 and 2007) and refers to him as \\"The Prince of Enchanters.\\"  The magical population uses the expression \\"Merlin's Beard\\" as a substitute for \\"My God.\\"  \\"The Order of Merlin,\\" mentioned throughout the books, is given to witches and wizards for great accomplishments and is given in three classes: First, Second, and Third; it is similar to an OBE. According to the Harry Potter website Pottermore, the Order of Merlin began as an organization formed by Merlin to protect Muggles or non- magical beings.  Merlin is featured on a Famous Witches and Wizards Collectors card; such cards are included with chocolate frogs. Albus Dumbledore much resembles Merlin.  As in many other stories, Merlin is the enemy of Morgan le Fay.  The Harry Potter website Pottermore states that Merlin was a Slytherin, despite the fact that the real-world mythology places Merlin's existence several centuries before the founding of Hogwarts. *Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files series (the first novel published in 2000) includes Merlin as both a title (leader of the White Council) as well as a man responsible for the creation of the supernatural prison Demonreach. *Merlin is the main character in Robert Holdstock's The Merlin Codex trilogy of mythic fiction novels (first published between 2001 and 2006), which traces Merlin's adventures in Europe over a span of two millennia; this trilogy places him alongside Jason and the Argonauts and Urtha Pendragon. Merlin is also a major character in Holdstock's short novel Merlin's Wood (1994). *In Diana Wynne Jones' book The Merlin Conspiracy (2003), Merlin is not a person, but rather a title.

The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific typhoon season, Tingting originated from a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. The storm gradually intensified as it traveled northwest, becoming a typhoon on June 28 and reaching its peak the following day while passing through the Mariana Islands. After maintaining typhoon intensity for three days, a combination of dry air and cooler sea surface temperatures caused the storm to weaken as it traveled northward. On July 1, the storm passed by the Bonin Islands, off the coast of Japan, before moving out to sea. By July 4, Tinting had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants were last reported by the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, near the international date line on July 13\\\\. While passing through the Mariana Islands, Typhoon Tingting produced torrential rains which triggered flooding and numerous landslides. In Guam, 554.99 mm (21.85 in) of rain fell in 24 hours, breaking the daily and monthly rainfall records for June. Winds gusted up to 212 km/h (132 mph), causing significant structural damage, amounting to $6 million in losses. One fatality occurred as a result of flooding and nine others resulted from rough seas. In the Mariana Islands, 71 homes were destroyed and hundreds were damaged; losses totaled $11.2 million. In Japan, two people were killed by rough seas.All damage figures are in 2004 USD Meteorological history On June 24, 2004, an area of low pressure associated with developing convection formed about 1,110 km (690 mi) to the east-southeast of Guam. Early the next day, as the system began to intensify, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the low pressure as a tropical depression. With low wind shear and favorable diffluence, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the storm at 0000 UTC, classifying it as Tropical Depression 11W twelve hours later. The depression traveled towards the northwest along the edge of a mid- latitude ridge. Outer bands began developing around the system, although the ridge to its north restricted outflow. About 24 hours after the JMA designated the depression, the agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tingting, which was contributed by Hong Kong and is a fairly common pet name for young girls. At 0600 UTC on June 26, the JTWC also classified Tingting as a tropical storm. As Tingting tracked northwestward, it continued to develop outflow in all directions. The storm slowly intensified as it traveled towards the Mariana Islands, strengthening into a severe tropical storm early on June 27. Later that day, a ragged eye began to form. The ridge influencing the track of Tingting moved eastward, causing the storm to begin a gradual turn towards the north At 0000 UTC on June 28, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a minimal typhoon, the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the JMA followed about six hours later. Several hours later, Tingting passed through the central Mariana Islands, tracking near the small island of Sarigan, while continuing to intensify. At 0900 UTC, the typhoon reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) according to both agencies and a minimum pressure of 955 hPa (mbar). With low wind shear, further strengthening was anticipated as it neared the Bonin Islands. However, the typhoon began to weaken due to increasing dry air and decreasing sea surface temperatures. On June 30, Tingting passed within 95 km (60 mi) east of Iwo Jima. Later that day, the storm's eye dissipated as convection around the center of circulation weakened. Typhoons Mindulle and Tingting on June 30 On July 1, the JTWC downgraded Tingting to a tropical storm. At 1200 UTC the following day, the JMA downgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as winds decreased below 120 km/h (75 mph 10-minute winds). Convection associated with the storm began to diminish as Tingting began to undergo an extratropical transition. Although the storm maintained its intensity as a severe tropical storm, it was moving into increasingly unfavorable conditions and weakening was anticipated. As Tingting tracked towards the northeast into the mid-latitude westerlies, it completed its extratropical transition on July 4. After becoming an extratropical cyclone, Tingting accelerated towards the north before abruptly stalling near the Kamchatka Peninsula. On July 6, the extratropical remnants of Tingting were absorbed by a developing area of low pressure located to the south of the former typhoon. However, the JMA continued to monitor Tingting as a separate system as it executed a counter-clockwise loop though July 10 before heading towards the international date line. The storm was last reported on July 13 to the west Aleutian Islands. =Differences among warning centers= The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds for its tropical cyclone tracking information, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. JMA's peak intensity for Tingting was 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160 km/h (105 mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Tingting was also 150 km/h (90 mph) 1-minute sustained, or 130 km/h (80 mph) 10-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory also assessed Tingting to have winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160 km/h (105 mph) 1-minute sustained. However, Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris, France proposed that Tingting was stronger than officially reported. He estimated that the storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds between 160 km/h (105 mph) and 185 km/h (115 mph) on June 28. Preparations and impact Throughout its track, Tingting was responsible for 12 fatalities, 10 in the Mariana Islands and two in Japan; it also left $23.7 million in damage behind, $17.2 million in the Mariana Islands and $6.5 million in Japan. =Mariana Islands= TRMM satellite image of Tingting on June 29 An estimated 300 people in Guam evacuated to emergency shelters in advance of Typhoon Tingting. Several schools throughout Guam were being used as shelters. A tropical storm warning and a flash flood warning, which were issued several hours before the typhoon warning, were kept in place for Guam until June 29\\\\. A small craft advisory was also issued for rest of the Mariana Islands. A typhoon warning was declared for most of the islands on June 27. The United States Air Force Base in the Mariana Islands was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Four, the lowest level of readiness, as Tingting approached. As Typhoon Tingting approached the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas produced by the storm in Saipan. On June 28, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82 km/h (51 mph) with gusts to 106 km/h (66 mph); a pressure of 994.6 hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer to the center of Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70 km/h (44 mph) with gusts of 93 km/h (58 mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. Winds of 56 km/h (35 mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84 km/h (52 mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100 km/h (62 mph) with gusts to 124 km/h (77 mph); a pressure of 984.9 hPa (mbar) was also recorded. The highest winds during Typhoon Tingting throughout the Mariana Islands were measured on Pagan Island where 106 km/h (66 mph) sustained winds were recorded along with a gust of 212 km/h (132 mph). Although Tingting passed about 400 km (250 mi) to the northeast of Guam, torrential rains from a monsoonal feeder band produced record-breaking rainfall. In the span of 24 hours, 554.99 mm (21.85 in) of rain fell on Guam, shattering both the record for highest single day rainfall and the monthly rainfall for June at 80.26 mm (3.16 in) and 371.09 mm (14.61 in) respectively. Most of the northern areas of the island received more than 510 mm (20 in) of rain but the southern areas of Guam reported much lower totals. At Anderson Air Force Base, a total of 287.78 mm (11.33 in) of rain was recorded over a 30-hour span. Rota recorded much less rainfall than Guam, having 145.28 mm (5.72 in) during 24 hours and a storm total of 221.99 mm (8.75 in). No rainfall was recorded on both Tinian and Pagan Island due to the lack of observations. On Saipan, a total of 197.61 mm (7.78 in) was measured. Rainfall accumulations from Tingting between June 25 and 28 The record-breaking rainfall in Guam produced severe flooding and numerous landslides throughout the island. A total of 57 homes were destroyed and another 624 were damaged. Crop damages on the island amounted to $500,000 with most of the farmers reporting total crop losses. One person died after being swept away along a flooded road. Total property damages totaled to $6 million. Most of the damage on Rota resulted from flooding and high seas. The port on the island suffered $1 million in damages and crop losses amounted to $500,000. The same day that Tingting made its closest approach to Guam, a 19-year-old was swept off a reef and drowned in rough seas produced by the typhoon. On Tinian and Saipan, unlike Guam and Rota, most of the damage was a result of the winds. A total of 4 homes were destroyed and 24 others sustained major damage on Tinian while another 4 were destroyed, 81 sustained major damage, and another 101 were affected on Saipan. Schools on the two islands sustained a combined $92,737 in damages. At Saipan's port, an oil tanker sank, spilling thousands of gallons of oil into the water. Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 power poles were damaged or destroyed, leaving 25 percent of the islands' residents without power and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6 million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. The main public facility, which was used as a storm shelter on Alamagan, sustained heavy damage. Damages from the three islands amounted to $500,000. The following day, five people went out kayaking however, the rough seas overturned the kayaks and all five drowned. Numerous water rescues on jet skis had to be made as residents became stranded in their cars after driving into flooded roads. Damages throughout the islands amounted to $11.2 million. =Japan= Between June 30 and July 1, Tingting brushed the Bonin Islands with heavy rainfall and high winds. The storm dropped 105 mm (4.1 in) of precipitation on Chichi-jima, of which 77 mm (3 in) fell in 24 hours. Chichi-jima experienced the strongest winds associated with the cyclone in the Bonin Islands; sustained winds reached 65 km/h (40 mph) and gusts peaked at 146 km/h (91 mph). At 1500 UTC, a pressure of was recorded on the island. The high winds produced by the storm caused power outages throughout the islands, with Chichi-jima losing power for nearly two hours. No known property damage resulted from the passage of Tingting. Throughout eastern Japan, large swells produced by Tingting caused moderate coastal damage and killed two people. In Urakawa District, Hokkaid≈ç, the local fishing industry sustained considerable damage, amounting to 20.5 million JPY (US$240,000). Moisture from the storm also enhanced rainfall in the Shizuoka Prefecture, resulting in a record daily rainfall of in Shizuoka City on June 29\\\\. The rains led to significant flooding and several landslides; 921 homes were flooded and an estimated 160,000 residences were without power at the height of the storm. Damage was estimated to be 540 million JPY (US$6.3 million). Aftermath On July 9, the Government of the Mariana Islands requested that President George W. Bush declare a major disaster area for the commonwealth. Governor Juan N. Babauta reported that the islands needed at least $2.5 million to repair damages from the typhoon. The cost to repair infrastructure and clean up debris on Rota totaled $762,000. A helicopter carrying relief supplies was sent to the Pagan and Agrihan, where people had no food. The American Red Cross also provided $17,000 in assistance. The Government of Guam requested $6 million in aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to repair the damages from Tingting. On July 29, George Bush approved the request for a disaster declaration and federal aid began to be sent to the Mariana Islands and Guam. Almost a month later, the islands of Agrigan, Alamagan, and Pagan were granted public assistance. In mid-August, Typhoon Chaba caused significant damage in the Mariana Islands. A bill was passed following the storm to allow up to 500 people to be hired as temporary workers on Saipan and Tinian. In mid- September, a request was made by the commonwealth for $10 million in natural disaster mitigation following the effects of successive typhoons in the region. The funds were to be used for cleanup efforts, aid residents struggling in the wake of the storms and help reduce unemployment. =Retirement= The typhoon's name originated from Hong Kong; Tingting is a girls' given name () from the area. It was part of a series of typhoon names that are reduplicated female, like Yanyan, Shanshan and Lingling. During the 38th session (2005) of the ESCA-WMO Typhoon Committee, Hong Kong requested that Tingting be removed from the lists of typhoon names. It would later replace it with Lionrock (a reference to Lion Rock).

Shepherd derives from Old English sceaphierde (sceap 'sheep' + hierde 'herder').  Origins  Shepherding is among the oldest occupations, beginning some 5,000 years ago in Asia Minor. Sheep were kept for their milk, meat and especially their wool. Over the next thousand years, sheep and shepherding spread throughout Eurasia. Henri Fleisch tentatively suggested the Shepherd Neolithic industry of Lebanon may date to the Epipaleolithic and that it may have been used by one of the first cultures of nomadic shepherds in the Beqaa Valley.Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Pr√©histoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63, 1966. Some sheep were integrated in the family farm along with other animals such as chickens and pigs. To maintain a large flock, the sheep must be able to move from pasture to pasture. This required the development of an occupation separate from that of the farmer. The duty of shepherds was to keep their flock intact, protect it from predators and guide it to market areas in time for shearing. In ancient times, shepherds also commonly milked their sheep, and made cheese from this milk; few shepherds still do this today. In many societies, shepherds were an important part of the economy. Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others. Shepherds also lived apart from society, being largely nomadic. It was mainly a job of solitary males without children, and new shepherds thus needed to be recruited externally. Shepherds were most often the younger sons of farming peasants who did not inherit any land. In other societies, each family would have a family member to shepherd its flock, often a child, youth or an elder who couldn't help much with harder work; these shepherds were fully integrated in society. Shepherds at work, 2017, Beskids, Carpathian Mountains Shepherds would normally work in groups either looking after one large flock, or each bringing their own and merging their responsibilities. They would live in small cabins, often shared with their sheep, and would buy food from local communities. Less often shepherds lived in covered wagons that traveled with their flocks. Shepherding developed only in certain areas. In the lowlands and river valleys, it was far more efficient to grow grain and cereals than to allow sheep to graze, thus the raising of sheep was confined to rugged and mountainous areas. In pre-modern times shepherding was thus centered on regions such as the Middle East, Greece, the Pyrenees, the Carpathian Mountains, Scotland and Northern England. The shepherd's crook is a strong multi-purpose stick or staff, often fashioned with a hooked end.  Modern times  Shepherd with his horse and dog on Gravelly Range, Madison County, Montana, August 1942 In modern times, shepherding has changed dramatically. The abolition of common lands in Australia in the eighteenth and nineteenth century moved shepherding from independent nomads to employees of massive estates. Some families in Africa and Asia have their wealth in sheep, so a young son is sent out to guard them while the rest of the family tend to not much tasks In the US, many sheep herds are flocked over public BLM lands. Wages are higher than was the case in the past. Keeping a shepherd in constant attendance can be costly. Also, the eradication of sheep predators in parts of the world have lessened the need for shepherds. In places like Britain, hardy breeds of sheep are frequently left alone without a shepherd for long periods of time. More productive breeds of sheep can be left in fields and moved periodically to fresh pasture when necessary. Hardier breeds of sheep can be left on hillsides. The sheep farmer will attend to the sheep when necessary at times like lambing or shearing. By country Transhumance ways of the Vlach shepherds in the past =Cyprus= First Shepherd's Fair was announced to take place in the Cyprus Village of Pachna, on August 31, 2014, in the printed editions of Cyprus Weekly and in the Greek language daily, Phileleftheros. =Australia and New Zealand= Shepherd's watch box, New South Wales European exploration led to the spread of sheep around the world, and shepherding became especially important in Australia and New Zealand where there was great pastoral expansion. In Australia squatters spread beyond the Nineteen Counties of New South Wales to elsewhere, taking over vast holdings called properties and now stations. Once driven overland to these properties, sheep were pastured in large unfenced runs. There, they required constant supervision.Coupe, Sheena (gen. ed.), Frontier Country, Vol. I, Weldon Russell, Willoughby, 1989, Shepherds were employed to keep the sheep from straying too far, to keep the mobs as healthy as possible and to prevent attacks from dingoes and introduced predators such as feral dogs and foxes. Lambing time further increased the shepherd's responsibilities. Shepherding was an isolated, lonely job that was firstly given to assigned convict servants. The accommodation was usually poor and the food was lacking in nutrition, leading to dysentery and scurvy. When free labour was more readily available others took up this occupation. Some shepherds were additionally brought to Australia on the ships that carried sheep and were contracted to caring for them on their arrival in the colony. Sheep owners complained about the inefficiency of shepherds and the shepherds' fears of getting lost in the bush.Pemberton, P. A., Pure Merinos and Others, ANU Archives of Business & Labour, Canberra, 1986, Typically sheep were watched by shepherds during the day, and by a hut-keeper during the night. Shepherds took the sheep out to graze before sunrise and returned them to brush-timber yards at sunset. The hut-keeper usually slept in a movable shepherd's watch box placed near the yard in order to deter attacks on the sheep. Dogs were also often chained close by to warn of any impending danger to the sheep or shepherd by dingoes or natives. In 1839 the usual wage for a shepherd was about AU¬£50 per year, plus weekly rations of meat, flour, sugar and tea. The wage during the depression of the 1840s dropped to ¬£20 a year. During the 1850s many shepherds left to try their luck on the goldfields causing acute labour shortages in the pastoral industry. This labour shortage leads to the widespread practice of fencing properties, which in turn reduced the demand for shepherds.Chisholm, Alec H., The Australian Encyclopaedia. 8. Sydney: Halstead Press. 1963. p. 103 Over 95% of New South Wales sheep were grazing in paddocks by the mid-1880s. An 1890s census of fencing in New South Wales recorded that 2.6 million kilometres of fencing had been erected there with a contemporary cost of A$3 billion. Boundary riders and stockmen replaced shepherds working on foot, who have not been employed in Australia and New Zealand since the start of the 20th century.Outback magazine, \\"Outback Story\\", Issue 62, Jan/Dec 2009 Religion Dumuzid, later known as Tammuz, was an important rural deity in ancient Mesopotamian religion, who was revered as the patron god of shepherds. In his role as Dumuzid sipad (\\"Dumuzid the Shepherd\\"), he was believed to be the provider of milk, which was a rare, seasonal commodity in ancient Sumer due to the fact that it could not easily be stored without spoiling. Under this same title, Dumuzid was thought to have been the fifth antediluvian king of the Sumerian city-state of Bad-tibira. In the Sumerian poem Inanna Prefers the Farmer, Dumuzid competes with the farmer Enkidu for the affection of the goddess Inanna and ultimately wins her favor. Ancient Near Eastern peoples associated Dumuzid with the springtime, when the land was fertile and abundant, but, during the summer months, when the land was dry and barren, it was thought that Dumuzid had \\"died\\". Metaphorically, the term \\"shepherd\\" is used for God, especially in the Judeo-Christian tradition (e.g. Psalm 23, Ezekiel 34), and in Christianity especially for Jesus, who called himself the Good Shepherd.Gospel of John 10:11 The Ancient Israelites were a pastoral people and there were many shepherds among them. It may also be worth noting that many biblical figures were shepherds, among them the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, the twelve tribes, the prophet Moses, King David, and the Old Testament prophet Amos, who was a shepherd in the rugged area around Tekoa.Book of Amos 1:1 In the New Testament, angels announced the birth of Jesus to shepherds. The same metaphor is also applied to priests, with Roman Catholic, Church of Sweden and other Lutheran, and Anglican bishops having the shepherd's crook among their insignia (see also Lycidas). In both cases, the implication is that the faithful are the \\"flock\\" who have to be tended. This is in part inspired by Jesus's injunctions to Peter, \\"Feed my sheep\\", which is the source of the pastoral image in Lycidas. The term \\"Pastor\\", originally the Latin word for \\"shepherd\\", is now used solely to denote the clergy of most Christian denominations. is one of the thrusts of Biblical scripture. This illustration encompasses many ideas, including God's care for his people. The tendency of humans to put themselves into danger's way and their inability to guide and take care of themselves apart from the direct power and leading of God is also reinforced with the metaphor of sheep in need of a shepherd. According to Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, every messenger of God had the occupation of being a shepherd at one point in their lives, as he himself was as a young man. Narrated by Jabir bin Abdullah: We were with Allah‚Äôs Apostle picking the fruits of the Arak trees, and Allah‚Äôs Apostle (peace and blessings of Allah be to him) said, \\"Pick the black fruit, for it is the best.\\" The companions asked, \\"Were you a shepherd?\\" He replied, \\"There was no prophet who was not a shepherd.\\" (Sahih Bukhari, Chapter ‚ÄòProphets‚Äô, Volume 4, Book 55, Hadith 618) This includes Jesus, Moses, Abraham, and all other prophets according to Islam. Sikhism also has many mentions of shepherd tales. There are many relevant quotations, such as \\"We are the cattle, God almighty is our shepherd.\\" This concept has also been used frequently by critics of organized religion to present an unflattering portrayal.

These works are, indeed, called pastoral, after the term for herding. The first surviving instances are the Idylls of Theocritus, and the Eclogues of Virgil, both of which inspired many imitators such as Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender. The shepherds of the pastoral are often heavily conventional and bear little relation to the actual work of shepherds. Shepherds and shepherdesses have been frequently immortalized in art and sculpture. Among the best known is the neoclassical Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen's Shepherd Boy with Dog. In the poem \\"The passionate shepherd to his love\\", by Christopher Marlowe, a shepherd is depicted as a partaker of rural paradise, and capable of giving things worth more than that a town resident could give. In the Latin American literary classic Empire of Dreams (Yale, 1994) by Giannina Braschi, shepherds invade the city of New York in a pastoral revolution. The shepherd, in such works, appears as a virtuous soul because of his living close to nature, uncorrupted by the temptations of the city. So Edmund Spenser writes in his Colin Clouts Come Home Againe of a shepherd who went to the city, saw its wickedness, and returned home wiser, and in The Faerie Queene makes the shepherds the only people to whom the Blatant Beast is unknown. Many tales involving foundlings portray them being rescued by shepherds: Oedipus, Romulus and Remus, the title characters of Longus's Daphnis and Chloe, and The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare. These characters are often of much higher social status than the characters who save and raise them, the shepherds themselves being secondary characters. Similarly, the heroes and heroines of fairy tales written by the pr√©cieuses often appeared as shepherds and shepherdesses in pastoral settings, but these figures were royal or noble, and their simple setting does not cloud their innate nobility.Lewis Seifert, \\"The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the Contes de F√©es in Late Seventeenth Century France\\", Jack Zipes, ed., The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, pp. 920‚Äì1, In Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\\" (1845), the porcelain shepherdess carries a gilt crook and wears shoes of gilt as well. Her lover is a porcelain chimney sweep with a princely face \\"as fair and rosy as a girl's\\", completely unsmudged with soot. The Shepherd by Frederick Forsyth is the story of a flight from Germany to England undertaken by a young Vampire pilot one Christmas Eve. Biographies of David Ben-Gurion published in the early years of Israel emphasized his having been a shepherd immediately after his arrival in the country in the 1900s. Later, however, historians concluded that he had been involved only very briefly in this profession and was not good at it.

The land around it is controlled by three town governments - Smithtown, Islip and Brookhaven. The separation originated because three different Native American communities claimed lands on different shores, and these claims continued when the tribes gave separate deeds to the land under their control. The name Ronkonkoma comes from an Algonquian expression meaning \\"boundary fishing-lake\\", also earlier written as Raconkumake and Raconkamuck.Bright, William (2007). Native American placenames of the United States. Bright University of Oklahoma Press. p. 411. Beginnings North beach, 1901 Smithtown founder Richard Smith's original holdings included the headwaters of the Nissequogue River east to a \\"freshwater pond called Raconkamuck,\\" which translates as \\"the boundary fishing place\\" in the Algonquian language. What is now known as Lake Ronkonkoma served as a boundary between lands occupied by four Native American communities: Nissequogues, Setaukets, Secatogues and Unkechaugs. The Smithtown side of the lake was settled by the 1740s, but it was not until the late 1890s that the area gained widespread public attention. That's when boarding houses and hotels were erected to accommodate a growing number of tourists drawn by claims that the lake's waters had special healing powers. By the 1920s, beach pavilions had sprung up. The Long Island Rail Road, which was completed to nearby Lakeland in 1842 (the depot was moved to Ronkonkoma in 1883), helped transform what had been a sleepy farming hamlet. The lake was created by a retreating glacier. Portions of its irregular basin are unusually deep for Long Island, but most of the lake is less than deep. As a rule of thumb, it is unproductive to fish deeper than in Lake Ronkonkoma because there is seldom enough dissolved oxygen to sustain fish beyond this depth. The primary gamefish are largemouth bass and smallmouth bass. Lake Ronkonkoma holds large bass but locating them is a challenge due to the scarcity of natural structure to attract these fish. Chain pickerel are extremely rare. In the last two decades, white perch and yellow perch populations have increased to the point of upsetting the ecological balance of the lake. = Species of fish in Lake Ronkonkoma = * Largemouth BassLake Ronkonkoma (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation) * Smallmouth bass * Bluegill * Pumpkinseed * Black crappie * Yellow perch * White perch * Tiger muskellunge * Carp * Brown bullhead * Walleye * Chain pickerel There have been unsubstantiated rumors of piranha being caught in the lake over the past two decades. The idea that schools of piranha are ravaging the depths of Lake Ronkonkoma is unfounded and highly unlikely, as there undoubtedly would have been more attacks on bathers and more evidence of devoured fish. Actual specimens \\"caught\\" in the lake (or at least presented by people in a glass jar in the mid-1990s) have been either proven to have not come from the lake, or have been pacu, a different species that looks very similar but is harmless and has a limited presence in the lake. Bites that have been reported on feet and the lower body in shallow water are likely to have been caused by turtles, which also have a moderately strong presence in the lake and may have a tendency to bite when threatened or irritated. Summer resort Lake Ronkonkoma was a popular Long Island summer resort in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There were a few boarding houses in town. One of the hotels on the lake was the Lake Front Hotel situated on twenty-four acres of land on the lake's shore. Most of the original settlers and local residents chose to live away from the lakefront. The land one half mile or so beyond the lake was flatter and better suited for farming. Little by little, the lakefront developed into a fashionable haven for the wealthier people who had summer estates there.\\"History of Ronkonkomas details 3 population waves,\\" by Erin Geismar (Newsday; December 10, 2011) In 1911, the Long Island Motor Parkway was completed from Queens to Lake Ronkonkoma. Traveling the winding Motor Parkway to reach the lake in those days was an adventure in itself. Lake Ronkonkoma became an exclusive summer enclave for the wealthy and famous from New York City. All summer long there was boating and swimming at the lake. While the area's population peaked during the summers, fall activities such as hunting were also popular, although hunting activity began to decline in the 1930s. During the winters, skating parties were often arranged. A favorite game on the ice was Crack the Whip. The perimeter of the lake itself began to change from residential to commercial usage. As the lake front become less exclusive, many longtime residents began to leave the area. In the 1950s, the original owners began to sell their beaches to others. George Raynor, whose family had lived at the lake since the 1840s, owned a parcel of land which later became Raynor Beach. Many of the beach front pavilions, which were left unattended, burned down. On October 4, 1962, Brookhaven Town purchased land for the first town-owned beach on the lake. The unattended sections of beaches began to deteriorate. Rubbish, tin cans and bottles lined the shores in many places. Since the shoreline lay in between three townships, no single entity was willing to take responsibility. A Tri-Town Committee for the Preservation of Lake Ronkonkoma has been formed. The committee has agreed that the three towns would treat the pollution problems as a single problem, affecting all of the Long Island residents.

His depiction varies between film adaptations, however, the original character was loosely based on the character Gnut, from \\"Farewell to the Master\\", a 1940 Astounding Science Fiction short story written by Harry Bates, used as the basis for Andrew Phillips's screenplay. In that story, Gnut is a moving green statue that is apparently attendant upon Klaatu, but in the terminus of the story is identified as the eponymous \\"master\\" over Klaatu. Farewell to the Master depiction Gnut is described with a much more human appearance, in general, as well as emotional expressions. He is described in the fourth paragraph of the short story as an 8 foot tall giant man made of greenish metal, including musculature: > For Gnut had almost exactly the shape of a mana giant, but a manwith > greenish metal for man's covering flesh, and greenish metal for man's > bulging muscles. Comparisons are made to robots, but only as a means of differentiating from the crudity of those built by humans while Gnut appears human in several respects. Additionally, the muscles are described as fully functional: > [Gnut's] neck and shoulders made Cliff a seat hard as steel, but with the > difference that their underlying muscles with each movement flexed, just as > would those of a human being. Gnut's movement is supposed to be smooth, walking with an \\"almost jerkless rhythm which only he among robots possessed\\", and his hands have \\"tough metal fingers\\" while 1951's Gort had none. Gnut also wears a loincloth, though it isn't explained why. Particular attention is given to describing Gnut's eyes, which are \\"internally illuminated red eyes [that] were so set that every observer felt they were fixed on himself alone\\", and the face in general is described with \\"a look of sullen, brooding thought.\\" Toward the end of the short story Gnut's face is described with \\"metal muscles\\". This differs dramatically from both movie depictions which use a visor to represent Gort's eyes, but very few other facial features. Gnut speaks to the main character at the end of the short story, while the movie depictions remove his ability to speak at all. Gnut is also able to raise his internal temperature high enough to vaporize \\"Glasstex\\", a fictional thermoplastic material used to imprison him partway through the story. His body is also invulnerable to \\"ray\\" weapons, gases, acids, heat, and electrical currents. 1951 depiction Gort is an eight-foot tall, seamless robot apparently constructed from a single piece of \\"flexible metal\\". He is but one member of a \\"race of robots\\" invented by an interplanetary confederation (described as \\"A sort of United Nations on a Planetary level\\" by Klaatu, who is a representative of that confederation) to protect their citizens against all aggression by destroying any aggressors. Klaatu describes \\"him\\" as one of an interstellar police force, holding irrevocable powers to \\"preserve the peace\\" by destroying any aggressor. The fear of provoking these robots acts as a deterrent against aggression. North, Edmund H. \\"'The Day the Earth Stood Still'.\\" dailyscript.com, February 21, 1951. To that end, Gort accompanies Klaatu on his mission to deliver an ultimatum to the people of Earth: the interplanetary confederation is not concerned with internal human politics; however, if humanity threatens to use atomic weapons against the other planets, the Earth will be destroyed to ensure the safety of the other planets. Gort does not speak, but he can receive and follow verbal commands (including the famous dialog line \\"Klaatu barada nikto\\", spoken by actor Patricia Neal's character toward the end of the film), as well non-verbal commands: at one point, Klaatu communicates with him using reflected signals from a borrowed flashlight. This is not the end of his capability, though, as Gort is also shown acting entirely on his own, both to protect Klaatu from harm and to free himself from encasement in a block of plastic. Gort can also operate highly complex machinery, and is both the pilot and captain of the ship that delivers Klaatu to Earth ‚Äì all of his \\"race\\" have similar ships that they use to patrol the planets. North, Edmund H. \\"'The Day the Earth Stood Still'.\\" dailyscript.com, February 21, 1951. Retrieved: July 219, 2017. Seemingly unarmed, Gort is in fact armed with a laserlike weapon that is projected from beneath a visor on his head. While the weapon can apparently vaporize any physical object, its effect is variable at Gort's discretion, and is precise enough to destroy a single object without harming anything around it. In its first onscreen use, it vaporized several soldier's guns from their hands while not harming the soldiers at all, and seconds later was used to vaporize tanks and artillery without harming their occupants or any surrounding objects. Gort is also continually aware of Klaatu's physical condition and location without Klaatu needing to wear a tracking device of any sort. Gort is not known to be damageable by any means available to mankind, and can ‚Äì despite resistance ‚Äì destroy the Earth itself if he is sufficiently provoked. During most of the film, Gort remains motionless in front of his ship, which rests in a baseball park in central Washington, D.C., near the White House. Scientists and military researchers attempt to examine both the robot and the ship. North, Edmund H. \\"'The Day the Earth Stood Still'.\\" dailyscript.com, February 21, 1951. Retrieved: July 219, 2017. He was portrayed by seven-foot, seven-inch (231 cm)-tall actor Lock Martin wearing a thick foam-rubber suit designed and built by Addison Hehr. Two suits were created, fastened alternately from the front or back so that the robot would appear seamless from any angle in the completed scenes. A fiberglass statue of Gort was also used for the close-ups of the firing of his energy beam weapon or when a scene did not require that he move. To maximize the height of the robot, the Gort suit was made with lifts in the boots. Martin could see forward through the suit's visor area during certain shots, and air holes were provided for him under the robot's wide chin and jaw, and these can be seen in several close-ups of Gort's head. 2008 depiction Gort, as seen in the 2008 remake, with the redesigned spaceship in background. The nature of Gort was almost completely altered in the 2008 remake. Gort's name was revised as an acronym assigned to the robot by the United States' military and scientists: G.O.R.T., which stands for \\"Genetically Organized Robotic Technology\\". The acronym is only used once. G.O.R.T. is significantly taller than Gort, being about twenty-eight feet tall as opposed to eight feet. Much like the original Gort, G.O.R.T does not speak. Unlike the original Gort, G.O.R.T. is on Earth specifically to save it from humanity: if the human race doesn't change its ecological destructiveness by a certain time, it will destroy humanity to save the Earth's biosphere. He is neutralized by Klaatu at the end of the film with a massive EMP that also shuts down all of humanity's electrical technology. G.O.R.T. is made up of a vast swarm of microscopic insect-like devices that can self-replicate through the consumption of matter and energy: these nano- machines are capable of consuming any substance they touch, regardless of the hardness or density of the material being consumed, and can fly as well as crawl. These nanomachines can be used as a doomsday weapon, potentially consuming all material on a planet. In addition to this mode of attack, G.O.R.T. conceals a laser weapon under a visor-like slit in his \\"face\\", which can also be used to hack Unmanned aerial vehicles (such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drones). It can also generate debilitating high-frequency sound and an electromagnetic field that disrupts all electrical devices in a wide radius. Unlike the 1951 version, this newer G.O.R.T. is an all-CGI effect, and has 5 digits on each hand, instead of the mitten-style hands of the 1951 robot; his feet, however, have no digits. Features such as the cuffs, belt, visor, and boots of the first Gort are gone. The 2008 G.O.R.T has a more simplistic overall surface design that in close-up appears to \\"move\\" due to its nanorobotic composition. Comparing 1951 and 2008 performances Owen Gleiberman writes that \\"Gort isn't so lovey-dovey\\" in the remake; rather, \\"he's like a super-tall, obsidian Oscar statue wreaking havoc.\\"Gleiberman, Owen. \\"Review of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)'.\\" Entertainment Weekly, December 10, 2008.

He was involved in many of the reform movements in New York City shortly before the start of the 20th century up until his death. As a longtime assistant to District Attorney Charles S. Whitman, he was involved in several high-profile criminal cases such as the Rosenthal murder trial in which police detective Charles Becker was found guilty of murder and executed. Biography Frank Moss was born in Cold Spring, New York in 1860 and moved to New York City as a child. Attending New York City College, he became involved in \\"vice crusades\\" and other reform movements while studying to pass the bar. Early in his legal career, he held important positions such as president of the City Vigilance League and president of the Society for the Prevention of Crime. He was also a member of the Union League Club and Republican Club. While council for Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, Moss helped police in closing down gambling dens belonging to the On Leong Tong in Chinatown. Much of the information was supplied by Mock Duck, a rival underworld figure of Tom Lee and the On Leongs, and who quickly assumed control of these establishments after they were closed. In appreciation, Mock Duck replaced the traditional joss in the Hip Sing Tong House with a crayon portrait of Moss.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 282-283) Moss first came to prominence during the Lexow and Mazet investigations, as an associate and chief council respectively, where he established himself as an aggressive prosecutor and investigator. While cross-examining Tammany Hall leader Richard Croker during the Mazet inquiry, Moss was able to provoke him into stating the now famous statement admitting his corruption: \\"I am working for my pocket all the time, just like you, Mr. Moss\\". In 1897, he succeeded Theodore Roosevelt as president of the Board of Police Commissioners. In 1901, during Seth Low and William Travers Jerome's campaign against the city's red light districts, Moss famously addressed the court in a speech blaming Croker for the existence of white slavery and forced prostitution. He and Jerome became close friends after the trial, Moss working tirelessly on the case to the point of exhaustion, however the two would later have a falling out when the two noted attorneys faced each other during the trial of John M. Wisker in 1902. In the fall of 1909, Moss was unexpectedly chosen by District Attorney Charles S. Whitman to become his first assistant. Although Moss was a Republican, he was not a particular favorite of machine politics and Herbert Parsons, political boss of New York County, was reportedly displeased with his appointment. While under Whitman, Moss successfully prosecuted the four members of the Lenox Avenue Gang accused of murdering gambler Herman Rosenthal. It was partly on evidence gained at this trial that he was able to greatly assist Whitman in proving that police detective Charles Becker hired the four gunmen to kill Rosenthal resulting in his conviction and execution. A devout churchgoer, Moss was an active member of the congregation of St. James Methodist Episcopal Church. He served on the board of directors for the New York Church Extension Society for a number of years and his son, Reverend Arthur Moss, was on the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Church. In November 1919, Moss underwent surgery at Roosevelt Hospital and suffered a relapse four months later from which he would never fully recover. In poor health for the last few months of his life, he died of heart disease at his East 127th Street home on the night of June 5, 1920. He and his wife Elva E. Bruce had two children, Arthur and Elizabeth Moss. Bibliography *Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time (3 vols.).

A paperback edition () followed in 1996. It is a sequel to his 1990 novel Jurassic Park. In 1997, both novels were re-published as a single book titled Michael Crichton's Jurassic World, unrelated to the 2015 film of the same name. Plot summary In 1993, four years after the disaster at Jurassic Park, chaos theorist and mathematician Ian Malcolm ‚Äì who is revealed to have survived the events of the previous novel, despite being declared dead in the epilogue ‚Äì teams up with paleontologist Richard Levine to search for a \\"lost world\\" of dinosaurs following rumors of strange animal corpses washing up on the shores of Costa Rica. In 1995, they learn of Site B on Isla Sorna, the \\"production facility\\" where the now-defunct company InGen hatched and grew the dinosaurs for their Jurassic Park theme park on nearby Isla Nublar. Afraid that the Costa Rican government will find Isla Sorna and destroy the dinosaurs, Levine hastily embarks on an expedition to the island without Malcolm. He arrives with a Costa Rican guide named Diego, but shortly after arriving, the two are attacked by mysterious creatures, later identified as Carnotaurus, who kill Diego. Malcolm eventually learns that Levine has gone missing there. Malcolm goes to the island with a rescue team consisting of Jack \\"Doc\\" Thorne, an engineer and retired university professor; Eddie Carr, Thorne's assistant; and two stowaway children, R.B. \\"Arby\\" Benton and Kelly Curtis, who were working as Levine's research assistants as part of a school project. Dr. Sarah Harding, an animal behaviorist and former lover of Malcolm's, is also approached to join the expedition. Though she initially refuses, she ultimately decides to meet them there. The group arrives on the island with weapons and a conjoined pair of heavily modified, and specially equipped RV trailers that serve as a mobile laboratory. They find a geothermal-powered complex of abandoned InGen buildings, including a worker village, and a laboratory that the group explores. They eventually find Levine, who is overjoyed at the trove of information he can glean from this \\"lost world\\". Simultaneously, another group‚Äîgeneticists Lewis Dodgson, Howard King, and \\"celebrity\\" biologist George Baselton‚Äîlearns of Levine's expedition and go to Isla Sorna with plans to steal dinosaur eggs for Biosyn, the rival company of InGen responsible for the sabotage that led to the Jurassic Park disaster. As they are about to leave, they encounter Harding, and offer to give her a ride to Isla Sorna. However, just as they approach the island, Dodgson attempts to kill her by shoving her off the boat, but she survives and meets up with Malcolm's group. Levine and Malcolm make many observations of the dinosaurs' behavior from the \\"high hide\\", an enclosed blind that is set above the ground on scaffolding. They soon learn that Dodgson's group has arrived on the island. Dodgson's group is attacked by a pair of Tyrannosaurus as they try to steal eggs from the animals' nest, resulting in Baselton's death. Dodgson and King become separated after the attack. While inspecting the T. rex nest, Malcolm finds that one of the infants had been injured and has a broken leg. He instructs Eddie to kill it because it has no chance of surviving in the wild. Unbeknownst to the group, Eddie refuses to kill the injured animal and brings it back to the trailers. When the group discovers the animal, Malcolm and Harding begrudgingly agree to set and cast its leg while the rest of the group returns to the high hide. As night approaches, the nocturnal Velociraptors emerge from the jungle and kill King. As Malcolm and Harding finish setting the T. rex's leg, the parents come looking for their infant and attack the trailers, pushing one of them over a cliff and injuring Malcolm. Thorne rescues Malcolm and Harding, while the raptors attack the high hide and kill Eddie. Malcolm is injected with a high dosage of morphine which makes him relaxed, though not without hallucinating once again. Arby, trapped in a survival cage, is taken hostage by the raptors but is rescued. The group later takes refuge from the raptors in the general store of the InGen worker village. The group attempts to formulate a plan to reach the landing site where the helicopter is set to meet them in the morning. When Thorne ventures out into the village to search for fuel, he survives an encounter with a pair of chameleon-like Carnotaurus. The next morning, Harding heads out to recover one of the team's vehicles that Thorne had left behind while saving her and Malcolm from the trailer earlier, as it may be the only vehicle large enough to carry everyone to the rendezvous point. However, upon finding it, she encounters Dodgson, attempting to steal the vehicle for himself. Suddenly, a T. rex approaches them, and they both hide under the car. However, Harding pushes Dodgson back out, and the T. rex picks him up and feeds him to her offspring. Harding sets out to reach the helicopter before it can take off without the group, but she is too late. The group then discovers a boat docked on the island and manage to reach it just as the raptors finally break into the general store. As the group sails away, Malcolm reveals information that he discovered in the laboratory: during Site B's active years, InGen fed the young carnivorous dinosaurs sheep extract infected with prions, which causes a disease that shortens the dinosaurs' life spans. Although the scientists contained the disease, it began to spread once again after they abandoned the island. Malcolm suspects that the disease will lead to the eventual extinction of the dinosaurs on Isla Sorna. Background After the publication of Jurassic Park in 1990, Crichton was pressured by fans to write a sequel. Following the success of Jurassic Park's film adaptation in 1993, director Steven Spielberg became interested in making a sequel film. Crichton had never written a sequel to any of his novels before, and was initially hesitant to do so. Crichton said a sequel was \\"a very difficult structural problem because it has to be the same but different; if it's really the same, then it's the same‚Äîand if it's really different, then it's not a sequel. So it's in some funny intermediate territory.\\" In March 1994, Crichton said there would probably be a sequel novel as well as a film adaptation, stating that he had an idea for the novel's story. Despite the character of Ian Malcolm dying in the first novel, Crichton chose to bring him back for the sequel: \\"Malcolm came back because I needed him. I could do without the others, but not him because he is the 'ironic commentator' on the action. He keeps telling us why it will go bad. And I had to have him back again.\\" Bringing a dead character back was an idea Crichton got from Arthur Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes, who had been killed off but was later brought back. Malcolm was also considered a favorite character among readers of the first novel and people who watched its film adaptation. An early draft of the novel included a lengthy tirade by Malcolm regarding God and evolution, but Crichton removed it \\"because it just didn't seem to fit.\\" In March 1995, Crichton announced that he was nearly finished writing the novel, with a scheduled release for later that year. At the time, Crichton declined to specify the novel's title or plot. Crichton later stated that the novel's title is an homage to Doyle's 1912 novel of the same name, as well as a 1925 film adaptation of Doyle's novel, also titled The Lost World. Crichton's novel also shares some story similarities with Doyle's novel, as they both involve an expedition to an isolated Central American location where dinosaurs roam. However, in Crichton's novel, the dinosaurs were recreated by genetic engineering, rather than surviving from antiquity. The Lost World was the only book sequel Crichton ever wrote before he died.  Reception  The Lost World spent eight weeks as number one on the New York Times Best Seller List, from October 8, 1995, to November 26, 1995, and remained on the list as late as March 1996. Susan Toepfer of People magazine wrote, \\"Action-packed and camera-ready, The Lost World is to its predecessor what microwave dinners are to home-cooked meals: hardly authentic, but in a pinch fully satisfying.\\" Toepfer wrote that \\"the odd reappearance of Ian Malcolm, when other key characters from the original have been dropped, makes one wonder if only Jeff Goldblum was available to appear in the movie sequel. But even at his most calculating‚Äîincorporating two urchins, crafting a feminist hero‚Äîthe author pleases. Characteristically clever, fast-paced and engaging, Michael Crichton's latest work accomplishes what he set out to do: offer the still- harrowing thrills of a by-now-familiar ride.\\" Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times gave the novel a negative review and called it a \\"tired rehash\\" of Jurassic Park. Kakutani wrote that the novel lacked the \\"surprise or ingenuity\\" of its predecessor, calling it \\"so predictable and unimaginative that it seems to have been intended to save special-effects technicians the hassle of doing new work on the movie sequel.\\" Kakutani said the novel represented \\"a new low\\" in Crichton's \\"attention to character,\\" and criticized the character of Ian Malcolm in particular: \\"Except for complaining about the injuries he suffered in 'Jurassic Park,' Malcolm makes virtually no reference to his previous visit to dino-land [...]. Instead of even making a half- hearted attempt to turn Malcolm into a reasonable facsimile of a person, Mr. Crichton cynically uses him as a mouthpiece for all sorts of portentous techno-babble about chaos theory, extinction theories and mankind's destructive nature. As for the other characters, they are each given handy labels for easy identification.\\" Tom De Haven of Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a \\"B-\\" rating and wrote that it \\"is like a videogame in prose ‚Äî a few hundred frantic pages of run, hide, kill, and die. Over and over again.\\" De Haven criticized the lack of characterization and wrote that Crichton was \\"clearly off his stride here, right from the start. Without any need to build scientific plausibility into the plot (he did that last time, beautifully), Crichton seems unengaged by his own material, distanced from it, and his cautionary lectures about extinction and natural selection seem halfhearted attempts to legitimize his return to familiar territory. But if there's a lack of freshness to the novel (even the title isn't new; it's borrowed from the granddaddy of all dinosaur tales, by Arthur Conan Doyle), it is still a very scary read.\\" De Haven felt that the novel's opening chapters were \\"rushed and contrived. Although it's perhaps a deliberate, affectionate nod to the old let's-get-going-so-we-can-get-to-the-good-parts kind of storytelling that was such a staple of 1950s monster movies, it's still cheesy. [...] No matter how feeble the premise, though, or how shallow the characterizations, I wouldn't dream of talking anybody out of reading the novel. For clarity, terror, and sheer grisliness, the action far surpasses anything in the original book; even better, the suspense is masterfully stretched out, then released all of a sudden ‚Äî just when you least expect it.\\" De Haven concluded that its predecessor \\"has earned a secure place for itself in the history of popular American literature. The Lost World, at best, will be a footnote. But still, it made my palms sweat.\\" Neal Karlen of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Crichton \\"has done the sequel step just right, keeping the tropes of the earlier novel familiar for the fans while changing the ideas and story line enough to keep even his severest and most envious critics turning the pages to find out what happens next.\\" Karlen noted that, \\"Once again, the dinosaurs seem the real stars,\\" while writing that the human characters \\"are introduced as if in shorthand screenplay form\\". Karlen especially praised the novel's raptors, calling them \\"seemingly meaner, more loathsome, and once again better developed than almost all of the book's human characters.\\"  Film adaptation  The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 science fiction film and sequel to Jurassic Park, loosely based on Crichton's novel. The film was a commercial success, breaking many box-office records when released, but received mixed reviews. It has a number of plot differences from the novel and incorporates scenes from the first novel that were not previously filmed, including the scene with Christina (Novel) / Cathy (Film) Bowman being attacked by Compsognathus.

The French defenders were driven back into the town of Saint- Palais in confusion. Because of this minor victory, the Allies were able to secure a crossing over the Bidouze River during this clash from the final stages of the Peninsular War. In the Battle of the Nive on 9‚Äì13 December 1813, Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult's army failed to drive Wellington's forces away from Bayonne. After the Nive, bad weather imposed a 2-month pause in military operations, during which time the French confined the Allied forces to an area south and west of the fortresses of Bayonne and Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. To break out of the region, Wellington launched an offensive toward the east in February, pressing back Soult's left wing. A column under Rowland Hill encountered Harispe's division at Garris. The next action was the Battle of Orthez. Background In the Battle of the Nive near Bayonne on 9‚Äì13 December 1813, Wellington with 36,000 British and 23,000 Portuguese defeated Soult with 65,933 troops. French casualties were 5,947 and 16 guns while Allied losses numbered 4,662. Another authority placed Allied losses at 5,000 while pointing out that the French lost 2,000 allied German troops who defected to the Allies. This action marked the end of the fighting for the year. Soult had found Wellington's army divided by the Nive River but failed to inflict a crippling blow. Afterward, the French withdrew into Bayonne and winter quarters. Jean Isidore Harispe Bad weather prevented Wellington's army from moving for the next two months. Heavy rains began soon after the fighting stopped, rendering the roads impassable and washing away the Allies' temporary bridges across the Nive. The Coalition allies begged the British commander to continue his campaign but Wellington politely declined to mount an offensive when the weather was so bad. He explained it would ruin his army to no purpose. After the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November 1813, Wellington's Spanish troops had run amok in captured French villages. Not wishing to provoke a guerilla war by French civilians, the British commander rigorously discouraged his British and Portuguese troops from plundering and sent most of his Spanish soldiers home. Only Pablo Morillo's Spanish division was retained since the men were regularly paid and fed by the British government. Wellington's policy soon paid off when his soldiers found it unnecessary to guard the roads in his army's rear areas. In January 1814, Soult's army was reduced by three divisions and one brigade when Napoleon demanded reinforcements to help defend eastern France. Transferred to the Campaign in Northeast France were the 5,428-man 7th Infantry Division led by Jean Fran√ßois Leval, the 5,587-strong 9th Infantry Division commanded by Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier Boyer, a 2,866-man dragoon division under Anne-Fran√ßois-Charles Trelliard and a 554-man dragoon brigade directed by Louis Ernest Joseph Sparre. Remaining with Soult were the 4,600-man 1st Division under Maximilien S√©bastien Foy, the 5,500-man 2nd Division led by Jean Barth√©lemy Darmagnac, the 5,300-man 3rd Division commanded by Louis Jean Nicolas Abb√©, the 5,600-man 4th Division directed by Eloi Charlemagne Taupin, the 5,000-man 5th Division commanded by Jean-Pierre Maransin, the 5,200-man 6th Division under Eug√®ne-Casimir Villatte, the 6,600-man 8th Division led by Jean Isidore Harispe and the 3,800-man cavalry division under Pierre Beno√Æt Soult. Marshal Soult's command also included 7,300 gunners, engineers and wagon drivers plus the 8,800-strong garrison of Bayonne and the 2,400-strong garrison of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. The original 8th Division was suppressed after the Battle of Nivelle. It was reconstituted by adding the brigade of Marie Auguste Paris, borrowed from Marshal Louis- Gabriel Suchet's army, to two brigades from Villatte's Reserve. Map of Pyren√©es-Atlantiques department shows Bayonne on the coast at left, Saint- Palais on the Bidouze at lower center and Soult's headquarters at Peyrehorade at upper center. Wellington's army included the 6,898-man 1st Division under Kenneth Howard, the 7,780-man 2nd Division led by William Stewart, the 6,626-man 3rd Division commanded by Thomas Picton, the 5,952-man 4th Division directed by Lowry Cole, the 4,553-man 5th Division under Andrew Hay, the 5,571-man 6th Division led by Henry Clinton, the 5,643-man 7th Division commanded by George Townshend Walker, the 3,480-man Light Division directed by Charles Alten, the 4,465-man Portuguese Division under Carlos Lecor and the 4,924-man Spanish Division led by Morillo. Stapleton Cotton commanded three light cavalry brigades under Henry Fane, 765 sabers, Hussey Vivian, 989 sabers and Edward Somerset, 1,619 sabers. In addition there were three independent infantry brigades, 1,816 British under Matthew Whitworth-Aylmer, 2,185 Portuguese led by John Wilson and 1,614 Portuguese directed by Thomas Bradford. Soult established his headquarters in Peyrehorade and posted his divisions in a line running from the fortress of Bayonne on the west to the fortress of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on the southeast. He believed that Wellington would try to surround Bayonne by crossing the Adour River east of the city. To prevent this, the French marshal assigned three divisions to hold the line of the Adour River from Bayonne to Port-de-Lanne. Facing southeast, four divisions defended the Joyeuse River from the Adour to the village of H√©lette. Cavalry outposts covered the gap between H√©lette and Saint-Jean-Pied- de-Port, which was blockaded by Spanish guerillas under Francisco Espoz y Mina. Soult planned to strike the Allies when they tried to push across the Adour, but Wellington had other plans. The British commander planned to use the corps of John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun against Bayonne, while pressing east with his other two corps in an effort to draw Soult's army away from Bayonne. Soult could muster 60,000 soldiers and 77 guns while Wellington was able to put more than 70,000 into the field. The rains stopped in the second week of February and Wellington's began his offensive on 14 February. On the right flank was Rowland Hill's 20,000-man corps, including the 2nd Division, the Portuguese Division, Morillo's Spaniards and Fane's cavalry brigade. Hill was temporarily assigned the 3rd Division. On Hill's left was the 25,400-man corps of William Beresford with the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Divisions plus the cavalry brigades of Vivian and Somerset. Hill's main column headed east for H√©lette while Picton's 3rd Division marched toward Bonloc on the north and Morillo's division moved through the foothills farther south. In the face of this threat, Harispe's division at H√©lette abandoned the line of the Joyeuse and fell back toward the Bidouze River at Saint-Palais. With his left flank uncovered, Villatte, facing Picton's 3rd Division, also backpedaled to the Bidouze. Battle Rowland Hill Just west of Saint-Palais, Harispe found a defensible position at Garris. He deployed his division on a long ridge and awaited the Allied onset. The only escape route was the single bridge over the Bidouze at Saint-Palais. Late in the afternoon of 15 February, William Henry Pringle's brigade at the front of Hill's corps, came up to the position but merely skirmished with the French. The soldiers were tired from their long march and looked forward to camping for the evening. Suddenly, an aide-de-camp of Wellington galloped up and demanded, \\"Take that hill before dark\\". The troops quickly formed into close column and advanced toward the French. Harispe deployed about 7,000 troops. They were two battalions each of the 9th, 25th and 34th Light Infantry and one battalion each of the 45th, 81st, 115th 116th and 117th Line Infantry Regiments. Against them, Wellington and Hill brought about 11,000 men, including two battalions of Pringle's brigade, the 1st Battalions of the 28th Foot and 39th Foot. In addition, there were Lecor's two Portuguese brigades under Hippolita Da Costa and John Buchan. Da Costa's brigade consisted of two battalions each of the 2nd and 14th Portuguese Infantry Regiments while Buchan's brigade was made up of two battalions each of the 4th and 10th Portuguese Infantry Regiments and the 10th Ca√ßadores (light) Battalion. Stewart's 2nd Division included three British and one Portuguese brigades, the 1st under Edward Barnes, the 2nd under the Earl of Strafford, the 3rd under Pringle and the Portuguese under Henry Hardinge. Barnes led the 1st Battalions of the 50th Foot, 71st Highlanders and 92nd Highlanders. Byng was in charge of the 1st Battalions of the 3rd Foot, 57th Foot and 66th Foot and the 2nd Battalion of the 31st Foot. Hardinge directed two battalions each of the 6th and 18th Portuguese Infantry Regiments and the 6th Ca√ßadores Battalion. Another source stated that in Pringle's brigade the 39th Foot was absent drawing new uniforms and that the 2nd Battalion of the 34th Foot and the 1st/28th Foot were the only units present. Pringle's battalions quickly fought their way to the crest of the ridge. The French defenders gamely counterattacked but failed to drive away their enemies. As this combat was going on, Morillo's Spanish and Lecor's Portuguese began to envelop the flanks of the outnumbered French division. Seeing the threat, Harispe ordered a withdrawal. With the Portuguese closing in on the bridge, the French retreat soon became a stampede to safety. Most made it across the bridge but the Allies captured some men on the east bank. The French lost 300 men killed and wounded and 200 prisoners. The Allies suffered 170 casualties, including 40 Portuguese. In a melee with the 81st Line, the 1/39th lost 43 men. The rout so demoralized Harispe's division that their general was unable to rally his soldiers in Saint-Palais and had to retreat west to Domezain- Berraute. Though the French engineers managed to set off demolition charges on the bridge, the work was done poorly and the Allies soon had the bridge back in operation. Result The Anglo-Allied army breached the line of the Bidouze. On 16 February, Soult recalled two of his divisions from north of the Adour leaving Abb√©'s division in Bayonne to make up a very powerful 14,000-man garrison. The French marshal assembled a field army with 32,000 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. He began reforming his line behind the Gave d'Oloron and Saison Rivers, from Peyrehorade through Sauveterre-de-B√©arn and Navarrenx. Facing Soult were Wellington's 42,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. Beresford's corps moved to Bidache on the lower Bidouze. By 18 February, Soult's units were all on the Gave d'Oloron line as Hill probed at Sauveterre and Beresford reconnoitered Hastingues, a French bridgehead on the south bank. That night it began to snow and sleet, causing Wellington to suspend operations for four days. Meanwhile, the British carried a bold plan to surround Bayonne by crossing the Adour below the fortress. Since the river is across with a tidal rise of , the French never suspected their enemies would attempt it and left no forces to guard the Adour below Bayonne. On 23 February, Hope sent eight companies across to set up a bridgehead. That evening 700 French troops sent to investigate were dispersed by Congreve rockets. The next day, 34 coasting vessels sailed into the channel and a bridge was constructed using the vessels as pontoons. Five cables were secured to the opposite bank by attaching each of them to a heavy 18-pounder cannon barrel. When the vessels and cables were in place, a roadway was built of planks. British troops poured across the span and by 27 February the city of Bayonne was completely invested by Hope's corps. On that day Battle of Orthez was fought.

Overview The Dodge Copperhead was unveiled at the 1997 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Many reviewers were impressed with its aerodynamic, yet rugged styling with its Copper Fire Orange color and the fact that its sale price would be about $30,000 USD ($45,000 less than the Viper). The Copperhead, unlike the Viper, was made more for handling and driving pleasure, while the Viper was made more for raw power. The Copperhead had excellent handling due to its low, wide stance. Dodge engineered the Copperhead to make the driver feel the road and the pavement, and this was done by stretching the wheels to the end of the frame, adding five inches of ground clearance and a stiff suspension, making this car marketed more towards enthusiasts. The Dodge Copperhead was due to be released in 2000, but was canceled.  Design  The exterior and interior designs of the Copperhead are both completely distinct compared to its original influence and platform, the Viper, but the Copperhead still contains some designs from it. = Exterior = An all-new bodykit made specifically for the Copperhead takes over most of the Viper's design to distinguish it. This new body forces some parts from its original platform to be changed (either in shape or position), or be removed. Even with the stuffy-looking design, the Copperhead is still slightly shorter than the Viper, except for the wheelbase, which is a foot (300 mm; 12 in) longer than it. The Copperhead's new look includes larger wheel fenders, a larger front bumper, a slightly smaller front grille, headlights positioned below the hood, side inlet pits (rather than the regular side performance inlets), removed front air intake, smaller hood louvers, a stubby top rear fin, smaller Viper taillights, and front wheels that have been slightly moved forward for better handling. = Interior = The dashboard tachometer has been changed entirely, now with an old-school design. Four gauges sit on the middle of the dashboard, displaying the engine oil, speedometer, fuel, and temperature, with the high beam lights and turn signal displays sitting beside them. Below the gauges sits a head-like designed center console control area, and includes climate control, two air conditioning fans, temperature display, radio FM display, and other functions. Below the controls sits the 5-speed manual transmission, and the handbrake. The whole center console design resembles a copperhead snake. The steering wheel design remains, the same design used for the Phase ZB series Vipers.  Specifications  The Dodge Copperhead is powered by a LH all-aluminum DOHC V6 engine manufactured by Chrysler, that is placed at a front longitudinal position. The engine puts out at 6000 rpm and at 4900 rpm. All of the power is sent to the rear wheels by a 5-speed close-ratio manual transmission, therefore making the car rear-wheel drive. The chassis is heavily based on the Dodge Viper, but has been extensively modified to suit the Copperhead's requirements. Its tires, which are 225/40R18 up front, and 255/40R18 down the rear, help the precise handling, thanks to its wide width and sticky footprint. The suspension is composed of double wishbones with coil over dampers. These are also short-and-long-arm versions to better increase comfort and better handling. Name controversy After the unveiling of the Copperhead, Dodge received a complaint regarding ownership of the rights to the \\"Copperhead\\" name. A customized 1950 Ford Coupe owned by Billy Gibbons of the American rock band ZZ Top, had already been registered with the Copperhead name. As a result, DaimlerChrysler unofficially renamed the car, with it being referred to as the \\"Concept Vehicle\\" instead of \\"Copperhead\\" in press kits, scale toys, and other merchandise. This made press kits or items with the Copperhead name collectibles.  Media  The Dodge Copperhead makes an appearance in Gran Turismo and Gran Turismo 2. After the Copperhead name controversy, the Copperhead was renamed as the \\"Concept Car\\" in the games.

It is bright yellow-green, shrubby and highly branched, and grows on the bark of living and dead conifers in parts of western and continental Europe, the Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains of Western North America. This species is somewhat toxic to mammals due to the yellow pigment vulpinic acid, and has been used historically as a poison for wolves and foxes. It has also been used traditionally by many native North American ethnic groups as a pigment source for dyes and paints. Description The thallus, or vegetative body, has a fructicose shape  that is, shrubby and densely branched  and a bright yellow to yellow-green, or chartreuse color, although the color will fade in drier specimens. Its dimensions are typically in diameter. The vegetative reproductive structures soredia and isidia are present on the surface of the thalli, often abundantly. Closeup showing dense covering of vegetative reproductive structures. Physiology Like most lichens, L. vulpina is highly tolerant of freezing and low temperatures. In one set of experiments, the lichen was able to reactivate its metabolism after 15 hours of cold storage and resume photosynthesis within 12 minutes of thawing. It was also able to start photosynthesis while rewarming, still at below-zero temperatures (¬∞C), suggesting that it may remain active during winter.Kallio P, Heinonen S. (1971). \\"Influence of short-term low temperature on net photosynthesis in some subarctic lichens.\\" Reports of the Kevo Subarctic Research Station 8:63-72. Distribution and habitat L. vulpina occurs throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is often abundant on exposed branches that have lost their bark. In old, moist forests, it is typically found in drier areas. This species has an intermediate air pollution sensitivity. In the Rocky Mountains, Letharia species are found in ponderosa forests at the prairie-forest boundary at relatively low elevations though medium and high elevation Douglas fir and lodgepole pine forests. Uses Some Plateau Indian tribes used wolf lichen as a poultice for swelling, bruises, sores, and boils, and boiled it as a drink to stop bleeding. The brightly colored fruiting bodies are popular in floral arrangements. =Dyeing= The Klamath Indians in California soaked porcupine quills in a chartreuse-colored extract of Letharia vulpina that dyed them yellow; the quills were woven into the basket patterns. Vulpinic acid, poisonous dye in L. vulpina. =Poison= The use of this species for poisoning wolves and foxes goes back at least hundreds of years, based on the mention of the practice in Christoph Gedner's \\"Of the use of curiosity\\", collected in Benjamin Stillingfleet, Miscellaneous Tracts Relating to Natural History, Husbandry and Physics (London, 1759). According to British lichenologist Annie Lorrain Smith, reindeer carcasses were stuffed with lichen and powdered glass, and suggests that the sharp edges of the glass would make the animals' internal organs more susceptible to the effects of the lichen poison. However, it is known that the lichen itself is also effective powdered lichen added to fat and inserted into reindeer carcasses will also be fatal to wolves that consume it. The toxic chemical is the yellow dye vulpinic acid, which is poisonous to all meat-eaters, but not to mice and rabbits. Similar species The closely related Letharia columbiana lacks isidia and soredia, usually bearing instead apothecia. It is also less branched than L. vulpina.

He had taught at Howard University, Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, and became chair of the department of political science at City University in New York. Early life, education and marriage Davis was born in the Washington, D.C. area in 1912 to John Abraham Davis and Gabrielle Dorothy (Beale) Davis. He and his two older siblings (anthropologist Allison Davis and sister Dorothy Davis Lucas) were raised on a farm in Virginia. They attended and graduated from Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.), a top academic high school for black students, which their father had also attended.Guide to the Allison Davis Papers 1932-1984 .

Like his older brother Allison, Davis attended Williams College, where he graduated in 1933.The Oakley Center - Lectures. Williams.edu. Retrieved on 2009-02-02. Upon graduation from Williams, he continued in postgraduate studies, earning a master's degree in political science from the University of Wisconsin in 1934, and a doctorate degree in political science from Columbia University in 1949. Davis married Mavis Wormley. They had two sons together, John A. Davis Jr. and Smith W. Davis. Academic career Davis taught at Howard University in the mid-1930s and after receiving his doctorate. He later was selected for a position as a full professor in political science at Lincoln University (Pennsylvania), a historically black college. In 1953, Davis was named an associate professor at City College of New York. There he was promoted to professor of government in the graduate faculty, and then to chairman of the department of political science at City University. Civil rights work Davis had become active in civil rights in 1933, when he formed the New Negro Alliance with Belford Lawson Jr. and M. Franklin Thorne. They challenged a white-owned business operating in African-American neighborhoods of Washington, DC that fired black workers to replace them with white, although most of their customers were black. To protest this practice, the Alliance organized the \\"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\\" campaign in the height of the Great Depression, calling for boycotts and picketing of these businesses by neighborhood customers. Most businesses, afraid of losing revenue in a shaky economic period, caved in to the protests. Others fought back and sought an injunction against the group. Initially, the lower courts sided with the businesses, but the case reached the Supreme Court, which in 1938 sided with The Alliance. Future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall represented The Alliance in the case, which was known as New Negro Alliance vs. Sanitary Grocery Company Inc.. In the process, he formed a close lifelong friendship with Davis.African American Heritage Trail . Cultural Tourism DC. Retrieved on 2009-02-02.

Working with a team of more than 200 scholars, who included Horace Mann Bond (father of Julian Bond, a future NAACP president), historian C. Vann Woodward, William Robert Ming Jr., Alfred Kelly, and historian John Hope Franklin, Davis compiled the factual evidence that was presented in Marshall's arguments against the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine, proving that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited racial discrimination.Brown v.

He was the quarterbacks coach for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL), a position he assumed in February 2012. Bates has previously served as the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks and quarterbacks coach for the USC Trojans football team. Personal life Bates is the son of former long-time collegiate and NFL coach Jim Bates and attended high school in Sevierville, Tennessee. He played quarterback at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Rice University, where he also played baseball. Bates completed his bachelor's degree in 1999 at Rice. In 2014, Bates hiked the 2,900-mile Continental Divide Trail (CDT), completing a five- month trek across the Continental Divide Trail from Mexico to Canada alone, trekking 20‚Äì30 miles per day with a 40 to 60 pound backpack. Coaching career =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= Bates began his coaching career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an offensive quality control coach from 2002‚Äì03; the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002. In 2004, he was promoted to the position of assistant quarterbacks coach, working closely with head coach Jon Gruden and quarterbacks coach John Shoop. =New York Jets= He was the New York Jets' quarterbacks coach in 2005; due to a series of injuries the team fielded five different quarterbacks that season, notably Brooks Bollinger. =Denver Broncos= Bates joined the Denver Broncos in 2006. In his first season, he served as an offensive assistant, helping offensive coordinator Rick Dennison coach the offensive line. In 2007, he served as wide receivers/quarterbacks coach, and in 2008 as quarterbacks coach, both seasons working closely with quarterback Jay Cutler. In 2008, Bates called the offensive plays for the Broncos, helping Cutler become a Pro Bowl selection and the team to have the NFL's second-most productive offense (1st in the AFC). At the end of the 2008 NFL regular season, longtime head coach Mike Shanahan was fired and replaced by Josh McDaniels. Due to the uncertainty, Bates began looking for a new position.Gary Klein, Trojans hire Broncos' Jeremy Bates for key post, Los Angeles Times, January 20, 2009, Accessed January 21, 2009. =USC Trojans= On January 19, 2009, USC Trojans head coach Pete Carroll hired Bates to replace outgoing coach Carl Smith, who had only taken the quarterbacks job two weeks earlier before moving back to the NFL. Smith had replaced Steve Sarkisian, who had taken the head coaching position of the Washington Huskies after serving as both quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator; John Morton had been promoted to offensive coordinator. Bates called plays from the field while Morton worked from the coaches' booth in the press box, similar to a previous arrangement run by the Trojans during the 2005-2006 seasons between Sarkisian and Lane Kiffin, respectively. =Seattle Seahawks= On January 12, 2010, former USC Trojans' head coach Pete Carroll was introduced as the head coach and executive vice- president of the Seattle Seahawks.

Their crew consisted of 150 officers and crewmen.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 143 The main armament of the Mutsuki-class ships consisted of four Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the superstructure, one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of 61-centimeter torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other was between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Four reload torpedoes were provided for the tubes. They carried 18 depth charges and could also carry 16 mines. They could also fitted with minesweeping gear. Kikuzuki was one of six Mutsuki-class ships reconstructed in 1935‚Äì36, with their hulls strengthened, raked caps fitted to the funnels and shields to the torpedo mounts. In 1941‚Äì42, most of those ships were converted into fast transports with No. 2 and No. 3 guns removed. In addition, ten license-built Type 96 light AA guns and at least two Type 93 anti-aircraft machineguns were installed. The minesweeping gear was replaced by four depth charge throwers and the ships now carried a total of 36 depth charges. These changes reduced their speed to and increased their displacement to at normal load.

Gua was the first chimpanzee to be used in a cross-rearing study in the US. Gua was born on November 15, 1930 in Havana, Cuba. She was given, along with her mother, Pati, and her father, Jack, to the old Orange Park, Florida, site of the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, by Pierre Abreu on May 13, 1931 after the death of his mother, Madame Rosalia Abreu. Gua was brought into the Kellogg home at the age of 7 1/2 months, and reared with their son Donald, who was 10 months old at the time. For nine months the Kelloggs raised the two as \\"brother and sister\\", and comprehensively recorded the development of the chimpanzee and the human child. When she was around one year old, Gua often tested ahead of Donald in such tasks as responding to simple commands or using a cup and spoon. Slight differences in their placement included people recognition. Gua recognized people from their clothes and their smell while Donald recognized them by their faces. The parting difference came with language. Donald was about 16 months and Gua was a little over a year old when they had language testing. Gua could not speak, but Donald could form words. On March 28, 1932, nine months into the experiment, the Kelloggs officially ended it as Donald began to copy Gua's sounds. Gua was returned to the primate center with Robert Yerkes in Florida, where she did experimental work with Yerkes' wife Ada. The Kelloggs returned to Indiana. Gua died of pneumonia on December 21, 1933, less than a year after her human \\"stepbrother\\" Donald Agger Kellogg and she were separated. She had just turned 3. Many videos posted on YouTube coming from the archives of Emory University, Wesleyan University, Kellogg University and other institutions continue to memorialize Gua, her short life, and her contribution to psychology.

Composed of members of such influential bands as Born Against, Avail and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, they released two albums and numerous singles on Vermiform and Lookout! Records. An overtly political band, their lyrics ranged from \\"superfluous nods to radical heroes like George Jackson and Carlos the Jackal\\" to \\"describ[ing] the relationship between struggling individuals and the machinery of oppressive politics\\". History The band was formed by three former members of the hardcore punk group Born Against: singer and guitarist Adam Nathanson (also ex-Life's Blood), drummer Brooks Headley (also ex-Universal Order of Armageddon) and harmonica player Neil Burke (also ex-Life's Blood). Burke's tenure was brief, and his departure after the group's debut EP on Vermiform Records was followed by Avail singer Tim Barry joining on bass guitar in 1994. Barry was replaced in 1995 by bassist Marty Key, known as Marty Violence, shortly before the group signed to California-based punk rock label Lookout! Records.

At the beginning of the Pacific War, she served in home waters as the plane guard for those aircraft carriers that were training or working up. In mid-1942, the ship played a minor role in the Battle of Midway and was then assigned to convoy escort duties between Formosa and Japan for the next year. Mikazuki was then transferred to the Solomon Islands in mid-1943 and was destroyed by American bombers after running aground. Design and description The Mutsuki class was an improved version of the s and was the first with triple torpedo tubes. The ships had an overall length of Watts & Gordon, pp. 265‚Äì66 and were between perpendiculars. They had a beam of , and a mean draft of . The Mutsuki-class ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley, p. 191 They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ships at . The ships carried of fuel oil which gave them a range of at . Their crew consisted of 150 officers and crewmen.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 143 The main armament of the Mutsuki- class ships consisted of four Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the superstructure, one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of 61-centimeter torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other was between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Four reload torpedoes were provided for the tubes. They carried 18 depth charges and could also carry 16 mines. They could also fitted with minesweeping gear. Mikazuki was one of six Mutsuki-class ships reconstructed in 1935‚Äì36, with their hulls strengthened, raked caps fitted to the funnels and shields to the torpedo mounts. In 1941‚Äì42, most of those ships were converted into fast transports with No. 2 and No. 3 guns removed. In addition, ten license-built Type 96 light AA guns and at least two Type 93 anti-aircraft machineguns were installed. The minesweeping gear was replaced by four depth charge throwers and the ships now carried a total of 36 depth charges. These changes reduced their speed to and increased their displacement to at normal load. Three more 25 mm guns were added in 1942‚Äì43.Watts & Gordon, p. 267 Construction and career Mikazuki, built at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, was laid down on 21 August 1925, launched on 12 July 1926Chesneau, p. 192 and completed on 5 May 1927. Originally commissioned simply as Destroyer No. 32, the ship was assigned the name Mikazuki on 1 August 1928. In the late 1930s, she participated in combat during the Second Sino-Japanese War, covering the landings of Japanese troops in central and southern China. =Pacific War= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mikazuki was part of Carrier Division 3 under the IJN 1st Fleet, and based in Japanese home waters as escort to the aircraft carriers and . During the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì5 June 1942, Mikazuki sortied as part of the escort for Zuih≈ç with Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç's occupation force, and was thus not involved in combat during that battle.Dull. A Battle History of the Imperial Japanese Navy Afterwards, Mikazuki was reassigned to the Southwest Area Fleet. From July 1942 to March 1943, Mikazuki escorted convoys between Moji, Ky≈´sh≈´ and Taiwan. From the end of March to 10 June 1943, Mikazuki underwent refit at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, after which she was reassigned to Destroyer Division 30 of Desron 3, in the IJN 8th Fleet based out of Rabaul. From the end of June 1943 to July 1943, Mikazuki was used primarily as a Tokyo Express high speed transport to convey troops and supplies to Kolombangara. She participated in the Battle of Kula Gulf on 5‚Äì6 July during which she landed Special Naval Landing Forces under fire. Mikazuki also provided cover during the Battle of Kolombangara on 12 July.Morison. The Struggle for Guadalcanal On 27 July 1943, Mikazuki grounded on a reef while on a troop transport mission to Tuluvu, New Britain .

It is known by the common name angular crab because of its angular carapace. Although it is also called the square crab, its shell is in fact more trapezoidal than square (or rhomboidal, as its scientific name might suggest). This species is also known as the mud- runner because they are able to run away quickly when threatened. Description Goneplax rhomboides is a relatively small (carapace up to ), distinctive-looking crab that ranges from yellowish-white, to orange, to reddish, to vivid pink in colour. It has a smooth, quadrangular, strongly convex carapace that is much broader than it is long. It has long, slender pereiopods with margins of propodus and dactylus bristles. It likewise has setae on its antennae and mouthparts. Females have short chelipeds but the chelipeds of males are long, with the merus portion of the claw considerably longer than the length of their carapaces. G. rhomboides has often been confused with G. clevai, a similar species sharing at least part of its range. Its eyes are on the end of long, retractable eyestalks. Distribution and habitat G. rhomboides is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea from the North Sea to southern Africa and the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa. Waters off Shetland constitute the northern boundary of its range, and in 2008, marine biologists from the University of Gothenburg discovered one intact in the stomach of a cod caught off the coast of Bohusl√§n which suggests that G. rhomboides has now moved into Swedish waters. A similar discovery a few weeks later in the same location reinforces this conclusion. This species inhabits muddy habitats similar to those favoured by the Norway lobster and burrows into inshore muddy sand. Its burrows often interconnect in complex patterns with those inhabited by other species of burrowing megafauna such as Callianassa subterranea, Cepola macrophthalma, Lesueurigobius friesii, and Nephrops norvegicus. These multi-species burrow complexes are very common in some localities. Symbiosis The setae on the antennae, mouthparts and legs of G. rhomboides are home to Triticella flava, a species of Bryozoa (\\"moss animal\\"). The short lifespan of these symbiotic moss animals is synchronized so that they produce larvae just before G. rhomboides moults. These larvae then attach to the crab's newly-emerged exoskeleton.

The song bears a resemblance to the Shaker song \\"Simple Gifts\\" hence the \\"(Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\\" in the title. According to lead vocalist and writer Rivers Cuomo, \\"The Greatest Man\\" has 11 different themes, including rapping and imitations of other bands such as Nirvana and Aerosmith (both of whom also recorded for Weezer's then-label Geffen Records at one point). This song received favorable reviews. After being announced as the third single, a music video was also announced; however, this never materialized and instead the song was featured in a film directed by Warren Miller. Recording and inspiration Rick Rubin produced \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\\" with the band between April 2007 and February 2008.Weezer (The Red Album) Deluxe Edition album notes. In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of The Red Album, Cuomo stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle \\"Variations on a Shaker Hymn\\", but when guitarist Brian Bell's mother came into the studio to see them, she mentioned that the melody from the song sounded similar to a Shaker hymn that the choir sang in her church. Cuomo wrote that he realised that people might notice the resemblance: \\"I knew people were going to come at us after and say 'Hey, you guys ripped off that hymn.' So I put the credit in there off the bat.\\" As a result, the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's \\"Simple Gifts\\" that they credited the hymn with the subtitle. The song was originally recorded in a room that the band nicknamed \\"The War Room.\\" Bell states that \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\\" took a long time to record; \\"I think the song 'The Greatest Man That Ever Lived' used about 20 feet of butcher paper and we discussed how we were going to successfully record it almost as long as actually recording it.\\" In an interview with KROQ-FM, Rivers Cuomo talked extensively about the concept behind the song. The song was originally titled \\"The Ballad of Oswaldo S√°nchez\\", inspired by S√°nchez playing in the 2006 World Cup after the death of his father. He mentioned the influence for each section, including the Baroque counterpoint vocal style which inspired the final 'Bach' & 'Beethoven' sections. In a January 21, 2009, interview on the NPR program Fresh Air, Cuomo stated that \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\\" is his favorite Weezer song. Composition The song includes piano, police sirens, and Rivers Cuomo singing in falsetto, and it contains 11 segued verses in total. In an interview with Rolling Stone Cuomo, when questioned about how practising VipassanƒÅ affects his music, says that the song is a lot different from any song he has previously written: \\"It's the most ambitious song I've ever attempted. It took me a few weeks of writing. And lyrically, it's a huge departure for me. I have a long history of writing songs from a victim type of place, and in this, I'm bragging.\\" In order, the themes are: # Rap 0:35 # Slipknot 1:00 # Jeff Buckley 1:26 # Choral 1:51 # Aerosmith 2:17 # Nirvana 2:43 # The Andrews Sisters 3:08 # Green Day 3:33 # Spoken word (heavily inspired by Elvis' \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\") 4:06 # Bach 4:37, Beethoven 4:54 # Weezer 5:10 Critical reception \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\\" was released in digital form on May 13, 2008. The song was generally well received by critics. Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe called the song \\"A sprawling folk-metal chorale that squashes wildly assorted references into epic musical settings.\\" IGN called it a \\"Schizophrenic, six-minute roller-coaster of 10 movements,\\" but did not expect the song to be a single: \\"I don't hear a single, but it's certainly the most curious song to leak from Cuomo's pen, and it is the runaway star of an equally spastic album.\\" It was also one of five songs on the album to be considered \\"download worthy\\" by IGN. Although Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media was critical of the album as a whole, he praised \\"The Greatest Man\\", calling it \\"[T]he warped genius let loose.\\" NME's James McMahon likened it to \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" by the English rock band Electric Light Orchestra, writing \\"[It] is without question the most ambitious song Cuomo has ever penned, cramming a rapped intro, barber-shop harmonies and ornate music box twinkling into a six- minute geek-pop rewrite of ELO's Mr Blue Sky.'\\" Not all reviews were entirely positive. Jeffrey Canino of Tiny Mix Tapes criticized the introductory rap section of the song, \\"[It] brings forth an unpleasant memory of Fred Durst. All throughout, the band is experimenting with disparaging sounds, and the only thing that ties them together is Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee's glossy production.\\" Despite this, Canino still rates the song highly, \\"The bulk of the middle portion is really pretty okay, so we'll concede this one as a success.\\" Similarly, Ira Robbins and Pete Crigler of TrouserPress.com said, \\"Despite that success, rap is not an advisable direction for Weezer.\\" Alan Shulman of No Ripcord commented that the song did not have much lasting appeal: \\"The novelty begins to wear after the 4th or 5th listen,\\" and Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly labelled the song a \\"Bombastic mini-rock opera\\" but also said the \\"remedial rhymes\\" marred an \\"otherwise intriguing musical experiment.\\" Music video and appearances in other media This song had been announced as the third single from The Red Album. Spike Jonze was said to be directing a video for the song. In the end, the video was not filmed and instead skiing and snowboarding film director Warren Miller used the song in a film called Children of Winter. The Weezer blog stated that it should not be considered official: \\"Note that while this [isn't] 'THE' music video for 'Greatest Man' - it's 'a' music video - [it's] nonetheless very cool indeed!\\" However, Weezer did film a video for the song through MTV, when they were selected as the MTV Artist of the Week. The video has the band sitting on a park bench lip syncing to their song playing through a boom box. Professional wrestler Austin Aries adopted the song as his ring entrance music, while also beginning to refer to himself as \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\\". The song was released as a downloadable song for the game Rock Band on June 26, 2008, along with \\"Dreamin'\\" and \\"Troublemaker\\".

An audio engineer (also known as a sound engineer or recording engineer) helps to produce a recording or a live performance, balancing and adjusting sound sources using equalization and audio effects, mixing, reproduction, and reinforcement of sound. Audio engineers work on the \\"...technical aspect of recording‚Äîthe placing of microphones, pre-amp knobs, the setting of levels. The physical recording of any project is done by an engineer ... the nuts and bolts.\\" It's a creative hobby and profession where musical instruments and technology are used to produce sound for film, radio, television, music, and video games. Audio engineers also set up, sound check and do live sound mixing using a mixing console and a sound reinforcement system for music concerts, theatre, sports games and corporate events. Alternatively, audio engineer can refer to a scientist or professional engineer who holds an engineering degree and who designs, develops and builds audio or musical technology working under terms such as acoustical engineering, electronic/electrical engineering or (musical) signal processing. Research and development Research and development audio engineers invent new technologies, equipment and techniques, to enhance the process and art of audio engineering.Daley, Dan, \\"The Engineers Who Changed Recording: Fathers Of Invention\\", Sound on Sound magazine, October 2004 They might design acoustical simulations of rooms, shape algorithms for audio signal processing, specify the requirements for public address systems, carry out research on audible sound for video game console manufacturers, and other advanced fields of audio engineering. They might also be referred to as acoustic engineers. =Education= Audio engineers working in research and development may come from backgrounds such as acoustics, computer science, broadcast engineering, physics, acoustical engineering, electrical engineering and electronics. Audio engineering courses at university or college fall into two rough categories: (i) training in the creative use of audio as a sound engineer, and (ii) training in science or engineering topics, which then allows students to apply these concepts while pursuing a career developing audio technologies. Audio training courses provide knowledge of technologies and their application to recording studios and sound reinforcement systems, but do not have sufficient mathematical and scientific content to allow someone to obtain employment in research and development in the audio and acoustic industry. Roger Nichols at a vintage Neve recording console. Audio engineers in research and development usually possess a bachelor's degree, master's degree or higher qualification in acoustics, physics, computer science or another engineering discipline. They might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in architectural acoustics. Alternatively they might work in audio companies (e.g. headphone manufacturer), or other industries that need audio expertise (e.g., automobile manufacturer), or carry out research in a university. Some positions, such as faculty (academic staff) require a Doctor of Philosophy. In Germany a Toningenieur is an audio engineer who designs, builds and repairs audio systems. =Sub-disciplines= The listed subdisciplines are based on PACS (Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme) coding used by the Acoustical Society of America with some revision. Audio signal processing Audio engineers develop audio signal processing algorithms to allow the electronic manipulation of audio signals. These can be processed at the heart of much audio production such as reverberation, Auto-Tune or perceptual coding (e.g. MP3 or Opus). Alternatively, the algorithms might perform echo cancellation, or identify and categorize audio content through music information retrieval or acoustic fingerprint. Architectural acoustics Acoustic diffusing mushrooms hanging from the roof of the Royal Albert Hall. Architectural acoustics is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a room. For audio engineers, architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a stadium or enhancing the quality of music in a theatre. Architectural Acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants. Electroacoustics The Pyramid Stage Electroacoustics is concerned with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound reproduction systems and recording technologies. Examples of electroacoustic design include portable electronic devices (e.g. mobile phones, portable media players, and tablet computers), sound systems in architectural acoustics, surround sound and wave field synthesis in movie theater and vehicle audio. Musical acoustics Musical acoustics is concerned with researching and describing the science of music. In audio engineering, this includes the design of electronic instruments such as synthesizers; the human voice (the physics and neurophysiology of singing); physical modeling of musical instruments; room acoustics of concert venues; music information retrieval; music therapy, and the perception and cognition of music. Psychoacoustics Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of how humans respond to what they hear. At the heart of audio engineering are listeners who are the final arbitrator as to whether an audio design is successful, such as whether a binaural recording sounds immersive. Speech The production, computer processing and perception of speech is an important part of audio engineering. Ensuring speech is transmitted intelligibly, efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through mobile telephone systems are important areas of study. Practitioner Live sound mixing At the front of house position, mixing sound for a band A variety of terms are used to describe audio engineers who install or operate sound recording, sound reinforcement, or sound broadcasting equipment, including large and small format consoles. Terms such as \\"audio technician,\\" \\"sound technician,\\" \\"audio engineer,\\" \\"audio technologist,\\" \\"recording engineer,\\" \\"sound mixer,\\" \\"mixing engineer\\" and \\"sound engineer\\" can be ambiguous; depending on the context they may be synonymous, or they may refer to different roles in audio production. Such terms can refer to a person working in sound and music production; for instance, a \\"sound engineer\\" or \\"recording engineer\\" is commonly listed in the credits of commercial music recordings (as well as in other productions that include sound, such as movies). These titles can also refer to technicians who maintain professional audio equipment. Certain jurisdictions specifically prohibit the use of the title engineer to any individual not a registered member of a professional engineering licensing body. In the recording studio environment, a sound engineer records, edits, manipulates, mixes, or masters sound by technical means to realize the creative vision of the artist and record producer. While usually associated with music production, an audio engineer deals with sound for a wide range of applications, including post- production for video and film, live sound reinforcement, advertising, multimedia, and broadcasting. In larger productions, an audio engineer is responsible for the technical aspects of a sound recording or other audio production, and works together with a record producer or director, although the engineer's role may also be integrated with that of the producer. In smaller productions and studios the sound engineer and producer are often the same person. In typical sound reinforcement applications, audio engineers often assume the role of producer, making artistic and technical decisions, and sometimes even scheduling and budget decisions.Huber, D.M. (1995). Modern Recording Techniques. (5th ed.). Burlington, MA: Focal Press In German, the \\"Tontechniker\\" (audio technician) is the one who operates the audio equipment and the \\"Tonmeister\\" (sound master) is a person who creates recordings or broadcasts of music, who is both deeply musically trained (in classical and non-classical genres), and who also has a detailed theoretical and practical knowledge of virtually all aspects of sound. TV Audio engineer =Education and training= Audio engineers come from backgrounds or postsecondary training in fields such as audio, fine arts, broadcasting, music, or electrical engineering. Training in audio engineering and sound recording is offered by colleges and universities. Some audio engineers are autodidacts with no formal training, but who have attained professional skills in audio through extensive on-the-job experience. Audio engineers must have extensive knowledge of audio engineering principles and techniques. For instance, they must understand how audio signals travel, which equipment to use and when, how to mic different instruments and amplifiers, which microphones to use and how to position them to get the best quality recordings. In addition to technical knowledge, an audio engineer must have the ability to problem solve quickly. The best audio engineers also have a high degree of creativity that allow them to stand out amongst their peers. In the music realm, an audio engineer must also understand the types of sounds and tones that are expected in musical ensembles across different genres - rock and pop music for example. This knowledge of musical style is typically learned from years of experience listening to and mixing music in recording or live sound contexts. For education and training, there are audio engineering schools all over the world. In North America, the most notable being Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, United States, and OIART (The Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology) in London, Canada. =Role of women= According to Women's Audio Mission (WAM), a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco dedicated to the advancement of women in music production and the recording arts, less than 5% of the people working in the field of sound and media are women. \\"Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the Grammys\\" and none won either award. According to Susan Rogers, audio engineer and professor at Berklee College of Music, women interested in becoming an audio engineer face \\"a boys' club, or a guild mentality\\". The UK \\"Music Producers' Guild says less than 4% of its members are women\\" and at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, \\"...only 6% of the students enrolled on its sound technology course are female.\\" Women's Audio Mission was started in 2003 to address the lack of women in professional audio by training over 6,000 women and girls in the recording arts and is the only professional recording studio built and run by women. Notable recording projects include the Grammy Award-winning Kronos Quartet, Angelique Kidjo (2014 Grammy winner), author Salman Rushdie, the Academy Award-nominated soundtrack to ‚ÄúDirty Wars‚Äù, Van-Ahn Vo (NPR's top 50 albums of 2013), Grammy-nominated St. Lawrence Quartet, and world music artists Tanya Tagaq and Wu Man. One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own rock and roll music label was Cordell Jackson (1923-2004). Trina Shoemaker is a mixer, record producer and sound engineer who became the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album in 1998 for her work on The Globe Sessions. Gail Davies was the '...first female producer in country music, delivering a string of Top 10 hits in the '70s and '80s including \\"Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You,\\" \\"Blue Heartache\\" and \\"I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me).\\" When she moved to Nashville in 1976, men \\"...didn't want to work for a woman\\" and she was told women in the city were \\"...still barefoot, pregnant and [singing] in the vocal booth.\\" When Jonell Polansky arrived in Nashville in 1994, with a degree in electrical engineering and recording experience in the Bay Area, she was told \\"...[y]ou're a woman, and we already had one\\"‚Äìa reference to Wendy Waldman. KK Proffitt, a studio \\"owner and chief engineer\\", states that men in Nashville do not want to have women in the recording booth. At a meeting of the Audio Engineering Society, Proffitt was told to \\"shut up\\" by a male producer when she raised the issue of updating studio recording technologies. Proffitt said she finds \\"...finds sexism rampant in the industry\\". Other notable women include: *Sylvia Robinson, early hip hop music producer *Susan Rogers, engineer for Purple Rain *Genya Ravan, producer The Dead Boys' Young, Loud and Snotty; *Delia Derbyshire, British electronics pioneer *Lari White, a co-producer on Toby Keith's White Trash With Money *Leslie Ann Jones =Sub-disciplines= There are four distinct steps to commercial production of a recording: recording, editing, mixing, and mastering. Typically, each is performed by a sound engineer who specializes only in that part of production. *Studio engineer ‚Äì an engineer working within a studio facility, either with a producer or independently. *Recording engineer ‚Äì engineer who records sound. *Assistant engineer ‚Äì often employed in larger studios, allowing them to train to become full-time engineers. They often assist full-time engineers with microphone setups, session breakdowns and in some cases, rough mixes. *Mixing engineer ‚Äì a person who creates mixes of multi-track recordings. It is common to record a commercial record at one studio and have it mixed by different engineers in other studios. *Mastering engineer ‚Äì the person who masters the final mixed stereo tracks (or sometimes a series of audio stems, which consists in a mix of the main sections) that the mix engineer produces. The mastering engineer makes any final adjustments to the overall sound of the record in the final step before commercial duplication. Mastering engineers use principles of equalization, compression and limiting to fine-tune the sound timbre and dynamics and to achieve a louder recording. * Audio/sound designer ‚Äì broadly an artist who produces sound tracks or sound effects content for media. *Live sound engineer Front of House (FOH) engineer, or A1.\\"Front of House (FOH) Engineer\\", Get in Media Entertainment Careers ‚Äì a person dealing with live sound reinforcement.

The term \\"foldback\\" comes from the old practice of \\"folding back\\" audio signals from the front of house (FOH) mixing console to the stage so musicians can hear themselves while performing. Monitor engineers usually have a separate audio system from the FOH engineer and manipulate audio signals independently from what the audience hears so they can satisfy the requirements of each performer on stage. In-ear systems, digital and analog mixing consoles, and a variety of speaker enclosures are typically used by monitor engineers. In addition most monitor engineers must be familiar with wireless or RF (radio-frequency) equipment and must communicate personally with the artist(s) during each performance. Systems engineer ‚Äì responsible for the design setup of modern PA systems, which are often very complex. A systems engineer is usually also referred to as a \\"crew chief\\" on tour and is responsible for the performance and day-to-day job requirements of the audio crew as a whole along with the FOH audio system. This is a sound-only position concerned with implementation, not to be confused with the interdisciplinary field of system engineering, which typically requires a college degree. *Re-recording mixer ‚Äì a person in post-production who mixes audio tracks for feature films or television programs. Equipment Correcting a room's frequency response. An audio engineer is proficient with different types of recording media, such as analog tape, digital multi-track recorders and workstations, and computer knowledge. With the advent of the digital age, it is increasingly important for the audio engineer to understand software and hardware integration, from synchronization to analog to digital transfers.

Ray was convicted in 1969 after entering a guilty plea‚Äîthus forgoing a jury trial and the possibility of a death sentence‚Äîand was sentenced to 99 years' imprisonment. At the time of his death, he had served 29 years of his sentence. Early life and education Ray was born on March 10, 1928, in Alton, Illinois, the son of Lucille Ray (n√©e Maher) and George Ellis Ray. He had Irish, Scottish and Welsh ancestry and had a Catholic upbringing. In February 1935, Ray's father, known by the nickname Speedy, passed a bad check in Alton, Illinois, and then moved to Ewing, Missouri, where the family changed their name to Raynes to avoid law enforcement.Gerald Posner, Killing The Dream 1998 Ray was the firstborn of nine children, including John Larry Ray, Franklin Ray, Jerry William Ray, Melba Ray, Carol Ray Pepper, Suzan Ray, and Marjorie Ray. His sister Marjorie died in a fire as a young child. Ray left school at the age of fifteen. He later joined the U.S. Army at the close of World War II and served in Germany. Ray struggled to adapt to military life and was eventually discharged for ineptitude and lack of adaptability in 1948.biography.com Initial convictions and first escape from prison Ray committed a variety of crimes prior to the murder of King. Ray's first conviction for criminal activity, a burglary in California, came in 1949. In 1952, he served two years for the armed robbery of a taxi driver in Illinois. In 1955, Ray was convicted of mail fraud after stealing money orders in Hannibal, Missouri, then forging them to take a trip to Florida. He served four years in Leavenworth. In 1959, Ray was caught stealing $120 in an armed robbery of a St. Louis Kroger store. Ray was sentenced to twenty years in prison for repeated offenses. He escaped from the Missouri State Penitentiary in 1967 by hiding in a truck transporting bread from the prison bakery. Activity in 1967 Following his escape, Ray stayed on the move throughout the United States and Canada, going first to St. Louis and then onwards to Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and Birmingham, Alabama, where he stayed long enough to buy a 1966 Ford Mustang and get an Alabama driver's license. He then drove to Mexico, stopping in Acapulco before settling down in Puerto Vallarta on October 19, 1967. While in Mexico, Ray, using the alias Eric Starvo Galt, attempted to establish himself as a pornographic film director. Using mail-ordered equipment, he filmed and photographed local prostitutes. Frustrated with his results and jilted by the prostitute with whom he had formed a relationship, Ray left Mexico on or around November 16, 1967. Ray returned to the United States, arriving in Los Angeles on November 19, 1967. While in Los Angeles, Ray attended a local bartending school and took dance lessons. His chief interest, however, was the George Wallace presidential campaign. Ray was a racist and was quickly drawn to Wallace's segregationist platform. He spent much of his time in Los Angeles volunteering at the Wallace campaign headquarters in North Hollywood. He considered emigrating to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where a predominantly white minority regime had unilaterally assumed independence from the United Kingdom in 1965. The notion of living in Rhodesia continued to appeal to Ray for several years afterwards, and it was his intended destination after King's assassination. The Rhodesian government expressed its disapproval. Activity in early 1968 On March 5, 1968, Ray underwent a facial reconstruction (rhinoplasty), performed by physician Russell Hadley. On March 18, 1968, Ray left Los Angeles and began a cross-country drive to Atlanta, Georgia. Arriving in Atlanta on March 24, 1968, Ray checked into a rooming house. He bought a map of the city. FBI agents later found this map when they searched the room in which he was staying in Atlanta. On the map, the locations of the church and residence of Martin Luther King Jr. were circled. Ray was soon on the road again and drove his Mustang to Birmingham, Alabama. There, on March 30, 1968, he bought a Remington Model 760 Gamemaster .30-06-caliber rifle and a box of 20 cartridges from the Aeromarine Supply Company. He also bought a Redfield 2x-7x scope, which he had mounted to the rifle. He told the shopkeepers that he was going on a hunting trip with his brother. Ray had continued using the Galt alias after his stint in Mexico, but when he made this purchase, he gave his name as Harvey Lowmeyer. After purchasing the rifle and accessories, Ray drove back to Atlanta. An avid newspaper reader, Ray passed his time reading the Atlanta Constitution. The paper reported King's planned return trip to Memphis, Tennessee, which was scheduled for April 1, 1968. On April 2, 1968, Ray packed a bag and drove to Memphis. Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. FBI most wanted fugitive poster of James Earl Ray The Lorraine Motel, now known as the National Civil Rights Museum, where King was assassinated On April 4, 1968, Ray killed King with a single shot fired from his Remington rifle, while King was standing on the second-floor balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. Shortly after the shot was fired, witnesses saw Ray fleeing from a rooming house across the street from the motel; he had been renting a room in the house at the time. A package was abandoned close to the site that included a rifle and binocular, both found with Ray's fingerprints. =Apprehension and plea= Ray fled to Atlanta in his white Ford Mustang, driving eleven hours. He picked up his belongings and fled north to Canada, arriving in Toronto three days later, where he hid for over a month and acquired a Canadian passport under the false name of Ramon George Sneyd. He left Toronto in late May on a flight to England. He stayed briefly in Lisbon, Portugal, and returned to London. On June 8, 1968, two months after King's death, Ray was arrested at London Heathrow Airport attempting to leave the United Kingdom for Brussels on a false Canadian passport. He was trying to depart the United Kingdom for Angola, Rhodesia, or apartheid South Africa on a false Canadian passport in the name of Ramon George Sneyd. At check-in, the ticket agent noticed the name on his passport, Sneyd, was on a Royal Canadian Mounted Police watchlist. At the airport, officials noticed that Ray carried another passport under a second name. The UK quickly extradited Ray to Tennessee, where he was charged with King's murder. He confessed to the crime on March 10, 1969, his 41st birthday, and after pleading guilty he was sentenced to 99 years in prison. =Recanting of confession= Three days later, he recanted his confession. Ray had entered a guilty plea on the advice of his attorney, Percy Foreman, in an effort to avoid the sentence of death by electrocution, which would have been a possible outcome of a jury trial. Unbeknownst to Ray, however, under the ‚Äò‚Äôde facto‚Äô‚Äô moratorium in place since 1967 and the following ‚Äò‚ÄôFurman v. Georgia‚Äô‚Äô, a death sentence would have been commuted as unconstitutional. Ray fired Foreman as his attorney and derisively called him \\"Percy Fourflusher\\" thereafter. Ray began claiming that a man he had met in Montreal back in 1967, who used the alias \\"Raul,\\" had been deeply involved. Instead, he asserted that he did not \\"personally shoot Dr. King,\\" but may have been \\"partially responsible without knowing it,\\" hinting at a conspiracy. Ray told this version of King's assassination and his own flight in the two months afterward to journalist William Bradford Huie. Huie investigated this story and discovered that Ray lied about some details. Ray told Huie that he purposefully left the rifle with his fingerprints on it in plain sight because he wanted to become a famous criminal. Ray was convinced that he would not be caught because he was so smart. Ray believed that Governor of Alabama George Wallace would soon be elected president and that he would only be confined for a short time. Ray spent the remainder of his life unsuccessfully attempting to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a trial. Escape from prison On June 10, 1977, Ray and six other convicts escaped from Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros, Tennessee. They were recaptured on June 13. A year was added to Ray's previous sentence, increasing it to 100 years. While serving time in the early 1980s at the Tennessee State Prison in Nashville, Ray asked to be interviewed by the news media on the anniversary of King's death. Dick Baumbach, the Tennessee Department of Corrections public information officer, coordinated the yearly interviews with local, state and national news media. Conspiracy allegations Ray had hired Jack Kershaw as his attorney, who promoted Ray's claim that he was not responsible for the shooting. His claim is that it was said to have been the result of a conspiracy of the otherwise unidentified man named \\"Raul.\\" Kershaw and his client met with representatives of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations and convinced the committee to conduct ballistics tests‚Äîwhich ultimately proved inconclusive‚Äîthat they felt would show that Ray had not fired the fatal shot. Kershaw claimed the escape was additional proof that Ray had been involved in a conspiracy that had provided him with the outside assistance he would have needed to break out of prison. Kershaw convinced Ray to take a polygraph test as part of an interview with Playboy. The magazine said that the test results showed \\"that Ray did, in fact, kill Martin Luther King Jr. and that he did so alone.\\" Ray fired Kershaw after discovering the attorney had been paid $11,000 by the magazine in exchange for the interview and instead hired attorney Mark Lane to provide him with legal representation. =Mock trial and civil suit= In 1997, King's son Dexter had a meeting with Ray and asked him, \\"I just want to ask you, for the record, did you kill my father?\\" Ray replied, \\"No. No I didn't,\\" and King told Ray that he, along with the King family, believed him; the King family also urged that Ray be granted a new trial.John Ray (brother of James Earl) on Fox at YouTubeToday in History March 27 at YouTube William Pepper, a friend of King in the last year of his life, represented Ray in a mock trial televised by HBO in an attempt to grant him the trial he never received. In the mock trial, the prosecutor was Hickman Ewing. The mock trial jury acquitted Ray. In November 1999, Pepper represented the King family in a wrongful death civil trial against Loyd Jowers. Jowers, a restaurant owner in Memphis, was brought to civil court in December 1999 and sued for being part of a conspiracy to murder Martin Luther King Jr. He was found legally liable, and the King family accepted $100 in restitution, an amount chosen to show that they were not pursuing the case for financial gain. The jury, concluding on December 8, found that Loyd Jowers as well as others, including governmental agencies, had been part of a conspiracy. The King family concluded that Ray did not have anything to do with the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. Coretta Scott King said, \\"The jury was clearly convinced by the extensive evidence that was presented during the trial that, in addition to Mr. Jowers, the conspiracy of the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame.\\" Prompted by the King family's acceptance of some of the claims of conspiracy, United States Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new investigation on August 26, 1998. On June 9, 2000, the United States Department of Justice released a 150-page report rejecting allegations that there was a conspiracy to assassinate King, including the findings of the Memphis civil court jury. Death Prior to his death, Ray was transferred to the Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility in Nashville, a maximum security prison with hospital facilities. Ray died at age 70 on April 23, 1998, at the Columbia Nashville Memorial Hospital from complications related to kidney disease and liver failure caused by hepatitis C. His brother, Jerry, told CNN that his brother did not want to be buried or have his final resting place in the United States because of \\"the way the government has treated him.\\" The body was cremated and his ashes were flown to Ireland, the home of his maternal family's ancestors.

After completing his studies, he taught history and philosophy in some high schools, and later became a professor of Institutions of Public Law at the University of Ferrara. The didactic activity was alternated with that of journalist and author of historical and legal publications. Preti did not hide his socialist ideas and when, in 1941, he was called to arms, he was denounced to the military court for \\"lese majesty, defeatism and insubordination\\". Held in a military prison awaiting trial, he managed to escape the death sentence, thanks to the fall of the regime and the subsequent armistice.

He was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died at 7:05 p.m. He was a prominent leader of the civil rights movement and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was known for his use of nonviolence and civil disobedience. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was arrested on June 8, 1968, at London's Heathrow Airport, extradited to the United States, and charged with the crime. On March 10, 1969, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in the Tennessee State Penitentiary. He later made many attempts to withdraw his guilty plea and to be tried by a jury, but was unsuccessful. Ray died in prison in 1998. The King family and others believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy involving the U.S. government, the mafia and Memphis police, as alleged by Loyd Jowers in 1993. They believe that Ray was a scapegoat. In 1999, the family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Jowers for the sum of $10 million. During closing arguments, their attorney asked the jury to award damages of $100, to make the point that \\"it was not about the money.\\" During the trial, both sides presented evidence alleging a government conspiracy. The accused government agencies could not defend themselves or respond because they were not named as defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury concluded that Jowers and others were \\"part of a conspiracy to kill King\\" and awarded the family $100. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000 because of the lack of evidence. Background =King on death= As early as the mid-1950s, King had received death threats because of his prominence in the civil rights movement. He had confronted the risk of death, including a nearly fatal stabbing in 1958, and made its recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, King told his wife, Coretta Scott King, \\"This is what is going to happen to me also. I keep telling you, this is a sick society.\\"(via Google News) =Memphis= King traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking African American city sanitation workers. The workers had staged a walkout on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions imposed by mayor Henry Loeb. At the time, Memphis paid black workers significantly lower wages than it did white workers. There were no city-issued uniforms, no restrooms, no recognized union, and no grievance procedure for the numerous occasions on which they were underpaid. During Loeb's tenure as mayor, conditions did not significantly improve, and the gruesome February 1968 deaths of two workers in a garbage-compacting truck turned mounting tensions into a strike. King participated in a massive march in Memphis on March 28, 1968, which ended in violence. On April 3, King returned to Memphis to attempt a successful new march later that week. His airline flight to Memphis was delayed by a bomb threat, but he arrived in time to make a planned speech to a gathering at the Mason Temple (world headquarters of the Church of God in Christ). At the Mason Temple, King delivered his famous \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\" speech. In it, he recalled his 1958 attempted assassination, noting that the doctor who treated him had said that because the knife used to stab him was so close to his aorta, any sudden movement, even a sneeze, might have killed him.Alexandra S. Levine, \\"New York Today: If Martin Luther King Had Sneezed\\", New York Times, January 12, 2017. Accessed August 11, 2018. He referred to a letter written by a young girl who told him that she was happy that he had not sneezed. He used that reference to say: King repeated the phrase \\"If I had sneezed\\" several more times, recalling numerous other events and acts of civil disobedience from the previous several years: the Albany Movement (1962), the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and the Selma to Montgomery March (1965).The King Encyclopedia, \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\", The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford). Accessed August 11, 2018. As he neared the close, he prophetically referred to the bomb threat: Assassination On Thursday, April 4, 1968, King was staying in room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. The motel was owned by businessman Walter Bailey and was named after his wife. Reverend Ralph Abernathy, a colleague and friend, later told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that he and King had stayed in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel so often that it was known as the \\"King‚ÄìAbernathy Suite\\". According to biographer Taylor Branch, King's last words were to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at a planned event. King said, \\"Ben, make sure you play 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\\" According to Rev. Samuel Kyles, who was standing several feet away, King was leaning over the balcony railing in front of Room 306 and was speaking with Rev. Jesse Jackson when the shot rang out. King was struck in the face at 6:01 p.m. by a single .30-06 bullet fired from a Remington Model 760 rifle. The bullet entered through King's right cheek, breaking his jaw and several vertebrae as it traveled down his spinal cord, severing his jugular vein and major arteries in the process, before lodging in his shoulder. The force of the shot ripped King's necktie off. King fell backward onto the balcony, unconscious. Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the deck, bleeding profusely from the wound in his cheek. Jesse Jackson stated after the shooting that he cradled King's head as King lay on the balcony, but this account was disputed by other colleagues of King; Jackson later changed his statement to say that he had \\"reached out\\" for King. Andrew Young, a colleague from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, first believed King was dead, but found he still had a pulse. King was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where doctors opened his chest and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He never regained consciousness and died at 7:05 p.m. According to Branch, King's autopsy revealed that his heart was in the condition of a 60-year-old man rather than that of a 39-year-old such as King, which Branch attributed to the stress of King's 13 years in the civil rights movement. Shortly after the shot was fired, witnesses saw a man, later believed to be James Earl Ray, fleeing from a rooming house across the street from the Lorraine Motel. Ray had been renting a room in the boarding house. Police found a package dumped close to the site that included a rifle and binoculars, both with Ray's fingerprints. Ray had purchased the rifle under an alias six days earlier. A worldwide manhunt was triggered that culminated in Ray's arrest at London's Heathrow Airport two months later. On March 10, 1969, he pleaded guilty to the first degree murder of Martin Luther King Jr., which was later recanted.

Responses =Coretta Scott King= King's widow Coretta had difficulty informing her children that their father was dead. She received a large number of telegrams, including one from Lee Harvey Oswald's mother that she regarded as the one that had touched her the most. =Within the movement= Demonstrator with sign saying \\"Let not his death be in vain\\", in front of the White House, after the assassination of Martin Luther King. For some, King's assassination meant the end of the strategy of nonviolence. Others in the movement reaffirmed the need to carry on King's and the movement's work. Leaders within the SCLC confirmed that they would carry on the Poor People's Campaign that year despite the loss of King. Some black leaders argued the need to continue King's and the movement's tradition of nonviolence. =Robert F. Kennedy speech= During the day of the assassination while on the campaign trail for the Democratic presidential nomination in Indiana, Senator Robert F. Kennedy learned of the shooting before boarding a plane to Indianapolis. Kennedy was scheduled to make a speech there in a predominantly black neighborhood. Kennedy did not learn that King had died until he landed in Indianapolis. Kennedy's press secretary, Frank Mankiewicz, suggested that he ask the audience to pray for the King family and to follow King's practice of nonviolence. Mankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted notes for Kennedy's use, but he refused them, using some that he had likely written during the ride to the site of the speech. The Indianapolis chief of police advised Kennedy that he could not provide him protection and was worried that he would be at risk when talking about King's death before the predominantly black crowd.Scarborough Country However, Kennedy decided to proceed. Standing on a flatbed truck, he spoke for four minutes and 57 seconds. Kennedy was the first to tell the audience that King had died. Some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: \\"For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\\" These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to \\"go beyond these rather difficult times\\" and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus: \\"Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\\" In conclusion, he said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, again quoting the Greeks. Kennedy's speech was credited with assisting in the prevention of post-assassination rioting in Indianapolis on a night when such events broke out in major cities across the country.Statement of Mayor Bart Peterson April 4, 2006, press release It is widely considered one of the greatest speeches in American history. Kennedy canceled all of his scheduled campaign appearances and withdrew to his hotel room. Several phone conversations with black community leaders convinced him to speak out against the violent backlash beginning to emerge across the country. The next day, Kennedy gave a prepared response, \\"On the Mindless Menace of Violence\\", in Cleveland, Ohio. Although still considered significant, it is given much less historical attention than is the Indianapolis speech. =President Lyndon B. Johnson= President Lyndon B. Johnson was in the Oval Office that evening, planning a meeting in Hawaii with Vietnam War military commanders. After press secretary George Christian informed him at 8:20 p.m. of the assassination, he canceled the trip to focus on the nation. He assigned Attorney General Ramsey Clark to investigate the assassination in Memphis. He made a personal call to King's wife, Coretta Scott King, and declared April 7 a national day of mourning on which the U.S. flag would be flown at half-staff. =Riots= Destruction after the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots. Colleagues of King in the civil rights movement called for a nonviolent response to the assassination to honor his most deeply held beliefs. James Farmer Jr. said: However, the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for forceful action, saying: Despite the urging for calm by many leaders, a nationwide wave of riots erupted in more than 100 cities. After the assassination, the city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on favorable terms to the sanitation workers. =Reactions= Garment workers listen to King's funeral service on a portable radio (April 9, 1968). On April 8, King's widow Coretta Scott King and her four young children led a crowd estimated at 40,000 in a silent march through the streets of Memphis to honor Dr. King and support the cause of the city's black sanitation workers. The next day, funeral rites were held in King's hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. The service at Ebenezer Baptist Church was nationally televised, as were other events. A funeral procession transported King's body for through the streets of Atlanta, followed by more than 100,000 mourners, from the church to his alma mater, Morehouse College. A second service was held there before the burial.\\"Dr. King's Assassination: Background\\", Civil Rights Digital Library, Digital Library of Georgia, 2013 In the wake of King's assassination, journalists reported some callous or hostile reactions from parts of white America, particularly in the South. David Halberstam, who reported on King's funeral, recounted a comment heard at an affluent white dinner party: Reporters recounted that many whites were also grief-stricken at the leader's death. In some cases, the shock of events altered opinions. A survey later sent to a group of college trustees revealed that their opinions of King had risen after his assassination. The New York Times praised King in an editorial, calling his murder a \\"national disaster\\" and his cause \\"just.\\" Public figures generally praised King in the days following his death. Others expressed political ideology. Governor George Wallace of Alabama, known as a segregationist, described the assassination as a \\"senseless, regrettable act.\\" But Governor Lester Maddox of Georgia called King \\"an enemy of our country\\" and threatened to \\"personally raise\\" the state capitol flag back from half- staff. California Governor Ronald Reagan described the assassination as \\"a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.\\" South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond wrote to his constituents: \\"We are now witnessing the whirlwind sowed years ago when some preachers and teachers began telling people that each man could be his own judge in his own case.\\" FBI investigation The Federal Bureau of Investigation was assigned the lead to investigate King's death. J. Edgar Hoover, who had previously made efforts to undermine King's reputation, told President Johnson that his agency would attempt to find the culprit(s). Many documents related to the investigation remain classified and are slated to remain secret until 2027. In 2010, as in earlier years, some argued for passage of a proposed Records Collection Act, similar to a 1992 law concerning the Kennedy assassination, to require the immediate release of the records. The measure did not pass. Funeral A crowd of 300,000 attended King's funeral on April 9. Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended on behalf of Johnson, who was at a meeting on the Vietnam War at Camp David; there were fears that Johnson might be hit with protests and abuse over the war if he attended the funeral. At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church was played at the funeral; it was a recording of his \\"Drum Major\\" sermon given on February 4, 1968. In that sermon, he asked that, at his funeral, no mention of his awards and honors be made, but that it be said he tried to \\"feed the hungry\\", \\"clothe the naked\\", \\"be right on the [Vietnam] war question\\", and \\"love and serve humanity.\\" Perpetrator =Capture and guilty plea= The FBI investigation found fingerprints on various objects left in the bathroom from which the gunfire had come. Evidence included a Remington Gamemaster rifle from which at least one shot had been fired. The fingerprints were traced to an escaped convict named James Earl Ray. Two months after assassinating King, Ray was captured at London's Heathrow Airport while he was trying to depart the United Kingdom for Angola, Rhodesia, or apartheid South Africa on a false Canadian passport in the name of Ramon George Sneyd. Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder. Ray confessed to the assassination on March 10, 1969. On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray took a guilty plea to avoid a conviction and potential death penalty. Ray was sentenced to a 99-year prison term, but he recanted his confession three days later. Ray fired Foreman and claimed that a man whom he had met in Montreal by the alias of \\"Raoul\\" was involved, as was Ray's brother Johnny, but that Ray himself was not. He said through his new attorney Jack Kershaw that, although he did not \\"personally shoot King\\", he may have been \\"partially responsible without knowing it\\", hinting at a conspiracy. In May 1977, Kershaw presented evidence to the House Select Committee on Assassinations that he believed exonerated his client, but tests did not prove conclusive. Kershaw also claimed that Ray was somewhere else when the shots were fired, but he could not find a witness to corroborate the claim. =Escape= Ray and seven other convicts escaped from Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros, Tennessee on June 10, 1977. They were recaptured on June 13 and returned to prison.FIELD OFFICE ESTABLISHED Knoxville Field Office, FBI. A year was added to Ray's sentence. Ray worked for the remainder of his life unsuccessfully attempting to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a full trial. In 1997, King's son Dexter met with Ray; he publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a retrial. William Francis Pepper remained Ray's attorney until Ray's death. He carried on the effort to gain a trial on behalf of the King family, who do not believe Ray was responsible, claiming that there was a conspiracy by elements of the government against King.KING FAMILY STATEMENT ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT \\"LIMITED INVESTIGATION\\" OF THE MLK ASSASSINATION The King Center =Death= Ray died in prison on April 23, 1998, at the age of 70 from kidney and liver failure caused by hepatitis C (probably contracted as a result of a blood transfusion given after a stabbing while at Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary). Conspiracy theories =Loyd Jowers= In December 1993, Loyd Jowers, a white man from Memphis with business interests in the vicinity of the assassination site, appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live. He had gained attention by claiming that he had conspired with the mafia and the federal government to kill King. According to Jowers, Ray was a scapegoat and was not directly involved in the shooting. Jowers claimed that he had hired someone to kill King as a favor for a friend in the mafia, Frank Liberto, a produce merchant who died before 1993. According to the Department of Justice, Jowers had inconsistently identified different people as King's assassin since 1993. He had alternatively claimed the shooter was: (1) an African American man who was on South Main Street on the night of the assassination (the \\"Man on South Main Street\\"); (2) \\"Raoul\\"; (3) a white \\"Lieutenant\\" with the Memphis Police Department; and (4) a person whom he did not recognize. The Department of Justice does not consider Jowers' accusations credible and refers to two of the accused individuals by pseudonym.Because [The Department of Justice] does not credit Jowers' inconsistent allegations, we refer to the two assassins he has named as the \\"Man on South Main Street\\" and the \\"Lieutenant\\", respectively. It has stated that the evidence allegedly supporting the existence of \\"Raoul\\" is dubious.\\"United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr\\". June 2000. Civil Rights Division. Coretta Scott King v. Loyd Jowers In 1997, King's son Dexter met with Ray and asked him, \\"I just want to ask you, for the record, um, did you kill my father?\\" Ray replied, \\"No. No I didn't,\\" and King told Ray that he, along with the King family, believed him. The King family urged that Ray be granted a new trial.John Ray (brother of James Earl) on Fox at YouTubeToday in History March 27 at YouTube In 1999, the family filed a civil case against Jowers and unnamed co-conspirators for the wrongful death of King. The case, Coretta Scott King, et al. vs. Loyd Jowers et al., Case No. 97242, was tried in the circuit court of Shelby County, Tennessee from November 15 to December 8, 1999. Attorney William Francis Pepper, representing the King family, presented evidence from 70 witnesses and 4,000 pages of transcripts. Pepper alleges in his book An Act of State (2003) that the evidence implicated the FBI, the CIA, the U.S. Army, the Memphis Police Department, and organized crime in the murder. The suit alleged government involvement; however, no government officials or agencies were named or made party to the suit, so there was no defense or evidence presented or refuted by the government. The jury of six blacks and six whites decided that King had been the victim of a conspiracy involving the Memphis police and federal agencies, finding Jowers and unknown co-defendants civilly liable and awarding the family $100.\\"Civil Case: King Family versus Jowers\\" (Partial Transcripts of Trial), hosted by The King Center, Atlanta, Georgia. Accessed January 20, 2014. Local assistant district attorney John Campbell, who was not involved in the case, said that the case was flawed and \\"overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented.\\" This civil verdict against Jowers has been claimed by some to have established Ray's criminal innocence, which the King family has always maintained, but it has no bearing on his guilty plea. In the United States, civil and criminal trials are always adjudicated independently. The family said that it had requested only $100 in damages to demonstrate that it was not seeking financial gain. Dexter King called the verdict \\"a vindication for us.\\" At a press conference following the trial, he and his mother Coretta Scott King told reporters that they believed the mafia and state, local, and federal government agencies had conspired to plan the assassination and frame Ray as the shooter. When asked whom the family believed was the true assassin, Dexter King said that Jowers had identified Lt. Earl Clark of the Memphis Police Department as the shooter. Counter evidence King Center in Atlanta. In 2000, the Department of Justice completed its investigation into Jowers' claims, finding no evidence to support the conspiracy allegations. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless new reliable facts were to be presented. A sister of Jowers said that he had fabricated the story in order to earn $300,000 by selling it, and that she had corroborated the story to get money to pay her income taxes. King biographer David Garrow disagrees with Pepper's claims that the government killed King. He is supported by author Gerald Posner, who wrote Killing the Dream: James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. (1998), concluding that Ray killed King, acting alone, likely for the hope of collecting a racist bounty for the murder. Conspiracy theorists bristled at Killing the Dream, criticizing Posner for in part basing it on \\"a psychological evaluation of James Earl Ray, which he [Posner] is not qualified to give, and he dismisses evidence of conspiracy in King's murder as cynical attempts to exploit the tragedy.\\" Pepper repeatedly dismissed Posner's book as inaccurate and misleading, and Dexter King also criticized it. In response to the 1999 verdict in King vs. Jowers, Posner told the New York Times, \\"It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.\\" =Other theories= In 1998, CBS reported that two separate ballistic tests conducted on the Remington Gamemaster allegedly used by Ray in the assassination were inconclusive. Some witnesses with King at the moment of the shooting said that the shot had been fired from a different location and not from Ray's window; they believed that the source was a spot behind thick shrubbery near the rooming house. King's friend and SCLC organizer Reverend James Lawson has suggested that the impending occupation of Washington, D.C. by the Poor People's Campaign was a primary motive for the assassination. Lawson also noted during the civil trial that King alienated President Johnson and other powerful government actors when he repudiated the Vietnam War on April 4, 1967‚Äîexactly one year before the assassination. Some evidence has suggested that King had been targeted by COINTELPRO and had also been under surveillance by military intelligence agencies during the period leading up to his assassination under the code name Operation Lantern Spike. Minister Ronald Denton Wilson claimed that his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated King. He stated, \\"It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.\\" However, reportedly Wilson had previously admitted his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In 2004, Jesse Jackson, who was with King when he was assassinated, noted: According to biographer Taylor Branch, King's friend and colleague James Bevel put it more bluntly: \\"There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million- dollar black man.\\" See also * \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\" * Post-civil rights era African-American history References =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=      External links * \\"Civil Case: King Family v.

The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried three above-water twin sets of torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other two were between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Early in the war, the No. 4 gun and the aft torpedo tubes were removed in exchange for four depth charge throwers and 18 depth charges. In addition 10 license-built Type 96 light AA guns were installed.Whitley, pp. 189‚Äì90 These changes increased their displacement to .

Construction and career Kamikaze, built by Mitsubishi at their shipyard in Nagasaki, was laid down on 15 December 1921, launched on 25 September 1922 and completed on 19 December. Originally commissioned simply as Destroyer No. 1, she was assigned the name Kamikaze on 1 August 1928.Watts & Gordon, p. 264 On completion, Kamikaze was assigned to Destroyer Division 1, based in the ≈åminato Guard District and charged with the defense of Japan‚Äôs northern waters. =Pacific War= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kamikaze was still based at ≈åminato, and was assigned to patrols from the Chishima Islands to the southern coasts of Hokkaid≈ç. In June 1942, Kamikaze helped provide cover for the Japanese forces during Operation AL, the diversionary invasion of the Aleutian Islands during the Battle of Midway. Following the Aleutian Islands Campaign, Kamikaze patrolled from Hokkaid≈ç through the Aleutians through the end of the year. Throughout 1943 and 1944, she was assigned to patrols of Soya Strait and Tsugaru Strait and to escort ship convoys to remote outposts in the Kurile islands. On 23 October 1944, she left Kataoka Bay Naval Base, Shimushu Island, Kuril Islands for Otaru in convoy WO-303 consisting of transports , Hokoku Maru, and Umegawa Maru, and Fukue. The transports were filled with naval personal and fishery workers being removed to the homeland for the winter from the islands of Shimushu and Paramushiro. On 25 October 1944, the convoy was attacked by the submarine . Hakuyo Maru was torpedoed and sunk west of the Kuril Islands with 1,415 lives lost. The Seal evaded depth charging by Kamikaze and Fukue and the remainder of the convoy reached Otaru unharmed. However, from January 1945, Kamikaze was reassigned to the Combined Fleet and relocated to Moji in Ky≈´sh≈´. On 26 January 1945, she departed with a convoy from Moji bound for Singapore, but was assigned detached duty at the Mako in the Pescadores. On 14 February she formed part of the escort for both s which were sailing from Singapore to Japan as part of Operation Kita. On 20 February, she rescued the survivors of the torpedoed destroyer , continuing on to Singapore by 22 February.Nevitt In May 1945, Kamikaze sortied twice from Singapore as escort to the cruiser on emergency transport missions to the beleaguered Japanese garrison in the Andaman Islands.

Trial In December 2008, Walter Watkins and Diane Dent were charged with 20 counts of violating state statutes against gambling. Pennsylvania law alleged that the defendants \\"unlawfully allowed persons to collect and assemble for the purpose of unlawful gambling\\" and \\"unlawfully solicit or invite any person to visit any unlawful gambling place for the purpose of gambling.\\" page=2 Walter Watkins was hosting poker games in his garage, and Diane Dent was serving the role of dealer. The house did not take rake, but players were expected to tip the dealer. The operation was infiltrated by an undercover police officer, who testified at the trial. Both the state and the defense attorneys agreed to the principal facts in the case, but agreed that the \\"controlling issue\\" was whether or not Texas hold 'em is illegal gambling under the state's criminal code. page=3 In his opinion, Judge Thomas A. James Jr. determined that the question was if Texas hold 'em is a \\"game of skill or a game of chance... if chance predominates Texas hold 'em is gambling. If skill predominates, it is not gambling.\\" page=4 This interpretation comes from a 1983 state Supreme Court ruling, which declared, ‚Äúfor a game to constitute gambling, it must be a game where chanced predominates rather than skill.‚Äù In evaluating the case, Judge James explained the \\"Dominant Factor Test\\" that most jurisdictions use in cases dealing with what is and is not gambling. page=8 The Dominant Factor Test relies upon four criteria: :#Participants must have a distinct possibility of exercising skill and must have sufficient data upon which to calculate an informed judgment. :#Participants must have the opportunity to exercise the skill, and the general class of participants must possess the skill. :#Skill or the competitors efforts must sufficiently govern the results :#The standard of skill must be known to the participants, and this standard must govern the results. In reaching his conclusion, the Judge pointed out that there are over 600 books on the subject of poker strategy and that all agree that poker is a game of skill.

The study compared the results of black jack, roulette, poker, and other forms of gambling. \\"If you ask who are the top five poker players in the world, you will receive a meaningful response because skill is a determining factor. But if you ask who are the top five roulette players in the world, the response is utterly meaningless: roulette is purely a game of chance...

Since the ruling, speculation has emerged on the web that online poker sites might take the US to court to overturn the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibition against online poker.

Ruling overturned The state appealed the verdict and on April 10, 2010 the state's appellate court ruled 2-1 that the game is a game dominated by luck. The appellate court relied primarily upon older rulings from states with a less defined Dominant Factor Test. In his dissenting opinion, Judge Robert Colville did not declare poker to be a game of skill, but instead said that the Commonwealth failed to prove that poker was a game of chance. The state opted not to attempt a retrial...offering community service to both Walter Watkins and Diane Dent and a full expunging of the record. Both did 20 hours of community service.

The Japanese approached the island early on the morning of 11 December, and the warships began to bombard the island at a range of at 05:30. As none of the six American coast-defense guns replied, Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka, commander of the invasion forces, ordered his ships to close the island, believing that the American guns had been destroyed by the earlier aerial attacks. Encouraging this, Major James Devereux, commander of the United States Marine garrison, had ordered his men to hold their fire until he gave the order to do so. After the Japanese ships had closed to a range of , he ordered his guns to open fire. They did so with great effect, sinking Hayate, near-missing Kajioka's flagship Yubari, and causing to him to order his forces to disengage.Wukovits, pp. 99‚Äì108 Oite was slightly damaged by near-misses that also wounded 14 crewmen.

This usage specifically refers to a means of entering the profession (although in England it is still customary to say that a university undergraduate is \\"reading\\" a course, which may be law or any other). Reading the law consists of an extended internship or apprenticeship under the tutelage or mentoring of an experienced lawyer. A small number of U.S. jurisdictions still permit this practice today. __TOC__ History =United States= In colonial America, as in Britain in that day, law schools did not exist at all until Litchfield Law School was founded in 1773. Within a few years following the American Revolution, some universities such as the College of William and Mary and the University of Pennsylvania established a \\"Chair in Law\\". However, the holder of this position would be the sole purveyor of legal education for the institution, and would give lectures designed to supplement, rather than replace, an apprenticeship.. Even as a handful of law schools were established, they remained uncommon in the United States until the late nineteenth century. Most people who entered the legal profession did so through an apprenticeship which incorporated a period of study under the supervision of an experienced attorney. This usually encompassed the reading of the works considered at the time to be the most authoritative on the law, such as Edward Coke's Institutes of the Lawes of England, William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and similar texts.. The scholastic independence of the law student is evident from the following advice of Abraham Lincoln to a young man in 1855: Reading law to become an attorney would be the norm, until the 1890s, when the American Bar Association (which had been formed in 1878) began pressing states to limit admission to the Bar to those persons who had satisfactorily completed several years of post- graduate institutional instruction.. In 1941, James F. Byrnes became the last (July 8, 1941) Justice appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States who had never attended college or law school, and he was the penultimate appointee who had been admitted to practice by reading law. Byrnes was followed by Robert H. Jackson, who was commissioned just three days later (July 11, 1941) and had also been admitted to the practice of law by reading, although he had attended a law school for less than one year (instead of the customary three to four years, and had not graduated). As of 2014, California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington permit students to take the state bar exam after reading law with the help of an attorney as an alternative to law school. New York, Maine, and Wyoming allow students to study in a law office together with some period of time in law school.

Drake, one of Dred Scott's attorneys *Clarence Darrow =Canada= Unlike their U.S. counterparts, early lawyers of Canada did get some legal training, but not within a higher institution like a school. Following English tradition, early Canadian lawyers trained by \\"learning law\\" through another lawyer. To practice fully, these legal students (articled clerk) are required to pass a bar exam and be admitted to the bar. Reading law was also used in Ontario to train lawyers until 1949. People training to become lawyers need not attend school, but they were asked to apprentice or article with a practicing lawyer. Changes in the late 1940s ended the practice. In Quebec, civil law required formal education; and in Nova Scotia, lawyers were trained by attending university. Modern practice A small number of jurisdictions still permit this. In the states of California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, an applicant who has not attended law school may take the bar exam after reading law under a judge or practicing attorney for an extended period of time. The required time varies. Exact rules vary as well; for example, Virginia does not allow the reader to be gainfully employed by the tutoring lawyer, while Washington requires just that. The State of New York requires that applicants who are reading law must have at least one year of law school study and Maine requires applicants to have completed at least two-thirds of a law degree. Such persons are sometimes called country lawyers or county-seat lawyers. In 2013, 60 people became lawyers this way as opposed to 84,000 via law schools.

Malibayli village of Shusha, 1813 Azerbaijani rugs () are a product of Azerbaijan, an ancient center of carpet weaving. The Azerbaijani rug is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Azerbaijan to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables.The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan Carpet making is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice, with carpet making and rug making being predominantly a women's occupation. In the past, every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets, and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry. In the case of a newly married son, it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household. Starting a new carpet meant a feast, but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family. In the old days, finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted. For the traditional process of carpet and rug making, men sheared the sheep for the wool in the spring and autumn, while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. Azerbaijani carpets are classified under four large regional groups, i.e. Quba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh, and Baku. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage by UNESCO.The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan Azerbaijani carpet entered UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage History Ganja, Azerbaijan in the late 19th century. Carpet manufacturing in Ganja in the early 20th century. Since ancient times, Azerbaijan has been known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well-developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. The results of the archeological digging in Azerbaijan validate the antiquity of the carpet weaving traditions on this land. The Gultapin excavations discovered carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. For many centuries during the historical existence of Azerbaijan, both settled and nomadic ways of life were of importance. The carpet making was born in rural huts and with time ranked among the most essential arts. It was highly valued by the heads of states, and the gifted weavers were glorified by the greatest poets. The carpet history is assumed to be divided into the following four main periods: * I period - the early stage of the carpet development. The carpet ware is very simple, without any motifs and patterns. The first palas and djedjims appear. * II period - introduction of the kilim weaving practice by the intricate threading technique. * III period - weaving of shadda, verni, sumakh, zili. The period of simple and complex whipping techniques. * IV period - introduction of the knotted pile weaving. Both from the technical and artistic standpoints this stage can be considered the acme of the carpet making. Flat-weave carpets =Shadda= A 19th century Azeri shadda of exceptionally high quality. It was exhibited at the upright=0.8 Shadda is a flat weave carpet, made primarily in Nakhchivan, Agdam, Gubadly, Agjabedi. The artistic composition of shadda made by complicated whipping, as well as its constituents have a complex form. Early in the 20th century the oldest weavers and carpet experts called this type of carpets ‚Äúshadra‚Äô or ‚Äúshatra‚Äù. The word ‚Äúshadda‚Äù is a distorted form of ‚Äúshatranj‚Äù and ‚Äúshadvard‚Äù. Shadda comes in a number of varieties, each having a specific technique such as monochrome, checkered or subject. Monochrome shadda are made by the simple interweaving technique. Shadda with a checkered pattern is based on the palas and jejim principle. The same technique is used to make subject-based shadda. The subject shadda ‚ÄúDavali‚Äù are famous all over the world. They use practically one and the same subject with the composition being almost invariable: the camelcade moving along the carpet field from left to right, along a few horizontal rows, and each string running into a figure of a sarvan on foot. The humans and animals are set off against the dark-red field, its color is smooth and hot. Silk embroidery, greater Azerbaijan, 17th-18th century. In the collections of the Textile Museum (Washington, D.C.) =Verni= The most widely spread type of the flat-weave carpet is ‚Äúverni‚Äù. Perhaps none of the flat-weave carpets can boast such a monumental pattern and harmonious clarity as the ‚Äúverni‚Äù made only in Azerbaijan. The technical perfection and utmost emotionality of these carpets is a sort of acme of the Azerbaijani carpet art. Sample ‚Äúverni‚Äù displayed in various museums throughout the world presents the outstanding monument of the richest heritage of the Azerbaijani folk art in which we by right take pride. Among the ‚Äúverni‚Äù centers were Agjabedi, Barda, Agdam, Nakhchivan. The key d√©cor feature, which is intrinsical to every ‚Äùverni‚Äù is the S-element. Its shape varies, it may resemble both figure 5 and letter S. This element means ‚Äúdragon‚Äù among the nomads and ‚Äúwater‚Äù among the village people. Based on the stories told by the oldest Azerbaijani weavers with nomadic roots, a dragon featuring carpet would protect the family from foul weather. In Taoism, a dragon is associated with spring. The Tibet pantheon considers dragon as a good deity, a master of chiefs. If the S-element takes up the whole of the carpet space, it would be viewed as an image of a dragon itself rather than a dragon symbol. This element has been known to the local weaver for centuries and is characterized by an ability to come alive through embodiment in a specific image and to symbolize the good and happiness. =Jejim= Jejims are woven on simple horizontal looms by narrow stripes 30‚Äì35 cm wide and 15‚Äì10 cm long. The resulting product is a cloth to be used as a wall carpet, a bedding coverlet, or curtains. The width of a jejim matches the distance between the weaver's feet as in the process of weaving the whole width of the cloth should pass through the weaver's feet. The ornamental d√©cor of jejims is diverse and rich. Various vertical stripes that decorate jejims are spectacular, colorful and decorative. They are often decorated by stylized images of utensils (comb, thread, candlesticks) and geometrical elements. Up to the mid 20th century delicate jejims were used to make garments both for men and women. The major jejim production centers are Barda, Nakhchivan, Zangilan, Shusha, Shamakha. =Zilli= Some traditional tools of the craft. ‚ÄúZilli‚Äù are characterized by stylized forms of animals and vegetal elements. In terms of their composition and pattern, the Azerbaijani zillis are very diverse. They feature a plastic flexibility of the pattern and emotional expressiveness. The ornamental decoration is marked by images of large elements in the shape of big lozenges, paired horns, various stylized elements. There are ‚Äúzillis‚Äù with a variety of compositions, which differed by peculiar vegetal ornamental patterns and overall rich colors. The key element in such compositions lies in the recurring alternation of colors along the horizontal pt vertical lines, which form an \\"energetic\\" rhythm. As to their technical and artistic qualities, ‚Äúzillis‚Äù are rich in moving images of stylized birds, elaborated ‚Äúbutas‚Äù and other elements. ‚ÄúZilli‚Äù were influenced by the tendency to fill in the space by various motifs, each being repeated in the field according to its individual layout, and the overall result resembles a fancy garden with a rich and fairy-tale flora. =Kilim= Kilim is the most widespread type of flat- woven carpets. They are made by passing the weft through the warp using the technique of compound interweaving. Kilim is characterized by a slot-like gap (opening) around the geometrical patterns. These openings impart a lace effect the kilim. The technique of kilim weaving predetermines the pattern shapes in the form of a lozenge, triangle, trapezium. Nearly all the vegetal elements, images of animals, birds and humans are geometrized in kilims. Kilims of different regions are distinguished by their composition, pattern, and colors. In terms of their technical peculiarities, kilims can be classified into five major groups based on the area of production: Kazakh, Karabakh, Absheron, and Shirvan kilims. They are all characterized by a balanced composition, contrasting colors and clear symmetry. The pattern is traditional, in the form of large and small lozenge and hook-like elements, which are rather expressive and dramatic. =Sumakh= The ‚ÄúSumakh‚Äù carpets present one of the interesting types of flat-weave carpets, which have become widely spread and recognized over the last few centuries. Beginning with the 18th century ‚ÄúSumakhs‚Äù have been made in the Quba nd Gusary districts.sumakh-carpets‚ÄúSumakhs‚Äù were created much later than other types of flat-woven carpets. In the early stage of their development they, might have had their own individual composition, but the ‚ÄúSumakhs‚Äù of the 18th-20th centuries reproduce the compositions and patterns copied from the pile carpets made in Shirvan, Quba, Karabakh and Ganja. The technological peculiarity of ‚ÄúSumakh‚Äù lies in their rich composition and colors. The diverse stylized vegetal motifs, various geometrical elements such as large hexahedral, square, rhomboid medallions impart festive beauty to ‚ÄúSumakh‚Äù. The traditional pattern includes the minor edge with a wave-like pattern, which is called ‚Äúdolan-gach‚Äù (pass around - run away). It is used basically in all ‚ÄúSumakh‚Äù type carpets. =Palas= Palas is one of the widely spread flat-weave carpets. The palas weaving process consists in passing the weft through the warp by a simple technique. The weavers decorate the palas by traditional patterns in the form of horizontal stripes commonly used throughout Azerbaijan. But every individual weavers had their own choice of composition and colors.azerbaijani palas As a rule, the palas is not framed by a border. The palases called ‚Äúchiy‚Äù are made by a very unusual weaving technique. Similarly to other simple types of palases the background of ‚Äúchiy‚Äù is plain weave. At the same time, the pattern-making thread is used to create a fine tiny geometrical pattern by piercing ‚Äúsanjma‚Äù. This creates the embroidery effect. Namazlyg carpet from Shusha. 19th century. Dyeing wool At dyeing workshops, professionals dye yarns with dye-stuffs mainly of plant origin, strictly following the centuries-old traditional techniques of colouring. To prepare the seven basic colors (red, green, yellow, black, dark blue, white, purple) and their tints used in carpet making, professional dyers use green walnut shells, the skin of pomegranates, indigo, leaves of the mulberry, quince and walnut plants, and roots of madder. In order to achieve yellow and its hues, they use bulb onion peels, mulberry leaves collected in the late autumn, etc. To produce red and pink colors, madder is used, and to obtain dark blue, blue and green, indigo dye is used. At the very end of the yarn dyeing process a dyer adds salt, alum or vinegar into the dye solution to increase the intensity, fastness and durability of colours. Then, dyed yarns are pressed and dried with special techniques. Weaving They are made using weaving looms, with average knot density (from 35√µ60 to 55√µ55). Three hand tools are used - a knife, a beater and shears. Pulling In most cases carpets manually woven of silk and wool have clear unevenness of their edges. To eliminate this characteristic, carpets are fastened to wooden floors with their four ends pulled. They are then raised up from the middle by means of special wooden lifters and smoothened on the reverse side. After that, the carpet is pulled and fastened to the wooden floor again and left in this position for two days. This process helps to straighten out the edges of the carpet. Carpet-weaving schools =Quba-Shirvan schools of carpet weaving= The rise of the carpet art on the territory of Azerbaijan was undoubtedly related to a number of objective factors, among them the geographical location of this land, at the joint of the East and the West. The Greater Caucasus ridge, home to some Quba-Shirvan carpet-weaving schools, lies the borderline between Asia and Europe. Here is the historical juxtaposition point between the Islamic and Christian cultures. Long camelcades passed through this land in the Middle Ages. Quba school of carpet weaving The Quba school that includes the Gonagkend and Divichi districts covers up to 35 pattern compositions of the carpets. Quba is an historical region hosting a plenitude of various tribes. The region is populated by ethnic groups that speak different languages, among them Azerbaijanis, Lezghins, Tats, Budugs, Gyryzys and others. Quba carpets come with a wide variety of designs, which may differ even from village to village. The ornamental pattern is characterized by geometrical and vegetal motifs, most of them stylized. These include Gyryz, Gymyl, Gonakend, Shahnezerli and other carpets. Shirvan school of carpet weaving The Shirvan school is famous for its superb carpets. Shirvan is one of the most ancient historical regions of Azerbaijan. Carpet making of different types is a widespread craft with both settled and nomadic natives. The Shirvan school accounts for carpets manufactured in the following towns and villages of the Shirvan region: Shemaha, Maraza, Bijo, Gashad, Gagali, Archiman, Kurdamir. The school totals 25 compositions. The Salyan carpets, with similar artistic and technical features, also belong to this school. The Shirvan carpets are characterized by an intricate design, which depicts numerous artifacts of everyday life, birds and people. =Ganja- Kazakh school of carpet weaving = The carpets of this school are notable for peculiarity of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include a relatively small number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups. The Kazakh carpets have a geometrical ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a schematic presentation of the geometrical patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on geometrical motifs as well as schematic presentation of plants and animals. =Baku school of carpet weaving= The Baku school of carpet weaving includes the villages of Novkhany, Fatmai, Nardaran, Bulbulya, Mardakan, Gaadi. These carpets are marked for their increased softness of the material and intense colors, as well as excellent artistic taste and exquisite decoration. This school has about 10 compositions. The historical sources and inscriptions on the carpets testify to the fact that carpet making was widely spread in these villages and carpet-ware was exported outside the country. The carpet composition often includes medallions. They are filled by various motifs, most often by stylized images of plants, which lost their resemblance to the original object after they had been geometrized. =Karabakh school of carpet weaving= The Karabakh carpets consist of 33 varieties. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool, the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet. In the mountainous part of Karabakh, the carpets were made in Malybeili, Muradkhanly, Dashbulag, Jabrayil, and many other villages.  Carpets in social and economic life  Azerbaijan Carpet Museum Carpets are not used only as a home decor in Azerbaijan, they carry a great cultural significance as a family tradition transferred verbally and with practicing, and also associated with the daily life and customs of Azerbaijani people. Taking into account its socio-economic importance, Azerbaijani folk applied art, particularly carpet weaving has been the subject to the special attention of the government to preserve, study, promote and develop carpet weaving traditions of Azerbaijani people. The Law ‚ÄúOn the protection and development of carpet art of Azerbaijan‚Äù was adopted in December 2004, \\"Azerkhalcha\\" was established in May 2016, Carpet Weaver Day started to be celebrated on May 5th according to the Presidential Decree, the new building for Azerbaijan Carpet Museum designed by an Austrian architect Franz Janz in the shape of a rolled carpet was constructed between 2007 and 2014. In addition, the State Program on the ‚ÄúProtection and development of carpet art in the Republic of Azerbaijan 2018-2022‚Äù was approved in February 2018 by the President Ilham Aliyev with the aim to create raw material supply for this industry, improve the infrastructure for carpet-weaving, support the establishment of new workplaces, carry out qualified personnel training in the field of carpet- weaving, as well as, wool processing, wool and silk yarns manufacturing, processing plants used for dyeing and production of dyes.

At , it is the second-longest river on the island (after the Ishikari) and the fourth-longest in the country (after the Shinano, Tone, and Ishikari). A Class A river, the Teshio is the northernmost major river in Japan, and has been designated Hokkaid≈ç Heritage. Matsuura Takeshir≈ç is said to have come up with the name \\"Hokkaid≈ç\\" during his exploration of the river's interior. Name The name of the river derives from the Ainu , meaning \\"river full of fishing weirs\\", perhaps because of rocks dotted across the river in such a shape. Alternatively, there is a locale in Bifuka that has been designated a municipal Historic Site as the on the basis that it was while staying here, during his exploration to the source of the river, on the seventh day of the sixth month of Ansei 4 (1857), there being a fishing weir at the spot, that recorded the river's name. Due to works on the river in recent years the rocks in its middle course that perhaps inspired the name themselves largely no longer exist. Geography The river's source is at Mount Teshio (), highest of the Kitami Mountains. Flowing down through the mountain valleys from its origins in Shibetsu, it is fed by tributaries (of which it has some 160) including the , then crosses the mountain plains, passing next through the more-constricted topography of Otoineppu before entering the Teshio Plain, where it meanders until flowing into the Sea of Japan at Teshio. The lower are, unusually, unbroken by dams and weirs and can be navigated uninterrupted. In the river basin, which has an area of , there are twelve municipalities: * Kamikawa SubprefectureÔºö Bifuka, Kenbuchi, Nakagawa, Nayoro, Otoineppu, Shibetsu, Shimokawa, Wassamu * Rumoi SubprefectureÔºö Teshio * S≈çya SubprefectureÔºö Horonobe, Toyotomi, Wakkanai As of the 2010 census, some 122,000 people lived in the basin. History It is believed the first humans arrived in the Teshio River system approximately fifteen thousand years ago. At the in Teshio, where the river enters the Sea of Japan, remains of some two hundred and thirty pit dwellings have been discovered, with deposits of the Zoku-J≈çmon period as well as of the Satsumon and Okhotsk cultures. Opening of the , similarly at the mouth of the river, in Tenmei 6 (1786) marked the advent of the Wajin and their trade with the Ainu of the interior. The first survey of the river was conducted by three men under , retainer of the Matsumae Domain, in Kansei 9 (1797), from its lower stretches as far as Otoineppu. In Ansei 4 (1857), Matsuura Takeshir≈ç spent twenty-four days exploring the Teshio River, starting from its mouth; he subsequently wrote up his account of the river and those who lived along it in his . It was from the tales he heard from an Ainu elder living in the area of Otoineppu that Matsuura conceived of the name \\"Hokkaid≈ç\\". Following the establishment of the in Meiji 2 (1869), settler-farmers began to arrive. After major floods in 1898, a need was identified for flood mitigation measures all over the island. After detailed surveying of the river between 1906 and 1908, and further flooding, a flood control plan for the Teshio River was first drafted in Taish≈ç 8 (1919). There ensued a programme of bank reinforcement, embankment construction, and channel switching. After flooding continued to adversely affect the local farmers' potatoes, the Sh≈çwa era saw further channel switching and the excavation of new waterways. A typhoon in 1981 and the heaviest rainfall since the war saw an area of inundated, with damage to 546 houses, while the typhoons of 2016 left 72 homes flooded. The river's history is documented at the in Teshio. Economy In the upstream areas of Shibetsu and Shimokawa, the lumber industry exploits the abundant forests of the interior. The Nayoro basin between Nayoro and Bifuka marks the northern limit of rice cultivation. Downstream, on the Teshio Plain, there is dairy farming, while near the river mouth there is salmon and trout fishing and also the prefecture's most intensive harvesting of shijimi clams. Water sports include canoeing‚Äîthere is an annual race . Ecology The mountainous area upstream extends to the Daisetsuzan National Park, while Teshiodake Prefectural Natural Park has many alpine plants.

Formed in July 2007 and incorporated in October 2007, it was founded by approximately 100 parents of young children with neuroblastoma who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Its purpose is to fund the development of new therapies for neuroblastoma that would not otherwise be pursued by research institutions or the pharmaceutical industry. The organization has become the largest single funder of neuroblastoma research at MSKCC. Neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma is a form of childhood cancer that can develop at any age but typically presents between the ages of 18 months and five years. It affects a little over 600 children per year in the United States. Most are diagnosed with stage IV disease, the most advanced form. Even with aggressive therapy, stage IV neuroblastoma carries a poor prognosis, with a three-year survival rate of 30‚Äì40%. Compared with other types of cancer, neuroblastoma is rare. Scientific advances have allowed the development of individualized treatments, with techniques such as immunotherapy being targeted to specific kinds of cancer. However, because of the rising cost of drug development, which is approaching $1 billion, pharmaceutical companies are not likely to develop drugs that are specific to neuroblastoma or other rare disorders. Projects The Band of Parents' first project was the development of a humanized antibody, Hu3F8. In addition to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, many neuroblastoma patients at MSKCC were treated with a murine (mouse-derived) monoclonal antibody called 3F8. Given intravenously, 3F8 binds specifically to neuroblastoma cells and triggers an immune response, which destroys the cancerous cells. Because the antibody also binds to peripheral nerve cells, the treatment is painful, but it is generally without long-term complications. However, its use is limited by the body's eventual development of human anti-murine antibody, which neutralizes the effects. The Band of Parents raised $2‚Äì$3 million to fund the genetic engineering of the murine cell line that produces 3F8 so that it would produce a new antibody, Hu3F8, using human genes. Hu3F8 has the same benefits as 3F8, but because it is 98% human, it does not cause a neutralizing immune response. In theory, this should allow patients to be treated with it indefinitely. In March 2013, the Band of Parents led a group of nonprofit organizations in providing a $2 million grant to MSKCC to fund the development of a bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting neuroblastoma. The organization's other projects have included the Loneliest Road Campaign, a 3,000-mile, 19-day bicycle ride across the US by six fathers of children in active treatment; a bake sale with cookies made by the children, their families and supporters; and The BoP Shop, an online store featuring artwork by children with neuroblastoma. In 2012, the Band of Parents began an annual gala event called the Evening of Hope, which has become its primary fundraiser.

From January through March 1942, Y≈´nagi provided cover for the landings of Japanese forces during Operation R (the invasion of Rabaul, New Britain) and Operation SR (the invasion of Lae and Salamaua). While patrolling out of Lae on 10 March, she suffered medium damage from strafing attacks, forcing a return to Sasebo for repairs by April. Once repairs were completed in June, the ship escorted convoys from Moji in Ky≈´sh≈´ back to Rabaul, via the Philippines and Palau.

(Yale University Press) 1995, s.v. \\"Stone, Nicholas\\", gives 1587 as his birth year. - 24 August 1647) was an English sculptor and architect. In 1619 he was appointed master-mason to James I, and in 1626 to Charles I. During his career he was the mason responsible for not only the building of Inigo Jones' Banqueting House, Whitehall,William Cure, the King's Master Mason having declined the demanding task (Colvin 1995). but the execution of elaborate funerary monuments for some of the most prominent of his era that were avant- garde by English standards. As an architect he worked in the Baroque style providing England with some of its earliest examples of the style that was not to find favour in the country for another sixty years, and then only fleetingly. He worked in a context where most sculptors in stone were \\"mason- sculptors\\", in modern terms combining sculpture with architecture. The quality of his sculptural work is variable, probably because much of it was done by his workshop colleagues. Netherlandish influence was dominant in English sculpture, and in Stone's training, but the importation of classical antiquities by collectors influenced his later work. There continued to be few sculpture commissions other than tombs in England during his career, and he developed the English types of the previous century.Whinney, 67-80 Early life Nicholas Stone was born in 1586, the son of a quarryman of Woodbury, near Exeter.Colvin 1995. He was first apprenticed to Isaac James, a Dutch-born London mason working in Southwark, London. When the sculptor Hendrik de Keyser (1567‚Äì1621), master mason to the City of Amsterdam, visited London in 1606, Stone was introduced to him and contracted to work for him in Holland, where he married de Keyser's daughter and worked with his son Pieter. Stone is thought to have made the portico to the Zuiderkerk in Amsterdam. In 1613 he returned to London with Bernard Janssens, a fellow pupil of de Keyser and settled in Long Acre, St Martin-in-the-Fields, where he established a large practice and workshops and soon became the leading English sculptor of funeral monuments. Works Stone owed his early success in London in part to Inigo Jones, the King's Surveyor. Stone was contracted by the depute-treasurer of Scotland Gideon Murray to decorate the chapel at Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh, in 1616-7.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1613-1616, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1891), pp. 593-4. He sub-contracted the painting and gilding work to Matthew Goodrick.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1895), p. 65. This involvement with the royal works led to the spectacular contract for building Jones's Banqueting House, that placed him in the forefront of London builders.Newman 1971. Throughout his life, Stone recorded his work in two journals; These are his autograph notebook (covering the years 1614‚Äì1641) and his accounts book (covering 1631-1642).W.L. Spiers, The Note-book and Account-book of Nicholas Stone (Walpole Society 7, 1919); noted in Oxford DNB; Colvin 1995. These journals record all his works and patrons, and provide in unequalled detail documentation of the career of an architect (then known as a surveyor) of the period.Oxford DNB A list of works by Stone's relative John Stoakes includes some work known not to have been designed by Stone, including Inigo Jones' Banqueting House, Whitehall, but permits some attributions, noted below. This amount of information available concerning Stone has led to his importance to English architecture often being overstated.This is the explicit view of the Oxford DNB. However, the documentation does clearly prove that by 1629 he was England's foremost sculptor and that by the end of his life he held comparable status in architecture. His first appointment in the royal Office of Works was as \\"master mason and architect\\" to Windsor Castle in April 1626;Stone's work at Windsor has been demolished, according to Colvin 1995. in 1632 he succeeded William Cure as Master Mason to the Crown.

Ketton- Cremer, \\"Sir William Paston\\" in Norfolk Assembly (London:Faber and Faber) 1957, pp. 17-40., instances Nicholas Stone's work for Sir William Paston at Oxnead and at Paston, Norfolk. Paston commissioned from Stone the monument to his mother (died 1629) in the church at Paston, the family's ancient seat; in Stone's note-book, the price came to ¬£340, and Stone remarks that in setting it up he was \\"very extreordenerly entertayned thar\\" by the genial Paston.Ketton-Cremer 1957:20. The simpler monument by Stone of Sir Edmund Paston (died 1633), without the effigy and achievement of arms, stands beside his wife's. Oxnead was emptied of its treasures, sold off and all but demolished, but in 1809 its long-term tenant, John Adey Repton,J.C. Loudon, The Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphrey Repton, Esq., new ed. 1840, \\"Biographical Notice\\" p. 4. made a conjectural drawing of it, based on the foundations and recollections of local inhabitants, which was illustrated in W.H. Bartlett and John Britten's Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain 1809, following p. 98.In The Gentleman's Magazine January 1844, Repton gave a further account of Oxnead and some of its former treasures, mentioning the drawing. his view is centered on the terraced parterres, in the lowest of which, he says, stood the fountain of two tiers of bold opposed scrolls supporting a shallow basin,An engraving of it, after Repton, is published in The Gentleman's Magazine, January 1844 article p. 21. re-erected after the Oxnead sale at the rival Norfolk house, Blickling Hall. Repton's drawing showed the banqueting house constructed as a wing; its style was so advanced for its date in the 1630s that the younger Repton concluded that it had been \\"erected by the first Earl of Yarmouth, to receive King Charles II. and his attendants, who visited Oxnead in 1676; it was a lofty building, with sash-windows, called the Banquetting-room. Underneath this was a vaulted apartment, which was called the Frisketting room, probably from the Italian 'frescati', a cool grotto.\\" Repton's drawing shows a building of three bays articulated by a giant order, with large rectangular windows over the basement windows and oval windows, recalled by local people, in a mezzanine above.The result may be compared to Stone's front in Foster Lane of Goldsmiths' Hall. Stone provided a magnificent chimneypiece that cost ¬£80Chimneypieces of the 1630s were not like the more familiar modestly scaled chimneypieces of the 18th century, but included elaborately rendered architectural overmantels that reached to the cornice of the room. and another for the banqueting house, a balcony with two door surrounds and an architrave in Portland stone, a \\"copper branch\\"‚Äî probably a cast bronze candelabrum‚Äî weighing 166 pounds, and an achievement of the Paston arms. There were many miscellaneous carved furnishings, picture frames and stands for tables, balustrades and paving-stones, and busts of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina. For the gardens he provided figures of Venus and Cupid, Jupiter, Flora, and, to guard the garden front door, a large figure of Cerberus on a pedestal, all long gone, but Stone's Hercules‚Äî and perhaps others‚Äî are preserved in the gardens at Blickling. In the garden Stone erected a large iron pergola painted green, surmounted by eight gilded balls. In 1638, he sent his son, Nicholas Stone the younger, to Italy, whence there returned an elevation of a new garden house just built in the Villa Ludovisi, Rome, \\"for Mr Paston\\",The younger Stone's Italian notebook is conserved in Sir John Soane's Museum. London (Platt 1994, p. 88 and fig. 34, p. 89 ). and marbles, architectural books (Vignola, Vitruvius, and Maggi's Le fontane di Roma), and plaster casts sent home from Livorno.Platt 1988, p. 88. With the onset of the Civil War, commissions from Sir William abruptly ceased in 1642; five years later, his outstanding account was settled, for ¬£24.Ketton-Cremer 1975:22. Christopher Hatton at Kirby Hall Christopher Hatton was rebuilding Kirby Hall in the same decade. For him Stone provided \\"6 Emperors heads, with their pedestals cast in Plaster, moulded from the Antiques\\" (¬£7 10s), a \\"head of Apollo, fairly carved in Portland stone, almost twice as big as life\\" and \\"one head carved in stone of Marcus Aurelius\\" still preserved set in the north front above the loggia (each ¬£4).Colin Platt, The Great Rebuildings of Tudor and Stuart England (London:Routledge) 1994, p 87f. =Sculpture= The poet John Donne posed in his shroud while still alive; an engraving of Nicholas Stone's 1631 effigy to him in Westminster Abbey While Stone's London workshop received commissions for garden statuary, perhaps including the sculptures in Isaac de Caus' grotto at Woburn Abbey, recently attributed to Nicholas Stone,Dianne Duggan, \\"Isaac de Caus, Nicholas Stone and the Woburn Abbey grotto,\\" Apollo (August 2003). and for domestic items such as door-cases and chimneypieces, the vast majority of Stone's surviving sculptures are funerary monuments, and it is by these that the quality of his sculpture is today judged. Stone was greatly influenced by the new classicizing fashion for art derived from the Italian Renaissance and the Roman Arundel marbles, and this is reflected in two of his works, both in Westminster Abbey, the memorial to Sir John Holles and his brother Francis both dressed Roman armour reflecting classical influence, something new to England. It has been said that until this time English sculpture resembled that described by the Duchess of Malfi: \\"the figure cut in alabaster kneels at my husband's tomb.\\"Halliday, p. 154. A taste for realism, in part the product of his training in the Netherlands, informs the floor tomb of Sir William Curle (died 1617) in the church at Hatfield, Hertfordshire; Sir William is sculpted lying in his grave coat, his knees drawn up in his last agonies: \\"in its sad and poignant realism,\\" observes Colin Platt, \\"it was as much a culture shock as the Whitehall Banqueting House\\".Platt 1994:87; illus fig. 433, p. 88. Two prominent funeral monuments, Stone's box tombs in Westminster Abbey served as influential models far into the 18th century for many monuments in the metropolis and in the country: they were for Sir George Villiers and his wife, the Countess of Buckingham (c 1631), and for Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, and his wife (after 1638).A. D. Harvey, \\"Baluster-Cornered Box Tombs\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 62 (1999), pp. 287-295, p. 287. Stone's 1631 monument to Dr John Donne, at St Pauls Cathedral is considered to be among his most remarkable. It depicts the poet, standing upon an urn, dressed in a winding cloth, rising for the moment of judgement. This depiction, Donne's own idea, was sculpted from a painting for which the Poet posed. Another of Stone's finest works is the effigy of Elizabeth, Lady Carey in the parish church at Stowe Nine Churches, Northamptonshire, is considered one of his masterpieces.1911 While other surviving examples of his monuments to the dead include those to: Sir Francis Vere, Earl of Middlesex; Sir Dudley Digges at Chilham church, Kent; Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, in Dover Castle (removed to Greenwich); Sir Thomas Sutton, at the London Charterhouse (with Janssens); Sir Robert Drury at Hawstead church, Suffolk; Sir William Stonhouse at Radley church, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire); Sir Thomas Bodley at Merton College, Oxford (1612-May 1615), with his bust in an oval niche flanked by pilasters of stacked books;Stone noted that he had been paid ¬£100 \\"in good mony;\\" a preliminary design, altered in the execution but apparently the only extant design for a monument by Stone, has been discovered in the Bodleian Library: see W.J. Blair, \\"Nicholas Stone's Design for the Bodley Monument\\" The Burlington Magazine 118 No. 874 (January 1976), pp. 23-24.

Of Stone's non-sepulchre sculpture precious little remains: a chimneypiece, from 1616, at Newburgh Priory depicting mythological standing deities in bas-relief; two crumbling garden statues at Blickling Hall and a collection of statues in good repair at Wilton House. The Wilton House statues, as at Woburn, indicate the close working relationship that Stone had with both Inigo Jones and Isaac de Caus both of whom worked on the design of Wilton. York House water gate York House water gate, often attributed to Stone Serlio's 16th-century design for a rustic gate which flouts all conventions of classical architecture. Nicholas Stone was influenced by such designs. York House, London, was one of the great houses of the aristocracy which lined the Thames during the 17th century. During the 1620s, it was acquired by the royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. The Duke rebuilt and modernised the house and, in 1623, commissioned the building of a water gate to give access to the Thames from the gardens, at that time the river being a favoured method of transport on London. With the Banqueting House, it is one of the few surviving reminders in London of the Italianate court style of Charles I. The water gate is believed to have been designed by Stone.It is credited to him in a list drawn up by his relative, Charles Stoakes (Colvin, \\"Gerbier\\"). However, like the Banqueting House, the design of the water gate has been attributed to Inigo Jones, with Stone only being credited with the building.by John Harris in Country Life 2 November 1989. It has also been attributed to the diplomat and painter Sir Balthazar Gerbier.by Sir John Summerson, in Architecture in Britain, 1530-1830 (1963); Sir John withdrew the attribution in the 1991 edition. The similarity of the architecture to the Danby Gate (below) and its bold vermicelli rusticated design in a confident Serlian manner indicate that it is by the same hand as the Danby Gate itself. Today, of the York House complex, only the water gate survives; the house was demolished in 1670 and the site redeveloped as Villiers Street. The creation of the Thames embankment in the 19th century caused the gate to be marooned from the river. The water gate was restored during the 1950s. The Danby Gateway, Oxford The Danby gateway to the University of Oxford Botanic Garden built in 1633. The Danby gateway to the University of Oxford Botanic Garden is one of three entrances to the garden designed\\"probably designed\\", according to Colvin 1995. by Nicholas Stone between 1632 and 1633. In this highly ornate arch, Stone ignored the new simple classical Palladian style currently fashionable, which had just been introduced to England from Italy by Inigo Jones, and drew his inspiration from an illustration in Serlio's book of archways.Pevsner, p. 267. Pevsner is almost certainly referring to Tutte l'opere d'architettura, Volume 6. p17. \\"Libro estraordinario\\" published in 1584. The gateway consists of three bays, each with a pediment. The largest and central bay, containing the segmented arch is recessed, causing its larger pediment to be partially hidden by the flanking smaller pediments of the projecting lateral bays. The stone work is heavily decorated being bands of alternating vermicelli rustication and plain dressed stone. The pediments of the lateral bays are seemingly supported by circular columns which frame niches containing statues of Charles I and Charles II in classical pose. The tympanum of the central pediment contains a segmented niche containing a bust of The 1st Earl of Danby, who founded the garden in 1621 and commissioned the gateways. Porch of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford Nicholas Stone's Baroque porch at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford. Designed 1637. In 1637, Stone designed a new entrance porch for the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford, this was one of his most spectacular works, in a European baroque design.Pevsner states it was designed in 1633, the church's website in 1637 The porch's heavy Baroque is quite unlike the eventual form the style was later to take in England. A huge scrolled pediment is supported by a pair of massive solomonic columns, an ancient architectural feature revived, in Italy, as a feature of the Baroque, and used most notably, as Stone would have been aware, for the baldacchino at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which has been completed by Bernini just four years earlier. The obvious European, and thus Catholic, design of the porch was later to cause problems for the porch's patron Archbishop Laud because at the centre of the scrolled pediment was placed a statue of the Virgin and Child, a composition considered to be Roman Catholic idolatry, and later used against the Archbishop at his trial for treason in 1641 following the grand Remonstrance.St Mary the Virgin Today, the statue is still bears the bullet holes cause when it was fired upon by Cromwellian soldiers. Goldsmith's Hall Stone designed and built Goldsmiths' Hall, Foster Lane, in 1635-38, which has provided an example of the manner in which Inigo Jones' ideas on architecture were disseminated in England.The commission and construction and the building's subsequent history were examined by John Newman, \\"Nicholas Stone's Goldsmiths' Hall: Design and Practice in the 1630s\\" Architectural History 14 (1971), pp. 30-39 and 138-41; Newman brought together contemporary drawings and 17th and 18th-century prints to discuss the building's architecture. Jones himself advised the Goldsmiths' Company not to further patch its medieval fabric but build it anew. Goldsmiths Hall circa 1814. It was rebuilt following the Great Fire of London of 1666. Stone's appointment as surveyor in charge of all the workmen in the design and erection of the new hall, came after a committee of the Company had voted on competitive plans offered by ad hoc partnerships of workmen, appears to be the first instance outside the King's works in which a \\"surveyor\\", the predecessor of an architect, was engaged to oversee every detail, a process that seems to have been unfamiliar to the members of the Goldsmiths' Company.Newman 1971 p. 33. The Company's official minutes record the detailed designs, vetted by Inigo Jones, that he drew up, not merely the \\"plotts\\" or floor plans and street and courtyard elevations but the \\"Patterne of the greate gate\\" in Foster Lane and patterns for the ceiling, wainscoting and the screen in the Great Hall and wainscot panelling in the parlour and the great chamber above it. His surveillance over workmen who found themselves working in a new manner, to which their apprenticeships had not accustomed them, can be sensed in his notation concerning Cornbury Park, where he contracted to \\"dereckt all the workmen and mak all thar moldes\\", providing correctly classical profiles for mouldings for carpenters and plasterers. His fee there of ¬£1000 suggested to John Newman that he combined with the surveyorship considerable mason's work.Newman 1971 p. 32. The placement of windows in the Hall's main facade show that Stone was ahead of his time in plans, smaller windows indicate the existence of mezzanine floors, such as those that exist at Easton Neston and Kinross, these housed small informal rooms, servant's rooms and rooms for housing closestools all features which were not common place until the advent of England's brief Baroque period which began in the 1690s. When servant's became confined out of sight to their own designated areas rather than sharing rooms with their employers. This was an important milestone in English domestic design.Girouard, p138, discusses the existence and significance of these mezzanine floors. Another strong Baroque feature of Goldsmith's Hall was the massive porch, rather than a more Palladian portico, similar, but more restrained in design than that of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford, it is crowned by a broken segmented pediment - again, a strong Baroque feature. Stone's Goldsmith's Hall was burnt to a standing shell in the Great Fire of London, rebuilt, and eventually demolished in 1829. Lesser architectural commissions Stone also designed Digges chapel, Chilham church, Kent, for Sir Dudley Digges to contain his monument to Lady Digges (1631, demolished); Cornbury House, Oxfordshire, partly rebuilt by Stone 1632-33 (altered); Copt Hall, Essex, 1638-39 (demolished in 1748).John Newman, \\"Copt Hall\\", in The Country Seat, H. Colvin and John Harris, eds. (1970) pp. 18-29. He worked for Mary, Countess of Home at her London townhouse in Aldersgate and also planned a tomb for her at Dunglass in Scotland.W. G Spiers, ‚ÄòAccount Book of Nicolas Stone‚Äô, 7th Volume of the Walpole Society (Oxford, 1919), p. 117, and see her will TNA Prob/11/272/611. Private and political life Portico to the cemetery of the Zuiderkerk, attributed to Nicholas Stone In 1613 Stone married Mayken de Keyser, the daughter of his master, Hendrick de Keyser. The year after his marriage Stone returned to England with his wife, settling in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where they remained throughout their lives. The marriage produced three sons: John (1620‚Äì1667), a sculptor; Henry Stone (1616‚Äì1653) an artist most notable for his copies of Van Dyck and Nicholas (1618‚Äì1647), a sculptor, who worked under Bernini in Rome. The outbreak of the civil war put an end to Stone's career, and he was to personally suffer. Like Inigo Jones, he was seen by the Puritans as a royal architect; his son, John, fought for the Royalists during the civil war. According to a presentation to King Charles II, in 1690 after the restoration, Stone had been ‚Äòsequestered, plundered and imprisoned‚Äô because of his loyalty to the crown. Legacy Nicholas Stone died at Long Acre, London, on 24 August 1647, and was buried in the parish church at St Martin-in-the-Fields. The sculpted memorial tablet, to the man who had created so many memorials for others, has been lost; only a drawing of it (above) remains to indicate his likeness. Despite being Master Mason to the Crown, and his revolutionary works being for and commemorating the most eminent in the land and being displayed in the country's most prominent buildings, Stone was always thought of as a craftsman, and accorded that status. It was to be his contemporary and less accomplished rival, the French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur, working in bronze, who was to cause the status of a sculptor to be elevated to that of an artist. Evaluated today, Stone's architecture combines the sophisticated classicism of Jones with an uncouth Artisan Mannerism popular at the time.Oxford DNB. The architectural historian, Howard Colvin's assessment of Stone's architecture is that he \\"partly absorbed the new classicism of Inigo Jones, but without accepting its full discipline and without rejecting some of the mannerist or baroque features that he had learned in London and Amsterdam. The result was a vernacular classical architecture, of which regrettably little remains today.\\" Stone, as an architect, was at the cutting edge of modernity, his work in the Baroque style while Inigo Jones' was still promoting Palladianism was at odds with contemporary fashion, it was to be almost fifty years from Stone's death before William Talman's Chatsworth House, completed in 1696, was to be hailed as England's first Baroque house, while England's truest Baroque house, Castle Howard, was not completed until 1712.

A sequel, Journey to Venus, followed in 1895. Pope's novel is the story of a Lt. Frederick Hamilton, USN. On a voyage to Antarctica, his ship is wrecked; he and a MƒÅori sailor are cast onto a barren island. Though near the end of his endurance, Hamilton rescues a strange-looking man before he loses consciousness. He awakens three weeks later, aboard a spaceship traveling to Mars. (Hamilton at first does not realize his hosts are Martians; he suspects they might have come from within the Hollow Earth through a polar opening, as per John Symmes's theory. Pope also wrote a subterranean fiction novel.) On Pope's Mars there are three human-like races: red, yellow, and blue Martians. They have attained a sophisticated technology while preserving a feudal society (which allows for duels and swordplay), much as in Burroughs's later books. The Martians travel in \\"ethervolt cars\\" and anti-gravity aircraft; they enjoy communications devices that are equivalent to television and video telephone. Pope also provides a Martian magician who is telepathic, invokes spirits, and reads the hero's future. Hamilton has various adventures, including a romance with the yellow-complexioned Princess Suhlamia. The Martians need to relocate from their world because of impending planetary catastrophe: meteors bombard the planet (the so-called Martian canals are actually linear cities, which makes them thinner targets), and the moons Phobos and Deimos threaten to crash to the surface. Hamilton returns to Earth to try to find space for them. A Martian revolution disrupts his plans, however; he writes no account of his adventures prior to an attempt to return to the red planet. Gustavus W. Pope (1828-1902) was a physician based in Washington DC, who wrote several books on a range of subjects (including one on Shakespeare's supposed Roman Catholicism). Pope followed his Journey to Mars with Journey to Venus the Primeval World; Its Wondrous Creations and Gigantic Monsters (1895), in which Hamilton and Suhlamia visit that planet. Journey to Mars has been reprinted in two modern editions, from Hyperion Press in 1974 and from Wildside Press in 2008. The Hyperion edition features an Introduction by Sam Moskowitz.

In video self-modeling (VSM), individuals observe themselves performing a behavior successfully on video, and then imitate the targeted behavior. Video modeling has been used to teach many skills, including social skills, communication, and athletic performance; it has shown promise as an intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Important practical and theoretical questions remain largely unanswered about video modeling and other forms of video-based intervention.  Classification  Video modeling is a form of video-based intervention (VBI); other forms include video prompting, computer-based video instruction, and video priming. Several dimensions of effectiveness have been identified for VBI, but important questions regarding VBI remain largely unanswered, both practically and theoretically. The term was developed by filmmaker James Stanfield in 1999 for a \\"series of video tapes that teach appropriate social behavior to special education students, by use of professional actors and actresses who demonstrate appropriate behavior (wrong way/right way)\\".  Autism  Researchers Kathleen Mccoy and Emily Hermansen observe: > Video modeling is particularly effective in ABA programs in teaching > behaviors to children with autism (Nikopoulos & Keenan, 2006).

Video modeling has been proven to successfully teach empathy, or perspective, where other methods have failed. The ability to be able to \\"see things from another person's point of view\\" is termed theory of mind by the research community (ToM; Happe et al., 1996). This ability is well developed by the age of 4 in typical children, but appears to be delayed or absent altogether in children with ASD. Researchers Marjorie H. Charlop-Christy and Sabrina Daneshvar observe: > Video modeling was used to teach perspective taking to three children with > autism....Generalization across untrained similar stimuli was also assessed. > Video modeling was a fast and effective tool for teaching perspective-taking > tasks to children with autism, resulting in both stimulus and response > generalization. These results concurred with previous research that > perspective taking can be taught. Unlike other studies, however, wider > ranges of generalization were found. This study is significant as it illustrates the increased generalization, or continued natural use of a learned skill. This effect has been witnessed in areas ranging from the teaching of conversationCharlop, M. H., & Milstein, J. P. (1989). Teaching autistic children conversational speech using video modeling.

A specific form of video modeling based on the discrete trial method of applied behavior analysis was developed and documented by Laura Kasbar in 2000 as a way to teach children who do not respond well to other kinds of therapy, including traditional applied behavior analysis (ABA). Kasbar in 2000, and then Dunn and Dunn in 2006, recognized that the precepts of ABA, most notably the very controlled or \\"discrete\\" presentation of desired information could be more effectively taught using the video medium rather than in vivo (Dunn and Dunn, 2006).A comparison of video modeling with in vivo modeling for teaching children with autism. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 30, 537-552. Dunn, L. M., & Dunn, D. M. Using this method, retention of the information taught is greatly increased. Video modeling was also shown to be an effective way to teach older children, when many other therapy methods have been ineffectual. This work was furthered in the study, \\"Using Video-Enhanced Activity Schedules and Matrix Training to Teach Sociodramatic Play to a Child with Autism\\" by Melissa Dauphin, Elisabeth M. Kinney, Robert Stromer in their study which demonstrated video modeling's ability to improve and encourage non-scripted interaction and communication. Chistos K.

He joined the group of Arne N√¶ss, although he had a more administrative role. A son of businessman Sigurd Rinde, Erik Rinde had several contacts that proved valuable, securing the financing of early projects. In 1950, Rinde and N√¶ss founded the Institute for Social Research. Other people involved were Vilhelm Aubert and Stein Rokkan. Rinde served as both managing director and chair for many years. He left the chair in the early 1970s, but returned in 1988 following the death of Vilhelm Aubert. He was also instrumental in the foundation of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO). Rinde was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, and received an honorary degree at the University of Oslo.

Rivadavia Avenue. Avenida Rivadavia is one of the principal thoroughfares in Buenos Aires, Argentina, extending Avenida Rivadavia at Google Maps from downtown Buenos Aires to the western suburb of Merlo. History Upon the designation of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata by the Spanish Empire in 1776, the \\"Road of the Kingdom of Heaven\\" leading into Buenos Aires from the east was designated a Camino Real, a \\"Royal Road\\" fit for a Viceroy, and afforded improvements and some security. This Royal Road of the West, by 1782, traveled to Mendoza, a city over to the west (roughly along the modern National Highway 7). Dubbed Federation Road by the paramount Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1836, it was renamed in honor of former President Bernardino Rivadavia in 1857, following the reestablishment of constitutional rule. Rivadavia Avenue, downtown Buenos Aires, c. 1880. The Buenos Aires Metro, inaugurated in 1913, was extended to Rivadavia Avenue in 1926, whereby 11 of the 16 stations on line Line A were built underneath the avenue. Rivadavia was on Buenos Aires' first bus line in 1928, a development that marked the beginning of the end for the city's intricate trolley system. The establishment of the National Highway Bureau in 1932 led to the 1935 designation of the avenue, west of the Federal District, as part of National Highway 7. This change encouraged the rapid development of the suburbs west of Buenos Aires, something which, by 1970, had made the avenue among the most congested in the metro area. A rerouting of Highway 7 north of the avenue began taking shape in the late 1970s and the resulting expressway between Buenos Aires and Luj√°n was completed in 1988. Absent since 1962, a Historic Tramway Line was inaugurated along the Caballito section of Rivadavia Avenue in 1980. Approximate route Itinerary Avenida Rivadavia begins at a crosswalk between the Casa Rosada and the State Intelligence Bureau, on the northeast corner of Buenos Aires' storied Plaza de Mayo. Running westward along the plaza, the avenue passes along the National Bank of Argentina, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires and City Hall before entering the old financial district. Crossing the pedestrian Calle Florida and the massive Avenida 9 de Julio, Rivadavia merges with Avenida de Mayo at Congressional Plaza, whereby it passes between the Argentine Congress and the Art nouveau Caf√© El Molino. Passing through Plaza Miserere in the Balvanera area, nearby points of interest include the eclectic Venetian Casa de los Pavos Reales, and, in Almagro, the Art Nouveau Caf√© Las Violetas. Along Rivadavia Park, in the Caballito area, the avenue affords a view of the Monument to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, founding father to Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Nearly west of its outset by the Casa Rosada, Rivadavia Avenue passes under the General Paz Beltway into Ciudadela, thus leaving the Federal District for the Province of Buenos Aires. The thoroughfare continues through the Buenos Aires suburbs of Mor√≥n, Castelar, Ituzaing√≥, San Antonio de Padua and Merlo before crossing the Reconquista River and becoming Bartolom√© Mitre Avenue. Mitre Avenue travels west another before merging with Piovano Avenue in Moreno.

Tribute to William G Leavitt Method books Leavitt's books contain no guitar tablature and consist only of standard notation and chord symbols with occasionally written-in fingering numbers, string numbers, and position numerals. They range in level from the beginning reader to the professional. Emphasis is placed on using a guitar pick, rather than a fingerstyle approach. At the time, although many players were using picks, very few college-level educational materials existed that were specifically designed with the pick-style in mind. With the exception of Classical Studies for Pick-Style Guitar, all of Leavitt's published studies are originals. This differs from many method books that include \\"old favorites.\\" Leavitt emphasizes that when learning how to read music, students must be presented with music they don't already know.
