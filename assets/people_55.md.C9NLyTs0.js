Types of problems Here, a state space is a discrete set of configurations of a system or solutions of a combinatorial problem, called states, together with a set of allowed moves linking one state to another. Reconfiguration problems may ask: *For a given class of problems, is the state space always connected? That is, can one transform every pair of states into each other with a sequence of moves? If not, what is the computational complexity of determining whether the state space for a particular problem is connected? *What is the diameter of the state space, the smallest number such that every two states can be transformed into each other with at most moves? *Given two states, what is the complexity of determining whether they can be transformed into each other, or of finding the shortest sequence of moves for transforming one into another? *If moves are chosen randomly with a carefully chosen probability distribution so that the resulting Markov chain converges to a discrete uniform distribution, how many moves are needed in a random walk in order to ensure that the state at the end up the walk is nearly uniformly distributed? That is, what is the Markov chain mixing time? Examples Examples of problems studied in reconfiguration include: *Games or puzzles such as the 15 puzzle or Rubik's cube. This type of puzzle can often be modeled mathematically using the theory of permutation groups, leading to fast algorithms for determining whether states are connected; however, finding the state space diameter or the shortest path between two states may be more difficult. For instance, for n\\\\times n\\\\times n version's of the Rubik's cube, the state space diameter is \\\\Theta(n^2/\\\\log n), and the complexity of finding shortest solutions is unknown, but for a generalized version of the puzzle (in which some cube faces are unlabeled) it is NP-hard. Other reconfiguration puzzles such as Sokoban may be modeled as token reconfiguration but lack a group-theoretic structure. For such problems, the complexity can be higher; in particular, testing reachability for Sokoban is PSPACE-complete. *Rotation distance in binary trees and related problems of flip distance in flip graphs. A rotation is an operation that changes the structure of a binary tree without affecting the left-to-right ordering of its nodes, often used to rebalence binary search trees. Rotation distance is the minimum number of rotations needed to transform one tree into another. The same state space also models the triangulations of a convex polygon, and moves that \\"flip\\" one triangulation into another by removing one diagonal of the polygon and replacing it by another; similar problems have also been studied on other kinds of triangulation. The maximum possible rotation distance between two trees with a given number of nodes is known, but it remains an open problem whether the rotation distance between two arbitrary trees can be found in polynomial time. The analogous problems for flip distance between triangulations of point sets or non-convex polygons are NP-hard. *Reconfiguration of graph colorings. The moves that have been considered for coloring reconfiguration include changing the color of a single vertex, or swapping the colors of a Kempe chain. When the number of colors is at least two plus the degeneracy of a graph, then the state space of single-vertex recolorings is connected, and Cereceda's conjecture suggests that it has polynomial diameter. For fewer colors, some graphs have disconnected state spaces. For 3-colorings, testing global connectivity of the single-vertex recoloring state space is co-NP-complete, but when two colorings can be reconfigured to each other, the shortest reconfiguration sequence can be found in polynomial time. For more than three colors, single-vertex reconfiguration is PSPACE-complete. *Nondeterministic constraint logic is a combinatorial problem on orientations of cubic graphs whose edges are colored red and blue. In a valid state of the system, each vertex must have at least one blue edge or at least two edges coming into it. A move in this state space reverses the orientation of a single edge while preserving these constraints. It is PSPACE- complete to test whether the resulting state space is connected or whether two states are reachable from each other, even when the underlying graph has bounded bandwidth. These hardness results are often used as the basis of reductions proving that other reconfiguration problems, such as the ones arising from games and puzzles, are also hard.

In addition to her newspaper work, Moten-Foster is remembered as the first African American to broadcast from the United Nations, the first African American woman radio announcer in Indianapolis, and the first African American woman to host a television show in Indianapolis. Early life and radio career Moten-Foster was born Beatrice Moten in Selma, Alabama, on July 20, 1937. Her first job was picking cotton. In the 1960s she participated in the civil rights movement and was arrested in Talladega, Alabama for riding at the front of a bus. Upon graduating from high school, Moten-Foster moved to Birmingham and began her career as a radio journalist. She subsequently moved to Miami, where she co- hosted an all-night jazz show with Flip Wilson on radio station WFAB. After WFAB changed to an all-Spanish-language format, she moved to New York City. From 1965 to 1969, Moten-Foster hosted a radio show on WNJR called \\"African Profiles,\\" in which she profiled over 65 African diplomats. In this capacity, she was the first African American to broadcast from the United Nations. Indianapolis career Moten-Foster served as the first Black woman radio announcer in Indianapolis. Moten-Foster initially moved to Indianapolis in an effort to reconcile with her first husband, who had moved there. In the 1970s, Moten-Foster served as chair of the Indianapolis Black Bicentennial Committee. The Committee, established in 1975, was part of a broader upsurge in interest in Black history in Indiana during the 1970s. The committee intended to publish two books, but the project stalled and Moten-Foster instead completed one of the books, a cookbook, herself. Moten-Foster's resulting 1976 book 200 Years of Black Cookery is remembered as an example of the renaissance in African-American cuisine in the 1970s. The book built upon her experiences as a UN reporter in the 1960s, when she collected African recipes from many diplomats. In 1989, Moten-Foster became the announcer of a television show on WFBM-TV, the Bea Moten-Foster Show, making her the first Black woman television announcer in Indianapolis. Muncie career Moten-Foster moved from Indianapolis to Muncie in the early 1980s, subsequently marrying a Ball State University professor named Robert O. Foster. In 1991, Moten-Foster founded the Muncie Times, with an initial budget for the project was fifty dollars. It was the first Black paper serving Muncie to last for more than a few months. By the late 1990s, the Times had a circulation of about 8000, reaching 10,000 by 2011. It was published twice a month. Moten-Foster was honored as a Sagamore of the Wabash on multiple occasions, including by Evan Bayh. She was also honored as Outstanding Businessperson of the Year by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce in 1996. Death and legacy Moten-Foster died April 9, 2011. Her husband Robert O. Foster had died approximately three weeks earlier. Moten-Foster's death was remarked upon, among others, by then-United States Representative Mike Pence, who read a memorial to her on the House floor. On Moten-Foster's death, ownership of the Muncie Times passed to Moten- Foster's daughter Rev. Pamela Emmanuel, but it soon ceased publication. In 2018, a marker was added to the Muncie Walk of Fame honoring Moten-Foster and her husband.

The company focuses on artist management, production, live events, and distribution. It is also the parent company of Van Zandt's independent record label, Wicked Cool Records, and distributes Little Steven's Underground Garage.  History  After Van Zandt's 1989 album Revolution lacked attention, his then label, RCA, turned down the demos for his next album, Born Again Savage, stating that \\"rock music was over.\\" By 1994, due to the shift in popularity from rock to pop music, and his lack of a recording contract, he started to record Born Again Savage with U2 bassist Adam Clayton, eventually resulting in the creation of his own record label. After the success of the Underground Garage radio show, which first premiered on April 6, 2002, Van Zandt expanded the company to include radio, live events, TV, artist management, and a subsidiary record label, Wicked Cool Records. Musician and longtime friend of Van Zandt, Jean Beauvoir, took a break to serve as CEO and Managing Director of the company for six and a half years, from 2004 to 2011, before returning to performing. In July 2013, it was announced that Marc Brickman would become the head of Renegade Management. Van Zandt made the decision after hiring him to put together the lighting for The Rascals' Once Upon a Dream tour.  Imprints  = Wicked Cool Records = Van Zandt's record label, Wicked Cool Records, was created in 2004 with the purpose of supporting new rock bands, inspired by the Underground Garage radio show. The majority of the bands signed to the label have experience with smaller, independent labels, with rare exceptions. The label also reissues some albums that have not been previously commercially successful. In 2007, Wicked Cool had a partnership with retailer Best Buy so that albums heard on Underground Garage could be easily found in stores. The first album to be released by Wicked Cool Records was Davie Allan and the Arrows' Fuzz for the Holidays, released on December 14, 2004. Other early releases include Strange Magic by The Charms, The Mindbending Sounds of...The Chesterfield Kings, Mastermind by the Cocktail Slippers, and the tribute album CBGB Forever. The label is also known for its compilation albums Little Steven's Underground Garage presents The Coolest Songs in the World. Halloween and Christmas-themed compilations were also released beginning in 2008. In 2017, Van Zandt's album, Soulfire, was released, marking his first new solo album since 1999.

Thanetophorus cucumeris), a basidiomycete, that causes a major limitation on rice production in India and other countries of Asia, it is also found to be a problem in the southern U.S. where rice is also produced. This disease can cause yield decreases of up to 50% and cause a loss of quality. Not only does it cause lesions on the rice plant, but it can also cause pre- and post-emergence seedling blight, banded leaf blight, panicle infection, and spotted seed.  Disease cycle  Once a plant has been infected circular or oblong lesions that normally appear green-gray and water-soaked, are found on the lower leaves of rice, normally in the late tillering or early internode elongation stage of growth. The lesions then spread under favorable conditions of high humidity and low sunlight and reach the upper part of the rice plant using runner hyphae. When there is leaf dieback and sun can penetrate and dry the lesions, they turn tan with a brown border. The sclerotia are produced near the infection in about 6 days before falling off. These can then survive in the soil, before being spread as the field is prepared or when it‚Äôs flooded for irrigation. The sclerotia can then come in contact with another plant and infect it. Both the sclerotia and mycelia of Rhizoctonia solani overwinter in plant debris as well as in tropical environments where they can survive in weed hosts.  Management  = Cultural control = Not a lot of success has been found with breeding a resistant cultivar, but there are not many wild species of rice that have the resistance genes. It is widely thought that the resistance would be found in multiple genes or is controlled by quantitative trait loci, but not much has been found, so attempts at breeding resistance has been difficult. = Biological control = Not much has been done, but there is the idea that the use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) could be a form of biological control. These have been used to help with both plant growth and with helping control other soil residing bacteria, and have been seen to control bacterial pathogens by competing for space and nutrients, as well as activating plant defense mechanisms. Studies have shown that some strains of bacteria, when they‚Äôre applied to the rice seed before it‚Äôs planted, decrease the viability of the sclerotia of R. solani, reducing instances of disease and increasing yield. Some species of potential antagonists that could become biocontrol agents are a few strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens that inhibit the mycelial growth and sclerotia germination. = Chemical control = The main control method of sheath blight is through the use of both systemic and nonsystemic fungicides, of which the systemic are seen to be more effective. The use of this method of control allows fewer instances of disease, less inoculum and better yields. One of the chemical controls used often is azoxystrobin, a QOI that prevents the respiration of fungi. Resistant cultivars of plants have not been found and cultural controls are impractical, so chemical control is currently the best option in terms of controlling this disease.  Pathogenesis  Once the rice sheath has been inoculated the pathogen forms an appressorium and infection cushions. Both intercellular and intracellular hyphae are formed in both the epidermal and mesophyll cells. The pathogen then releases many cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) that contribute to lesion formation and spreading, some of those are polygalacturonase, cellulase, pectin methylgalacturonase, and polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase. The ShB pathogen also produces toxins that inhibit rice radicle growth and wilting of the leaves. The main contributors to pathogenesis by the ShB pathogen, is from secreted hormones, Cytochrome P450s (a family of enzymes that is involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormones), and growth hormones.

It was lit for the Opening Ceremony of the regional games which was held at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan. Design The cauldron. The 2019 Southeast Asian Games cauldron including its backdrop and podium was designed by Ma√±osa & Co. Inc. (MCI) of Filipino architect and National Artist Francisco Ma√±osa. Ma√±osa himself was involved in the design process despite him already in poor health and in early stages of dementia when his family firm was approached by the Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC) in January 2019 to design a cauldron for the games. Despite unable to draw by that time, Ma√±osa was able to give direction regarding the design of the cauldron verbally. The architect viewed videos of Olympic cauldron on YouTube as part of the design process and concluded that the 2019 Southeast Asian Games cauldron \\"must be Filipino\\" and directed his firm to look into his original design for the unbuilt Centennial Tower which was inspired from the sulo, a traditional Filipino torch. MCI presented two other designs to the PHISGOC. PHISGOC selected the design which was made by Ma√±osa himself. MCI did not disclose which among the three proposals were made by Ma√±osa beforehand. The cauldron's design consists of the following: *Three main pillars which represents the Philippines' main island groupings; Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao *17 sub-pillars for the 17 regions of the country *11 segments in the tower and 11 steps on the podium for the 11 countries participating at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. The cauldron was originally planned to be high so that the flame would be visible from inside the Athletics Stadium but the planned height was reduced to . The cauldron was elevated by a podium. A foreign company was responsible for cauldron the flame mechanism. Construction MCI supervised the construction of the cauldron ensuring that its design for the structure was followed. Different firms were contracted for the construction of the podium, the fabrication of the tower, and the cauldron itself. Cost The Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC) requested a budget of for the cauldron from the Philippine Sports Commission which handled the fund provided by the national government for the organization of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. The breakdown of the budget for the cauldron is as follows: * ‚Äì design * ‚Äì foundation construction * ‚Äì construction and installation of the cauldron itself * ‚Äì wrist tags Days leading to the 2019 Southeast Asian Games the construction of the cauldron was met with criticism due to its cost. Senator Franklin Drilon pejoratively called the cauldron a kaldero () questioning the cost of the structure saying the money spent for it could have been used to build 50 classrooms. Senator Alan Peter Cayetano who is also the chairman of the organizing committee of the games defended the cauldron as \\"priceless work of art\\" and pointed out that the cauldron used in the 2015 Southeast Asian Games in Singapore was more expensive at .

The piece contains seven movements, each of which quotes the last words of an unarmed black man before he was killed. Thompson has said that in composing the piece, he \\"used the liturgical format in Haydn's Seven Last Words of Christ in an effort to humanize these men and to reckon with my identity as a black man in this country in relation to this specific scourge of police brutality.\\" He was also inspired by the illustrations of Iranian-American artist Shirin Barghi. It was premiered in 2016 by the University of Michigan Men's Glee Club under the direction of Eugene Rogers. Rogers said, > \\"...I hesitated before taking it to my glee club; I did not want them to > think I was pushing an agenda. At the same time, repertoire that deals with > issues of social justice is important to me, a part of my philosophy of > teaching. It engages our audience, builds a strong sense of community > amongst our singers, and can foster musical ubuntu. As Nelson Mandela > defined the philosophy, ubuntu holds that our personal humanity is dependent > on the humanity of others. Providing a safe place for students to express > and process issues that affect us all can be very rewarding and act as > another vehicle for bringing change to our world. With all of that in mind, > I decided to introduce the piece to the chorus. Initially, some members felt > performing it would be overly political. We talked about their concerns, and > some wrote essays about them. Together we found resonance in the central > theme of loss, and that enabled us to get through the journey. Some of our > audience expressed similar misgivings, but most of the response was > extremely positive.\\" The song has also been performed by the Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra (with The Village Square, the Florida A&M; Concert Choir, the Morehouse College Glee Club), the Chicago Sinfonietta, the Boston Children's Chorus, and the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. The work has been subject to renewed interest in 2020 https://www.clickondetroit.com/all-about-ann-arbor/2020/06/05/social- justice-music-project-debuted-at-u-m-back-in-national-spotlight-amid- protests/https://www.wqxr.org/story/hear-me-out-seven-last- words/https://www.sfcv.org/article/recommended-streaming-from-the-interwebs after the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests and outbreak of police violence. The song is often followed by a performance of the song \\"Glory,\\" from the 2014 film Selma. Said Rogers, > \\"The impact of 'Seven Last Words of the Unarmed' is sobering, as it ought to > be, but at the premiere we wanted to leave our audience with a message of > hope. With that in mind, we transitioned without pause to a choral > arrangement of 'Glory,' which John Legend and Common wrote for the film > Selma.

She is Honorary Senior Lecturer in Linguistics at the University of Sydney. Caffarel is recognized for the development of a Systemic Functional Grammar of French which has been applied in the teaching of the French language, Discourse analysis and Stylistics at the University of Sydney. Caffarel is recognised as an expert in the field of French Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Biography Caffarel was born in Bordeaux, France in 1961 and moved to Australia in 1983. She began her undergraduate studies in Linguistics at the University of Sydney in 1987 and graduated in 1991 with First Class Honours. Her Honours thesis research on the semantics of French tense was published in 1992. She went on to complete a PhD in Linguistics at the University of Sydney in 1996. Her PhD thesis was a prolegomena to a Systemic Functional grammar of French. Her first academic appointment was at the University of Sydney in 1996 as Associate Lecturer which was then was converted into a tenured full time lecturing position in 1998. In 1996 and 1999 Caffarel co-organised the First and Second Systemic Functional Typology/Topology Workshops with Professor J.R. Martin. Papers from these workshops were compiled into a volume (published December 2004) which she co- edited with J.R. Martin, C.M.I.M. Matthiessen (Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University). In 2003, Caffarel was awarded a Faculty of Arts Teaching Excellence Award at the University of Sydney. Since joining the French Studies Department in 1996, Caffarel has expanded the linguistic curriculum and taught a number of linguistic units on language development, language teaching methodology, functional grammar, discourse analysis, ideology in news, and stylistics. She became Chair of the French Studies Department at the University of Sydney in 2009 until mid-2011. In addition to her work in expanding the linguistic curriculum in the Department of French Studies, Caffarel has published a number of books and book chapters on French grammar. One of her latest works is a book chapter, The Verbal Group in French, in The Routledge Handbook of Systemic Functional Linguistics. Contributions to linguistics Caffarel has made major contributions to the development of a Systemic Functional Language theory of the French language. Her work on developing a Systemic Functional Grammar of French is unique as \\"it is discourse-based and provides an interpretation of grammar which reflects how French speakers/writers make meaning in various contexts of use\\". M.A.K. Halliday, in the foreword to her 2006 mongraph, described her contribution to theory in the following way: > The consistent interplay between theoretical and applied pursuits has always > been a defining feature of systemic functional theory, where no clear line > is drawn between application and theory and each is a souce fo positive > input to the other. This kind of mutual enrichment is clearly demonstrated > in Alice Caffarel‚Äôs work. The result is a description which penetrates to > the heart of the language, revealing it at one and the same time as a > specimen of the human semiotic and a unique resource for the continuous > creation of meaning. (Halliday, 2006: i) Her work has been used as an instrumental resource in the discourse analysis and interpretation of French texts, and her work has also been used as a model for developing descriptions of other languages from a Systemic Functional perspective. In addition to her ongoing description of French as a tool for the analysis of meaning, from 2005 to 2010, Caffarel also worked with a number of Systemic Functional Linguistics researchers from universities around Australia on an international news project which analysed the coverage of news on the Middle East in various languages, looking at ideology and text structure. Caffarel's current work focuses on developing the first comprehensive account of the language of the influential French writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. This project aims to elucidate Beauvoir‚Äôs use of language as a mode of action and tool for change by analysing recurrent linguistic choices that are significant to her philosophy and to the communicative force of her writings. It explores the aspects of Beauvoir‚Äôs language that, on the one hand, contribute a particular vision of the world that promotes freedom and change, and, on the other hand, extend agency and transcendence to her readers.

The name \\"Valhalla Mountains\\" first appeared in George Mercer Dawson's Geological Survey of Canada map published in 1890. Dawson applied names derived from Scandinavian mythology to several of the mountain ranges and peaks in Southern Kootenay. In keeping with the Valhalla theme, this peak's name was submitted February 1970 by Robert Dean of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club for consideration, and it was officially adopted March 3, 1971, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Asgard, according to Norse mythology, is the section of Valhalla where the twelve gods dwell. Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Asgard Peak has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. This climate supports a small glacier on the peak's north slope.

They are recognized for their work and writings surrounding LGBT life as a South African, and they are best known for their memoir Black Bull, Ancestors and Me: My Life as a Lesbian Sangoma.  Early life and family  Nkabinde was born on December 7, 1975 in Soweto in Gauteng, South Africa in the midst of apartheid and six months prior to the Soweto uprising. Nkabinde‚Äôs mother, Sibongile, went into labor without her husband present because he was a truck driver who worked away from home. Her friend, Mamtshali, aided her when she went into labor, and she ran outside to find transportation to the hospital. While rushing, Mamtshali left her dompas behind, so she was aggressively arrested by police, and a neighbor had to transport Sibongile to the hospital. Mamtshali was also pregnant at the time and went into an early labor at the same hospital as Sibongile because of the aggressive force used by police officers. The baby died because it was delivered too premature to survive. That same evening, Sibongile gave birth to twins which are considered bad luck in Zulu culture. The first baby was a boy who died during childbirth. The second baby was Nkabinde, and they were named Nkunzi, or \\"black bull,\\" after their male ancestor. On the day of Nkabinde‚Äôs birth, there were multiple deaths in their family, including their twin brother, paternal grandmother, and maternal uncle. This was considered extremely bad luck in their culture, and followed Nkabinde throughout their life.  Gender identity and pronouns  Nkabinde was on a journey of self- discovery as they explored the intersections of their sexuality and gender identity. Initially, they identified as a lesbian sangoma and represented this within the majority of their work. Towards the end of their lifetime, they began to reimagine their identity as a transgender man. Academic Ruth Morgan, who has worked closely with Nkabinde, reports that they had intentions to release a book about their experiences as a transgender man before their death. As Nkabinde‚Äôs life was cut short during this journey, it is unsure which gender pronouns would best reflect their gender identity. Some scholars refer to Nkabinde with feminine ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù pronouns which is what Nkabinde used for themself in their autobiography. Others use ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù as gender neutral pronouns and few use ‚Äúhe/him‚Äù as masculine pronouns.  Life as a sangoma  After their mother passed away, Nkabinde was summoned to become a sangoma. Initially, they resisted until they were bombarded with voices, dreams, and other supernatural forces that urged them to give into becoming a sangoma. A woman came to them in their dream and told them to stop being stubborn because they were destined to perform this work. Eventually, they submitted and began their training. Once Nkabinde began to train as a sangoma, their trainer said that their lesbianism would be gone by the end of the process. However, after Nkabinde completed their training and became a sangoma, their attraction to women only grew stronger. Nkabinde's abilities as a sangoma include connecting with and controlling their ancestors to manipulate herbs and cure illnesses.  Academic work  Nkabinde has produced a variety of work and has conducted research surrounding LGBT identity as a sangoma in South Africa. This work encompasses journal articles, a documentary, and an autobiography. Nkabinde's work has been perceived as activism because its existence and publication challenges Zulu tradition and the concept that homosexuality is \\"un-African.\\" In doing so, Nkabinde helps to amplify other LGBTQ narratives in South Africa and around the continent. Nkabinde's most popular work is their memoir, Black Bull, Ancestors and Me: My Life as a Lesbian Sangoma. Within the book, they explain their familial history and culture, particularly the importance of their ancestors and how this impacts their life. They also explore their strong and unwavering attraction to women throughout the book, and their dream of having a penis. They explain how the male ancestor after which they were named is dominant, present in their life, and influences their sexuality, including their identity as a lesbian. They attribute many of their strong sexual urges for women to the desires of their dominant male ancestor, Nkunzi. In 2004, Nkabinde joined Busi Kheswa to interview same-sex sangomas and presented this research with Ruth Morgan, the Director of the Gay and Lesbian Archives in South Africa (GALA). They shared their findings in Dublin, Ireland at a lesbian conference. Nkabinde was involved with the African Women's Life Story project. This project was one of GALA's and it was for the Sex and Secrecacy Conference at Wits University. Nkabinde's work consisted of workshops, same-sex life story research of women sangomas, and a presentation of their findings. This research is the basis of the chapter that Nkabinde co- wrote in Tommy Boys, Lesbian Men, and Ancestral Wives: Female Same-Sex Practices in Africa. Nkabinde explains that this interview work for GALA drastically altered their view of the world and changed the way they perceived their own culture and lifestyle. Nkabinde can be seen on Season Three of The Big Debate, entitled Is Homosexuality un-African?. During this episode, they explain their perspective as a lesbian sangoma on how they do not believe homosexuality to be un-African. They spread awareness on the existence of LGBT sangomas in African culture and challenge the idea that the identities and lifestyles of those in the LGBT community are inherently un-African.\\"Is Homosexuality Un-African?\\" The Big Debate.

She is an associate professor in the School of the Arts and Media at the University of New South Wales, Australia. Her research expertise includes multimodal communication, museum communication, discourse analysis, and systemic functional grammar, using the frameworks of Systemic Functional Linguistics, Social Semiotics, and Multimodal Discourse Analysis. Ravelli has authored a number of books in linguistics, multimodality, and museum studies, including Multimodality in the Built Environment: Spatial Discourse Analysis (with Robert McMurtrie, 2016), Doctoral Writing in the Creative and Performing Arts (with Brian Paltridge and Sue Starfield, 2014), and Museum Texts: Communication Frameworks (2006).  Biography  Ravelli grew up and attended school in Parkes, New South Wales. Ravelli completed a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Linguistics at the University of Sydney, Australia in 1985, followed by a Master of Philosophy in 1987 at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.

She is a Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. Her major contributions are based on the discourse of social media and ambient affiliation (how people bond online). Her work is interdisciplinary and covers studies in systemic functional linguistics (SFL), corpus linguistics, multimodality, social media, online discourse and social semiotics. Zappavigna is the author of six books and numerous journal articles covering these disciplines.  Biography  Zappavigna was born in 1978 and educated in Sydney, Australia. She received her PhD in Information Systems from the University of Sydney in 2007. A book based on her PhD research was published in 2013, titled Tacit Knowledge and Spoken Discourse. From 2008 to 2012, Zappavigna was an Australian Research Council (ARC) Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Linguistics, University of Sydney. She worked on the ARC project Enacting Reconciliation: Negotiating meaning in Youth Justice Conferencing, a research project that analysed Youth Justice Conferencing in Australia from the perspectives of functional linguistics and performance studies with J.R. Martin and Paul Dwyer. A book based on this research project, Discourse and Diversionary Justice: An Analysis of Ceremonial Redress in Youth Justice Conferencing, with J.R. Martin, was published in 2018. In 2013, Zappavigna was appointed a Lecturer in the School of the Arts and Media at the University of New South Wales. Since 2016, Zappavigna has been a Senior Lecturer in the School of the Arts and Media, University of New South Wales.  Contributions to Linguistics  Major contributions by Zappavigna include work based on the discourse of Twitter, ambient affiliation and social semiotic multimodal approaches to social photography. = Discourse of Twitter and Ambient Affiliation = Zappavigna has published widely on the discourse of Twitter and has made major contributions to research on 'ambient affiliation' - how people bond online. Her journal article published in New Media & Society in 2011, \\"Ambient affiliation: a linguistic perspective on Twitter\\", has been widely cited and is the first example of a systemic functional linguistics approach being applied to the discourse of Twitter and the use of the hashtag as a linguistic marker, making language \\"searchable\\". Zappavigna's 2012 book, Discourse of Twitter and Social Media: How We Use Language to Create Affiliation on the Web, expands upon the concept of \\"ambient affiliation\\" introduced in her 2011 journal article and, as a review by Rachelle Vessey states, \\"ultimately it presents new and innovative ways of approaching the discourse of Twitter, a type of data that had yet to be examined from a linguistic perspective\\". Zappavigna has also co-authored a book with Ruth Page, David Barton, Johann Wolfgang Unger, Researching Language and Social Media, that makes a contribution regarding different linguistic approaches to the analysis of social media. In 2018, Zappavigna published another book on the discourse of Twitter, with a focus on the functional contexts of hashtags: Searchable Talk: Hashtags and Social Media Metadiscourse. This book makes a major contribution to the study of hashtags as evaluative markers and expands upon Zappavigna's work on ambient affiliation. A review by Mark McGlashan writes that \\"not only does this monograph flesh out Zappavigna‚Äôs SFL-based approach to the examination of social media communication, it provides the most comprehensive account of hashtags from a social semiotic/SFL perspective that I am aware of, and will be of interest to researchers and research students alike\\". = Social Photography = Zappavigna has contributed to studies regarding social photography and the selfie. In collaboration with Sumin Zhao from the University of Edinburgh, she has developed a new social semiotic multimodal framework for interpreting the selfie. This involves interpreting the selfie in terms of \\"intersubjectivity\\" and classifying the selfie according to five sub-types: presented, mirrored, inferred, implied and still life. This framework has been applied to a diverse range of topics including selfies in mommyblogging, digital scrapbooks, decluttering vlogs on YouTube, and cyclist Instagram posts.

They were facelifted versions of the earlier BX/FX trucks, retaining those trucks Type B and Type F six-cylinder petrol engines. The first letter in the model name indicates the engine family fitted; in 1957 the Type D diesel engine was introduced in a model known as the DA. The second letter indicated the size of the truck, with shorter medium duty versions being coded BC/FC/DC. A second letter \\"B\\" was used on bus versions of this chassis. A second generation FA/DA was introduced in 1964 and was built in Japan until 1980, when Hino replaced Toyota's heavier truck lines entirely. The DA, however, was also built in numerous other countries and manufacture continued into the first decade of the 21st century. First generation (1954) Introduced in February 1954, the original models were trucks (BA and FA respectively) on a wheelbase. Visible changes vis-a-vis the earlier BX and FX trucks were mainly limited to a new grille, but the F engine in the FA was upgraded, gaining ten horsepower for a total output of at 3000 rpm. The BA's Type B engine still produced at 3000 rpm. In March the BC model was added, followed by the F-engined FC in June. The BC and FC have a wheelbase and were often used as tractor units. Toyota FA80 (1959-1961) The heavier FA sold very well in a changing Japanese trucking market which was moving to larger loads and greater distances. Accordingly, in September 1954 Toyota lengthened the FA's chassis and upgraded it to carry 5 tonnes, renaming it the FA5. The smaller BA and BC were discontinued in February and July of 1956. Also in February 1956, the FA5 was facelifted with a wider grille and equipped with a transmission with synchromesh on second through fourth gear (a first for the segment in Japan) and renamed the FA60. The new name did not reflect a change in payload, which remained at . Simultaneously, the lighter FC received similar changes, becoming the FC60 in the process. The FC60 became the FC70 in January 1958, reflecting an increased compression ratio and a power increase to for the F engine. Along with a payload upgrade to it was renamed the FC80 in November 1959. This was kept in production until September 1964, when it was replaced by the second generation FC100. The FA60 became the FA70 in January 1958, with the same engine upgrade as for the FC70. The heavier part of the F-engined range was split into two in September 1959, with the FA80 and FA90 being built to handle respectively; these model codes were again maintained until the first generation was replaced. In March 1957 the diesel-engined DA60 was introduced. The all new \\"D\\" engine was a pre-combustion diesel straight-six displacing and producing at 2600 rpm. The DA60 also prompted Toyota to introduce the new Toyota Diesel Store sales network, which remained until 1988 and was the exclusive distributor of Toyota's diesel-engined vehicles in Japan. This became the DA70 at the beginning of 1958. As with the petrol-engined models, the diesel lineup was split into the 5-tonne DA80 and the 6-tonne DA90 in September 1959. Unlike the petrol-engined models, however, the 6-tonne diesels also received a new, larger and more powerful engine. The 2D displaces and produces . There were also the long-wheelbase DA95/FA95, with between the axles. Some diesel-engined models carry an \\"H\\" suffix (such as a DA90-H); this signifies a model with a two-speed rear axle, giving a total of eight forward speeds. =Appearance= In late 1959 the lineup was refreshed and the grille was changed to incorporate two yellow marker lights. In late 1961 (for the 1962 model year) the range was facelifted again, with a single-piece curved windshield replacing the earlier split unit. This was Japan's first heavy truck with such a fitment. At the same time, the grille was stamped directly with widely spaced \\"TOYOTA\\" lettering rather than having chromed letters mounted to a red bar as earlier. Cabover trucks With the sales of bonneted trucks slowing down in Japan at this time, reflecting ever more congested city streets, Toyota developed a cab-over version on a wheelbase. Based on the medium-duty FC80 model, the new DC80C was presented in October 1963, fitted with the D-type diesel engine and a tilting cab. As with the bonneted models, the 5.9-liter D-type six-cylinder engine develops . Because the engine was mounted between the seats, the cabover model could only take two occupants. The DC80C initially sold very well, but problems with the drivetrain as well as the chassis meant that it soon lost out to its competitors. At the same time as the DC80C, the petrol-engined FC100C with was also introduced. The cabovers received a facelift in September 1966. The 4-ton cabover trucks were both replaced by the new Toyota Massy Dyna in September 1969. There was also a heavier-duty version, called the FA115C or DA115C depending on engine fitment. They sit on a wheelbase and were introduced in September 1964; the DA115C received the enlarged 2D diesel engine with . After an engine revision in April 1977, this engine produced at 2800 rpm and torque increased to at 1400 rpm. The DA115C was kept in production until February 1980. It thus outlived the bonneted FA/DA-series which it preceded. The 6-tonne cabovers have a longer cab to accommodate a small sleeping area behind the front seats. There are also period brochures from 1963/1964 showing a model called the DA95C, using the 2D engine and a version of the DA115C cab with unusual additional small windows flanking the grille. Second generation (1964) Appearing in September 1964, the second generation adopted a new squared-off cab with twin headlights. Wheelbases were adjusted upwards, to . The longest wheelbase was installed in the 115-series, the shorter ones were 100- and 110-series. The chassis was modified for increased rigidity and the suspension was strengthened. The glass area of the cabin was increased and a dished steering wheel was adopted for safety. These moves were intended to make the truck a more capable proposition on Japan's newly developed highways. At the time of introduction, there were six main models available: The 100-series is a truck, fitted with either the F or the D engine. The 110- and 115-series are rated for , and received the F or the larger 2D diesel engine. A month after the heavy-duty models, the FC100 was introduced. Power output for the F as well as the 2D engines were at the time of introduction. The diesel unit, however, offered considerably higher torque, at versus .Japanese motor vehicles guide book 1968/1969, p. 197 The 5.9-liter D engine produces and of torque at 1200 rpm. In June 1965, the extra long-wheelbase, 6-tonne DA116 was introduced.Shibusawa Shashi Database, p.104 The FC100 was taken out of production in March 1974. Around this time, the series was also facelifted. The new models have a grille with four central openings flanked by six openings on either side, rather than the earlier seven-bar grille. The engine badges were removed from the front fenders, and the identification script between the door and the bonnet now read simply \\"TOYOTA\\" rather than TOYOTA 5000 or 6000 depending on the weight rating. In January 1975, petrol-engined FAs changed over to the 4.2-liter 2F engine. In April 1977 the 2D engine was thoroughly overhauled, to further increase reliability over the earlier, somewhat troublesome Toyota diesels. Petrol-engined Toyota FA100 fire engine in Thailand. In many markets, petrol engines were reserved for such applications where quick starting and strong performance were essential. Japanese production of the second generation DA/FA ended in 1978 in favor of subsidiary brand Hino Motors. The DA/FA was also assembled in several other countries, however, including but not limited to Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, and South Africa. In Indonesia it was nicknamed \\"Toyota Buaya\\" (Alligator Toyota), a reference to the alligator-style bonnet. Indonesian sales began in 1969 under the auspices of Astra International until the formation of the Toyota Astra Motor (TAM) joint venture in 1971. TAM built a dedicated plant for the FA/DA in 1973 and exported SKD kits to various countries, including Nigeria and Australia. Indonesian models were facelifted in 1976 and post- facelift models were painted moss green as standard; they continued in local production until 1986. Kenyan assembly began in 1977, while South African-made trucks began using locally made engines in May 1982. Production in South Africa continued until 2001, over twenty years after Japanese manufacture had ended.

O'Halloran (born 1958) is an Australian-born academic in the field of multimodal discourse analysis. She is Chair Professor and Head of Department of Communication and Media in the School of the Arts at the University of Liverpool and Visiting Distinguished Professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University (2017‚Äì2020). She is the founding director of the Multimodal Analysis Laboratory of the Interactive and Digital Media Institute (IDMI) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). She is widely known for her development of systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) and its application in the realm of mathematical discourse and multimodal text construction. Her current work involves the development and use of digital tools and techniques for multimodal analysis and mixed methods approaches to big data analytics.  Biography  O'Halloran was born in 1958. Her early teaching career in mathematics led her to pursue a more sophisticated model of discourse analysis for the discipline of mathematics. This she found in the systemic functional linguistics of M.A.K. Halliday. She received her PhD at Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia in 1996, and then held a postdoctoral position at Martin Luther University in Halle (Saale), Germany from 1997 to 1998. Following her move to the National University of Singapore in 1998, where she initially worked in the Department of the English Language & Literature, she established (2007) and directed the Multimodal Analysis Lab in the Interactive & Digital Media Institute, and from 2012 to 2013, she was the Deputy Director of Interactive & Digital Media Institute. O'Halloran returned to Australia in 2013 to take up a professorship at Curtin University (2013 to 2019). Her research involves the study of the integration of language, images and other resources (e.g. gesture, movement, 3D objects and space) in texts, interactions and events, and her current work involves the development and use of digital tools and techniques for multimodal analysis and mixed methods approaches to big data analytics.  Contributions to SF-MDA  O'Halloran's major contribution to scholarship is in the realm of multimodal discourse analysis. She is internationally known for developing systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) approaches to mathematical discourse and multimodal texts (O'Toole 2012). Her research in multimodal approaches to mathematics is having a major impact in education (see e.g. Moschkovich (2010) Language and Mathematics Education: Multiple Perspectives and Directions for Research).Mary J Schleppegrell (2007) The Linguistic Challenges of Mathematics Teaching and Learning: A Research Review, Reading & Writing Quarterly, 23:2, 139-159, Her 2005 monograph, Mathematical Discourse, has received high praise.

She specialises in the field of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) and has completed research in language and literacy education, writing development, pedagogic grammar, genre theory, and teaching English as a mother tongue and as a second language.  Biography  Christie was born in Sydney in 1939. She was educated at Cremorne Girls' High School and completed a BA majoring in English and history, and a Dip Ed., at the University of Sydney. Her teaching career took her to schools in rural New South Wales and to London in the UK. While completing a Master of Education at the University of Sydney (1977), Christie was highly influenced by the outstanding scholar of the history of educational theory, curriculum design and pedagogical principles in the western tradition, W. F. Connell (1916-2001), and focused her thesis on the history of English teaching in the Australian colony of NSW. During her time with the Australian federal government Curriculum Development Centre, Canberra (1978-81), Christie worked on the national Language Development Project (LDP), a curriculum development initiative addressing the English oral language and literacy needs of children in the upper primary to junior secondary school years. At the same time, she was studying and working with M. A. K. Halliday, a consultant on the LDP, at the University of Sydney. She completed a PhD on early primary school writing development (supervised by J.R. Martin, University of Sydney) in 1990. Her academic career took her to Melbourne, to Deakin University (1985‚Äì90), to Darwin (1990‚Äì94) to the then Northern Territory University (now known as Charles Darwin University) and back to Melbourne (1994) where she was appointed Foundation Professor of Language and Literacy Education at the University of Melbourne, a position she held till her retirement in 2002, when she was appointed emeritus professor. She also holds an honorary professorship at the University of Sydney.  Career  Her work on the English language curriculum was not without controversy, based as it was in a model of language development inspired by the work of M.A.K. Halliday. The model centred on three core areas: learning language (i.e. the basic resources of sound, grammar, commenced in infancy); learning through language (i.e. simultaneously learning to use language to shape experience, create relationships, make sense of the world); and learning about the language (i.e. learning about the resource that is one‚Äôs language, where the latter is primarily a responsibility of schooling). At the time, English teachers resisted any formal talk of teaching knowledge about language. However, Christie argued that language study should be about building a knowledge of the language with which to live and to go on learning, and this meant bringing knowledge about language (KAL) into focus. Christie also noticed and nurtured valuable connections between the work of Basil Bernstein, the SFL model and pedagogy, bringing Bernstein to Melbourne in 1996 to collaborate. Her most recent collaboration with Beverly Derewianka (University of Wollongong) was an Australian Research Council (2004-6) funded project investigating the key indicators of development in adolescent writing in English, History and Science. The book 'School Discourse' (2008) that Christie and Derewanka co- authored out of this project was described by Prof Mary Schleppegrell (School of Education, University of Michigan, USA) as \\"a tremendous contribution to our understanding of the paths learners follow in written language development from early childhood to late adolescence\\". Chistie has also been instrumental in bringing the work of other scholars to publication, for example in the Series on Language Education she edited for Oxford University Press. Christie has made a significant contribution to educational linguistics and to the development of the English language curriculum in Australia. She was also the founding President (1995-7) of the Australian Systemic Functional Linguistics Association (ASFLA).  Key publications  Christie, F. & K. Watson 1972. Language and the Mass Media.

Eggins is the author of a best selling introduction to systemic functional linguistics and she is known for her extensive work on critical linguistic analysis of spontaneous interactions in informal and institutional healthcare settings.  Biography  Suzanne Eggins was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire UK, to Australian parents living and working in the UK at the time. After her family returned to Australia, she grew up in Inverell, New South Wales and then moved to Sydney. After completing her Bachelor of Arts, Honours (first class) at the University of Sydney in 1982, she started a master's degree in linguistics on ergativity in English under the supervision of Michael Halliday. She decided to defer this admission when she was awarded a scholarship from the French government. From September 1983 to June 1985, she studied at the Universit√© de Nancy II (now Universit√© de Lorraine), completing a Ma√Ætrise des Sciences du Langage and a Dipl√¥me des Etudes Approfondies, under the direction of Philip Riley and Henri Holec. Upon returning to Australia in mid-1985, she resumed her deferred postgraduate degree (converted to a PhD) under the supervision of Michael Halliday and J. R. Martin at the University of Sydney. In 1986/1987, Eggins was asked to lecture the course ‚ÄòLanguage as Content‚Äô for students preparing to study the MA in Applied Linguistics at the University of Sydney and these lectures formed the basis of the first edition of her book 'An Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics' in 1994. She received her PhD in 1991 and the title of her thesis was 'Keeping the conversation going: A systemic-functional analysis of conversational structure in casual sustained talk'. From 1992 to 2006, Eggins was an academic at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) School of English (now a part of UNSW School of the Arts and Media), with a period as a Head of School (2001‚Äì2003). During this time, she developed a number of courses focusing on systemic functional linguistics, text analysis, children's literature and literacy, and professional writing. In 2005, she also formalised her interests in editing, literary studies and writing by completing a master of arts in professional communication at Deakin University. From 2007 to 2009, she was the Editor of The School Magazine, which is a suite of illustrated literary magazines for children widely distributed throughout primary schools across Australia. Before accepting a role of an Honorary Fellow at Australian National University in 2017, she had spent seven years at The University of Technology Sydney as a Research Fellow involved in a national study of clinical handover communication led by Prof Diana Slade and funded by Australian Research Council.  Contributions to linguistics  = An Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics = To cater for the needs of undergraduate UNSW students coming from educational rather than linguistic backgrounds, Suzanne Eggins converted her lecture notes into a textbook introducing systemic functional linguistics. The first edition closely followed Michael Halliday‚Äôs 'Introduction to Functional Grammar' (IFG) and was intended to contextualise it within social functional linguistic theory. Furthermore, it aimed to provide analysed examples of ‚Äòreal texts‚Äô, rather than the short clause-length examples that students encountered in Halliday's IFG. The book concentrated on clause-level grammar and grammar‚Äôs interface with social life through chapters on genre, register and cohesion. When first published, the 'Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics was one of only two or three introductory books on systemic functional linguistics available. It was critically acclaimed, quickly becoming a bestseller. In his book review for the 'Functions of Language' journal, Martin Davis said, \\"I would put a copy [of this textbook] in the hands of every teacher in training in the UK - not just teachers of English and not teachers only in schools: university teachers in English-speaking institutions world-wide, or whatever discipline, would profit greatly from it.\\" The second edition of the book was published in 2004 and it includes a chapter on the clause complex and draws on a wider variety of textual examples, including literary texts and writing by children. It also reflects a more ‚Äòcritical‚Äô approach to applying functional grammar that had been developing as a result of the rise of Norman Fairclough‚Äôs work on Critical Discourse Analysis. = Analysing casual conversation = Eggins is the co-author of the book 'Analysing Casual Conversation' Using casual conversation from workplaces and social settings, the book offers the first critical and theorised account of conversation within systemic functional linguistics and provides practical analytical tools for researchers working on spoken interaction. According to Suzan Feez, \\"the insights contained in the material are made available both for theoretical pursuit within the academy and for more practical application in the classroom.\\" = Healthcare communication = As National Linguist on the ARC- funded project ‚ÄòEffective Communication in Clinical Handover‚Äô, Eggins carried out linguistic ethnographic fieldwork at a metropolitan public hospital and advised research teams in other states on the analysis and interpretation of language data. With Diane Slade, she observed and recorded hundreds of hours of nursing and medical clinical handovers. Afterwards, they published widely on the communication patterns and developed training courses for nurses in ‚Äòbetter bedside handovers‚Äô that have been delivered to several hundred nurses at Canberra Hospital. This training has since been adapted and delivered at hospitals in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Australia. .  Selected publications  = Books = * Eggins, S. (2004).

He attended the United States Naval Academy, where he played college football for the Navy Midshipmen from 2016 to 2019. The son of United States Army personnel, Perry was a military brat who grew up in Tennessee. After high school and attending the Naval Academy Preparatory School, he joined the main campus and football team in 2016, where he played a variety of positions. He cycled between quarterback and slotback for his first two seasons before becoming the starting quarterback in 2018. After struggling that year and returning to slotback, he permanently reverted to quarterback in 2019. As a senior, he set various Navy and NCAA records, including the most rushing yards by a quarterback in a season, and was named American Athletic Conference (AAC) Offensive Player of the Year. He was selected by the Dolphins in the seventh round (246th overall) of the 2020 NFL Draft. Early life Perry was born in Fort Campbell, where his parents Bonny and Malcolm Sr. were stationed as members of the United States Army. The family later moved to Clarksville, Tennessee. After growing up with basketball, Perry began playing football in third grade. He attended Kenwood High School, where he played high school football for the Knights. He was named the team's quarterback in his sophomore year and led the team to three consecutive Class 5A state playoff appearances; all three postseason runs ended with losses to opponents that would make the state championship (with two winning). Perry's junior year saw him record 1,000 yards each in rushing and passing, a performance that ClarksvilleNow.com's Jimmy Trodglen wrote \\"almost carried the Knights offense alone.\\" In his senior season in 2014, he recorded 800 passing yards, 1,600 rushing yards, and 20 touchdowns as he was named District 10 Most Valuable Player and The Leaf-Chronicle All Area Player of the Year. Perry concluded his high school career with two All-State selections. College career After high school, Perry contemplated attending Middle Tennessee State University, where his older sister's friends played college football, or enlisting in the armed forces. Although he hoped to play running back for the University of Tennessee, the team did not express interest in him. Instead, he was recruited by the three service academies‚ÄîArmy, Navy, and Air Force‚Äîand his hometown Austin Peay. Perry committed to Navy as the academy allowed him to play football in addition to serving, while the team also allowed him to select his position; in contrast, Air Force and Army wished to keep him at quarterback. In 2015, before enrolling at the main academy, he attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School. Despite starting the NAPS football season at slotback, he was moved to quarterback after starter Jonah Llanusa broke his wrist. =2016= During Perry's freshman year in 2016, offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper switched his position from slotback to quarterback. In addition to playing for the junior varsity team, he began the varsity season sharing the third-string quarterback spot with Zach Abey before being demoted to fourth string due to illness. Perry made his varsity debut against Fordham after starting quarterback Tago Smith suffered an ACL tear. Although he was initially inactive for the game and instead watched from the stands, the injury forced the Midshipmen to pull Perry into action, while team equipment members had to return to campus to retrieve his uniform. Backup Will Worth played much of the game and Abey was suspended, leading to Perry seeing action in the fourth quarter. He led a 90-yard drive that resulted in a field goal, and ended the 52‚Äì16 Navy win with seven carries for 30 yards. He saw playing time at slotback in Navy's game with SMU, where he recorded one carry for 13 yards. In the 2016 Armed Forces Bowl against Louisiana Tech, Perry entered the game with 3:46 remaining after Abey suffered an injury and scored on his lone play, a 30-yard touchdown run to tie the game at 45 points apiece. However, the Bulldogs kicked the game-winning field goal on the ensuing drive. It was Perry's first college touchdown and his only score in 2016 as he finished the season with nine carries for 73 yards. =2017= Perry runs for a touchdown in the 2017 Army‚ÄìNavy Game Entering the 2017 season, Perry was expected to serve as Abey's backup quarterback since he was the only other player on the team to have varsity experience at the position. However, Navy head coach Ken Niumatalolo moved him to slotback as he wanted to provide playing time for Perry; the change was spurred by Smith spending much of his Navy career backing up Keenan Reynolds, only to suffer a season-ending injury in his first game as a starter. Niumatalolo described Perry as \\"a very athletic kid who can help us and I'm going to get him on the field. I'm not going to have him standing on the sideline sending in signals.\\" With Abey as the starter and junior Garret Lewis as backup, Llansula was originally slated as the third- string quarterback before he left the team, leading to Perry sharing the role with Jacob Harrison. Perry would start all 12 games in his sophomore year, including three at quarterback, and also served as the Midshipmen's kick returner after the incumbent Tre Walker was lost for the season to injury. Perry's first 100-rushing yard game came against Cincinnati, followed by 104- and 127-yard performances against Tulsa and Air Force, respectively; the latter was a then-career-best for Perry. The Air Force game also saw him record a 91-yard touchdown, the third-longest carry in Navy history and the longest at Navy‚ÄìMarine Corps Memorial Stadium, along with his first receiving touchdown on a 40-yard completion from Abey. In a 31‚Äì21 loss to UCF, Perry scored a 75-yard receiving touchdown and had a second score that was nullified by a holding penalty. Against Temple, Perry completed his first touchdown pass with a five-yard throw to Abey; the score came on a trick play that began with Abey pretending to give audibles to his team before the ball was snapped to running back Darryl Bonner, who pitched to Perry on a reverse, who in turn threw to Abey for the touchdown. Abey suffered a shoulder injury in the loss, leading to Perry making his maiden start at quarterback the following against SMU. Although he recorded 282 rushing yards and four touchdowns, including a 92-yard run that was the second-longest rushing score in the team's history, he sprained his left ankle in the fourth quarter; Navy would win 43‚Äì40 after the Mustangs came back from a 34‚Äì11 halftime deficit. For the season's remaining games, Niumatalolo opted to name starting quarterbacks shortly before kickoffs as Perry and Abey's differing playing styles (Perry preferred to run to the outside and could quickly change his pace, while Abey was a better passer and employed a more physical running style) forced opponents to prepare differently even if Navy fundamentally ran the same offense regardless of the starter. The 2017 Army‚ÄìNavy Game saw Perry start at quarterback, though Navy went on to lose 14‚Äì13. In snowy conditions, he recorded 250 rushing yards on 30 attempts, including a 68-yard touchdown, but penalties on the final drive hampered the Midshipmen offense and resulted in Bennett Moehring's game- winning 48-yard field goal going wide left. Perry's rushing yards accounted for 84 percent of his team's total yardage in the game and were nine more than Army's total. The performance also allowed Perry to break 1,000 rushing yards in 2017; Abey also accomplished the feat, allowing Navy to have its third duo of 1,000-yard rushers in a season. The Midshipmen, who started with a 5‚Äì0 record, concluded the regular season 6‚Äì6 and played in the Military Bowl against Virginia. Perry scored two touchdowns and rushed for 114 yards before leaving with a foot injury in the 49‚Äì7 victory. The 114 rushing yards were the second-most in bowl history behind Reynolds' 144 in 2015. He ended the year with 1,182 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns; he averaged 8.6 yards per carry, a Navy record and the third-highest in the nation. His 303 receiving yards and two touchdowns on 13 catches were second-best on the team. =2018= Perry began his junior year in 2018 as the Midshipmen's starting quarterback. Although he had thrown only two passes in his college career‚Äîone of which was intercepted‚Äîand Navy did not feature a pass-heavy offense, Jasper noted Perry possessed \\"a good arm\\" and threw \\"a great deep ball\\". As part of his new responsibilities, Perry transitioned into Navy's full triple option offense; in 2017, he only saw action at quarterback when the offense ran the read option from the shotgun formation. In July, he was placed on the preseason watch lists for the Maxwell (best college football player), Paul Hornung (most versatile player), and Walter Camp Awards (the Walter Camp Football Foundation's best player). The Midshipmen opened 2018 with a 59‚Äì41 loss to Hawaii, during which Perry recorded 108 rushing yards and a 75-yard touchdown late in the first half. He also threw his first touchdown pass as a quarterback on a 19-yard score to Walker in the fourth quarter. In Navy's first American Athletic Conference (AAC) game of the year against Memphis, Perry led the team in all three offensive yardage categories (166 rushing, 22 passing, 17 receiving), the school's second player to do so after Reynolds in 2015; he also scored a \\"highlight-reel touchdown\\" as he dodged multiple Memphis players en route to a 14-yard touchdown run. This was followed by a 51‚Äì21 victory over Lehigh, during which Perry ran for 223 yards and three touchdowns as the Midshipmen recorded 629 total yards (tenth-most in program history), though he struggled with arm strength and accuracy as a passer. The offense struggled through the next games, including a 35‚Äì7 loss to Air Force that dropped Navy to 2‚Äì3. The Midshipmen recorded just six first downs and 199 total yards in the loss, while Perry had a mere 54 yards on 19 carries (a number that was skewed by a 20-yard run). In a column published after the defeat, Capital Gazette writer and Navy beat reporter Bill Wagner criticized the team for its excessive reliance on Perry, whose 105 carries across the first five games greatly exceeded his teammates' attempts. Wagner called for Navy to \\"admit the Malcolm Perry experiment has been a mistake\\" as \\"Perry is a running back and not a quarterback. I completely understand the logic of wanting to put the ball in the hands of the best offensive player as much as possible, but Navy's coaching staff is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole in its desperate attempt to do so.\\" TheMidReport's Mike James wrote Perry was \\"a year behind in his development as a quarterback\\" due to spending the previous year as a slotback, with Navy's offense consequently growing too complex for him; the system used in the Air Force game was simplified to aid Perry, but James noted the offense was the same used against Army in 2017 shortly after Perry returned to quarterback, which Air Force capitalized on. After five games at quarterback, Perry was moved to slotback, a position that was hampered by mounting injuries. Although he was no longer the starting quarterback, he continued to see time at the position with Abey and Lewis. Despite the quarterback switch, the Midshipmen continued to struggle passing- wise as the three combined to complete less than 42 percent of their attempts. As a runner, Perry had just one more game of the remaining seven in which he recorded at least 100 yards‚Äîa 133-yard performance in a 44‚Äì22 loss to Notre Dame. In a one-point loss to Tulane, Perry threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Abey, who also completed a 73-yard touchdown throw of his own to Perry in the game as Navy fell 29‚Äì28. The Midshipmen ended the season 3‚Äì10, their worst record since 2002, including a third-straight loss to Army. Perry led Navy in rushing yards with 1,087 on 172 attempts, along with seven rushing touchdowns; in receiving, he recorded nine catches for 167 yards and a touchdown; when throwing, he completed nine of 25 passes for 222 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. In March 2019, Niumatalolo admitted he was unsure if ousting Perry from the starting quarterback role during the 2018 season was \\"the right decision[...] We did what we felt was best for the team at the time, but when I go back and look at our games I'm not sure it worked out very well.\\" =2019= Perry (center) shakes hands with Army linebacker Cole Christiansen before the 2019 Army‚ÄìNavy Game For his senior year in 2019, Perry went back to quarterback and was named team co-captain. As Perry's playing style differed from previous Navy quarterbacks, Niumatalolo and Jasper redesigned Navy's offense to support him. For example, to assist his development as a passer, Navy hired Billy Ray Stutzmann to install features of the run and shoot offense; Stutzmann played in and coached the system at Hawaii. The run and shoot also shares formations and concepts with Navy's standard spread option offense. During the offseason, Perry focused on improving his decision making, noting that the option and passing aspects of the offense were \\"all in my hands now.\\" Entering the 2019 season, Perry was again placed on the Maxwell Award watch list. Perry and the Navy offense enjoyed success in the season- opening 45‚Äì7 win over Holy Cross as the quarterback recorded his first 100-passing yard performance, completing six of nine passes for 103 yards, and ran for 28 yards and a touchdown. The following week against East Carolina saw Perry combine for six touchdowns‚Äîtwo passing and four rushing‚Äîand 307 total yards in a 42‚Äì10 victory; the six scores were the most by a Navy player in a game since Reynolds' seven in 2014. Perry also became the first Midshipman to record at least 150 rushing and passing yards apiece in one game since Ricky Dobbs in 2010. Navy's first loss of the year, a 35‚Äì23 defeat by Memphis, saw Perry run for two touchdowns and throw for another, but the Midshipmen's offensive production faltered in the second half. He was also pulled from the game on three occasions after hurting his throwing shoulder while sustaining hard hits, prompting coaches to advise him to avoid absorbing tackles. The Midshipmen avenged their blowout loss to Air Force the previous year with a 34‚Äì25 win, during which Perry led an 11-play, 75-yard drive late in the game that ended with his go-ahead three-yard touchdown run. Against Tulsa, he ran for 218 yards and three touchdowns as Navy won their first away game since they beat the Golden Hurricane in September 2017. Perry continued his string of success by rushing for 188 yards and two scores against South Florida, guiding the final drive against Tulane that led to Bijan Nichols' game-winning field goal, and another two-score performance in a 56‚Äì10 blowout over Connecticut that placed Navy on a five-game winning streak. At the time, the Midshipmen were 7‚Äì1, their best record after eight games since the team began using the triple option in 2002. The Connecticut game also saw Perry run for 108 yards to surpass the 1,000-rushing-yard mark for the season, making him the first Navy player since Reynolds to record 1,000 rushing yards in three seasons. Navy's win streak was snapped with a 52‚Äì20 loss to Notre Dame. Perry recorded 117 rushing yards on 25 attempts, but lost three fumbles in the first half before being benched for Perry Olsen in the third quarter. He rebounded in the next game against SMU by completing a career-best nine of fifteen passes for 162 yards and a touchdown, while also running for 195 yards and two scores in the 35‚Äì28 win. In Houston against the Cougars, Perry ran for 146 yards and a touchdown, along with throwing for 107 yards on just two attempts, as Navy won 56‚Äì41; it was the Midshipmen's first victory at TDECU Stadium since they joined the AAC. The win tied Navy at the top of the conference's West Division with Memphis, but the Tigers were named division champion thanks to their win over the Midshipmen earlier in the year. In early December, Perry was named AAC Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Conference; at the time of the announcement, he led the conference in rushing yards per game (136.4), which was also the most among quarterbacks in the nation, along with 1,500 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns. Against Army, he ran for a career-high and rivalry-record 304 yards (the first Navy player to do so against an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision opponent and the second in general) and two touchdowns as the Midshipmen won 31‚Äì7, their first win in the rivalry since 2015. His performance allowed him to break two Navy records: Worth's 2016 single-season total offense record with 2,831 yards and Napoleon McCallum's 1983 single-season rushing yardage record with 1,804, while his 606 rushing yards in three Army‚ÄìNavy Games were the most by any player in rivalry history. He was also the third player in school history to record 4,000 career rushing yards, joining McCallum and Reynolds. The Midshipmen concluded the regular season 10‚Äì2, during which Perry had nine consecutive games with at least 100 rushing yards and two games with over 200, the fourth player in school history to accomplish the latter. The 2019 Liberty Bowl against Kansas State was Perry's final college game. He completed five of seven passes for 57 yards and a touchdown, while also running for 213 yards on 28 carries; the rushing yards surpassed Dobbs' 106 in the 2009 Texas Bowl for the most by a Navy player in a bowl game. Perry received game MVP honors in the 20‚Äì17 Navy victory. He ended 2019 with 2,017 rushing yards, surpassing Jordan Lynch's record for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in a season, while his 4,359 career rushing yards were the 79th-most among all players in college football history and the second-most by a Midshipman behind Reynolds. Professional career =2020 NFL Draft= Perry, who was assigned to the United States Marine Corps for his post-Academy military commitment, entered the 2020 NFL Draft as a wide receiver; he explained the position change gave him \\"the best opportunity to play at the next level.\\" Although service academy graduates were required to serve for five years, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper signed an order in November 2019 that allowed athletes from the academies to defer their service to play professional sports upon receiving approval. During the pre-draft process, Perry participated in the 2020 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Bowl, playing for the East team. He had one carry in the 31‚Äì27 East win: he received the snap as a quarterback on a speed option play, from which he faked a lateral to running back Adrian Killins before running 52 yards for a touchdown. In February, he was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine; Perry was the second player in Navy history to attend the event, joining long snapper Joe Cardona in 2015. He was regarded as a potential late- round draft pick or undrafted free agent by various outlets, with NFL.com's Lance Zierlein considering him a \\"priority free agent\\" and WalterFootball.com's Charlie Campbell projecting him in the sixth-round-to- undrafted range. Although draft scouts like Zierlein praised his toughness and intelligence, his small frame and the move to wide receiver were seen as concerns. However, Zierlein also added Perry's experience in the option offense and versatility made him a viable utility player in the NFL.

It is situated on the southern border of Valhalla Provincial Park, northwest of Gimli Peak, and west of Slocan and Slocan Lake. The name \\"Valhalla Mountains\\" first appeared in George Mercer Dawson's Geological Survey of Canada map published in 1890. Dawson applied names derived from Scandinavian mythology to several of the mountain ranges and peaks in Southern Kootenay. In keeping with the Valhalla theme, this peak's name was submitted February 1970 by Robert Dean of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club for consideration, and it was officially adopted March 3, 1971, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. According to Norse mythology, Midgard is the home of earth dwellers. Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Midgard Peak has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

History An enlarged section of an 1866 map of the Bao'an County, showing Sai Kung and surrounding area, including Ngau Mei Chau (marked in map as Ngau T'au Ch√º) The island appeared in a map drawn by Father Simeone Volonteri in 1866, at that time it was marked as Ngau T'au Ch√º (). However, there are criticisms on the accuracy of Volonteri's map in general, or for specific place name such as Green Hill, which historically known as Tuen Mun Hill. There is a rock formation currently called (), which connects to the island by intertidal zone. According to a book, Pai means rock, hill or mountain that locates in water body in general in the language of the Tanka people. It is not certain Volonteri's record is correct or not for the name of the island at that time. The name Shelter island also appeared in a book for sailing directions that published in 1863. In Asiatic Pilot by the U.S. Hydrographic Office in 1910, the island was described as high at that time. Shoal water extended northwards for , and westwards from the island at that time. The island was part of a larger region that ceded to the Colony of Hong Kong in 1898. According to the historical document of the District Office South, the island was uninhabited when it was part of the Port Shelter Firing Range. The firing range was closed in the 1970s. In 2011, a mortar shell was discovered on a beach of the island. Administratively, the District Office South was replaced by the Sai Kung District Office as well as other District Offices after the World War II. At present, Shelter Island still administratively part of the Sai Kung District. It is part of Hang Hau East constituency of the Sai Kung District Council as of 2019 election,https://www.eac.hk/pdf/distco/2019dc/final/dc2019q2.pdf despite the island is uninhabited. But in term of environmental protection, the island is surrounded by the Port Shelter Water Control Zone. In the 1970s, the island was used by , a drug lord, and his associates as a place to hide their goods. Nowadays, it was one of the tourist attraction of the Sai Kung District. In specific, the island was known for its sea cave, known in Chinese as . The surrounding water of the island is a popular diving site. Such as the shallow waters in the bay Tai Wong Wan (), as well as west of Ngau Tau Pai, etc. Commercial divers also catch sea urchin near the island for their own restaurant. In 2019, human bones were discovered in Tai Wong Wan. Biodiversity 24 species of vascular plant were discovered on the island. Corals also appears in the water surrounding the island. However, survey discovered that the coverage rate is decreasing, from 50.6% to 31.2%, according to the interpretation of Ming Pao on the survey summary. According to another research, Shelter Island has a high number of Drupella rugosa and Cronia margariticola, which preying coral species Pavona decussata and Platygyra sinensis in the location. That research reported that the coverage of hard coral at Shelter Island, was 50.2% at that time. A marine park that covers Sharp Island, Tai Chau, Shelter Island and surrounding water was proposed by the Country and Marine Parks Board, a consultative body for the government in 2014. However, it was not materialized. In 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature also proposed to establish the Port Shelter Marine Protected Area, which also includes the Shelter Island.

It was first discovered in a screen for genes whose overexpression would suppress the phenotypes of PKC1 pathway mutations (thus named Bypass of C Kinase). Though its mechanism is currently unknown, it is believed to interact with Swi4 and Mcm1, both important transcriptional regulators of early cell cycle.  Discovery  BCK2 was first discovered in a yeast genomic library screen. An mpk1 deletion strain was transformed with a library of plasmid vectors containing parts of the entire yeast genome. One of the cells that grew out harbored BCK2 on its plasmid, whose overexpression rescued the mpk1 deletion phenotype. In the same publication, Bck2 was found to rescue a pck1 deletion phenotype as well.  Protein structure  BCK2 encodes a 93.7 kDa protein that is 851 amino acids long. The protein is serine/threonine-rich. The expression of BCK2 with a deletion of 189 amino acids of the C-terminus resulted in the loss of CLN3 and BCK2 deletion phenotype. A crystal structure of Bck2 has not been determined.  Genetics  BCK2 loss results in larger cell size resulting from delay of START, a checkpoint in the yeast cell cycle. A double deletion of BCK2 and G1 cyclin CLN3 results in inviability. or extremely slow growth. This was found to be a result of G1 arrest Overexpression of CLN2 or RME1 (a transcriptional activator of CLN2) was found to rescue loss of BCK2 and CLN3. Loss of BCK2 also led to a decrease in rate and levels of CLN2 mRNA accumulation in G1, as well as a delay in SWI4 mRNA accumulation. Overexpression of BCK2 resulted in smaller cell size. Besides rescuing PCK1 pathway mutation phenotypes1, overexpression of BCK2 also rescued the slow growth rate phenotype of a CLN2- and CLN3-null strain.  Physical interactions  A yeast two-hybrid screen revealed that Bck2 physically interacts with Mcm1, Swi4, Yap6, and Mot3. A V69E mutation on a hydrophobic pocket in Mcm1 prevents binding of Yox1 and Fkh2. This same mutation resulted in loss of interaction with Bck2.  Cell cycle regulation  The overexpression and null genetic experiments performed with BCK2 suggests its role as a G1 cell cycle regulator. For example, BCK2-null is synthetically lethal with G1 cyclin CLN3, and leads to a decrease in mRNA levels of another G1 cyclin CLN2 and transcriptional regulator of late-G1 genes SWI4. A global screen for genes regulated by Bck2 investigated through RNA microarray experiments revealed that Bck2 regulated a wide range of cell cycle genes beyond those associated with G1 phase. The SBF and MBF complexes, which includes protein Swi6, regulate late G1 and G1/S transition genes. Overexpression of Bck2 in Swi6-null cells resulted in changes in expression of genes known to be regulators of the cell cycle, or cell cycle dependent. 40% of the genes found to be regulated by Bck2 were also targets of regulation by Mcm1. Mcm1 activates M/G1 genes through binding to promoters containing Early Cell Cycle Box (ECB) elements. Another study showed gene regulation by Bck2 may be ECB-dependent. BCK2 overexpression leads to CLN3 and SWI4 upregulation. Mutations of ECB elements in CLN3 and SWI4 promoters blocked these effects. Bck2 may also be sensing cell size to promote crossing of START. Budding yeast senses cell size at START in part through sensing Whi5 concentrations in G1. Cells express the same amount of Whi5 protein independent of size, leading to larger cells having lower concentrations of Whi5. Thus, larger cells take a shorter amount of time from birth to START. Expressing multiple copies of WHI5 led to a linear increase in this time. Importantly, this effect was observed to be greater in BCK2 deletion backgrounds, suggesting that BCK2 may also be sensing cell size to input signals for passing START.

History  Line through western Montana, 1934 Horn reflector antennas on AT&T; Long Lines microwave relay station, Seattle, Washington = AT&T; Long Lines = The American Telephone & Telegraph Long Lines wire, cable, and microwave radio relay network provided long-distance services to AT&T; and its customers. The connection to other countries from the United States began here. By the 1970s, 95% of distance and 70% of intercity telephone calls in the United States were carried by AT&T.; Before utilizing microwave relay and coaxial cables, AT&T; used lines for long- distance service. In 1911, the system connected New York to Denver. The introduction of repeater towers allowed such connections to reach across North America. In the 1930s the company experimented with long-distance coaxial cable. The first long-distance L-carrier coaxial link in 1936 connected Philadelphia and New York City. With improved klystrons and other devices devised for World War II, it was quickly determined that relay networks were easy to build, especially over mountainous regions and rough terrain. Coaxial systems connected all major US cities, but the primary links used microwaves. Formal opening of the United States coast-to-coast connection was on August 17, 1951, via AT&T;'s network control center in New York City. A presidential address from Harry Truman at the San Francisco Peace Conference on September 4, 1951 opened the network, demonstrating coast-to-coast television service. The first regularly scheduled show to use this was Edward R. Murrow's See It Now on November 18, 1951. Later the network allowed events such as American Bandstand and ABC's Monday Night Football to be broadcast live nationally and permitted distribution of regional sports events, such as Saturday football games prior to the adoption of satellite communications in the 1970s. By the 1980s, alternatives supplemented what was in place. Long Lines briefly published a periodical, TWX, targeted to companies that used AT&T;'s equipment and services, particularly TeletypeWriter eXchange, from which it took its name. The periodical was discontinued in 1952. = Direct distance dialing = In 1950, New York City's five boroughs were dialed from various communities in New Jersey with the digits '1-1' followed by the 7 digit telephone number. While New York City was assigned area code 212 at the very beginning of the Area Code format in October 1947, it wouldn't be until later in the 1950s when Englewood, New Jersey, customers would dial their calls to New York City using the digits 2-1-2. The use of the '11+' code from Englewood (and other parts of northeastern New Jersey) to call New York City had been in place for a while, even prior to 1951. New York City's five boroughs also had been dialing northeastern New Jersey as 11+ the two letters and five digits of the New Jersey number as well for a while prior to 1951 and until the latter 1950s. 32 Avenue of the Americas, New York headquarters and principal switching center of AT&T; Long Lines in mid 20th century; still used in 2008 Long Lines relay tower in Indiana. The use of area code 201 to call New Jersey from New York City didn't begin until the latter 1950s. Other cities in northeastern New Jersey were dialable in 1951 (and for a few years prior) from Englewood by simply dialing the two letters of the exchange name and remaining five digits. In addition to New York City, the Nassau County part of Long Island was dialable from Englewood and Teaneck using area code 516. Also Westchester County, Rockland County, and portions of Orange and Putnam Counties were also dialable from Englewood and Teaneck in 1951 using area code 914. Early in the 20th century, the telephone companies organized a \\"Separations and Settlements\\" process by which Long Lines and the local companies divided the revenues of long-distance calls according to their respective costs. The mid- century advent of microwave and other high capacity systems dramatically cut the cost of long-haul operations, but pricing did not decline proportionally. Rather, the local fraction of revenue-sharing rose to subsidize local service. = AT&T; Communications = AT&T; Communications became one of the three core sales units of AT&T; after reorganization of assets. AT&T; divided AT&T; Communications into 22 operating companies, serving the regions of each Bell Operating Company that was spun off.

Their names were: Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell, and US West. The advertising campaign which had a broad appeal was named AT&T; CallVantage.  AT&T;‚ÄìSBC Communications merger  In 2005, SBC Communications purchased AT&T; Corp., the parent company of AT&T; Communications. SBC had already been offering its own long-distance services through SBC Long Distance LLC in its own territory in competition with other long-distance companies.

By the 16th century, it was almost completely demolished. Location The pyramid was located in today's Borgo district of Rome, between Old Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Its foundations have been discovered under the first north block of via della Conciliazione, which now includes the Auditorium della Conciliazione and the Palazzo Pio. History The Meta Romuli was a monumental burial erected in the Roman age on the right bank of the Tiber, near the intersection of two Roman roads, the Via Cornelia and the Via Triumphalis, in an area outside the pomerium (the religious boundary around Rome); this area, named Ager Vaticanus, hosted at that time numerous cemetery areas such as the nearby Vatican Necropolis and, due to its proximity to the Campus Martius represented an ideal area to build the monumental tombs of the members of the roman upper class.Petacco (2016), p. 33 It was directly south next to another large mausoleum, the so-called Therebintus Neronis, whose demolition started during the 7th century, which had instead a circular plan and the shape of a giant tumulus tomb. While both monuments survived the great changes due to the construction of the old St. Peter's Basilica, the latter was destroyed already during the Middle Ages, while the former survived until the Renaissance age becoming an important element of Rome's topography. It is clear that the man who could afford to build such a monument could only have been a prominent figure of the Roman state, but his name remains unknown. The first mention of the Meta can be found in a comment to Horace by the Pseudo-Acron (a writer of the 5th century AD)Ps. - Acro, in Hor. Epod. 9, 25 who mentions that the ashes of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus were taken from a pyramid in the Vatican; due to that, the Meta Romuli was also named \\"Sepulcher of the Scipions\\".Petacco (2016), p. 34 The name Meta Romuli instead was due to a popular belief, which linked it to the pyramid of Cestius (named Meta Remi in the Middle Ages and lying near the Basilica of Saint Paul), identifying them with the tombs of Romulus and Remus, the two mythical founders of Rome, and making them the object of various legends, based upon the analogy between the founders of the city and the apostles Peter and Paul. It was traditionally believed that the site of the martyrdom of Saint Peter, described as ad Therebintum inter duas metas...in Vaticano, was placed either between the Therebintus and the Meta Romuli, or between the latter and the obelisk of the Circus of Nero, or - in a larger context - in the mid-point between the Meta Romuli and the pyramid of Cestius, that is the place on the Janiculum hill called Montorio, where in the Renaissance Donato Bramante built the Tempietto di San Pietro; consequently, the pyramid was represented for centuries in the depictions of St. Peter's martyrdom. The tomb had also a great importance for the pilgrims who reach Saint Peter, since on their way to the Basilica they met the tomb of the founder of the city before that of the founder of the church. Due to that, the Meta Romuli was a popular subject in the representations of the city in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Some examples are the Stefaneschi Polyptych by Giotto; a polyptych by Jacopo di Cione; one tile of Filarete's Bronze Doors in Old St. Peter's Basilica; the fresco of The Vision of the Cross in Raphael's Rooms in the Vatican; and the frescoes on the vaults of the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi by Cimabue.Petacco (2016), p. 35 The cella of the pyramid was used for centuries as a granary by the Chapter of Saint Peter, which owned it from the 13th century until its destruction.Gigli (1990) p. 84 At the beginning of the 15th century, the pyramid's pinnacle was demolished; on the platform which resulted were garrisoned soldiers of the nearby Castle, who got their supplies thorough a system of ropes hanging to the fortress. Despite its importance for the city and for the church, Pope Alexander VI ordered its demolition on 26 November 1498 for the opening of the new Via Alessandrina (later known as Borgo Nuovo), a road which connected the Vatican area with the bridge crossing the Tiber. Due to the difficulty of the undertaking, the pope conceded a plenary indulgence to the men willing to help. On 24 December 1499, the pope blocked all the old roads between Saint Peter and the Tiber, forcing the people to use the new thoroughfare; however, the demolition of the pyramid was not complete, since Raphael, who arrived in Rome in 1509, in a letter to Pope Leo X written in 1519 about the antiquities of the city, writes that he could still see the remains of the monument. In 1511, Pope Julius II claimed ownership of the monument, and in several documents of the 16th century until 1568 the Meta was cited as the end of the Palio race.Castagnoli, (1958), p. 363 Structure The Meta Romuli (on the left) depicted in the Stefaneschi Triptych by Giotto The adoption of the pyramidal shape for sepulchral monuments was popular during the Augustan period, in the context of cultural influences from Egypt. Many pyramidal tombs were built, between 40 and 50 meters high, of which only that of Gaius Cestius survives. The Vatican pyramid dated back presumably to the same age or to the first imperial age,Castagnoli, (1958), p. 229 and according to evidence was larger than the Cestia pyramid; as per 15th-century accounts, it had a square plan with sides long and was between 32 and 50 meters high. The Mirabilia Urbis Romae (a 12th-century guide of the city) says that the monument fuit miro lapide tabulata (\\"was sided with wonderful stone\\") Mirabilia, 20, 3, 1-4 and that pope Donus (r. 676-8) dismantled its siding to pave the quadriporticus and the stairs of Saint Peter's church.Petacco (2016) p. 36 The construction was very robust: Michele Ferno, an eyewitness of the demolition, could visit the burial chamber, which was reachable through a long tunnel; its walls had four niches to keep the defuncts' ashes,Gigli (1990) p. 82 and with a side of 7 m and a height of 10.5 m it was almost as big as that of the Mausoleum of Hadrian (which has a side of 7.8 m and an height of 10‚Äì12 m). Ferno writes also that during its demolition, which took place between April and 24 December 1499, the concrete of the building was so hard that it had to be demolished with a trip hammer; the bangs which resulted were so loud like those produced by beating a mountain of iron. In 1948-49, during the works for the construction of the first block of the north side of Via della Conciliazione, it came to light a northwest/southeast-oriented foundationCoarelli (1974) p. 322 of concrete conglomeration made by tufa quarry waste, surrounded by a large pavement made with travertine slabs.Petacco (2016) p. 37 These remains fully confirm the description of the Meta found in the Mirabilia and those given by the eyewitnesses.

It was one of the first Lithuanian-language texts published in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The work is valued by researchers for the purity of the Lithuanian language and for its Polish dedication that defended the use of the Lithuanian language in public life. The 646-page postil remained the largest Lithuanian published work until the 19th century. Publication history After the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), the Roman Catholic Church religious texts in native languages to combat the Protestant Reformation. Lutheran pastor Jonas Bretk≈´nas published his Lithuanian postil in the Duchy of Prussia in 1591 prompting Lithuanian Catholics into action. Jakub Wujek, rector of the Jesuit Academy in Vilnius, published two postils in Polish ‚Äì a larger one in 1573‚Äì1575 and a smaller in 1579‚Äì1580. The large postil was aimed at well educated clergy and delved into theological arguments by various Christian sects. The smaller postil was aimed at an average priest. It was not a summary of the larger postil, but a brand new work that used various texts by other authors, including Louis of Granada, Johann Wild (Ferus), Johann Eck, Johann Augustanus Faber, etc. Wujek's postils were an answer to a Protestant postil of Miko≈Çaj Rej published in 1557. Lithuanian priest Mikalojus Dauk≈°a translated the smaller postil into Lithuanian. He used the 2nd edition of the Polish postil and later added details from the 3rd edition which was published in 1590 in Krak√≥w. Several times, the text refers to Pope Gregory XIII, who died in 1585, as the current pope though the text was given to the printing press of the Jesuit Academy in Vilnius in early 1595 (though, due to financial difficulties, it was not published until 1599). At the time, 500 copies of books were usually published but it is very possible that more copies of the Catholic Postil were published to compete with the Protestant Postil of Jonas Bretk≈´nas. After translating the postil, Dauk≈°a also translated Catechism, or Education Obligatory to Every Christian but it was published first in 1595 as it was much smaller and less expensive work. Eight original postils survive. They are kept at the Vilnius University Library (3 copies), National Martynas Ma≈ævydas Library, Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore, G√∂ttingen State and University Library, Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Vatican Library. The Vatican copy was gifted to Pope Pius XI by President Antanas Smetona in May 1930. Excerpts from the Catholic Postil by Dauk≈°a were first republished in 1823 in Vilnius. It was two short booklets (25 pages and 16 pages) believed to have been prepared by Simonas Staneviƒçius to showcase the beauty and lexical richness of the Lithuanian language and to encourage its development and use. The first Lithuanian translation of the Polish dedication to the reader was published in Varpas in 1900. In the 19th century, Dauk≈°a and his texts became firmly established as key developments in the history of the Lithuanian language and started attracting academic interest. Staneviƒçius and later bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius raised the issue of republishing the Catholic Postil in full, but the work was started by Eduards Volters only in 1898. The first two sections were published in 1904 and 1909. The third section was almost complete, but the outbreak of World War I prevented its publication. Volters managed to convince the Soviet Union to complete the third section and it was published in 1927. In total, 456 pages (out of 628) of the original postil were published. In 1926, a photocopy of the postil was published by Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka. In 1977, Polish linguist published a two-volume Indeks-s≈Çownik do Dauk≈°os Postile which alphabetically indexes all Lithuanian words and their forms in the postil and provides their Polish equivalent in Wujek's postil. A new publication of the postil alongside the Polish original was prepared by Jonas Palionis and published in 2000. Content Measuring at , Catholic Postil has a total of 646 pages: 8 pages of dedications written by Dauk≈°a, 630 pages of translated sermons (the printed book marks only 627 pages due to some numbering errors), 6 pages of erratum, and 2 pages of covers. Some surviving copies of the book have an image of the coat of arms (a rose from the Poraj coat of arms) of Merkelis Giedraitis, the Bishop of Samogitia and sponsor of the postil, with a Latin quatrain about it as well as an eight-line dedication to Giedraitis. The dedication was written by Vaclovas Daujotas from . Dauk≈°a added two dedications, one in Latin to his benefactor Giedraitis and another in Polish to the reader. The Latin dedication survives in only one copy of the book which was kept by the Kra≈æiai College and Simonas Staneviƒçius. It is dated 1 March 1599. It is a panegyric work that praises Bishop Merkelis but, unlike many such works, does not portray excessive humility on Dauk≈°a's part. Instead, the dedication makes references to \\"our\\" work and compares Dauk≈°a to Orpheus. Even though both Merkelis and Dauk≈°a were members of the clergy, the dedication does not reference the Bible or the popes and instead draws parallels with the Classical Antiquity. Overall, the dedication shows clear influence of classical authors, primarily Cicero. Dauk≈°a praises Merkelis' work and accomplishments and states that he will earn gratitude from the homeland for his dedication, from the clergy for making their work easier, from the people for their salvation, and from others for saving the native language from abandonment and perish. Those \\"others\\" have been interpreted to refer to the Protestants showcasing Dauk≈°a's tolerance and concern for the Lithuanian language which surpassed religious differences. Overall, the dedication is condensed, without unnecessary drivel, and is one of the better examples of such works. The postil is mainly known and valued for its Polish dedication to the reader which is part of the secondary school curriculum in Lithuania. The dedication is a passionate and patriotic defense of the native language which is considered to be the key to the survival of the nation. Dauk≈°a claims that all nations have three things in common ‚Äì ancestral land, traditions, and language. Significantly, Dauk≈°a does not emphasize social class or state in his definition of a nation. He wants to see the Lithuanian language preserved, perfected, and enriched and used in churches and state documents ‚Äì at the time official documents used Church Slavonic, Latin, or Polish. In his quest to promote the Lithuanian language, unlike many authors of the era, Dauk≈°a does not advertise the supposed Lithuanian roots from the Romans (see the Palemonids). It reflects clear ideas of the Renaissance and has been compared to La D√©fense et illustration de la langue fran√ßaise by Joachim du Bellay. Dauk≈°a's declaration about the Lithuanian language resonated with the activists of the 19th-century Lithuanian National Revival who worked to purify and promote the Lithuanian language. The Polish dedication is also a polemic response to some Protestant thesis. For example, he saw language as an element of the human nature and natural law which were divine; the Protestants saw human nature as corrupted by sin and requiring intellectual efforts to improve. The main content is an example of the Baroque literature though it has some elements of Renaissance in its expressions and form. The main theme is not the love of God, but the wrath of the harsh and vengeful God of the Old Testament. The sermons appeal not to the rational mind but to the emotions striking the fear of God. In a typical Barque fashion, the sermons frequently discuss the pitiful temporary nature of every material thing, including the human body and life. There is no earthly joy or worthwhile pursuit as death and the Apocalypse will turn everything to dust and rot (cf. memento mori). The end of the world is described particularly vividly and alarmingly. The sermons are more abstract, looking for hidden meanings in Biblical passages, than dealing with realities of life. The sermons support feudal society and argue for unconditional obedience both to good and bad rulers as both were given their power by God. The text often attacks the Protestants and tries to instill hatred towards them even hinting that the Protestants should be punished and persecuted for their beliefs. Therefore, there is a marked difference between the dedications (Dauk≈°a's original works that show clear influence of Renaissance and humanism) and the translated sermons that are more medieval. Language The translation was done almost word-by-word without any larger alteration to meaning. It appears that church officials wanted a faithful copy of Wujek's postil which they considered well suited for the Counter-Reformation. Researchers have identified about 200 text deletions but majority of them seem to be mechanical errors. Such rather mechanical approach to translation produced some failed neologisms, introduced barbarisms, and hampered syntax. Some references to \\"us\\" as Poles (and not Lithuanians) and to the deceased Pope Gregory XIII as the current pope could be explained by the word-by-word approach to translation. Nevertheless, the translation is noted for its overall quality and lexical richness. Dauk≈°a paid particular attention to provide synonyms to enrich the reader and to appease speakers of different Lithuanian dialects. When a Lithuanian equivalent was not available, Dauk≈°a preferred internationalisms based on Latin or Greek over loanwords from Slavic languages. Dauk≈°a also invented new Lithuanian words, often by compounding or by adding suffixes or prefixes. A particular challenge were words for abstract concepts (e.g. shame, example, luxury, cause, etc.), but it is hard to determine which were Dauk≈°a's neologisms and which were taken from everyday language. He often chose stronger and more expressive words than the Polish original to strengthen the emotional impact, to make the language more dynamic. Dauk≈°a borrowed from the spoken language of the people and was not shy to use some coarse language. He aimed the sermons at the poorly educated villagers and tried to use common, everyday language. In the process, some saints or Biblical figures lost some of their otherworldliness and acquired features familiar to local Lithuanians. Both Wujek and Dauk≈°a were familiar with the art of rhetoric. Wujek frequently used periodic sentences that Dauk≈°a preserved and in some instances improved. Dauk≈°a was successful in translating various proverbs, rhyming them or polishing their parallel construction. The postil was printed in the Gothic script. Dauk≈°a borrowed many elements of orthography from the Polish language, for example letters w and ≈Ç, but also introduced some innovations, including ogonek letters ƒØ and ≈≥. While these letters are part of the standard modern Lithuanian, they were forgotten and then re-imported from texts published in East Prussia. He used various complex diacritic signs to indicate pronunciation nuances as well as stress. Catholic Postil is the oldest Lithuanian text with stress marks making it particularly interesting to linguists.

Background In 310 BC, after an unsuccessful siege of the city of Bayblon by his son Demetrius, Antigonus decided to march against Seleucus himself. He mobilized an army of more than 75,000 men and marched towards Babylon. Seleucus, who had just reconquered Babylon, was heavily outnumbered, but emboldened by his earlier victories he decided to make a stand.  The siege  The confrontation began with several clashes on the outskirts of the city between 12 January and 10 February. On 19 January Antigonus attacked the city and his troops took parts of the city. The Antigonids plundered some of Babylon's temples. They did not capture all of the city, and after some attempts on the citadel, Antigonus retreated. Seleucus, realising how desperate the situation was, ordered a retreat; the Seleucids were attacked by the Antigonids while retreating, the fighting lasted until 28 February, when the remaining Seleucids retreated to the citadel or to the fields outside the city. On the 2 March Antigonus managed to capture and raze Cutah, but the Seleucid army nevertheless managed to escape.  Aftermath  Antigonus named Archelaus as the new satrap, while Seleucus ordered his army to disperse and fight the invader in a guerrilla war. Antigonus retaliate by plundering and razing the countryside, trying to force Seleucus to fight a pitched battle. In 308 B.C. Seleucus faced Antigonus in a battle somewhere in southern Mesopotamia or northern Babylonia. When the two armies met, they fought an inconclusive engagement. Both retired to their camps for the night; but whereas Antigonus's army disarmed and went to sleep, Seleucus ordered his men to dine and rest in full armor and in their ranks. He then launched a surprise attack towards the morning and overwhelmed Antigonus's forces. Antigonus managed to escape and gave up on the idea of reconquering the upper satrapies, leaving the east to Seleucus.Richard A.

Formed in 2003, the six-voice group is known for parodying contemporary pop songs by adding Jewish themes and lyrics. It also sings cover versions of pop hits and Yiddish and Israeli classics, and produces original compositions based on traditional Jewish prayers. Relying solely on vocals, the group achieves the effects of guitar, bass, drums, and electronic music through beatboxing and multiple layering of vocal tracks on its music videos. The group performs regularly for universities, synagogues, public and private groups, and in music festivals. It has released seven albums and won numerous awards. History Six13 was formed in 2003 at Binghamton University by then-student Mike Boxer. Boxer tapped several of his religious Jewish college friends for the new group, which was named for the 613 commandments of the Torah. The group performs with six voices at each concert appearance. In addition to vocals, group members do beatboxing. =Parodies= Six13 is best known for their parodies of contemporary pop songs, incorporating Jewish-themed lyrics. Like other Jewish a cappella groups, they produce an annual music video to honor the holidays of Hanukkah and Passover. Their Hanukkah songs include \\"Bohemian Chanukah\\", a 2018 parody of Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", in which the bridge \\"Mamma mia, mamma mia\\" is recast as \\"Abba, Ima, Abba, Ima\\" (Hebrew for \\"Father, Mother, Father, Mother\\"), and a 2019 video featuring traditional Hanukkah songs and prayers sung to music from Star Wars. For Passover, they released \\"Chozen\\", a parody of the soundtrack from Disney's Frozen, in 2014, \\"Uptown Passover\\", a parody of Mark Ronson's \\"Uptown Funk\\", in 2015, and \\"A Lion King Passover\\", parodying music from Disney's The Lion King, in 2019. The music video for the latter song garnered more than 1.6 million views on YouTube. =Covers= Six13 has performed vocal cover versions of \\"Poker Face\\" by Lady Gaga, \\"Heartless\\" by Kanye West, and \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" by The Black Eyed Peas, among others. =Original songs= While Six13 is best known for its parodies, most of its output is original songs, based on prayers and tunes from the traditional Jewish liturgy. Boxer, the group's main songwriter and arranger, estimates that original compositions constitute six out of every eight songs they perform, and are mainly found on the group's albums. =Appearances= Six13 performs regularly in the United States, Canada, and Israel, appearing at universities, synagogues, Jewish youth conferences, and private events. They have also performed at music festivals in Israel, Germany, Austria, and Costa Rica. In 2016 they were invited by President Barack Obama to perform at the White House Hanukkah Party. The group prepared to sing in the foyer for guests who were filing in to the East Room for the reception, but Obama invited them inside to sing for him, the First Lady, and other guests including US Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. For this occasion, they sang a short selection from \\"A Hamilton Hanukkah\\", their parody of music from the Broadway musical Hamilton. Musical styles Six13 employs a wide range of musical styles, including pop, rock, hip hop, doo wop, and jazz. Relying solely on vocals, the group achieves the effects of guitar, bass, drums, and electronic music through beatboxing and multiple layering of vocal tracks on its music videos. Personnel Mike Boxer is the group's musical director, songwriter, arranger and business manager. As of 2019, the group has a total of nine members, aged 25 to 37, who travel in groups of six for performances. Members are all college graduates, are based in New York City, and have careers outside the group.  Honors and awards  Six13 sings \\"God Bless America\\" on Jewish Heritage Day at Citi Field, 2009 Six13 has been invited to participate in Jewish Heritage Day at Shea Stadium/Citi Field for seven consecutive years. The group was chosen as a finalist for three years in a row in the casting process for the NBC a cappella competition The Sing-Off.

Further versions were planned for conventional catapult launches and landing using the arresting gear. Design and development The Convair Model 200 was designed in 1973 as a single-jet fighter, that could be built in both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) (model 200A) and conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) configurations (Model 201A). For the CTOL, the single Pratt & Whitney JTF22A-26A with tail hook, canard with flap, and CTOL tail cone. For the VTOL operations, the single Pratt & Whitney JTF22A-30A with a jet exhaust pipe tiltable by 90 degrees, and two additional lifting engines with 46.7 kN thrust each were provided behind the cockpit. The lifting engines and the swiveling nozzles were eliminated in the CTOL versions. The top speed was Mach 2. The wingspan was 27 feet 10.5 inches; the length was 51 feet 1.5 inches. The Model 200 had a cruise engine, a swept tail, two ventral fins under the fuselage, delta wings and delta canards directly behind the rectangular air intakes. The Model 200 was proposed in a US Navy competition for a small VTOL fighter that could be carried by the Sea Control Ship, the small aircraft carriers that the US Navy was planning at the time. Neither the Model 200 nor the SCS were built. However, a competitor of the Model 200, the Rockwell XFV-12 fighter aircraft, was built. The XFV-12 was far from meeting expectations, and the project was canceled before the second XFV-12 was completed. Various models for wind tunnel tests were built for the Convair Model 200. As well as a model for researching the air currents during vertical takeoff and landing. Furthermore, a 1:1 front fuselage model including a complete cockpit layout. Variants ;Convair Model 200A: single-seater vertical take-off with two lifting engines behind the cockpit and swiveling main engine exhaust, nose gear with one wheel. ;Convair Model 201: single-seat carrier aircraft, without lifting engines, in this version there is additional internal fuel with conventional afterburning engine, nose gear with two wheels and catapult launch bar and an arrestor hook for arrested landings. In the case of the vertical take-off version, the nose landing gear moves forward into the landing gear shaft under the cockpit, the nose landing gear of the CTOL version retracts to the rear. ;Convair Model 201 Trainer: just like Convair Model 201, instead of the fuel tank behind the cockpit, enlarged cockpit for two crew in tandem arrangement.

Life  Eggebrecht was born in Dresden. His father was a Protestant minister and since 1929 superintendent in Prussian Schleusingen and early on sympathized with political right-wing movements. In 1933 he joined the German Christians. At the beginning of his studies in 1937/38 at the in Hirschberg Eggebrecht was a member of the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB) and was temporarily active as a music consultant for Hitler Youth. With the beginning of the war he interrupted his music studies. After the military basic training he was transferred in February 1940 to the Feldgendarmerie. According to Claudia Zenck, who evaluated the estate in the Freiburg University Archive, he was only fit for service to a limited extent, also used every opportunity to make music during his training and afterwards, and was trained as a driver. His letters show that he did not like being a soldier. He took part in the Western Front and was stationed there in Besan√ßon, busy with prisoner transports, patrolling and reporting journeys. From the end of September he was deployed in Krakow. In November 1940 he received leave to study for one semester at the Humboldt- Universit√§t zu Berlin for a teaching post. After his examination he had to report to the troops in April 1941 and was stationed in Zagreb and at the Romanian border. In 1941, shortly after the beginning of the German Attack on the Soviet Union, the Feldgendarmerie Department 683, 2nd Company, 3rd Platoon, to which Eggebrecht belonged, was deployed as part of the 11th Army in the conquest of the Crimea. He served mainly as a messenger rider on a motorcycle. On 14 November 1941 the unit reached Simferopol. In cooperation with the SS-Einsatzgruppe D under Otto Ohlendorf, which was too understaffed to operate alone, parts of the field police force took also part in a SD massacre of \\"at least 5,000 people from Simferopol\\" from 9 to 13 December 1941.Norbert Kunz: Die Krim unter deutscher Herrschaft 1941‚Äì1944 (Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Forschungsstelle Ludwigsburg der Universit√§t Stuttgart. Volume 5). Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2005, , (also in Mainz University, Dissertation, 2003). Whether and to what extent Eggebrecht was involved in the events is controversial. According to researcher Claudia Maurer Zenck, he was released from duty in those days until Christmas in order to prepare for the NCO examination and was also promoted to NCO one day before Christmas; his involvement was not yet proven by any source, not even indirectly.Friedrich Geiger: Quellenkritische Anmerkungen zum \\"Fall Eggebrecht\\". Online-Publikation, Hamburg 2010 (PDF; 2,1MB). According to music historian Boris von HakenHaken, first presented his research on 17 September 2009 in a lecture at the annual conference of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Musikforschung (Society for Music Research) in T√ºbingen, and then on 17 December 2009 in a ZEIT article. Whether the available documents actually prove Eggebrecht's participation in the massacre was subsequently questioned several times. See e.g. B. Jens Malte Fischer: Assumption without evidence. NS accusations against musicologist H. H. Eggebrecht. In S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. 19/20 December 2009; Richard Klein: Suche nach einer Sprache in der falschen Welt. In FAZ, 23 December 2009 (faz.net); Friedrich Geiger: Im langen Schatten deutscher Musik. In: FAZ. 23 December 2009 (zeit.de). Eggebrecht stood in the so-called trellis for at least one day, through which the victims were driven immediately before their murder; this assertion was meanwhile rejected as unprovable and even unlikely.Gottfried Schramm, in: Ein controvererer Lebensweg. Freiburg 2012, . On the state of Hakens' research in the middle of 2013 Die Zeit published an article.Volker Hagedorn: In the heart the greatest horror. In Time. 11 July 2013, (zeit.de). Haken refers to seven field post letters from Eggebrecht to members of the fellowship Johann Sebastian Bach of the NSD-Studentenbund in Berlin in particular from 1942/43, which he discovered and which according to Haken show a National Socialist attitude.Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht. An ideological fanatic. Boris von Haken in conversation with Dina Netz. In Deutschlandfunk, 5 May 2014. Two days after the fall of Sevastopol, Eggebrecht appeared on the radio as a pianist and played Mozart and Beethoven (6 July). In the period before that, he was also involved in guarding POVs, a large number of whom were involved in the conquest of the Kerch Peninsula. In 1942 Eggebrecht was transferred to the fighting troops of Panzerj√§gerabteilung 28, with which he was on the Leningrad front. In July 1944 he was seriously wounded. He received the East Medal (Medal Winter Battle in the East 1941/42, August 1942), the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class. B. v. Haken expresses himself inaccurately, in any case no \\"knight's cross\\": (as knight's cross bearer/oak-leaf bearer not listed see Walther-Peer Fellgiebel: The bearers of the knight's cross of the Iron Cross 1939‚Äì1945. 1996, ) and was severely wounded at the end of the war in 1945. Eggebrecht consistently concealed his activities in the field police from 1945 and claimed that he had been with the tank fighters throughout the war and then with the infantry. Eggebrecht studied from autumn 1945 with Richard M√ºnnich, Hans Joachim Moser and Max Schneider in Weimar, Berlin, Munich and Jena, where he promoviert as Dr. phil.. In 1949, without having to face a denazification trial, he received an assistant position with Walther VetterAlbrecht Riethm√ºller: Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht zum Gedenken in Die Musikforschung. 53 (2000) 1, , here: . at the Institute of Musicology of the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1951 Wilibald Gurlitt, who had been dismissed as J√ºdisch versippt in 1937, brought him to the University of Freiburg. habilitierte in 1955, Eggebrecht obtained his doctorate from Gurlitt. He then took up a position as a private lecturer at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, which he temporarily interrupted in 1956/57 for a substitute professorship at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg. From 1961 until his Emeritus in 1987, Eggebrecht succeeded Gurlitt as professor and director of the Department of Musicology at the University of Freiburg.  Work  Already in 1955 Eggebrecht presented the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz with a report entitled Studien zur musikalischen Terminologie. However, it was to take until 1972 before this project could be implemented in Freiburg im Breisgau and the first deliveries of the ' appeared. Eggebrecht remained the main editor of this exemplary terminological lexicon until 1999. Eggebrecht's main research interests were the music of Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Johann Sebastian Bach and Protestant church music in general, the music of the First Viennese School, Gustav Mahler and the music of the 20th century. He regarded his editions of medieval music treatises merely as proof of aptitude vis-√†-vis the \\" Guild\\", but together with the editions of his pupils they set standards for research into medieval music theory. He wrote some of his writings together with the musicologist Carl Dahlhaus. Among his students were Peter Andraschke, Christoph von Blumr√∂der, Werner Breig, Reinhold Brinkmann, Elmar Budde, Fritz Reckow, Albrecht Riethm√ºller, Wolfram Steinbeck and Michael Wittmann. His aesthetics of music approach was committed to the thought of Roman Ingarden. The reception of works of art thus runs through several layers of perception, a perception with different qualities each. Eggebrecht's book Zur Geschichte der Beethoven-Rezeption in 1972 was criticized for continuing the clich√© of the titan and fighter. From 1933 to 1945 remained omitted in it. In 1991 his work Musik im Abendland was published. Processes and Stations from the Middle Ages to the Present, an overall presentation of his reading of European music history, which he enriched with methodical reflections on the writing of music history. Unlike many musicologists, Eggebrecht sought dialogue with a number of contemporary composers (for example with Wolfgang Rihm, who studied with him in Freiburg, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Mathias Spahlinger). Eggebrecht was an honorary doctor of the University of Bologna and the Masaryk University. Contrary to Volker Hagedorn's assertion, \\"Unlike Dahlhaus, Eggebrecht remained almost untranslated, a German phenomenon,\\" Eggebrecht's book on Bach's The Art of the Fugue was translated into English in 1993 and published under the title J. S. Bach's the Art of Fugue. The Work and Its Interpretation; in 2009 Ashgate Publishers issued an English translation of the book Understanding Music. Translated into Italian and Czech: The Music of Gustav Mahler and Music in the Occident. Christoph Keller's rhetorical question from 1997, \\"whether a Mahler critique like his can be written after Auschwitz and whether it can be written by someone who belonged to Hitler's Wehrmacht\\", can be criticized with good reasons.Volker Hagedorn: Unheimliches Abendland.

Tietgen. The SS Rotterdam from 1908 was the fourth Rotterdam by that name of the HAL. She is often referred to as Rotterdam IV, but this designation was rarely used at the time.  Ordering and construction  Before 1906 the HAL had ships that were no larger than 12,500 tons. The HAL then decided on a strategy to use bigger ships. In February 1906 the HAL received the New Amsterdam of 17,200 tons built by Harland and Wolff. By July 1906 it was known that the HAL had ordered a new Rotterdam of 23,000 tons at Harland and Wolff. It was to be delivered in Spring 1908. By January 1907 it was known that she would be named Rotterdam. The launch of the Rotterdam was planned for 22 February 1908. By 1 o'clock in the afternoon about 5,000 guests of Harland and Wolff had assembled for the event, and thousands of other spectators had assembled on the shores. At the moment supreme the director of the yard had to announce that the launch had become impossible because two other ships had not been removed to a save location. On the 23rd a second attempt was cancelled because the two ships could not be removed because of a storm. A third attempt failed because the grease on the slipway had been pushed aside. On 3 March 1908 the Rotterdam was finally launched. On 3 June 1908 the Rotterdam made her trial run and reached a speed of 18 knots. After that she sailed to Southampton in order to be inspected in the dry dock over there.  Characteristics  = Dimensions and hull = The Rotterdam measured 666 by 77 by 56 (depth of hold) English feet. Given as length 203 m, beam 23.47 m and depth 17 m in the metric system. The tonnage was 24,170 tons. The displacement was 36,870 tons at 35 feet draught. The hull was divided in watertight compartments by thirteen transverse bulkheads and one bulkhead along the center line of the ship. The bottom of the hull was double. She did have bilge keels = Engines = The engines of the Rotterdam were two separate quadruple expansion engines generating 14,000 ihp. Steam was provided by two single and eight double boilers heated by 54 fires. The designed speed was 16.5 knots. The quadruple expansion was realized by cylinders of 33, 47, 68 and 97.5 inch diameter with a 60-inch stroke. = Accommodation = The Rotterdam could transport 3,440 passengers. 525 first class, 515 second class, and 2,400 third class passengers. The first class passengers had the most facilities. Their big dining room measured 28 m by 23 m and could seat about 500 persons. Its floor was covered in rubber. The social hall measured 16 by 12 m and was finished with dark Spanish Mahogany. It had a piano and an organ. The large lobby was finished in cream lacquered wood and had wide stairs with wrought iron gilded ornamentation and a copper handrail. It led to a palm garden of 14 by 12 m, which was finished in cream lacquered wood in Louis XVI style. Its sides contained Delftware tile tableaux. In the center a large cupola with stained glass windows shed light on the garden and stairs. The library measured 10.5 by 12 m and was decorated Louis XVI style in Italian juglans wood. The upper and lower smoking lounges measured 18 by 13.5 m and 9 by 13.5 m. There were 265 first class cabins. There were 48 single person luxury cabins, and 12 suites with their own saloon. The number of first class bathrooms was about 100. The wide stairs gave access to the first class promenade decks. There was an upper and lower promenade decks as well as a boat deck, totaling 28,255 square feet. A novelty of the Rotterdam was that parts of the promenade decks had glass covers that could be brought up against the sea spray. At the time a unique feature of liners crossing the Atlantic. For the second class passengers there was also a dining room. It was also finished in lacquered wood, seated 300 persons and measured 14 by 23 m. On the higher decks there was a saloon for ladies and a smoking saloon finished in oak. The second class promenade decks measured 12,000 square feet. There were 158 second class cabins. Many for two persons, but also for four persons. The 2,400 third class passengers had two dining rooms measuring 6,230 square feet in total. Not that much smaller than the first class dining room. However, it had place for only 581 persons, so the third class passengers had to eat in shifts. Third class cabins were also for two or four persons, and got clean bedding each trip. Spacious lobbies with seats led upstairs where the third class had 11,000 square feet of promenade deck. = Crew = The Rotterdam had a crew of 472 people. 51 served on deck, 119 on the machines, and 302 in 'civilian service'. The purser (chef- hofmeester) had an assistant-purser as well as 5 stewards (hofmeesters). There were 126 waiters first class, 55 waiters second class, and 31 waiters third class. There were 15 maids for the linen, and 44 cooks. Their work was made a bit lighter by three electrical dishwashers, one with a capacity of 4,000 an hour, and two with a capacity of 400 pieces an hour. There were also machines for skinning potatoes and polishing knives.  Service  The Rotterdam at the HAL terminal in Hoboken, New York on one of her first voyages On 13 June 1908 SS Rotterdam started her maiden trip from Rotterdam to New York. This was only a few weeks after her trials at Belfast in early June. On board were only 75 first class passengers, 82 second class, and 128 third class passengers. On 1 July she left New York again, with 288 passengers first class, 356 second class passengers and 298 third class passengers. 1908 was not a good year for the American economy, and that explains why the passenger numbers picked up slowly. However, by 1910 the Rotterdam regularly transported more than a thousand migrants on each trip. Even before World War I the HAL started to develop a cruise industry. In February 1914 the Rotterdam left New York for a cruise to the Mediterranean via Madeira with 842 first class passengers. It would make a round trip of the Mediterranean, visiting Cadiz, Gibraltar, Algiers, Athene, Istanbul, Jaffa, Alexandria, Naples, Villefranche-sur-Mer, and Boulogne.  World War I During the first years of World War I the Rotterdam transported many of the 45,000 American civilians that got stuck in Germany or Switzerland back to the United States. In September 1914 the Rotterdam steamed from New York and was arrested and brought to Plymouth on 22 September. Here it had to unload the copper it carried. However, the 1,500 tons of copper loaded in New York could not be unloaded from the lower decks because the harbor of Southampton was closed. Therefore, the English government bought the copper and the Rotterdam was released on 6 October. The copper would then be unloaded in Rotterdam and stored there on behalf of the English government. On 12 October 1914 the Rotterdam arrived in Rotterdam carrying 8,000 25kg sacks of flour. On 16 October she left for New York again, carrying almost 2,000 passengers. She then made another trip from Rotterdam to New York, and made two trips between Italy and New York. After most Americans had left Europe, and because migration had come to a standstill, the number of passengers became insufficient to make a profit. This was more than compensated by the cargo situation. Exports from the Netherlands had first declined, but then began to grow. For cargo to the Netherlands, the situation was even better. There was so much cargo that the HAL had to hire ships to transport it. In 1915 the Rotterdam sailed a regular schedule between Rotterdam and New York. Often less than a hundred boarded in New York, and about 500 in Rotterdam. On 29 August 1915 a fire was discovered on board. It was extinguished by pumping sulfur gas into the compartment. On arrival in Rotterdam on 2 September this proved not to be the case, and the fire was extinguished with water. The fire probably started in the cotton cargo. Of the 201 sacks of mail stored above, 7 were burnt and the rest was heavily damaged by the water. In the first years of the war the Rotterdam also regularly transported gold to the Netherlands. In late 1915 the Rotterdam had 25,500 balen coffee (sacks of 60 kg) on board. On 23 March 1916 the Rotterdam arrived in Rotterdam. Her cargo of mail had been seized in England, and she carried the crew of the sunk Palembang. HAL then decided to lay up the Rotterdam. The official reason was that if she was lost, she could not be replaced for many years because Dutch shipyards were not able to build a ship of the size of the Rotterdam. Rotterdam sat out the unrestricted submarine warfare, that started on 1 February 1917 safely in port.  Post World War I On 2 April 1921 Albert Einstein arrived in New York on board the Rotterdam = Back in service = After World War I had finished, the Rotterdam first had to go to Glasgow to dock, as there was no suitable drydock in the Netherlands. On 24 January the Rotterdam left the Rotterdam for New York with less than 100 passengers, but in Brest she picked up many American soldiers. These trips with American soldiers continued for some months, and gradually the regular service from New York to Rotterdam was restored. In April 1921 the Rotterdam was the first ship to officially use the 46,000 tons drydock at Wilton%27s Dok- en Werf Maatschappij in Schiedam. = Cruise ship = In the 1920s the Rotterdam regularly made a cruise from New York to the Mediterranean. E.g. in 1923, in February-March 1924. and in 1925. In 1929 she was renovated. The three passenger classes were replaced by two. The capacity changed to 517 first class and 1,130 tourist class passengers. A decline in capacity of almost 50% from the 3,139 she could carry previously. Also in the early thirties, her hull was painted white. In 1935 the Rotterdam hit a reef near the Morant Cays south of Jamaica. She was pulled loose, and repaired at Wilton-Fijenoord. The Rotterdam made cruises to the North Cape in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938. In 1937 and 1938 she also made a long cruise to South America.  Broken up  Polygoon-journaal from 1940 about the voyage of the SS Rotterdam IV to the ship breakers In 1939 the Rotterdam was laid up in Rotterdam. By then she had sailed a distance of 70 times the circumference of the earth. In 1940 she was broken up. The next HAL ship named Rotterdam was the SS Rotterdam V that still exists as a museum ship and hotel in Rotterdam.

He worked for the Air Inspectorate Department in nearby March, auditing aircraft parts during the Second World War. After the war, he married and worked in Wisbech as a manager with Cambridgeshire Motors on Elm Road. His house was one of many that was affected by the 1978 Wisbech Flood. His collection of thousands of prints was ruined. Fortuitously, the film negatives were not.  Photography Hastings made strenuous efforts to capture the images of buildings in Wisbech during the 1950s and 1960s. Slum clearances and the demolition of redundant buildings were rapidly changing the townscape. The filling in of the Wisbech Canal in the 1960s, removal of bridges and sluice and construction of the dual carriageway and associated road junctions changed the town irreversibly. The closure of the passenger railway and reduction in the freight operations also released land for other uses. Cycling around the town and nearby villages with a 35mm camera, he captured images of properties destined for future demolition. As his collection rapidly grew he was increasingly able to provide images for local papers and books on local history. The Wisbech flood of 1978 ruined his collection of prints. After he died in 2005, his family discovered boxes of negatives not reached by the floodwater. These were passed to a family friend, a local history enthusiast. An example of one of his drawings used in a newspaper is on the Cambridgeshire Community Archive Network website. A picture of the Young memorial drawn by Hastings accompanied a letter by Roger Powell in the Cambridgeshire Times in 2012. Legacy Images of pubs around Wisbech over the border that are in Norfolk, are on the Norfolk pubs website. Wisbech & Fenland Museum organised a month long exhibition of Hastings' drawings in March 2012. In October and again in November 2013, an exhibition of Hastings photographs accompanied a talk by William P Smith on the Wisbech Canal in the Tower Ballroom. A selection of his photos from the 1960s is on Facebook. One of his photos is used on the Fully Booked murder website His images of local pubs feature on the Norfolk pubs website ( http://www.norfolkpubs.co.uk/norfolke/emneth/emnetsw.htm). Since Hasting's death, other images continue to be used in books on the local history of the town, canal and nearby villages, \\\\- The negatives of the films were digitised by Andy Ketley so that the collection could be made secure and available to the public. Hastings' railway drawings are on the Hornby site. Hastings is featured in the Fading Images website of Cambridgeshire photographers and on the Wisbech High Street project website. He is described as one of Wisbech's impressive legacy of pioneering photographers, along with Samuel Smith and Lilian Ream, who used the town centre and High Street as the subject for many of their photographs. In 2019, the Friends of Wisbech and Fenland Museum started a project to publish his images and raise funds to preserve the collection of 3,000 images. To support the launch, articles appeared in the Wisbech Standard and The Fens magazine. The first print run of 100 copies of Images of Wisbech no.1 sold out in a week and the reprint of 200 was sold out before a formal book launch could be arranged. The Images of Wisbech no.2 print run of 200 copies was brought forward and quickly sold out. Reprints and additional releases are planned for 2020. An illustrated talk by William P. Smith to coincide with the launch of Images of Wisbech no.3 was held by the Friends of Wisbech and Fenland Museum in Wisbech Library on 13 February 2020. Research into the collection of images is ongoing and unidentified images are posted to local Facebook discussion sites to facilitate accurate identification.

Design and development The Rocketdyne division of North American Aviation developed a relatively small liquid-fuelled rocket engine for thrust augmentation of manned aircraft during the late 1950s. The AR2 is a single-chamber rocket engine burning kerosene (JP-4 or JP-5) jet fuel, oxidised with 90% High Test Peroxide (H2O2 / HTP), allowing the engine to use the same fuel as an aircraft fuel system. The variable-thrust AR2 is a direct development of the fixed thrust AR1, which was given the military designation LR36.

Majority of the inhabitants are Christians. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the inhabitants. In 2015, the original settlement got submerged in water when the Mapithel Multi Purpose dam was commissioned. Most of the arable land in the village also got submerged and some of the residents relocated to a higher ground while most of the residents resettled elsewhere. The village for now has become a tourist destination who mainly visit for sightseeing, fishing and camping by the dam. The submerged church and the old settlement is visible when the water level of the dam recedes during winter and is a major attraction for tourists to revisit the once flourishing village.

She was a postdoctoral researcher at the Silwood Park campus of Imperial College London and later a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1998 she moved to the Natural Resource Institute at the University of Greenwich where she leads on Pest Behaviour Research. In 2013 was appointed Professor of Medical Entomology.  Research  Gibson's research looks the sensory physiology and behaviour of mosquitoes and how this influences their interactions with humans and other animals. She found that mosquitoes can adapt their acoustic behaviour to aid mating, they will adjust their wingbeat frequency to synchronise with that of a mosquito of the opposite sex flying near them, so as to aid mating in mid air. The insects listen to each other's wingbeat frequencies with a special organ on their antenna called the Johnston's organ. Her team subsequently found that mosquitoes of the same sex or of different species are not able to match wingbeat frequencies and are therefore not able to mate. Gibson's team have created a new mosquito trap that can mimic human body odour and incorporates design to encourage mosquitoes to land on the trap surface.

Biography James Robert Kennedy was born on October 14, 1946 in Anderson to parents Bill Kennedy and Janie Mae Bolden Greenlee. He had two brothers, George and Walter. According to Sheila Hilton, the former principal of T.L. Hanna High, Kennedy earned the nickname \\"Radio\\" in the mid-1960s when he began to show up at the school football field with a transistor radio. In 1964, Kennedy befriended the high school's then football coach Harold Jones. Their friendship served as the basis of the 2003 film Radio starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Kennedy and Ed Harris as Jones. In 1965, Kennedy became an unofficial 11th-grade student at T.L. Hannah High. Kennedy was considered a permanent high school junior, meaning that he would never graduate or have to leave. In 2006, a statue of Kennedy was unveiled at the football stadium of T.L.

A cast iron milepost in St Stephen's Hill, St Albans placed by the Hatfield and Reading Turnpike Trust about 1820 The Hatfield and Reading Turnpike was an English turnpike road created in the 1760s to provide a route that connected the Great North Road (the modern A1) with the Holyhead Road (A5) and the Bath Road (A4). It had the advantage that it made it possible for travelers to avoid congested London and was shorter in distance. In 1881 it was one of the last of the turnpikes to have its tolls removed.  Founding  It is said that the Marquis of Salisbury, who lived at Hatfield House, wanted a route to the Great West Road avoiding central London, for onward travel to the spa towns of Bath and Cheltenham where, as a sufferer of gout, he often took the waters. This would also spare him the discomfort and congestion of London's cobbled streets. , With others (including the Earl of Essex, who suffered from a similar affliction, and who lived at Cassiobury House near Watford) he sponsored an Act of Parliament passed in 1757 for the building of a road from Hatfield to Reading. The Reading and Hatfield Turnpike Trust was set up by a further Act passed in 1768, to improve the route between the two towns. It ran via St Albans, Watford, Rickmansworth, Amersham, High Wycombe and Marlow, with two alternative routes south and west from there, one to Knowl Hill (on the Great West Road between Maidenhead and Reading) and the other to Reading itself via Henley-on-Thames. The Trust lasted until 1881, and at that date was one of the last surviving Turnpike Trusts in the country. For many years the route was known as the Gout Track, given its reputed raison-d'etre. Analysis of toll receipts shows that traffic was lighter than that on the great trunk routes it interconnected. . Nevertheless, it stimulated the local economies along its route in trades like farriers , foraging and inn keeping.  Modern successor routes  Hatfield and Reading Turnpike Trust milestone on Hatfield Road St Albans.. On classification by the newly formed Ministry of Transport in 1922, it formed parts of the A414 (Hatfield - St Albans), A412 (St Albans - Watford - Rickmansworth), A404 (Rickmansworth - Amersham), A416 (Amersham - High Wycombe - Marlow - Knowl Hill) and A32 (Marlow - Henley - Reading). In 1935, the A404 was extended along the A416 section between Amersham and the A4 to make it easier for those who wanted to use the route for its original function, while the A32 section through Henley was renumbered the A4155 . South of Marlow the turnpike had two alternate routes - * one to Knowl Hill (former terminus of A404) on the A4 to the west of Maidenhead with part now the unclassified Burchett's Green Road. * or another via Henley-on-Thames to Reading (now the A4155).

Research  Her research looks at freshwater invertebrates and she specialises in British mosquitoes, and the microplastic pollution and ecotoxicology of freshwater invertebrates. Callaghan has showed that in lab experiments mosquito larvae can feed on microplastic particles and these will remain in their bodies when they metamorphose through to a pupa and then a flying adult mosquito. She monitors British mosquito species to look at whether their distribution and behaviour is changing in response to global climate change and whether there might be a risk of Malaria disease transmission in Northern Europe. In particular she has highlighted that the use of water butts in UK gardens can create a habitat in which female mosquitoes can lay their eggs.

It replaced the Commission pour la transparence financi√®re de la vie politique (lit. Commission for the financial transparency of politics). The HATVP is responsible for ascertaining and preventing potential conflicts of interest among French public servants.  History  Until 1989, the investigation and application of ethical problems, which included conflicts of interest or chronicles, were included in criminal proceedings, but had no special laws or authority to deal with such affairs until the Luchaire Affair that took place between 1982 and 1986. During the tenure of Charles Hernu, France supplied shells to Iran. The newspaper La Presse de la Manche and a report of the Contr√¥le g√©n√©ral des arm√©es published by L'Express in January 1987 revealed that end-user certificates were falsified to show destinations other than Iran, as the country was under an arms embargo at the time. After this scandal, the first \\"transparency of public life\\" law was passed; it defined the state funding of political parties and mandated some public servants to publish their financial status. However, this law was very vague and unclear in some aspects. In 1994, a parliamentary working group led by Philippe S√©guin made 18 proposals including the limitation of election expenses, the reformation of the status of political parties, and the extension of the mandatory declaration of status to more categories of public servants. On 14 January 2020, the High Authority received three delegates from the European Commission. On April 10th, 2013, after the Cahuzac affair, the HATVP was created.

Indigenous, Basque, New England, Norwegian and Japanese whaling traditions have been present in Chilean waters. Prehispanic and colonial whaling A passive style of whaling may have been practised by the canoe-faring peoples of the fjords and channels of southern Chile during Prehispanic times. This mean that only weakened or stranded whales where hunted. Similarly to the peoples from the fjords and channels, inhabitants of more northern parts of Chile practised passive hunting from at least colonial times to well into the 20th century. 19th century whaling Active whaling in Chilean waters began with United States whalers venturing into Chile in the 19th century. In New England, whaling had developed rapidly in the 18th century. The presence of New England whalers in Chilean Waters catalyzed the local whaling industry which had developed considerably by 1868, with 19 whaling ships being registered in Chile. Chilean registered whalers made annual travels to Gal√°pagos Islands and the Gulf of Panama in search of whales. 20th century whaling In the early 19th century, whaling began to be conducted with modern techniques developed in Norway. For this purpose, whaling companies were formed in Valdivia, Chilo√© and Punta Arenas. In the 1960s, the whaling industry declined severely, and the processing factories in Bajo Molle and Quintay closed in 1965 and 1967, respectively. The last processing factory, in Chome, closed in 1983. Whaling companies were: *Compa√±√≠a Chileno Noruega de Pesca *Sociedad Ballenera de Corral Whale hunting is richly portrayed by Francisco Coloane in his books. =Norwegian whaling in Magallanes= Adolf Amandus Andresen immigrated to Chile in 1894 where he prospered as a tugboat captain. He later returned to Norway to learn about the whaling industry in Finnmark. In 1903, Andresen, with a harpoon cannon mounted on one of his tugboats, shot his first whale in Chilean waters. He later managed the Sociedad Ballenera de Magallanes (the Magellan Whaling Company) with a shore station in Bah√≠a Aguila. Andresen's 1907 catch of 79 right whales drew competition to the area, though the success went unmatched. In 1914, he set out from San Pedro with a factory ship, Sobraon, and two catchers to hunt humpbacks along the coast from Chile, Peru, Ecuador and on to Columbia, following the migrating animals. Andresen was the first person to raise the Chilean flag on Antarctica. However, his whaling business ultimately failed as a result of economic depression and the collapsing world market for whale oil. Encouraged by Andresen, another Norwegian whaler, Christen Christensen, sent the Vesterlide to San Pedro, captained by his own son, to hunt blue whales in the Bay of Corcovado. Christensen also financially backed another whaling company, Sociedad Ballenera y Pescadora, which was operated by H.C. Korsholm in Valdivia. Unfortunately, the returns were inadequate and both companies were liquidated by 1913.

Installation  head crowned with golden stars The Statue Notre-Dame-du-Saguenay begins its journey on August 13.

The Godin and Desvarennes company from Chicoutimi ascended the Virgin from Cape Trinit√©. A dozen employees are supervised by foreman Godin. They install wooden beams along the cape as well as a hoist actuating a cable about 50 feet in length that they fix on the side of the mountain. An attempt is made to hoist one of the three parts of the statue for the first time, but the attempt is unsuccessful because the weight is too great. The statue is therefore separated into fourteen pieces, previously assembled by Louis Jobin using wooden dowels, to manage to hoist it. Slowly, we go up the pieces by raising them one by one 50 feet at a time until the first level of Cape Trinit√©. Then, the monument is installed on the wooden base which is intended for it.

Personal life  De Jong was born on 19 May 1866 as the daughter of the lawyer Sir Johan Jan Fran√ßois de Jong van Beek en Donk and Anna C√©cile Wilhelmine Jeanne Jacqueline Nahuys, as the second of three children. She married Adriaan Eliza Goekoop on 25 August 1890. The couple did not have children and the marriage was dissolved on 20 November 1899. In 1900, she moved to France. She remarried in Paris on 28 May 1904, to Michel Frenkel and gave birth to a son, Pierre Michel, in 1905. Her earlier divorce had caused a break with her family, and her death in M√©r√©ville, France, on 15 June 1944 went mostly unnoticed in her native country, the Netherlands.  Career  De Jong was a fervent feminist. Even though many historians dismissed her because she was from a higher class, she was one of the, if not the, most famous feminist authors in the Netherlands around the 1900s. Her career as an author started in 1897. Her first published work was \\"Aan de vrouwen van Nederlandsch Oost-Indi√´\\" (\\"To the women in the Dutch East Indies\\"). This piece was written in honor of an exhibition about female workers. This piece was not given a lot of attention, unlike her next book \\"Hilda van Suylenburg\\" (1897) which is when her writing career really took off. This novel was a great success within the Netherlands and around it, but caused a lot of controversy. The novel encompasses a story about the first female lawyer (fictional) in the Netherlands, and also touches upon how women can build their own meaningful lives without having to depend on others. On top of that, it promotes marriages only when there is equality and love involved. Her second novel is \\"Lilia\\" (1907) about an unmarried woman who becomes pregnant. It was not received as well as her other novel, even though there were positive reviews. She published some more texts, but none reached the fame that her very first novel did.  Critical reception  Much has been written about De Jong's most famous works, Hilda van Suylenberg and Lilia. Opinions are divided on Hilda. The novel is a trend novel (nl), in which all feminist ideas from the fin de si√®cle are discussed. It was seen as a trend novel, because it highlights feminist ideas very strongly. Moreover, the message was seen as very, or too, obvious. Because of this pamphlet in novel form, the book did end up with the desired public, namely women from the bourgeoisie. However, the novel was criticised, because it was only focussing on higher class women, and does not give a voice to lower class women. The novel also received positive reactions. Hilda was a role model for higher class women, because she was able to combine her career as a lawyer with a good marriage and motherhood, and the novel showed how girls can create a meaningful life. This contrasts heavily with Eline in the then also popular novel Eline Vere (1888) by Couperus. Margaretha Meijboom put her positive response like this: \\"Now it gave words and forms ‚Äì powerful and striking! ‚Äì to what unknowingly lived and caused struggle in so many women's hearts.\\" And she called it \\"the spark in the gunpowder\\". Hilda van Suylenberg was even compared to Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), because it also ruffled a few feathers. However, it was also said that the book contains too many extreme characters, which would reduce the believability. In addition, according to Henri√´tte Roland Holst bourgeois feminism would distract from true socialism. Recent researchers call the novel the most read and discussed Dutch novel of the fin de si√®cle. According to literary critic Henri Smissaert, De Jong's second novel Lilia depicted too much immoral behavior, and did not offer a counter perspective to this behavior. This prevented the readers from seeing Lilia like she really was. Moreover, Lilia is not ashamed of her immoral behavior and her illegitimate child. On the other hand, Smissaert says, she is a person of flesh and blood, in contrast to Hilda and Corona in Hilda van Suylenberg. Lilia's free love was seen as the demise of morality. Author Anna de Savornin Lohman argues that it is bad to exercise free love, because the change in morality would not lead to the liberation of women. In addition, Lilia is seen as egoistic, because she only thinks about herself and not about her child, who will now have to live with the backlog that Lilia has given him as an outcast. The story is also unbelievable, according to Lohman, because the novel ends where the struggle begins in real life.

The group was founded in 2017 and incorporated in 2019. It has offices in Central, Hong Kong. It is the only incorporated organization dedicated to such doctors.  Background  The member doctors graduated from medical schools outside of Hong Kong, attained medical licensure in their original jurisdiction, and then successfully cleared the qualification requirements for registering as a medical practitioner in Hong Kong. Before non-local medical graduates can become registered medical practitioners in Hong Kong, they are required to attain a license from the Medical Council of Hong Kong (i.e., the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Hong Kong or LMCHK qualification). The pathway to earn the qualification requires passing a rigorous Hong Kong Medical Licensing Examination (HKMLE) and undergoing a period of training or local work experience. LMCHK doctors are thus both licensed and registered in Hong Kong. Prior to 1997, the LMCHK doctors consisted overwhelmingly of graduates from Mainland China. The pre-1997 colonial government exempted graduates of commonwealth countries from having to sit for a licensing exam or having to serve additional training. After 1997, all non-local graduates were required to earn the LMCHK licensure in order to register to practice in Hong Kong. Consequently, the geographic and ethnic diversity of LMCHK doctors has increased particularly in the last several years.  History  The rigorous requirements to become an LMCHK doctor has given the group a common bond. With the growing size and diversity of LMCHK doctors post-1997, interest grew within the LMCHK community to meet up. To this end, there were periodic social events throughout the years from 1997 to 2016. The Licentiate Society traces its formation to 15 June 2017, when the doctors started a popular WhatsApp group and began meeting regularly. On this same day, 11 members of the LMCHK community held a happy hour social. The group continued to grow and hold regular meet-ups, dinners, and other events. In August 2019, the members outnumbered the WhatsApp limit of 256 people. To address the overflow, they formed additional groups. The quarterly events (and more) have been held continuously since June 2017. On 26 November 2019, the group incorporated as a nonprofit company limited by guarantee with the name The Medical Licentiate Society of Hong Kong. The Licentiate Society has LMCHK doctors from over 20 different licensing jurisdictions including (in order by relative numbers of doctors): UK, Mainland China, Australia, Ireland, USA, Canada, South Africa, Chinese Taipei, Singapore, Belgium, India, Korea, Nepal, Netherland-Antilles, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Russia, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.  Purpose  The Licentiate Society's aims include: * Nurtures the needs of the LMCHK community through social events and medical education. * Represents LMCHK community's interests in and outside of Hong Kong * Supports the efforts of candidates sitting for the HKMLE, including holding exam review sessions * Endorses public education and engagement * Promotes the highest standards of healthcare, professionalism, safety, and education * Encourages working with other medical practitioners and doctors and community organizations in realizing it objectives  Governance  The Licentiate Society's governing body is the Council and consists of 9 Council Members, who serve as its board of directors. Three Council Members hold officer positions as follows: President, Honorary Secretary, and Honorary Treasurer.  Membership  There are 4 classes of members: Full, Associate, Honorary, and Corporate. Only Full Members may vote and hold office.  Committees  The Licentiate Society has 3 approved committees, which consist of the following: Member Services, Medical Education, and Industry Relations.

There is a long-standing tradition that she was a natural daughter of James II of England. No records of her during her life in the town have been located in the Wisbech & Fenland Museum that confirm the Stuart royal link; it was only after her death that the details of her life were recorded in oral histories of Wisbech residents.  Biography  Stuart's father, James II of England, was an English prince in exile in France following the execution of his father, Charles I. when she was born. The identity of Stuart's mother is unknown. James returned to England, bringing Jane Stuart with him, when she was about six years old. She was raised at court. Stuart was once engaged, but her fiance was killed in an accident when their coach overturned on their wedding day. At one point, she was imprisoned with Quaker theologian Thomas Elwood. She left court for a life in keeping with her values as a Quaker around age 34, when her father, by then King of England, was exiled to France. She left in disguise, perhaps a Quaker's dress, and went north, ending in Wisbech, working first in fields and then as a spinner. She once traveled to Scotland to see her much-younger brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, Prince of Wales, also known as \\"the old pretender.\\" Later in life, Stuart was sought out by the Duke of Argyll; she recognized his coach and hid, thinking he was seeking her out to be a political pawn. It is said that Stuart preferred her simple life to that of one at court and claimed she would not give it up to be Queen of England. The meeting house Stuart attended was a thatched building, as shown in watercolour painting by Algernon Peckover. She died at the age of 88 on 12 July 1742. She is referred to in the Victoria County History. She is supposed to have had all her teeth at the time of her death. The story of Stuart's life was the basis of a novel Royal Quaker by Mrs Bertram Tanqueray.  Gravesite  Her final resting place is in the burial ground behind the Friends Meeting House on the North Brink. The graves at that time were unmarked. Stuart's was marked by box (Buxus sempervirens) hedging. Stuart's grave is stated as \\"exhibiting the initials 'J.S.' with the words and figures 'aged 88. 1742' and is supposed to record the sepultre of one of the descendants of the royal family of Stuarts\\" in The History of Wisbech published by William Watts in 1834. Box hedging remains around Stuart's grave. Today it forms the shape of a rectangle enclosing 'JS, AGE, 88, 1742' although in the past a drawing by Algernon Peckover showed it as forming \\"JS, aged 88, 1742\\" perhaps over the centuries parts required replanting. A recent photo of the box hedging is on the Friend website. The travel writer James Hooper was shown around the Friends Meeting House and Burying Ground by Alexander Peckover in 1897, later in his newspaper article he notes 'the headstone inscription - Jane Stuart Died 1742 Aged 88' and 'this highly accomplished woman once fainted in the God's Acre of the peace-loving Friends, and under the turfy spot on which she fell lie her remains'.

It stars Ethan Hawke as Nikola Tesla. Eve Hewson, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Jim Gaffigan, and Kyle MacLachlan also star.TeslaSundance Film FestivalConsequence of Sound The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 27, 2020, and was released in selected theaters and via Premium VOD on August 21, 2020, by IFC Films.  Plot  The narrator tells how Nikola Tesla, as a small child, saw electricity when petting his cat. In 1884 New York City, adult Nikola Tesla (Ethan Hawke) is working for Thomas Edison (Kyle MacLachlan), who doesn't seem to regard Tesla overly highly. He is told by another coworker that perhaps it is because Edison's wife has just died. When they get into a heated work confrontation, they smash ice cream cones in each other's faces. The narrator revealed to be Anne Morgan (Eve Hewson), appears with a laptop, saying that this probably is not how this happened. She tells about how when you Google Tesla, you only find a couple of photos, and proceeds to detail more information about his past and how he had his first flash of the motor he would eventually invent. She notes when you google Edison, you get twice as many results. The narrator continues to explain his previous troubles and financial poverty until he is finally able to pitch his idea to those who will pay him much more than Edison. The narrator tells how Edison meets his second wife Mina (Hannah Gross) in 1885. Tesla continues work on his induction motor, assisted by his friend Anthony Szigeti from Budapest (Ebon Moss-Bachrach). They reveal their spark-less motor to high praise, and Tesla eventually meets Anne, the daughter of JP Morgan (Donnie Keshawarz). Tesla presents his findings, and George Westinghouse (Jim Gaffigan) buys the patents for Tesla's inventions and brings Tesla to Pittsburgh to oversee production. Westinghouse updates Tesla on the rivalry between Edison's findings and Tesla's, Edison insists on his for the matters of execution. Edison says direct current is better and dismisses Tesla's alternating current. Szigeti shows Tesla an invention he has discovered, a compass, only to be told by Tesla another inventor has beaten him to it, and he leaves town to seek other fortunes. Meanwhile, William Kemmler becomes the first person to be executed with electric induction ‚Äì but it is completely botched and gruesome. Edison blames the doctors. Tesla begins dating Anne ‚Äì despite her father being one of Edison's incredibly wealthy funders. After the World's Fair in 1893 is powered by Westinghouse/Tesla's machines, everyone sees Tesla's alternating current as highly viable. Edison meets with Tesla and admits he was wrong and asks him to work together, insisting bygones be bygones. The narrator comes over and says the meeting never happened, and that Edison never admitted he was wrong and they never reconciled. Westinghouse tells Tesla that Edison is sunk, but that their business is still failing, and that they need a JP Morgan-like merger. If Westinghouse pays Tesla what he is owed, he will be bankrupt. The only merger he could get requires Tesla to give up his horsepower clause, but then the entire country will be using his machines. Tesla chooses to tear up their contract to go forward with the merger. The famous traveling actress Sarah Bernhardt (Rebecca Dayan) performs her act and everyone goes out to see her. After the performance, Tesla seems attracted to Sarah, concerning Anne. Tesla and Edison have an uncomfortable and tense run-in where Edison seems bitter and resentful of Tesla's success, and Edison leaves with Sarah's group. After discussing Tesla's work with her father, he asks whether Tesla is seeking an investor or a wife. Shortly after, Tesla tells Anne he is planning on moving to Colorado, rather far. There, he begins work developing the Tesla coil. Its debut is impressive and unsettling, blowing up the local generator, which Tesla offers to pay for. Tesla once again sees Sarah when her tour comes through town and the two have an attraction. Tesla then presents his discoveries to JP Morgan showing him all the advantages his machines can provide the world. He is skeptical and doesn't like Tesla very much, but invests one hundred thousand dollars into Tesla's work. The narrator reveals Edison got out of the electricity business and goes into mining ‚Äì which ends up being a complete failure that loses him four million dollars. After Tesla gives an interview saying his equipment is picking up signals that could potentially be from Mars, Anne confronts him about this idea, noting her father reads the interviews he gives. Tesla goes to Morgan to ask for more money, who is skeptical that Tesla's research is really going anywhere. Tesla explains he is developing technology to map brain waves from the brain. Morgan, who is playing tennis with Anne, dismisses him. In a fantasy sequence, Tesla sings ‚ÄúEverybody Wants to Rule the World‚Äù. The narrator Anne asks Tesla if he remembers her face when she realized it was hopeless between them. She moves to the French countryside and begins working on creating health services and camps for children. She explains that Tesla outlives Edison, Westinghouse, Bernhardt, and Morgan and dies alone at 87. She says that maybe he overreached, or maybe the world we live in is one that Tesla dreamed first.

Capture On 30 September 1813 Weser, under the command of captaine de vaisseau Cantzlaar, Chevalier de L'ordre Imperiale de la Reunion, sailed from the Texel for the North Sea. There she captured two Swedish ships before a gale on the 16th took away her main and mizzen mast. Two days later , Commander Colin Macdonald, encountered her 60 leagues west of Ushant, making her way towards Brest under jury main and mizzen masts. Rather than engage Weser and risk being crippled and so unable to follow her given the weather, Macdonald decided to follow her. Fortuitously, on 20 October, , Commander J.J. Gordon Bremer, arrived and Macdonald and Bremer decided to attack Weser. They engaged her for about an hour and a half before they had to withdraw to repair their rigging. At about this time a third British vessel, the 74-gun third rate, , Captain Christopher Cole, came up. Bremer joined Cole and informed him of the situation while Scylla remained with Weser. The next morning, as Rippon and Royalist sailed towards Scylla to renew their attack, Weser sailed towards Rippon and struck, after first firing two broadsides towards Scylla. Scylla suffered only two men wounded in the entire engagement. Royalist suffered more heavily, having two men killed and nine wounded. Weser lost four men killed and 15 wounded. Royal Navy The Navy commissioned HMS Weser in March 1814 under Commander Thomas Ball Sulivan as a troopship, armed en fl√ªte. She underwent fitting at Plymouth for that role between February and April. In June she was part of a convoy, Royal Oak, Diadem, Dictator, Weser, Trave, Thames, Menelaus, and Pactolus, with 2,852 troops of General Ross' brigade (WESER carried 383), and four transports with horses, forage and rockets, which sailed for America, where she was actively employed until the conclusion of the war. Commander Sulivan commanded a division of boats and tenders at the destruction of Commodore Joshua Barney's Chesapeake Bay Flotilla in the Patuxent River on 22 August 1814. Commander Sulivan was promoted to post captain on 19 October. Commander Bartholomew Kent assumed command of Weser on 22 January 1815. Weser was present at the capture of Mobile, Alabama.

PSS Computation  In behavioral experiments, test individuals are usually presented with pairs of signals from different sensory modalities (such as visual and audio) at different SOAs and asked to make either synchrony judgements (i.e. if the pair of signals appears to have come at the exact same time) or temporal order judgements (i.e. which signal appears to have come earlier than the other). Results from an individual‚Äôs synchrony judgement tasks are typically fitted to a Gaussian curve with average perceived synchrony in percentage (between 0 and 1) on the y-axis and SOA (in milliseconds) on the x-axis, and the PSS of this individual is defined as the mean of the Gaussian distribution. Alternatively, results from an individual‚Äôs temporal order judgement tasks are typically fitted to an S-shaped logistic psychometric curve, with percentage of trials where the subject responds that signals from one certain modality has come first on the y-axis and SOA (in ms) on the x-axis.

Temporal recalibration is a phenomenon quantified by the shift in PSS after an individual is exposed to stimuli that are biased towards one particular sensory modality (e.g. only presenting them audio-visual pairs where audio comes before the video). Evidence suggests that after being exposed to bias stimuli, negative correlation can be found between level of temporal recalibration (change in PSS) and subjects‚Äô level of autistic traits, specifically attention to detail. This finding supports the idea that differences in sensory perception in individuals with ASD may be a contributing factor of their autistic behavioral traits.

The copy is of about 1470, attributed to a minor artist known as the \\"Pseudo-Pier Francesco Fiorentino\\" It is a highly individual depiction of the familiar scene of the Nativity of Jesus in art, placed in a mountainous forest setting, with debris from woodcutting all around, rather than the familiar stable in Bethlehem, and with the usual figures and animals around the mother and child replaced by others.Hartt, 219‚Äì220 The painting is in oil on a poplar panel, and the painted surface measures 127 x 116 cm, with the panel being 129.5 x 118.5 cm.Berlin, 44 Description The moment shown is known as the Adoration of the Child in art, as the almost naked baby Jesus is placed on the ground, and \\"adored\\" by his mother Mary. The lower part of his body is covered by a gauzy and transparent cloth. They are on a patch of ground with grass, several types of flower in bloom, but also some of the debris of forestry that appears throughout the forest background. To the left, the infant John the Baptist stands, wearing his attribute of a camelskin coat under a red robe. He carries a small cross on a long staff, and holds a banderole inscribed Ecce Agnus Dei (\\"Behold the Lamb of God\\"). However, he is shown as perhaps five or six years old, a much bigger age difference with the newborn Jesus than the church taught.Hartt, 219‚Äì220; Solum The signature on the axe handle Above John the Baptist is the praying figure of Saint Romuald (c.951 ‚Äì c. 1025/27), founder of the Camaldolese order of monks, to which the Medici family, the patrons of the painting had connections.This last figure is still sometimes identified as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, as by Holmes, 178, but is usually now seen as Romuald, as by Hartt, 220, Verdon and Rossi, 56, and Solum. At the top of the painting, slightly off-centre, are the two other persons of the Christian Holy Trinity, God the Father and the Holy Spirit, represented as a dove. All these figures form a near-continuous rough circle, slightly off-centre to the left. John's figure almost reaches the left edge of the painted surface, but on the right of the composition there is a generous slice of background, interrupted only by Mary's robe. It is not uncommon to have saints and persons not mentioned in the biblical accounts in Nativity scenes, but in addition to the normal elements. In contrast, as Hartt puts it, here there is \\"no cave, no shed, no Joseph, no angels, no ox, no ass\\".Hartt, 219 The scene is set on a steep slope in a rather dark forest, mostly consisting of pine trees, which runs right to the top of the composition, so that no sky can be seen. Stumps, discarded pieces of tree and other evidence of woodcutting is all around,Solum ‚Äì over 50 cut trees have been counted in the painting and Lippi has signed his name (\\"FRATER PHILIPPUS P[inxit]\\" ‚Äì \\"Brother Phillip painted this\\") along the handle of an axe struck into a stump in the bottom left-hand corner.Hartt, 220; Holmes, 180 A small, evidently fast-running, stream runs down the right- hand side of the painting, crossed by a crude bridge of planks. On the other side of this, near the top of the painting there is a small hut-like building. On the near side of the stream a crane or heron preens itself. A small goldfinch is perched on a stump at the front of the picture-space, near Jesus's foot; a common symbol in art for the Passion of Christ in the future.Private, 21:00 Context The Camaldoli monastery, 1898 Having a \\"portable altar\\", and so a private chapel, in a family city house was at this time a rather rare privilege; the Medici's right to do so had been granted in a papal bull of Pope Martin V in 1422. Only nine Florentine families were given the right in this period, and most of the identifiable altarpieces for such chapels featured several saints associated with the family, often the namesakes of members.Solum By 1563 the lack of the normal elements of a Nativity scene would be partly redressed by the completion of the famous frescos of the Procession of the Magi by Benozzo Gozzoli that cover most of the other walls of the Magi Chapel, and give it its name. These show the large and lively processions of the three Biblical Magi and their crowded trains making their way to Bethlehem, and include a number of portraits of the Medici family.Hartt, 298‚Äì299 Romuald was the founder of the Camoldolite order, named after their remote base at Camaldoli in the Apennines. The Medici, in particular Lucrezia Tornabuoni Medici, wife of the head of the family Piero de' Medici, were supporters of the order, and in the 1560s financed extensive rebuilding at Camaldoli, including cells reserved for their use when they visited. It is agreed that the forest in the painting represents the thick pine forests on the steep slopes around the monastery.Verdon and Rossi, 59; Hartt, 220 Woodcutting was a part of daily life for the community there, and timber for Florentine builders a major source of income.Hartt, 220; Private, 22:20 Many of the monks lived as hermits in small huts in forest clearings where they grew crops on their own plots. The cut down trees also refer to the words of John the Baptist, given in the Gospel of Matthew 3:10:Hartt, 220; Solum :And now also the axe is laid :unto the root of the trees: :therefore every tree which :bringeth not forth good fruit is :hewn down, and cast into the fire. (Authorized Version) The Camaldoli Nativity by Lippi, for Lucrezia Tornabuoni Medici's cell at Camaldoli, c. 1463. 130 x 140 cm (51.1 by 55.1 inches); now Uffizi Gallery Because of this passage, an axe was an attribute of John the Baptist in art, though by this period it was rare in Western art.Schiller, I, 125 and note 21 It may also have had other specific and personal meanings for Lippi, arising from the traditions of his own Carmelite order.Holmes, 180‚Äì182 John the Baptist was the patron saint of Florence and of the Camaldoli monastery. Lucrezia Tornabuoni Medici had a particular devotion to him, demonstrated by her poetry.Solum There has been much discussion as to who influenced the unusual features of the painting, apart from Lippi himself. Although there is surviving correspondence showing that Piero de' Medici took a considerable interest in the Gozzoli frescos, making his wishes prevail, there is nothing comparable for the altarpiece, and it has been argued that his wife Lucrezia was more significant for that.Solum Another candidate is the Archbishop of Florence until his death in 1459, Saint Antoninus of Florence, who knew the Medici well.Hartt, 219 The distinctive elements of the painting were quickly repeated by Lippi in a different composition of about 1463, known as the \\"Camaldoli Nativity\\". This was painted for Lucrezia Tornabuoni Medici's \\"cell\\" (one of the small single-story houses with its own plot) in the Camaldoli monastery, the treatment no doubt specified by her; it is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.Hartt, 219 Vasari says that both paintings were commissions of Lucrezia.Vasari, 136 File:Altar wall, Chapel of the Magi, Florence..jpgThe copy in the Magi Chapel of the Palazzo Medici, flanked by parts of Gozzoli's frescos File:Filippo lippi, adorazione del bambino coi ss. giuseppe, girolamo, ilarione e maria maddalena, 1455 ca. 01.jpgThe Annalena Nativity by Lippi, c. 1455, Uffizi Gallery File:Fra Filippo Lippi - St John Taking Leave of his Parents (detail) - WGA13283.jpgLippi and workshop, fresco in Prato Cathedral, John the Baptist Bids Farewell to his Family History The painting was created at the height of the power of the Medici family; Piero was dead within a few years, and the power of their many enemies grew until the main family members were expelled from Florence in 1494. Their goods were confiscated, and the Lippi was for several years hung as the altarpiece in the chapel of the Palazzo Vecchio, headquarters of the republic. When the Medici returned in 1512 they reclaimed it and it returned to their palace, where it remained for the next three centuries.Private, 31:00 Although not on public display, the painting was very well-known and much copied.Private, 30:20 The Englishman Edward Solly, whose large fortune came appropriately from trading timber, bought the painting in 1814, during the upheavals of the Napoleonic wars, and it was acquired for the Berlin collection in 1821, as part of a large sale of his collection.Private, 35:00; Berlin, 44 It became famous and popular with the public on display in Berlin over the next century, and in 1940 was moved with other important works to safe storage in a Berlin bunker.Private, 39:10 In 1945 this was not felt safe enough, and with thousands of other artworks and other valuables it was moved to a potassium mine.Private, 40:40 The US Army took the mine in the same year. At the end of the war the Americans intended, like the Russians, to permanently seize artworks owned by the German government, and over strong protests from the \\"Monuments Men\\", the Lippi was one of 202 artworks shipped to the US. On arrival they were hung in the basement of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, but the collection was not opened to the public, as the seizure had become controversial, with criticism in the press and Congress. Eventually the paintings were displayed as a temporary exhibition in the National Gallery, which toured to twelve cities in 1948‚Äì49; they were then sent back to Germany. The touring exhibition was a huge success, seen by over ten million people.Private, 41:20 After returning to West Berlin, the painting had a number of homes in the Berlin State Museums before the new building of the Gem√§ldegalerie at the Kulturforum was opened in 1998.Private, 44:50 See also *The Mystical Nativity by Sandro Botticelli, 1500‚Äì01 Notes References *\\"Berlin\\": The Complete Catalogue of the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, 1986, Harry N.

It had a maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale. At least 13 people were killed and another 210 injured.  Tectonic setting  Mindanao lies across the complex convergent boundary between the Sunda Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. Part of the oblique convergence between these plates is taken up by subduction along the Cotabato Trench. The strike-slip component of the convergence is accommodated partly by the Philippine Fault System and partly by the Cotabato Fault System, a network of mainly NW-SE trending sinistral (left-lateral) strike-slip faults that form the boundary between the Cotabato Arc and the Central Mindanao Volcanic Belt. In the area of the December 2019 earthquake, the individual faults include the NW-SE trending Makilala‚ÄìMalungon Fault, Tangbulan Fault and the Central Digos Fault. Earthquake The earthquake was recorded as 6.8 by ANSS and 6.9 by PHIVOLCS. The maximum felt intensity was given as VII MMI on the ANSS ShakeMap and VII PEIS in the PHIVOLCS summary for this event. The focal mechanism indicates strike-slip faulting with either sinistral movement on a NW-SE trending fault or dextral movement on a SW-NE trending fault, but the distribution of the aftershocks are consistent with the sinistral fault plane. The earthquake may be the result of movement on the Tangbulan Fault, according to PHIVOLCS. There were a series of large aftershocks, including nine of M ‚â• 5.0 in the first 48 hours after the mainshock, with the largest being an 5.7 event about an hour afterwards, which had a maximum felt intensity of VII (MMI). This event followed on from a series of earthquakes that struck Mindanao during October that year. The sequence of three M>6 events affected that area to the northwest of the December earthquake. The December 15 event is likely to be related to the earlier sequence, possibly by the effects of stress transfer. Damage and casualties The greatest damage from the earthquake was in the area around the epicenter, in the towns of Matanao, Magsaysay, Hagonoy and Padada. Significant damage was reported in 207 out of 232 barangays in Davao del Sur, 5 in Sarangani, 3 in Sultan Kudarat and 3 in North Cotabato. This earthquake added to the damage that much of the affected area suffered during the Cotabato earthquakes in October. At least one road was declared impassable in the Matanao area, a hospital was destroyed in Hagonoy and there was significant damage to a police station and fire station in Padada. A total of 5,973 houses were destroyed in Davao del Sur, with 31,832 suffering some damage and a further 32 in North Cotabato. 397 schools and 62 health facilities were damaged in Davao del Sur, Sarangani and North Cotabato. A six- year-old child was crushed by a wall in the barangay of Asinan in Matanao. Three others were killed and several others were trapped in Padada when a supermarket collapsed. As of December 23, at least 13 people had been killed, one remained missing and a total of 210 people were reported injured in the quake. Aftermath As of December 29, 40,424 people from 10,505 families were reported to be sheltering in a total of 102 evacuation centers after the earthquake, with a further 100,427 people (23,321 families) being assisted by friends and family.

The libretto was based on Il Trionfo di Camilla, regina de' Volsci by Silvio Stampiglia, translated into English verse by Owen Swiny, Peter Motteux, or others. Authorship of the music for the original is attributed variously to Giovanni Bononcini and to his brother Marc Antonio. Music for the London version was adapted by Nicola Haym. The opera was the first to be sung in a mixture of English and Italian, and it was one of the first London operas in which the castrato Nicol√≤ Grimaldi (known as Nicolini) performed. There were three separate productions of Camilla in London which together had 111 or 112 performances 1706 and 1728, making it the most popular and successful work of its period, after The Beggar's Opera. Roles and plot The story is based very loosely on the mythological figure of Camilla in Virgil's Aeneid. The characters are: Camilla, heiress to the throne of the Volscians, disguised as Dorinda, a shepherdess (soprano); Prenesto, prince of Latium (soprano); Latinus, king of Latium (tenor); Lavinia, his daughter, (soprano); Turnus, king of the Rutuli, disguised as Armidoro, a Moorish slave (soprano); Metius, confidant of Camilla (tenor); Linco, servant of Camilla (bass); Tullia, Lavinia's maid (tenor); and a Hunter (tenor). Act I: Camilla, disguised as a shepherdess, is hiding in the Volscian countryside and plans to overthrow the usurper King Latinus from the throne that is rightfully hers. A group of hunters arrives and one of their number, Prenesto, son of Latinus, is menaced by a boar. When Camilla shoots down the boar, he falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Lavinia, sister of Prenesto, is concealing her lover the enemy king Turnus in the palace, disguised as a slave. King Latino presses her to find a husband. Prenesto gives Camilla access to Latino's entourage where, allied with Metius, she plots to overthrow the king. Act II: Amorous intrigues and political conspiracies continue. Before the statues of her ancestors, Camilla swears revenge against Latinus and turns to the people to stir up the struggle. Meanwhile, Turnus, observed by Latinus, brings Lavinia poison and a dagger, offering her a choice of deaths as a way out of her impasse. However, unable to kill her himself, he confesses his real identity to Latinus, offering his own life in exchange for hers. Moved by this appeal, Latinus accepts him as a son-in-law. Act III: Latinus and Turnus ally themselves against Camilla, whose identity is meanwhile discovered by Lavinia's maid. Taken prisoner, she is freed by Prenesto, who continues to love her despite the hatred between their families. During a banquet a popular uprising is announced: Camilla and her allies defeat the troops of the Latin king. Love triumphs over political rivalry and marriage between Camilla and Prenesto ends the discord. Performance history The adaptation by McSwiney and Haym cut as much of the recitative as possible from libretto, as this was an unfamiliar form in English and difficult to write as effectively as in Italian. While the first performances were entirely in English, some sections were turned back into Italian to accommodate foreign singers, so that the performances took place in a changing mix of two languages. The original cast was: Holcomb (Prenesto), Hughs (Turnus), Lewis Ramondon (Metius), Richard Leveridge (Linco), Catherine Tofts (Camilla), Joanna Maria Lindelheim (Lavinia), and Mrs Lyndsey (Tullia). From December 6, 1707 the cast changed and performances were staged in a mix of Italian and English. The role of Turnus was taken by Valentino Urbani (Valentini), of Lavinia by Joanna Maria Lindelheim, and of Prenesto by Margherita de l'√âpine. The other roles were sung in English by Purbeck Turner (Latinus), Littleton Ramondon (Metius), Richard Leveridge (Linco), Catherine Tofts (Camilla) and Mary Lindsey (Tullia). From February 7, a new castrato, Giuseppe Cassani, took over the role of Metius. He was extremely unpopular and audiences hissed him and did not appear after February 10. Ramondon replaced him, presumably in English, from February 21. On 25 January 1709 Nicolini Grimaldi (Nicolini) took over the role of Prenesto, and Catherine Tofts the role of Camilla. There were nine performances in the first season, 21 the following season, and fourteen the one after. It was revived with (with Bononcini's original score rather than Haym's adaptation) in 1717, 1719 and 1726-28. The opera was so popular that five editions of the libretto were published by Jacob Tonson in 1726 alone. It was performed at court for the birthday of Queen Anne in February 1707. The original Italian opera by Stampiglia and Bononcini's premiered in Naples at the Teatro di S Bartolomeo on 27 December 1696. It went in to become the most successful work of its period; the libretto was used in 38 known productions before 1767. Bononcini's score was substantially used in 27 of these while there were 38 settings by other composers including Leo, Vinci (Parma 1725) and Porpora.

The term is derived from the fact that it receives the waters from the rivers and streams which flow into the lagoon from the drainage basin of the plain of the mainland by the lagoon. It is also reached by the tidal flows form he sea. , it is meant to be a belt that forms a transition area between the open lagoon and the mainland. Since it is between the inflow of freshwater form rivers and sea saltwater, in its natural state it would be an area with freshwater wetlands, barene (saltmarshes), velme (mudflats), and lagunar channels which forms a transitional belt between the mainland and the open lagoon rather than forming a fixed boundary, with its conformation changing according to the interplay of the hydrodynamic forces of the lagoon and their hydrodynamic equilibrium. However, this complex hydrologic and environmental system has undergone dramatic changes, both natural and, especially, man-made and has by and large lost it character as a transitional belt. Hydrologic characteristics of the lagoon and the gronda lagunare The drainage basin is a mildly inclined plain of alluvial formation to the north and along the sides of the lagoon which drains the watercourses coming from the Dolomites range of the Alps or from outcrop springs in the plain.Outcrop pf spring water into the lagoon and the nearby sea coasts. The gronda lagunare receives the waters of these watercourses and the sediments they carry. It has areas of freshwater wetlands near the mouths of these watercourses. It is also reached by the tidal flows which come through the lagoon from the inlets of its coastal shoreline in its south. A coastal lagoon is formed by the conjoint interaction between the freshwater of the inland watercourses and of the saltwater of the sea and is subject to a delicate hydrologic equilibrium between these. The sea coastline is composed of the peninsulas of Cavallino and Sottomarina, which form the northern and southern part respectively, and the barrier islands of Lido and Pellestrina in the middle. Between these formations, three inlets (Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia) let the tidal flow come into the lagoon. Over centuries the sediments brought in by the inland watercourses can cause significant silting and eventually fill the lagoon in, which can be turned into it into a delta by the force of the rivers. In the long run, the force of the sea could have two effects. One is to render the inlets non-navigable through the accumulation of sand carried by the current and, ultimately, closing them, turning the lagoon into inland waters closed off from the sea. Pandora ‚Äì ambiente (Laguna di Venezia) The other effect is an opposite one, a progressive erosion of the barrier islands through exceptional tides and, especially, storm surges. If the sea was to erode the barrier islands to an insignificant size or submerge them, the lagoon would be turned into a coastal bay. The Republic of Venice built a series of murazzi (imposing walls made of Istrian stone) along the seaward coasts of Pellestrina and Sottomarina to protect them from erosion by the sea between 1748 and 1784.Biblioteca Idraulica Italiana - La Laguna di Venezia The Republic also diverted many of the rivers which drain into the lagoon away from it to prevent silting in some of its areas. This altered the nature of the gronda, decreasing its areas of freshwater wetlands. It also altered the hydrogeographic balance between the input of fluvial and sea water in the lagoon. In the late 19th and early 20th century breakwaters were built at the inlets to stop the accumulation of sand there and ensure their navigability. The fluvial system of the gronda lagunare was complex and unstable. Several rivers flow into the lagoon along its length. They are, from east to west, the Sile, Zero, Dese, Marzenego, Muson, Bottenigo and Brenta. Moreover, there are affluent streams, ditches and drainage canals. Heavy rain could cause hydrologic stresses which had a cascading effect. The Zero could overflow and pour its waters into the Dese, which in turn would overflow and pour its waters into the Marzenego. Downpours could lead to frequent overflows and floods in the countryside over a wide area and changes in the courses of riverbeds. Due to the low gradient of the pain there was also a tendency for water to stagnate in the lower tracts of the rivers. This created wetlands in the gronda area, forming an amphibious environment between the mainland, lagoon and sea. In addition, the rivers continued on into the shallow lagoon, often reaching the sea, forming rivulets between the lagunar saltmarshes, bringing sediments into it and causing silting and mixing freshwater and saltwater, creating brackish water marshes which were liable to lead to problems with malaria.Il Fiume Marzenego Hydrologic transformations =River diversions= Rivers of the Lagoon of Venice Since the instability of the hydrogeography of the gronda lagunare, which could lead to floods, silting, stagnation of water and the development of wetlands, the Republic of Venice carried out many river diversion works over several centuries. Venice's main concern was to protect the lagoon form silting, which could hamper the navigation of the lagunar channels and the gronda rivers which provided communication routes for her trade with the mainland. Concern about floods in the mainland countryside was not a high priority. As a result, Venice created diversion canals close to the edge to the lagoon as it was cheaper than carrying out such works further inland. Effective flood prevention would have required catching the water of overflowing watercourses further upstream. In addition, the canals further inland would have had a greater incline, guaranteeing a good pace of water flow which would have prevented floods and water stagnation. Instead, canals by the lagoon had an insufficient incline, which meant that they could easily overflow and create floods and pools of stagnant water and wetlands, worsening the hydrologic situation of the gronda lagunare.Il Fiume Marzenego The Osellino canal was dug between 1510 and 1520 to partially divert the waters of the River Marzenego which flowed into the lagoon at Mestre. It runs along the central part of the lagoon to the east of Mestre, close to its edge, and ends at the mouth of the River Dese, in the northern part of the lagoon. It was intended to prevent silting in the lagoon and to stop the floods in the countryside of this area. However, it did not stop the latter. Being so close to the lagoon, it lacked incline, flowed too slowly and created areas of stagnant waters and wetlands which caused problems with malaria. The Republic of Venice never implemented plans for canals to collect the waters of all the rivers in the area (including the Muson, Dese and Zero) further inland to effectively prevent flooding because it was too expensive. These problems were resolved in the 20th century. Between 1674 and 1683 Taglio del Sile canal was dug. It diverts the waters of the River Sile which flowed into the northern part of the lagoon to the east of the above- mentioned rivers and takes them out of the lagoon, running along its edge. Silting in the lagoon was prevented but, again, the problems of floods and the formation of wetlands worsened. The river delta behind the canal progressively became eroded and the ground got lower due to sediment compaction. As a result, the countryside was on average half a metre lower than the canal which, with rain, would overflow. In 1871 the left bank of the canal was raised and in 1889 a siphon underpass was built to allow two local rivers (the Vallio e Meolo) to flow into the lagoon. This only alleviated the problems which were finally solved in the 1930s with the construction of a water pumping station.La Bonifica tra Basso Sile e LagunaArtificial fluvial diversions in the mainland of the Lagoon of Venice during the 16th and 17th centuries inferred by historical cartography analysis, Geomorphologie, Vol 18, No 2, 2012 : Alluvial geomorphology in Italy To the west of Mestre, the River Brenta and other nearby watercourses caused floods and silting in the central area of the lagoon which led to disruptions in that part of the mainland countryside and obstructed navigation on the watercourses which connected Venice with the mainland. To counter this, between the 14th century and the early 16th century, the Republic of Venice diverted the waters of this fluvial system, especially the Brenta, with a series of canals. After a number of ineffective interventions two long canals were created. Between 1489 and 1507 the Brenta Nova canal was dug to divert the Brenta away from its original mouth at Fusina, near Venice, to Conche, in the southern lagoon. It started at Dolo and run roughly parallel to the edge of the lagoon a few miles further inland. As this canal was close to the lagoon, it did not have a sufficient gradient and caused repeated floods upstream. Moreover, the new mouth brought sediments which created a large delta (over 30 km2) which partially buried the southern lagoon. Between 1554 and 1577 an embankment (the Parador di Brondolo) was built to take the mouth of the Brenta at Conche, together with the mouth of the nearby River Bacchiglione, away from the lagoon of Venice. The two rivers were made to flow into the lagoon of Brondolo, which was to the south of the lagoon of Venice and connected to it. This lagoon, which did not have a direct access to the sea, was turned into a freshwater lake and, later, it became completely silted up. The sea shore in this area advanced into the sea, forming a cuspate foreland. The southern part of the Lagoon of Venice, having lost the sediment input for the Brenta, became exposed to the erosive effect of the tidal flow, which led to a decrease in its above-water lands, a reduction of its saltmarshes and the progressive erosion of its inner deltas and of the fluvial channels that cross it. A new canal, the Taglio Novissimo, was dug between 1610 and 1791 to divert the waters of the rivers Magra, Muson, Bottenigo, Volpago, Bionca and Tergola as well as those of the Brenta. It started further east than the Brenta Nova (at Mira) and was thus longer than the Brenta Nova. It run a similar course and most of it was along the edge of the lagoon. Its objective was to resolve the problem of flooding. However, as it run along the edge of the lagoon, it incline was low and did not stop the floods. This problem was solved only in the late 19th century with the creation of the Cunetta canal which starts much further inland and to the east of the lagoon (at Stra, near Padua) and joins the Brenta Nova canal at its southern end and thus has the required incline. These river diversions also altered the hydrodynamic balance of the lagoon and new problems arose. Large areas of the lagoon became exposed above water during low tides and the inlets which provided communication to the sea became poorly navigable because of an accumulation of sand brought by the sea currents. In the early 17th century Benedetto Castelli, an engineer, argued that the former was due to the scarcity of the inflow of freshwater into the lagoon caused by the diversion of the River Brenta and that the latter was due to the sand brought by the sea current no longer being counteracted by the freshwater flowing into the lagoon from the opposite direction. He proposed to bring back the waters of the Brenta in a controlled manner so as to bring back the inflow of water into the lagoon but in a way that would prevent silting. He was also opposed to the planned diversions of the River Sile and four other mentioned rivers. This was rejected. The problem of sand accumulation at the Malamocco and Lido inlets was eventually resolved with the construction of breakwaters between 1838 and 1856 (for the Malamocco inlet) and between 1881 and 1910 (for the Lido inlet). The breakwaters keep the coastal current at bay and trap the sand it carries.Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 107-8, 115, 116, 118, 122-23, 125, 126, 127 The river diversions and the resulting loss of freshwater input into the lagoon also led to a reduction in the areas of freshwater wetlands in the gronda lagunare. = The \\"stiffening\\" of the gronda lagunare= In Italian the term \\"stiffening\\" of a shore or bank refers to the construction of embankments. Such works create rigid structures which make the shore or bank rigid compared to a natural state and constrains its waters. The term comes from the word rigido, rigid. In relation to the gronda lagunare, it indicates the development of artificial shores along the gronda and, through this, the creation of a fixed lagunar boundary which prevents natural fluctuations of its edge with a consequent loss of gronda's character as a transitional area between the open lagoon and the mainland with lagunar deltas and wetlands. Much of the gronda lagunare has been \\"stiffened\\" by the above- mentioned river diversions carried out by the Republic of Venice (particularly with the Taglio del Sile, Osellino and Taglio Novissimo canals). It has been accentuated by 20th century developments. This situation started to draw attention in the 1970s, when scientists determined that this exacerbates the risk of flooding in Venice and elsewhere in the lagoon. The river delta which was created in the southern part of the lagoon by the Brenta Nova canal and the nearby areas saw extensive land reclamations in the early 20th century. This dramatically changed the characteristics of this area, wiping out the local saltmarshes and patches of the lagoon and completely rearranging the local lagunar hydrographic network. It triggered substantial subsidence, causing in the long-term a lowering of the ground by a few metres. A new airport, the Venice Marco Polo Airport, was built by the edge of the central part of the lagoon, in the Tessera area in 1961. Its 3.3-kilometre (2.05 miles) long runway runs along the coast of the lagoon. The airport was built over part of the Osellino canal (which was covered), some 500 metres before it ends in the River Dese. The central area of the lagoon has been affected by industrial development. In the 1950s the town of Marghera, on the mainland coast of the lagoon, started to become an industrial area. The digging of a canal, the Malamocco-Marghera canal, was proposed. Its purpose was to link the Malamocco inlet access of the sea into the lagoon to a second industrial zone at the port of Marghera and make it accessible to large ships. With the development of large oil tankers in the 1960s, the project was modified and the canal was dug to a greater depth to allow these vessels though. For this reason the canal was nicknamed canale dei petroli (oil canal). The works started in 1964 and finished in 1968. An oil refinery was also built.Relazione sul Piano Regolatore Portuale Porto di Venezia - Le origini e la storia The sediments which were dredged to create the Malamocco-Marghera canal were used to create artificial islands, the casse di colmata A, (155 hectares), B, (385 ha) and D-E (752 ha), for the creation of a third industrial area at the port of Marghera. The original plan envisaged further artificial islands that would fill in the whole of the saltmarsh area between Marghera and Chioggia, in the southern part of the lagoon. However, studies carried out by scientists after the disastrous 1966 flood in Venice and the lagoon showed that the islands reduced the area in which the tidal flow could expand and that this had an impact both on lagoon's water level and the efficiency of water turnover in the lagoon. The former has also had the consequence of worsening the aqua alta phenomenon (high water, the floods which can occur in Venice and the lagoon with above average high tides). As a result, the expansion works were suspended in 1969 and the plan was scrapped in 1973. Casse di colmata To try to alleviate these problems a number of channels which had been filled in to create the islands were reopened to reconnect the waters behind these islands to the rest of the lagoon. These are the Volpego and Fiumesino, which cut through the cassa B, the Taglio Vecchio and Mattoni, which cut through the cassa B and the Avesa, which cuts through the cassa A. The area of the lagoon which can absorb the tidal flow has decreased by about 30% since 1791.Environmental problems in the Venice Lagoon, Bolet√≠n Sehumed, 1997, No. 1 The \\"stiffening\\" of the gronda lagunare, which has been worsened by the creation of the artificial islands for the industrial area, and its connection with an exacerbation of the aqua alta phenomenon has also drawn attention to another factor which contributes to this \\"stiffening\\" of the gronda lagunare: the valli da pesca with fixed banks. =Valli da Pesca= The term valli da pesca (sing. valle), or just valli/valle, translates into \\"fishing valleys.\\" It refers to fish farms. Although in Italian valle means valley, the term originates from the Latin word vallum, which means rampant. This term came into use centuries ago because the valli are separated from the rest of the lagoon by banks. They are located along the gronda lagunare in the southern and northern parts of the lagoon. There are 33 valli which cover c. 92 km2 of the waters of the lagoon (1/6, 17% of the total surface).Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere e Arti - Banca di Dati Ambientali della Laguna di Venezia There are two types, valli with mobile banks and valli with fixed banks. The former was the type which was used for centuries. It started being replaced by the latter from the 19th century. Mobile banks were made of poles, reed mats and rods. In this kind of valle the inner water level was dependent on that of the water outside it. The banks were moved to open the valli to the outside waters when there was a need to raise the inner water level. Fixed banks are earthworks and the valle's water levels are regulated through rolling shutter gates. Since these valli are separated from the lagoon permanently, they keep the tide at bay. This constrains the expansion of the tidal flow and can have negative hydrologic consequences. The authorities of the Republic of Venice understood the importance of the valli for the hydrology of the lagoon. They forbade the construction of fixed banks because they did not want any impediments to the free expansion of the tidal flow. In 1314 they issued laws regarding the fishing valli. In 1624 the valli were declared property of those who fished and their public use was barred to preserve their functionality. In 1719 the government placed boundary stones to define the boundary of the lagoon (this was known as conterminazione lagunare). This was done to define the areas subject to the Republic's laws and the ordinances issued by the water authority. After the fall of the Republic, when it was conquered by Napoleon in 1797, these laws became dead letter. In the 19th century, valli owners started to enclose their fish farms with fixed banks as an engineer indicated that it made fish farming more efficient. In the mid-20th century, the Italian government incentivised the development of fixed banks. With the mentioned warning by scientists about the connection between the \\"stiffening\\" of the gronda lagunare and floods in the 1970s, there was a policy shift towards the opening of the valli da pesca to the expansion of the tidal flows. Opening of the valli da pesca and promotion of wetlands A 1984 law prescribed studies and projects for works aimed at the hydrologic re-balancing of the lagoon, stopping its it degradation and eliminating its causes. It made particular reference to restoring the previous depths of canals which had been dug deeper and the opening of the valli da pesca to the expansion of the tides. The latter could lead to a reduction of the aqua alta problem, particularly in the peripheral islands in the norther part of the lagoon, such as Burano and Torcello. A 2000 study by the Environment Ministry estimated that the opening of the valli could on average reduce the tidal peaks by 20.2 cm and, in the case of the island of Burano, reduce tides between 9.10 cm and nearly 10 cm.Boato S., Riequilibrare e Riqualificare la Laguna di Venezia per un Futuro Sostenibile Another problem which developed in the 20th century is the increasing silting of the lagoon's peripheral channels and canals in the areas along the gronda lagunare. The main cause of this is a diminished circulation of currents due to the \\"stiffening\\" of the gronda lagunare, including the fixed bank valli da pesca which limit the flow of the tides. This is particularly accentuated in the southern part of the lagoon because of the construction of a road on an embankment which crosses it and almost completely, blocking the tidal flow in the area to its south. Some openings along this embankment were created in 1981‚Äì82. However, the silting of the bottom and the local channels continues. The opening of the valli da pesca can contribute to an extension of the tracts of the lagunar channels in the gronda lagunare and this can help to bring in the tidal flow to the areas at the edge of the lagoon, increasing the area which can absorb this tidal flow. It can also bring a greater water turnover in these peripheral areas of the lagoon. A pilot project, the opening up of the Valle Figheri, in the southern part of the lagoon, which was chosen as a test case, was completed in 1999. The aim was to stop the degradation processes of the lagoon and to improve the quality of the water in the peripheral area of the lagoon where water circulation and turnover occurs with difficulty. An earthen embankment has been built to divide the valle into two parts, one of which was reopened. It has a barrier with 20 gates to regulate the flow of the tide between the open part of the valle and the lagoon. Two structures between the open part and the closed part have also been built.Mosevenezia Valle Figheri After this pilot project not much progress with the opening of the valli da pesca was made. There has been a legal challenge by a firm which owns one the valli. The case was first heard in 2004 by a court in Venice. It went before the European Court of Human Rights in 2014 and the authorities lost the case. There was an out of court settlement in 2017. Sentenza della CEDU The opening of the valli da pesca can also be of great value for the regeneration of the gronda lagunare areas by restoring it as a transition belt with the formation of wetlands and reed beds. In the past 50‚Äì60 years there has been an increased appreciation of the value and benefits of wetlands and reed beds. These can improve the geomorphology of the gronda lagunare and also its ecology as they provide an ideal habitat for diverse fauna and flora. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands underlines the ecologic and economic value of wetlands. It notes that wetlands ecosystems can have some of the highest ecosystem service values compared to other ecosystems due to their importance in clean water provision, natural hazards mitigation and carbon storage. A large proportion of the values come from their water-related services. Of particular value to the Lagoon of Venice are: * Coastal protection by attenuating and/or dissipating waves and by buffering winds, thus regulating floods and the impact of storms * Erosion control by providing sediment stabilisation and soil retention, thus contributing to land formation and increasing resilience to storms * Flood protection by regulating and controlling water flows * Phytodepuration (the natural treatment of surface water by natural purification processes through bacteria on the roots of plants)Lenntech, phytodepurationPhytodepuration and lagooning by providing nutrient and pollution uptake and retention and particle deposition. The nutrients in question are nitrogen or phosphate from fertilisers which can cause eutrophication. * Carbon sequestration by generating biological productivity and diversity * Tourism, recreation, education and research by providing a unique and aesthetic landscape and a suitable habitat for diverse fauna and flora * Cultural, spiritual and religious benefits, bequest values through the cultural, historic or spiritual meaning of this unique environment Ramsar Convention documents Thirty-nine hectares of phytodepuration wetlands have been created along the gronda lagunare to restore its water purification capacity and the environmental characteristics of the gronda lagunare, which used to have woods, ponds, marches and freshwater wetlands. They have been created by the river mouths along the lagoon to reconstruct wetland areas which act as a transition between the mainland and the lagoon where aquatic and non-aquatic plants and various communities of organisms absorb in a natural way the large quantities of nitrogen and phosphate which would otherwise be introduced into the lagoon. The elimination of pollutants occurs in the sedimentary basins, especially in the surface area. These transitional wetlands are needed to ensure that the lagunar system has the capacity to deal with rising water events and peaks in pollution loads, maintaining its purification efficacy.Mosevenezia Difesa Ambientale References External links *http://geomap.arpa.veneto.it/maps/56/view Stato ecologico della laguna di Venezia *http://cigno.atlantedellalaguna.it/maps/22/view Valli da pesca Category:Venetian Lagoon Category:Geography of Venice Category:Lagoons of Italy Category:Ramsar sites in Italy Category:Wetlands Category:Aquatic ecology Category:Environmental terminology Category:Freshwater ecology Category:Fluvial landforms Category:Geomorphology ","title":"Gronda lagunare"},{"id":"62590231","text":"Nam Ki-won (, born 26 May 1966) is a South Korean para table tennis player.

The game will be released on PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Windows on November 12, 2020; it was the first game confirmed for release on the PlayStation 5. Gameplay The game is set in a high fantasy setting, split into the realms of Earth, Water, Air, Fire and Spirit, where players take the role of one of the last exalted Knight's Order to prevent a major apocalyptic event. The player has 5 weapon classes to select from, based on which of their armor sets, Valorplates, they equip. These weapon classes include the longsword, dual blades, polearm, two handed war hammer and the two handed great sword.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu8jivl_po4 Additional Valorplates and Augments can be equipped to customize how this character class plays out. It supports single player and up to three players in \\"drop-in drop-out\\" cooperative mode. The game is described as a \\"looter-slasher\\" as while based on the loot shooter concept of completing missions and gaining better loot for further quests, the focus of the combat is on melee attacks rather than ranged ones. Development Counterplay Games is a 75-person studio in California with several developers that had worked on other loot shooters such as Destiny 2; their prior game was Duelyst. Counterplay engaged with Kowloon Nights to gain funding to help develop Godfall by September 2018 as a triple-A title, and avoid some of the struggles they had with funding Duelyst through a Kickstarter campaign. The game's world was inspired by The Stormlight Archive, The First Law and the Foundation series, while the gameplay from the Monster Hunter series inspired the variety of weapons and combo mechanics. The game's first trailer was revealed in December 2019 at The Game Awards, where it was identified to be the first game confirmed for release on the PlayStation 5, due to be released on November 12, 2020.

Her name was Grace Alexandra Smith but she created the surname of Ashley-Smith. She attended Albyn School before spending a year at Aberdeen University. She then went to a Belgian convent for two years to learn French. She was a sportsperson and she won an Empire Medal for her shooting in 1911. She joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) because of the word \\"Yeomanry\\" in the title as she wanted to ride horses. The FANY was formed to both rescue the wounded and to administer first aid from horseback. Their founder felt that a single rider could get to a wounded soldier faster than a horse-drawn ambulance. Each woman was trained not only in first aid but signalling and drilling in cavalry movements. At the start of 1912 2nd Lieutenant Lilian Franklin and McDougall (Sergeant-Major Ashley-Smith) won a power struggle with the FANY founder Edward Baker and his daughter, Katie. In 1912 the FANY uniform became a khaki tunic, khaki riding skirt and later a khaki soft cap. Franklin and Ashley-Smith were in charge; before the First World War started in 1914, Ashley-Smith was sure that the FANY had a useful role and she intended to find it.

In December 2019, two more individuals were charged with obstruction of sex trafficking enforcement. The website was removed in January 2020. According to the United States Department of Justice, the website and its sister website GirlsDoToys generated over $17 million in revenue. Videos were featured on GirlsDoPorn.com as well as pornography aggregate websites such as Pornhub, where the channel reached the top 20 most viewed, with approximately 680 million views. Pornography produced by the company‚Äîwhich was based in San Diego, California‚Äîwas in the style of a \\"casting couch\\", featuring women who were not professional pornographic actors. A lawsuit filed in 2016 involving 22 plaintiffs alleged \\"intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, unlawful and fraudulent business practices, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress\\" on the parts of Michael Pratt (co-owner), Matthew Wolfe (co-owner and cameraman), and Andre Garcia (pornographic actor). In January 2020, the plaintiffs received damages of $12.775 million, as well as ownership to videos they featured in. Lawsuits and other testimony describe alleged practices by GirlsDoPorn in detail. According to a lawsuit, women who responded to fake modeling advertisements on Craigslist were put into contact with \\"reference girls\\" who pretended to have had positive experiences shooting videos for the company. Some participants were told that they would be paid between $2,000 and $6,000 to have sex for 30 minutes on camera. All plaintiffs said that they were given verbal promises that the videos would never be released on the internet or in the United States, instead being told the videos would be put on DVDs and sold only to private buyers or independent video stores in Australia, New Zealand, or South America. When they reached San Diego, they were made to sign contracts which did not mention the name \\"GirlsDoPorn\\". The Department of Justice said that \\"some were sexually assaulted and in at least one case raped\\". Filming was described as lasting up to seven hours and, according to an ex-employee, 50% of women were not paid the amount they were promised. History GirlsDoPorn was a pornography website owned by Michael Pratt (born 1982, New Zealand), who also worked as the editor. Matthew Wolfe (born 1982 or 1983, New Zealand) served as co-owner and cameraman. He is also a childhood friend of Pratt's. Doug Wiederhold and Ruben \\"Andre\\" Garcia (born 1986 or 1987) were male pornographic actors for the company. Teddy Gyi was a cameraman for some of the videos, and lawyer Adam Sadock began working for the company in 2012. Pratt began planning GirlsDoPorn in 2006, founding it in 2009. Pratt began working in the pornographic industry around the year 2000, after graduating high school. He initially launched the websites Wicked Movies, Kute Kittens and TeenieFlixxx, the last an affiliate of the existing website ExploitedTeens, all of which produced pornography in the same style that GirlsDoPorn later would. In 2007, he moved to the United States to film pornography. Between 2007 and 2009, Wiederhold worked with Pratt, the two filming videos of Wiederhold having sex in hotel rooms with women who were not in the porn industry. These videos formed the basis of the videos first released by GirlsDoPorn. In 2010, Wiederhold and Pratt created the MILF pornography website MomPOV, which has a Vanuatu address but operates from Las Vegas. In 2011, Wolfe moved from New Zealand to the United States. Wolfe was involved with Pratt's work from 2008 onwards. Over 100 videos were filmed by Wolfe for GirlsDoPorn between 2011 and 2020. GirlsDoPorn was active during a period of growing consumption of \\"casting couch\\" internet pornography. Such pornography is often filmed in hotel rooms with minimal crew, and may feature women who have not previously filmed pornography and are given money on-camera. In the case of GirlsDoPorn, the women would be asked about their sex lives on camera, and sometimes videos including women reading parts of their contracts aloud. Vice reported that this style of content originates from Backroom Casting Couch, a 2000s series by a pornographer who allegedly deceived the women featured in his videos. Over a dozen U.S. and foreign companies were associated with GirlsDoPorn throughout its lifespan. In 2011, GT Group Limited‚Äîa company referenced in the Panama Papers‚Äîwas listed as its parent corporation. The Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2011 that GT Group Limited was founded by a man associated with arms-smuggling, drug gangs, and tax fraud. By 2017, its parent corporation were Oh Well Media Limited, a company based in Port Vila, Vanuatu, which is an offshore tax haven according to the San Diego Reader. The company BLL Media Inc. was referred to in contracts signed with some women who worked for the company. GirlsDoPorn.com had a subscription model costing $30 per month. It had a spin-off site, GirlsDoToys, launched by Pratt and Wolfe in 2014. In January 2017, GirlsDoPorn.com was the 33,949th-most-visited website in the United States, receiving roughly 1.2 million visitors between November and December 2016, including approximately 84,000 who were visiting the website for the first time. According to the United States Department of Justice, the websites GirlsDoPorn and GirlsDoToys generated over $17 million in revenue. Pratt was the sole recipient of profits from the websites. Upon filing bankruptcy in 2018, Pratt estimated his income to be greater than $60,000 per month, and reported over $134,000 in back taxes. The company received tabloid attention in 2013 and 2014 when it was reported that two beauty pageant models for Miss Teen USA were the subjects of videos on the website; as a consequence of this being made public, the models ceased connection with the beauty pageants. Some women who filmed videos with GirlsDoPorn later became professional pornographic actors, including Emily Willis, who filmed two videos with the website in 2018 after dating Garcia for a month, according to her own account. In October 2019, in a court testimony, Wolfe said that GirlsDoPorn continued to recruit new women, whose contracts did not mention the name of the company. GirlsDoPorn.com appeared to go offline in January 2020, according to Ars Technica. Content on other websites In addition to being released on GirlsDoPorn.com, videos produced by the company were also released on websites which aggregated pornographic videos such as Pornhub, XVideos, and YouPorn. They were viewed over 800 million times on these websites, including roughly 680 million views on Pornhub, where GirlsDoPorn was amongst the top 20 most viewed channels. Overall, court documents found that videos produced by the website were watched over 1 billion times, and pirated versions were viewed hundreds of millions of times. GirlsDoPorn's channel was removed from Pornhub in October 2019, which journalists at Daily Dot and Motherboard said was a slow response to the incident. Additionally, the videos could still be found afterwards unofficially on Pornhub's website. Motherboard found that the digital fingerprinting which Pornhub uses to remove duplicates of removed videos, Vobile, prevented them from uploading some identical or nearly-identical clips of GirlsDoPorn videos, but also did not remove many slight variants on the footage. Discussion website Reddit had a forum, \\"r/girlsdoporn\\", which began in 2013 and was dedicated to posting links and videos from GirlsDoPorn. In October 2019, amidst a lawsuit against GirlsDoPorn, moderators removed most content on the subreddit and announced it to be in hiatus. Reddit removed the subreddit shortly afterwards. The forum had approximately 99,000 accounts subscribed to it at the time of its closure. In 2014, GirlsDoPorn.com launched an internet forum. The company was also active on Instagram, where posts would brag about how young the actors involved were. Reported practices Details of alleged practices by the company have been documented in lawsuits, mainstream media and court testimonies by employees of the company. One attorney pursuing legal actions reported that he and his co-counsel communicated with 150 women who said that they were misled during their experience filming videos for GirlsDoPorn. A lawsuit filed in 2016 contained information from 22 plaintiffs. Six further women who were not part of the lawsuit told NBC 7 San Diego journalists in 2019 that they had similar experiences. =Casting process= According to the 2016 lawsuit, GirlsDoPorn was associated with fake modeling websites such as BeginModeling, ModelingGigs, ModelingWork, and Bubblegum Casting. Advertisements for these websites were posted on Craigslist under college towns and localities spanning America and Canada. Explore Talent was also used by them to find models. They requested applicants aged between 18 and 22, and provided forms asking for physical and personal information about applicants. Pratt, Wolfe and Garcia often used aliases when dealing with the girls they recruited and never revealed their real names. Pratt would use names such as \\"Mike\\" and \\"Mark\\". Garcia mostly went by \\"Jonathan\\", and Wolfe used \\"Ben\\", \\"Joshua\\" and \\"Isaac\\" when doing the recruiting and subsequent filming. They would contact women who had applied and tell them that the job was not modeling, but having sex on camera. They claimed that the footage would be used only for DVDs sold to private buyers and independent video stores in Australia, New Zealand, or South America and would never be released online or in the United States in any form. There were instances where women were lured to San Diego under the false pretences of a clothed modeling or nude modeling shoot, if they declined initial offers to film pornography. Some women were offered between $2,000 and $6,000 for 30 minutes of filming, consisting of five sexual positions lasting between five and seven minutes apiece. Women involved report frequent and persistent contact from the company before they agreed. Filming would take place in San Diego, California, and their travel expenses and accommodation would be paid for. Several women report that Garcia booked flights for them before they had fully committed. Women who agreed were put into contact with a \\"reference girl\\". According to one such person, reference girls were hired to lie to the women and conceal information in order to convince them to agree to the job. They were paid between $25 and $200 per contact they persuaded. They would communicate via text or video call. Some women took months of convincing to agree. According to several of these women, reference girls would make false claims about distribution of the videos, saying that their ostensible videos had not been seen within the United States. One woman involved reported Garcia threatening to sue her after she attempted to withdraw from the process shortly before she was due to fly to San Diego. =Filming process= Once in San Diego, women were met by employees who had signed non-disclosure agreements forbidding them from mentioning the name GirlsDoPorn. They were allegedly instructed to call the company Plus One Media, or deny that the videos produced would be published online. The women stayed in four-star hotels, where filming took place. Additionally, women have alleged being lied to in various ways by Garcia to convince them to enter his apartment: in some cases, he said that the women should stay at his apartment before he drove them to the airport the next morning; in others, he feigned needing to stop at his apartment and suggested that the women should come inside briefly. Women in the 2016 lawsuit were hurried to sign contracts written in hard-to- understand legal terminology, sometimes being told the contracts were needed for tax purposes. The contract did not mention \\"GirlsDoPorn\\". The contracts involving the 22 plaintiffs also did not mention \\"GirlsDoPorn\\" anywhere in the entire document, as per court records. There were reports that company employees got the women drunk before signing, or smoked marijuana with them, or offered them cocaine. An FBI complaint said that the company prevented the women from keeping copies of their contracts. In the lawsuit's 187-page proposed statement of decision, the release form is described as purposefully long and vague, written with an intent to obscure the true nature and character of the video's distribution. Filming lasted up to seven hours, in contrast to the thirty-minute shoot that the women were told to expect. It begins with an interview in which the subject is asked personal and sexual questions, after being coached on how to answer. There were reports of Garcia being verbally abusive. During sex, some women reportedly experienced vaginal bleeding, while another said that she vomited in her mouth and began choking due to the violence of the sex. Accounts of the women document that if they expressed pain or refused to continue, they were told that it was too late to withdraw, and in some cases the exit was physically blocked by the men. Some women were also threatened with cancellation of the return flight or being asked to pay back the flight and hotel costs if they tried to renege on filming or refused to shoot an additional scene. Filming for GirlsDoToys took place during the same trips. The United States Department of Justice reported that \\"some [of the women] were sexually assaulted and in at least one case raped\\". It has been reported that Garcia had sex with some of the women before or after shooting, or in the midst of shooting, after asking the cameraman to leave. Former employee Val Moser testified that only 50% of women received the amount of money they were promised. The court case found that women were frequently told that their pay would be reduced immediately after stripping naked, despite never being told that their pay was contingent. Another frequently used tactic was to cut pay after the scene was shot by citing body flaws even though the models had sent nude photos clearly showing whatever blemishes and tattoos they had. One woman was allegedly paid $400 after having being promised $2,000, and also locked out of the hotel room where she was expecting to stay. =Outcomes= Videos were published online around a month after recording. Some women filmed on multiple occasions, and their first video was not released online until they had completed all of their shoots. One woman reported that naked photos she had sent in communication over the Craigslist advert were also published. Some women reported receiving sexually transmitted infections from sexual contact with Garcia. Personal information of the women was posted online including contact details, social media profiles, home addresses, and parents' names and home addresses. Many women contacted GirlsDoPorn employees to complain. Court documents indicate that responses to complaints varied from claims that the employee would attempt to remove the video to referral to Panakos Law, which would send cease-and-desist requests to the complainant. There was testimony that Panakos Law also sent cease-and-desist requests to women who contacted websites asking for the video of them to be removed. The names of hundreds of women who filmed videos for GirlsDoPorn were published on Porn Wikileaks, a website specifically set up to dox porn actors. The 2016 lawsuit alleged that the website's domain was transferred to an email address known to be owned by Pratt in November 2015, and an FBI affidavit describes the site as \\"a website connected to Pratt\\". Judge Kevin Enright found it \\"more likely than not\\" that Pratt, Wolfe, and Garcia were instigators of the online harassment of one of the women who filmed with them. Pratt reportedly held control of the website until June 2016; it was purchased in August 2019 by pornographic film studio Bang Bros and closed down. Women involved in filming reported that their family, friends, and colleagues were sent text messages with links to videos or GIFs of them having sex when the videos they made were published online. The incidents led to women involved losing jobs or accommodation and leaving college or being disowned by family. Others reported experiencing panic attacks, depression, self-harming and, in at least four cases, suicide ideation. Legal action =Lawsuit filing= In June 2016, four women filed a lawsuit in the San Diego Superior Court against Wolfe, Pratt, Garcia, and GirlsDoPorn. Six months later, the lawsuit had 14 plaintiffs; within a year, the number was 22. Plaintiffs were aged between 17 and 22 during recruiting of their videos for GirlsDoPorn and most of them were college students at the time of filming the video. 10 of the 22 plaintiffs reported that they wanted to leave at some point before or during the shoot but were made to complete it. The plaintiffs testified on how the release of the videos adversely affected their college life, career plans and plans for having a family. The plaintiffs requested more than $22 million in damages. The defendants stood accused of \\"intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, unlawful and fraudulent business practices, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress\\". Brian Holm was a lead attorney, with John O'Brien as co-counsel. Eventually the legal team of the 22 plaintiffs grew to include multiple law firms including Sanford Heisler Sharp LLP. Attorney Daniel Kaplan also represented GirlsDoPorn in the lawsuit. =Trial and charges= An initial trial date was set for March 8, 2018, but the trial was set back by several different delays. In January 2019, the judge set a tentative ruling that Wolfe, Pratt, and Garcia had engaged in \\"malice, fraud or oppression\\". The same day, Pratt filed for bankruptcy, and the case was put on hold. The bankruptcy judge deemed that Pratt had acted in bad faith, so the case resumed in early 2019. After further delay, trial began on August 20, 2019, lasting until November 2019. Kevin Enright served as the judge. In September 2019, attorneys were told that Pratt had left the country, according to NBC 7 San Diego. The following month, Garcia and Wolfe were arrested on charges of sex trafficking after a search warrant was executed by the FBI. As of January 2020, Pratt is a fugitive wanted on a federal warrant. Wolfe was denied bail in October 2019, and again in May 2020. In November 2019 a federal indictment was unsealed naming three more individuals‚ÄîTheodore Gyi, Valorie Moser and Amberlyn Dee Nored‚Äìas defendants. Gyi had acted as videographer. Moser was the administrative assistant who had worked for Pratt for almost three years. She had also testified on the plaintiffs' behalf in the trial. Amberlyn had acted as a fake reference girl on Pratt's behalf. She had never shot a pornographic video for GirlsDoPorn or any other production. Pratt alone has been charged with producing child pornography of a 16-year-old girl in 2012 and of sex trafficking of a minor. Additional charges for Pratt and the other five include conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion and sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion. The crimes are alleged to have happened in October 2013, January 2015, May 2015, January 2016 and February 2016. There are multiple reported cases of attempted disruption or obstruction during the trial. Attorney Holm was harassed throughout the legal process, with fake gay porn images of him spread, and one woman testifying that she was paid to make repeated harassing phone calls to him by a GirlsDoPorn employee. He reported that harassing posts on social media and pornography blogs were made about himself, his wife and young daughter, and that a private investigator was hired to follow him. In a separate case, brothers Fredrick Jimenez and Efrain Jimenez were charged in December 2019 for obstruction of sex trafficking enforcement. The complaint states that they tried to remove and destroy evidence related to the federal sex trafficking in October 2019. Fredrick Jimenez was an ex-employee of GirlsDoPorn. Prosecutors also collated evidence of witness harassment: a U.S. attorney found evidence that defendants called the plaintiffs to falsely pose as journalists. A witness alleged that a co-defendant offered her $1,000 in exchange for not testifying in the trial. FBI agents found a planned video script, \\"22 Whores + 5 Shady Lawyers VS GirlsDoPorn\\", which encouraged viewers to spread the real names of the defendants. =Lawsuit outcomes= On January 2, 2020, the women in the trial were awarded $12.775 million in damages‚Äî$9.475 million for compensatory damages and $3.3 million in punitive damages. On January 9, Faith Devine was appointed receiver over the business and individual assets of the defendants.\\"Order After Hearing (Order Appointing Receiver after hearing) filed by DOE 1, Jane.\\" (January 9, 2020). San Diego Superior Court. ROA 3041, Case Number 37-2016-00019027-CU-FR-CTL. Retrieved May 10, 2020. Furthermore, the women were given ownership rights to the videos they featured in. The ruling ordered defendants to remove all images and videos from websites under their control, and to take action to remove them from other websites. In the injunction, the court ordered GirlsDoPorn to clearly state in bold and centered at the top of the first page of their model agreement that the video was going to be published on GirlsDoPorn.com. The verbal release must also show the model clearly stating the name of the website. Additionally, they were ordered in the future to state in recruitment postings that videos will be posted online, give participants copies of the contracts before arriving, and ensure that participants sign documents indicating that they understand their names or personal information may be used. Later in January 2020, another woman sued the men involved with GirlsDoPorn with a similar case to the 22 previous plaintiffs.

Research  Wright's research has looked at the effects of intoxication in honeybees with ethanol, finding that with increased ethanol consumption the bees spent less time on normal behaviours such as flying, walking and grooming, and instead spent more time upside down. She has also done research to look for emotions in bees, testing their responses to smells that were unfamiliar to them. Bees that had been subjected to an uncomfortable experience prior to the test were less likely to test the smells, and were perceived as pessimists compared to those that had not had the experience. Levels of neurotransmitters such as Octopamine, dopamine and serotonin were also lower in bees that had the uncomfortable experience. Her work has also looked at the effects of insecticides on bees, finding that a combination of insecticides can have a greater detrimental effect on bee learning and memory than a single compound. Wright also found that the nicotine present in neonicotinoid insecticides may 'give bees a buzz', as honeybees and bumblebees preferred food containing neonicotinoids over that without. In contrast she found that caffeine can improve the memory of bees of a particular scent that might bear nectar and subsequent research by Wright showed that bees have two neurons in each tastebud which help regulate bees' response to particular tastes.

The possession of an \\"access to the sea\\" by Siena was therefore a natural continuation of its expansionary and commercial policy in the Maremma with the conquest of the ports of Talamone, Porto Ercole and Porto Santo Stefano. In order to ensure access to maritime traffic and a competitive sales network, Siena already tried to secure the use of the Grosseto river port in the 13th century. However, the port, swept away during the 14th century by the violent flood that removed the course of the Ombrone from the city, never had any development, also due to the incorrect economic policy of Siena and the lack of a productive background.  History  = Purchase and growth of Talamone = In May 1303, the abbot of the monastery of San Salvatore, Friar Ranieri, arrived in Siena proposing to the government of the Nine the purchase of the lands belonging to the monastery (even if they were then occupied militarily by the Counts of Santa Fiora), including Talamone and Castiglion di Val d'Orcia. After a difficult negotiation, the purchase contract was signed on 10 September 1303. At the price of 900 gold florins the port of Talamone, the Contrada di Valentina and Castiglion di Val d'Orcia were sold to the Republic of Siena which also placed the monastery under its protection. Coastal possessions of the Republic of Siena from the purchase of Talamone to 1559 The possession of an outlet to the sea was extensively celebrated in Siena, hoping to increase its trade in this way, despite being affected by the negative consequences that the failure of the Gran Tavola bank of the Bonsignori had caused in relations with France and northern Italy. In May 1304 a bailiff was established for three Sienese citizens who took care of the needs of the port of Talamone and communicated them to Siena. Tower of Collelungo built by the Republic of Siena to improve the defensive system of the coast next to Grosseto At this point, it was necessary to decide the strategy to be followed regarding the port. The General Council of the Bell was divided on two opposing ideas represented respectively by Mignanello dei Mignanelli and Cione di Alemanno dei Piccolomini. The first claimed that the government of the Nine should have full authority in the work, while the second claimed that it was necessary to agree with the Genoese for the proper development of the port given the inexperience of the Sienese in maritime affairs. It was decided to avoid external interference by directly managing the seaport. From 1305, restoration work was carried out for the harbor walls, roads were improved, a bridge was built and the quarterdeck was rebuilt while, to avoid possible hostilities with the Counts of Santa Fiora, the boundaries were precisely established. The following year a ban was placed for the salt evaporation pond that should have provided half of the product to the Commune because it was his property. On the recommendation of three Sienese citizens sent to the site, in 1309 improvements were made both to the castle and to the port to make it easier for sailors to land thanks to wooden piers, as well as to start work on a lighthouse. Following the adhesion to the Tuscan Guelph League, made possible thanks to the political change imposed by the Nine that removed the city from the empire, Siena then found itself to be allied with Florence. Given the growing enmities existing towards the Ghibelline Pisa, the Florentine government stipulated an agreement on 17 August 1311 with the Sienese Republic for the passage of all their goods by sea from Talamone. = Difficulty in managing and granting the Talamone port = With the descent of the Emperor Henry in Tuscany there were various reprisals against the Florentine merchants in Genoa and, probably for the same reason of damaging the Florentine trade, some Sienese Ghibelline exiles attacked Talamone in 1312; in that moment without defenses. It took the Republic of Siena two years to regain control of the port. The Walls of Talamone were restored and improved as early as 1305 at the behest of the Republic of Siena However, already in 1320 there was a new aggression, this time on the part of Genoese exiles, who sacked Talamone with a large quantity of wheat bound for Siena, burdened at that time with a famine. In the following years the Municipality of Siena committed itself to taking the necessary measures to avoid new foreign incursions, together with the granting of privileges to the inhabitants of the port in order to encourage the growth of the Talamone population. Despite the efforts, the population and the safety of the airport turned out to be a failure also considering the pressing presence of malaria. The port was forced to suffer a new hostile occupation in 1328 by the army of the king of Sicily who tried to take Grosseto as well. Given the impossibility of managing the port in a fruitful way, the government of the Nine opted for the concession of Talamone for rent to the Duke of Calabria through his ducal vicar. In 1339 the port was granted for eight years to the Genoese Manfredi del Fiesco, count of Lavagna. However, due to some breaches of the agreements, the contract was canceled and the maritime port returned to the direct control of Siena. Following new clashes against the Pisans due to the influence on Lucca, Florence renewed the agreements with the Republic of Siena for the rights of Florentine merchants in the port of Talamone in 1340; situation that was repeated in 1356. Medieval fortress of Talamone Upon learning of the treaty with Florence, Pisa threatened to occupy the port and tried several times to attack it, failing thanks to Florence's commitment to protect its maritime trade. However, once the peace agreement was signed with Pisa in 1364, the Florentine merchants preferred to leave the more distant Sienese port in favor of the Pisan one, despite the pressure exerted by Siena to maintain Florence's commercial traffic. In a period of strong political instability in Siena, more privileges were therefore decided for anyone who wanted to live in Talamone and cultivated the land and the passing merchants, so as to remedy the damage caused by the loss of Florentine maritime traffic. The entire area of the Sienese Maremma was however seriously neglected and due to the strong emigration the population of Talamone, Magliano and Grosseto was by now decimated. In this situation in 1375 the Sienese coast suffered several looting by Pisan troops, which later occupied Talamone together with the papal militias. Due to contrasts between Siena and the papacy due to the support given to Perugia in the riots against the Papal State, the papal occupation lasted until 1378, the year in which the Republic of Siena regained control of the port by paying a large sum of money to Urban VI. The following year, due to conflicts with Pisa and Genoa for control of Sardinia, the Catalans concluded a treaty with the Republic of Siena for the use of the port of Talamone, guaranteeing their merchants the same rights that were granted to the Florentines, but with lower duties. Once the Sienese port was left by the Catalans, failing to cover the defense and guards with maritime trade, in 1385 it was decided to grant the port to a company that also took care of maintaining the defensive structures. In 1399 various measures were approved for the rehabilitation of the Maremma and the reclamation of the lands of Grosseto, so as to finally take full advantage of the great fertility of the agricultural areas. With the conquest of Livorno in 1404 and that of Pisa in 1406 by Florence, the modernization of Talamone became more pressing for Siena to avoid the decadence of the port. In those years King Ladislaus of Naples tried to bring the Republic of Siena to his part in anti-Florentine function, but given the rejection of the Sienese the king of Naples attacked Talamone together with the Genoese in 1410. With great effort and with the help of Florence and France, Siena succeeded in regaining the port and the castle in December of the same year. = Conquest of Porto Ercole and Porto Santo Stefano = Tower of Lividonia of Porto Santo Stefano designed by the Republic of Siena in 1548 Porto Ercole and the territory of Monte Argentario, including the lesser Porto Santo Stefano, were conquered by the Republic of Siena at the time of the coming in Tuscany of the King of Naples Ladislaus in 1409. The damages caused by the Genoese occupation were huge and the General Council of the Bell approved in 1411 that the necessary repair work was done, and the same happened in 1416 with Orbetello recently conquered. Porto Ercole with the fortress wanted by the Aldobrandeschi and then cured and enlarged under the Republic of Siena The return of the Catalans to the Sienese port in 1436 was a positive event and, with the treaty signed by the parties, the Republic of Siena undertook to maintain the roads to Grosseto in good condition as well as the bridge of the port. The trade could flourish again and the following year the visit of Prince Alfonso of Aragon was also recorded. Given the huge expenses that brought the Ercole Port to the Municipality of Siena, in 1441 it was given in concession to Agnolo Morosini with the latter's commitment to build fortifications and defensive structures both in the airport and in the area of Monte Argentario. In 1460 the territory was granted to a commercial company of Sienese citizens. They committed to Siena to make the area of Porto Ercole habitable (by granting the inhabitants the same privileges as the citizens of Talamone), building a new tower and even a warehouse. Given the poor condition of Porto Ercole, the concession to the commercial company was withdrawn by the Bell Council in 1474. The Republic sent guard and two lords to deal with the needs of the airport more carefully and to solve the problem of lack of housing for citizens. On 30 January 1474 there was the only document of a Sienese ship, built in one of the ports of the Sienese Maremma by the merchant Francesco Benedetti da Perpignano who obtained a license from the Municipality to hoist the flag of the Republic of Siena. = Decline of the Republic of Siena = Coastal tower of the Maddalena, built at the behest of the Republic of Siena during the fifteenth century to strengthen the defensive system of the western slope of Monte Argentario In 1476 a serious plague struck the ports of Talamone and Porto Ercole, decimating the population of the entire Grosseto area, subsequently impoverished by the pause of the Neapolitan royal army in those lands that were just repopulating. From 1480 the Republic decided to intervene on the ports trying to stimulate the return of the emigrated citizens during the plague. In this period Porto Ercole experienced a good commercial flow thanks to the trade of wool cloths to the east by Sienese merchants. To solve security problems, in 1489 Siena sent its Muslim consul to Constantinople so that the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire drove the many pirates who damaged the cities and ports from the Maremma. In the first few years of the 16th century the Republic of Siena sold, for the price of 4,500 florins, all the revenues of the ports of Talamone and Porto Ercole for ten years to Alessandro di Galgano Bichi, while the use of the lands of Monte Argentario was bought by the Spedale of S. Maria della Scala of Siena. In 1507, during his lordship, Pandolfo Petrucci bought the domain of Monte Argentario for 34,000 gold florins. Taking advantage of a period of strong political instability in the Republic of Siena, the Genoese commander Andrea Doria occupied Talamone in 1527, and afterwards also Orbetello and Porto Ercole fell. The occupation of Orbetello and Talamone did not last long because the Sienese army supported by the population managed to recover the two cities. Since the Sienese could not take Porto Ercole by force, the Commune of Siena insisted with great insistence on Pope Clement VII that he would return the lands occupied by force. Not obtaining positive responses and given the prolongation of the negotiations, the Republic decided to attack the port of call in 1530, managing to take back the port thanks to the commander Cincio Corso. Fearing an imminent war against the Emperor or against the Pope, the Commune had the towns and the castles of the Maremma visited by the architect Baldassarre Peruzzi and Antonmaria Lari who were in charge of strengthening the walls of Porto Ercole, Grosseto and Talamone in 1532 and in 1541. The fleet of Khayr al-Din Barbarossa, arrived in Italy to help the king of France, sacked and captured Montiano, Talamone and Porto Ercole. The plundered lands were ceded to the king of France who, after offering them in vain to the Pope (who refused them because he supported the Spanish presence in Italy) decided to withdraw from these lands after setting fire to Porto Ercole and its fortress. During the last decade of the Republic of Siena, from 1545 to 1555, the restoration of the walls and the fortifications of the ports of Talamone and Porto Ercole were continuous. During the Siena War where the Sienese and French armies faced each other against the Florentine and Spanish armies, besieged Siena on August 2, 1554 and surrendered the city in April 1555, Porto Ercole still remained to be conquered, where the French commander Charles de Carbonni√®res, after having awaited the arrival of Marshal Piero Strozzi, he surrendered on June 18, 1555. The ports that were of the Republic of Siena for more than two centuries, became part of the nascent State of the Presidi in 1557 at the behest of Philip II king of Spain.  Sienese ports in mass art and culture  * In the fresco Effects of Good Government in the city, present in the Sala dei Nove of the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena, the beginning of the writing \\"Talamone\\", truncated in the terminal part, is still visible. Ambrogio Lorenzetti had in fact drawn the Sienese countryside to the sea in 1339, which at the time in the countryside of Siena meant the outpost of Talamone. The work, however, has undergone a fifteenth-century remake in the right margin, on a triangular surface roughly defined on the side that goes from the penultimate ceiling beam to the lower right margin. At the time of the changes, in fact, the coastal area was infested with malaria and it was preferred to depict the countryside up to an anonymous lake, rather than to the sea. *Talamone is also represented in the tablet. View of cities on the sea attributed to the same Ambrogio Lorenzetti and is probably the first experiment in depicting a landscape theme of European painting. The city is similar to medieval Siena, in an imaginary vision, with inconceivably high towers.Detail of the fresco by Giorgio Vasari The taking of Porto Ercole (1570). You can see the various fortresses of the Republic of Siena (including the one on the islet called Forte Ercoletto) during the siege of the Sienese port (in the middle of the fresco) of 1555. *Porto Ercole is instead represented by Giorgio Vasari in the fresco The Taking of Porto Ercole, present in the Salone dei Cinquecento in Florence. With this work, Giorgio Vasari celebrated the conquest of the Sienese port on June 18, 1555 together with the greatest Florentine military victories, for the exaltation and glorification of the patron Cosimo I de Medici and his family. Contrada Capitana dell'Onda in the Cathedral of Siena. * According to its Statute, the Contrada Capitana of Onda still considers Talamone an integral part of its territory and its inhabitants, who are protectors, part of the people of the Contrada. The origins of the Contrada derive in fact from the aggregation of the peoples of the ancient Sienese military companies of Casato di Sotto and San Salvadore occurred in the fifteenth century, in charge of the defense of the coast of the Republic of Siena, whose main port was the town of Talamone.

He is the earliest known sports announcer credited with creating the profession at the Staten Island Athletic Club games in 1884. Early Years Frederick William Burns was born in Brooklyn on July 7, 1860 to Scottish immigrants. His father, Archimedes Burns, was a Scotsman who immigrated from Ireland. Both he and his brother, Euclid Garfield Burns, were born in Ireland at 10 Dobbin Street in Armagh. Archimedes and Euclid traveled through India and Africa prior to entering the United States about 1856. Archimedes and his brother began a plumbing business in Brooklyn which they managed together until Archimedes' sudden death prior to 1860 leaving Fred without a father prior to the age of 9. His mother, Agnes Alderdice Wemyss-Burns (n√©e MacIlvine), came to the United States in 1842 at the age of 12. Prior to his Archimedes death, Archimedes and Agnes had 4 children: Matilda Frank, Fred, Ulala Evangeline and Lualaba Gwendoline. Matilda died at just over two years old August 11, 1860 when Fred was only a month old. Agnes, always a homemaker, lived on Clinton Street in Brooklyn and owned a summer home in Echo Lake, New Jersey. She lived to the surprising age of 92 when most died in their sixties. She was mentally sharp to the end. Fred's early work had him involved with his uncle and well-known local Brooklyn politician, Euclid G. Burns. His business entanglements with his uncle found him in front of a magistrate more than once including charges of violating his liquor license for selling alcohol on Sunday. Ultimately, he landed in his lifelong daytime profession as a broker at the Custom House on Wall Street until his death in 1923. Athletics Both his parents were notably bigger people so, Fred, of no surprise, was slender and tall for the time at six feet. He grew up involved in athletics, participating in decathlon-style sports as well as two fledgling sports which had become American rages: baseball and football. Fred, despite his rheumatism, competed in track and field events into the 1890s. Fred was a noted oarsmen and a good fisherman as well. Fred and his wife Anna were championship winning bowlers in the New York City area. Anna, particularly, set bowling records for women, rolling over 200 on many an occasion. Taught by his father, Fred played golf all his life, competing regularly in amateur tournaments after his announcing years faded. He became involved in local golf course design and tournament scoring rules during the years prior to his death. Lacrosse In the early 1870s at a lacrosse exhibition on the Capitoline Grounds, Fred became very impressed with lacrosse. He could not afford his own lacrosse stick so, he taught himself to thrown and catch with a broom. About 10 years later, Fred was training for sprinting at the original Polo Grounds. Fred's running came to the attention of John R. Flannery (Father of Modern Lacrosse). Flannery, who captained the New York Lacrosse Club, approached Fred because he was lacking fast runners on the team. Fred spoke of the broom story and a friendship blossomed which would last until Flannery's death in 1919. Fred played lacrosse on Flannery's New York Lacrosse Club and Williamsburgh Athletic Club teams for 8 years until rheumatism got the better of him. During that time Fred played primarily Inside Home (Attack in modern terminology). Together, they won numerous local and national championships including the Hermann Oelrichs Cup (local) and the James Gordon Bennett, Jr. Cup (national). Bennett, publisher of the New York Herald was better known for his namesake yachting cup. Both he and Flannery were selected to the All-American team to go to England but, neither could make the trip due to their respective business affairs. However, the managers of the All-American team chose a warm-up team, which included Burns and Flannery, to play the All-America team prior to their departure. Burns' and Flannery's team won, much to the chagrin of the All-America squad, handily. The All-America team, without Burns and Flannery, traveled to England and overwhelmingly won every match. They were noted by their England opponents for their rough play. The Williamsburgh N.Y.A.C. lacrosse team, with Flannery and Burns, went on to tie the Canadian champion Caughnewaga Indians 3-3, which was shocking because at the time, what baseball meant to the United States, lacrosse meant to Canada. Both Burns and Flannery scored in the contest. No American clubs came close to the Canadian teams until that July afternoon in 1884. Fred proclaimed the Forward Pass in football had its origins in lacrosse, much to the denouncing of Yale stars, quarterback Harry Beecher and fullback Billy Bull, who attributed it to the great Walter Camp. Contrary to modern belief, the forward pass got its start long before the 1896 contest between John Heisman's North Carolina Football Team and Pop Warner's Georgia Bulldogs. Cycling and the Good Roads Association Fred Burns' enthusiasm for cycling began in the early 1890s. During this time, he became part of the Good Roads Associations of Brooklyn and Long Island and served on executive committees which led to the first paved bicycle path between Brooklyn and Coney Island. He was the chairman of the Track and Race Committee of the New York Division of the League of American Wheelmen which constructed the concrete-paved Manhattan Beach Bicycle Racetrack in 1895 which included banked turns. Over 12,000 wheelmen attended the first meet in June with numerous American and world cycling records broken. The success led to many professional and amateur races at the venue including the establishment of a bicycle-riding academy for women, children and beginners. He was even considered as a candidate for President of the L.A.W. in 1898 due to his honesty and ability. Of all the athletic clubs he belonged to and as avid a cyclist as he was, he never belonged to a wheelmen's club and became known as the \\"Hermit Wheelman\\" for simply riding off on his own. There are numerous accounts of him riding his bicycle to events of which he announced. In a couple of cases having been engaged as the ring announcer of illegal boxing bouts, he attained a reputation for escaping arrest by the police by outrunning them on his bicycle. Fred Burns announcing for Charles \\"Mile-A- Minute\\" Murphy in 1899 Burns staunchly supported Mile-A-Minute Murphy in his quest to show a cyclist could pedal 1 mile in less than 1 minute. It started with Charles Murphy's declaration that he would perform the feat by June 1, 1895. Burns' first involvement came in May as he'd written a letter to the Pennsylvania Railroad to allow Murphy to follow behind a train moving at 60 miles per hour. Numerous railroads all over the country were contacted to perform the feat. Finally, the Long Island Railroad finally agreed in 1899. On June 1, 1899 after over 4 years of effort and all Burns' and Murphy's letters to railroads, Murphy road a mile behind a Long Island Railroad train in 57.8 seconds. Announcing In the earliest days of athletic competitions, results were recorded and posted on bulletin boards whereby spectators and athletes crowded around them to view the official results. The earliest account of announcing came at the athletic games of the Staten Island Athletic Club in 1884. The account is announcing began as a bit of joke. A number of events were tight and spectators crowded around the boards to get the results. Folk who could not see the board clamored after the results of various athletes. Fred Burns, know for his sharp piercing voice, stepped up and began reading off the answers to the crowd. Fred received a huge ovation for his efforts and announcing was born. A separate account had Fred, sidelined from an athletic event with rheumatism in the winter of 1886, shouting loudly during the games. His close friend Malcolm W. Ford, the Jim Thorpe of his time, recommended to him to try announcing events. However, Fred had already been announcing by this time. Regardless, Fred and Malcolm were very close friends until that latter's 1902 murder-suicide of his novelist brother, Paul Ford. Malcolm loved Fred's little girls, Florence and Gladyss, and was seen on more than one occasion holding their hands at athletic clubs and venues where both Burns and Ford trained, officiated and competed. From these early beginnings, \\"F.W. Burns\\" could be read in all the New York papers multiple times per week in relation to athletic contests and boxing matches, sporting a moniker brand new to the sporting world, Announcer. The more notable athletic clubs in the northeast, such as the New York Athletic Club, created roles for an official announcer. Although Fred Burns remained the preference of most all athletic organizations in the northeast, he could not cover all events and other names began to appear. Fred Burns was the first announcer of record in Madison Square Garden I in 1889 and in Madison Square Garden II in 1890. Current events are held in Madison Square Garden IV. By the 1890s, all notable boxing matches employed Fred Burns as the ring announcer. He announced some of the biggest names in boxing including Godfrey, Choynski and so many more. When George Dixon defeated England's Fred Johnson in 1892 to become the first ever African-American boxing champion at any weight, Fred Burns was the announcer. When Jim Jeffries beat Bob Fitzsimmons in 1899 for his first Heavyweight Championship, both pugilists got announced by Fred Burns. Fred became known nationally, recognized as the announcer of all major boxing bouts between Philadelphia and Boston. During the \\"Gentleman\\" Jim Corbett and Bob Fitzsimmons Heavyweight Championship in 1897 in Carson City, Nevada, a special telegraph was setup in the Lenox Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan which received all the details of the bout. Fred Burns read out all the action, blow-by-blow, to a crowd of people becoming the first play-by-play sportscaster on record. The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight was, also, filmed by Enoch Rector lasting more than 100 minutes making it the first feature film in history. Fred Burns with his megaphone in 1898 His announcing in cycling was tantamount to his involvement in the sport. It was in cycling that Fred Burns introduced the world to the papier-m√¢ch√© megaphone in 1894. He became known in the sporting world as the first professional megaphoner, a term commonly used for announcer until public address systems took over athletics in the 1930s. He announced some of the biggest cyclists of the time including: Jimmy Michael, Arthur Linton, Earl Kiser and Eddie Bald. When automobiles became the new rage, Burns was called upon to announce the time tests. At the world's first automobile show held in Madison Square Garden in November 1900, the organizers engaged Fred Burns as the announcer. When Henri Fournier, the best chauffeur (original term for race car driver) of his day, drove a world-record mile in 51.8 seconds against a head-wind during the race meetings of the Long Island Automobile Club, the man with the megaphone was Fred Burns. In 1894, the management of the New York Giants baseball club leveraged the services of Fred Burns and Jack Adler to inform the crowds in lieu of using a bulletin board at the Polo Grounds. This Giants team went on to win the first Temple Cup over the original Baltimore Orioles. Several future Hall of Famers played for the team: shortstop George Davis, pitcher Amos Rusie, first baseman Roger Conner and manager/second baseman John Montgomery Ward. Fred was involved, a member, founding member or a board member of the biggest athletic organizations such as the New York Athletic Club, Williamsburgh Athletic Club, Varuna Boat Club,Manhattan Athletic Club,Crescent Athletic Club and American Athletic Union including colleges and military. As a founding board member of the Brooklyn Athletic Association, he was heavily involved in the creation of the club in 1885. While in the process of putting the club together, a rival club emerged naming themselves the South Brooklyn Athletic Club, spearheaded by a group of prominent Brooklynites which including a young Charlie Ebbets and Timothy Woodruff. The Ebbets team quickly incorporated the Brooklyn Athletic Association to prevent the group, including Burns, Flannery and future New York City Police Commissioner John Partridge who were building their new club out of the old Williamsburgh Athletic Club from using it. In truth, they rushed to get their paperwork turned in only a half hour before the old W.A.C. crowd. Fred Burns and his colleagues took great exception and began threatening legal action. To prevent litigation, the Brooklyn Athletic Association renamed themselves the Nassau Athletic Club where Ebbets became the first secretary. The Williamsburgh group took the name Brooklyn Athletic Association. By the end of 1887, Burns and Flannery had defected and joined the board of the Nassau Athletic Club, where Ebbets was now treasurer. At the end of 1889, the Brooklyn Athletic Association had gone under. Fred not only announced but also, refereed boxing, acted as a starter at track meets and cycling/auto races, was up for president of the League of American Wheelmen due to his honesty and ability, was up for boxing commissioner as he was highly regarded for his fairness as a referee at bouts and organized athletic events. Along with athletics, he became a highly sought-after master of ceremonies at social affairs. On top of everything else, he managed wrestler Max Luttbeg. Even at the Custom House where he was a broker, his announcing abilities came into play. During the start of the Tariffs of 1894 of Grover Cleveland's second presidency, a never before seen rush brokers trying withdrawal bonded goods from the Custom House. Using his stentorian voice, made all the official announcements and instructed the unruly crowd to \\"get in line\\". He had a baritone voice and was regularly referred to as \\"Silver- tongued\\" or \\"Silvery-tongued\\". His articulate enunciation and clear explanations during events made him a primary choice of organizers along the eastern seaboard for any major affairs. At the time, Fred Burns was the standard. People credited some of his success to his keen sense of humor. Father of Sports Announcing Due to Burns' vanguard of announcing and the sheer number of athletic events, other men got the bug and began sprouting up to announce as many opportunities to do so arose. The biggest names to follow in Burns' stead were Jack Adler (earliest known horse racing announcer), Pete Prunty, Charles Harvey (famed boxing promoter who once extorted $25,000 out of Hitler for Max Schmelling to come to the United States for a championship bout against Steve Hamas), John P. Dunne and boxing's renowned Joe Humphreys (inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame). The only one of these men to ever use a Public Address System was Humphreys. The foundations of announcing laid by these men led us to folks like Pat Pieper, Red Barber, Bob Sheppard, Vin Scully and Michael Buffer that we know today. Personal Fred Burns married Henrietta M \\"Anna\\" Van der Bosch in the early 1880s and they remained married until his death 1923 from Cardio Valvular Disease and Nephritis. They had two daughters, Florence and Gladyss. Both daughters were athletic like their parents. There is one story which indicates Florence was the first person to ever swim across the Hudson River. Anna and Florence were excellent pistol shots which would figure into Florence's murder case below. Burns' sister, Eva, was a well-known contralto and lyricist who taught music in Brooklyn with her live-in boyfriend of 25 years, the esteemed Professor Albert Caswell (considered the best music director in Brooklyn). There is even a story of Professor Caswell directing over 5,000 children to sing at once, directing them with a megaphone in 1900. This is the first known usage of a megaphone to direct a music group. Since Eva's brother was Fred Burns, a likelihood exists Albert received the megaphone from Fred himself. His father-in-law, William Van der Bosch, was one of the principal engineers of the Brooklyn Bridge, highly regarded in the New York science community and considered the largest man in New York City at 6'4\\" and 300 lbs. On February 15, 1902, 19-year-old Florence was arrested for the murder of her boyfriend, Walter Brooks. Upon the advice of his long-time friend and attorney, Foster Backus (who was also the president of the Brooklyn Athletic Association), Fred ceased announcing and left the state of New York to avoid subpoena by the prosecutor, William Travers Jerome. The original magistrate of the hearing, Robert C. Cornell, worked the Yale games with Fred. The New York City Police Commissioner who investigated the Church Street Police Departments 3rd Degree treatment of Florence, John N. Partridge, was the former president of the Williamsburgh Athletic Club. Timothy Woodruff, Lt. Governor of New York, was part of the Nassau Athletic Club. His daughter was held for 5 weeks in the Tombs I, where she was attended to by the well-known Tombs Angel, during the hearing of the Court of Special Sessions. Noted many times, her trial was the most sensational in New York City history with hundreds crowding the courtroom and thousands in front of the Centre Street Court on the day of her release. Due to Florence's age, 5'8\\" height, golden hair, big blue eyes, attractive face and shapely figure, she would have been considered strikingly beautiful in a world where the typical woman averaged 5'2\\" in size. Due to this, many famous people of the time attended the hearings like socialite Harriet Hubbard Ayer (mostly known for starting the Cosmetics Industry but also, a journalist for Joseph Pulitzer's New York World) and illustrator Charles Dana Gibson (known for creating the Gibson Girl). Upon her release, she joined her family in New Jersey and they remained in hiding until her acquittal after the Coroner's Inquest in mid-May. After which, Fred returned to announcing. However, the number of events he announced significantly declined. Fred is interred in the Tulip section of the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn with his wife, daughter Florence, Bad Bill Dahlen and many, many others.

In short, given two functions f, g, viewed as oracles, the problem is to find x and y such as f(x) = g(y). The pair (x, y) is then called a claw. Some problems, especially in cryptography, are best solved when viewed as a claw finding problem, hence any algorithmic improvement to solving the claw finding problem provides a better attack on cryptographic primitives such as hash functions. Definition Let A, B, C finite sets, and f: A \\\\to C, g: B \\\\to C two functions. A pair (x,y) \\\\in A \\\\times B is called a claw if f(x) = g(y). The claw finding problem is defined as to find such a claw, given that one exists. If we view f, g as random functions, we expect a claw to exist iff A \\\\cdot B \\\\geq C. More accurately, there are exactly A \\\\cdot B pairs of the form (x,y) with x \\\\in A, y \\\\in B; the probability that such a pair is a claw is 1/C. So if A \\\\cdot B \\\\geq C, the expected number of claws is at least 1. Algorithms If classical computers are used, the best algorithm is similar to a Meet-in- the-middle attack, first described by Diffie and Hellman. The algorithm works as follows: assume A \\\\leq B. For every x \\\\in A, save the pair (f(x),x) in a hash table indexed by f(x). Then, for every y \\\\in B, look up the table at g(y). If such an index exists, we found a claw. This approach takes time O(A + B) and memory O(A). If quantum computers are used, Seiichiro Tani showed that a claw can be found in complexity \\\\sqrt[3]{A\\\\cdotB}. Shengyu Zhang showed that asymptotically these algorithms are the most efficient possible. Applications As noted, most applications of the claw finding problem appear in cryptography. Examples include: * Collision finding on cryptographic hash functions. * Meet-in-the-middle attacks: using this technique, k bits of round keys can be found in time roughly 2k/2+1. Here f is encrypting halfway through and g is decrypting halfway through. This is why Triple DES applies DES three times and not just two. * Currently best known attack against supersingular isogeny key exchange is finding a claw on the isogeny graph.

From the mid 1960s to the early 1970s, she hosted a weekly Seattle television show, Face to Face, which featured guest speakers discussing issues such as race, education, and welfare. In 1973 she became the first woman principal of a high school in Seattle. Early life and education Roberta Spencer was born in Tacoma, Washington on January 4, 1919. She attended Lincoln High School and Wilberforce University. She also attended the New School of Social Research. She later earned a bachelor's degree in sociology and elementary education as well as a master's degree in librarianship from the University of Washington. Career as educator and librarian Barr worked as a teacher and librarian in a number of schools within Seattle. During the Seattle school boycott of 1966, she headed one of the Freedom Schools that were set up in protest of the lack of progress towards desegregation. That same year, she was appointed to the Washington State Board Against Discrimination. She was appointed vice principal of Franklin High School in 1968, after 150 students held a sit-in protesting the expulsion of black female students who chose to wear their hair in a natural style. In 1973 Barr became the principal of Lincoln High School, becoming both the first woman and the first African American to be a principal in the Seattle Public Schools district. Career in acting and television Barr's career in acting began when she starred in a Cirque Theatre production of A Raisin in the Sun alongside Greg Morris.

She moderated an audience participation show called Face to Face on KING-TV from 1965-1970 and on KCTS from 1971-1972. Barr interviewed people who were considered too radical for other television shows, including Cesar Chavez. The show's producer, Jean Walkinshaw, described Barr as waking \\"up the community to all kinds of things that had been overlooked.\\" Legacy Seattle advocacy organization Byrd Barr Place (originally Central Area Motivation Program) was renamed in 2018 to honor Barr, who was at one time a writer for the group's monthly newsletter; the organization focuses on improving the lives of low- income people throughout Washington State.

Many deepfakes on the internet feature pornography of people, often female celebrities whose likeness is typically used without their consent. History Deepfake pornography prominently surfaced on the Internet in 2017, particularly on Reddit. The first one that captured attention was the Daisy Ridley deepfake, which was featured in several articles. Other prominent pornographic deepfakes were of various other celebrities. A report published in October 2019 by Dutch cybersecurity startup Deeptrace estimated that 96% of all deepfakes online were pornographic. In December 2017, Samantha Cole published an article about r/deepfakes in Vice that drew the first mainstream attention to deepfakes being shared in online communities. Six weeks later, Cole wrote in a follow-up article about the large increase in AI-assisted fake pornography. Since 2017, Samantha Cole of Vice has published a series of articles covering news surrounding deepfake pornography. Since then, multiple social media outlets have banned or made efforts to restrict deepfake pornography. Most notably, the r/deepfakes subreddit on Reddit was banned on February 7, 2018, due to the policy violation of \\"involuntary pornography\\". In the same month, representatives from Twitter stated that they would suspend accounts suspected of posting non-consensual deepfake content. Scarlett Johansson, a frequent subject of deepfake porn, spoke publicly about the subject to The Washington Post in December 2018. In a prepared statement, she expressed that despite concerns, she would not attempt to remove any of her deepfakes, due to her belief that they do not affect her public image and that differing laws across countries and the nature of internet culture make any attempt to remove the deepfakes \\"a lost cause\\". While celebrities like herself are protected by their fame, however, she believes that deepfakes pose a grave threat to women of lesser prominence who could have their reputations damaged by depiction in involuntary deepfake pornography or revenge porn. In June 2019, a downloadable Windows and Linux application called DeepNude was released which used neural networks, specifically generative adversarial networks, to remove clothing from images of women. The app had both a paid and unpaid version, the paid version costing $50. On June 27 the creators removed the application and refunded consumers, although various copies of the app, both free and for charge, continue to exist.  Efforts to limit deepfake pornography  On January 31 2018, Gfycat began removing all deepfakes from its site. In February 2018, r/deepfakes was banned by Reddit for sharing involuntary pornography. Other websites have also banned the use of deepfakes for involuntary pornography, including the social media platform Twitter and the pornography site Pornhub. However, some websites have not banned deepfake content, including 4chan and 8chan. Also in February 2018, Pornhub said that it would ban deepfake videos on its website because it is considered \\"non consensual content\\" which violates their terms of service. They also stated previously to Mashable that they will take down content flagged as deepfakes. Writers from Motherboard from Buzzfeed News reported that searching \\"deepfakes\\" on Pornhub still returned multiple recent deepfake videos. Chat site Discord has taken action against deepfakes in the past, and has taken a general stance against deepfakes. In September 2018, Google added \\"involuntary synthetic pornographic imagery\\" to its ban list, allowing anyone to request the block of results showing their fake nudes.

It is found in Chinese communities and Chinatowns across Latin America, including Peru (where it is known as chifa) and Cuba. It has spread to the United States with the migration of Asian Latin Americans, particularly the migration of Chinese Cubans to New York City.  Cuba  Chinese Cuban cuisine stems from the earliest migration of Chinese migrants to Cuba in the mid-1800s. Due to a labor shortage, close to 125,000 indentured or contract Chinese laborers arrived in Cuba between 1847 and 1874. The laborers or coolies were almost exclusively male, and most worked on sugar plantations alongside enslaved Africans. Tens of thousands of Chinese who survived indenture and remained on the island during the 1870s and 1880s now had more physical, occupational, and even social mobility. They joined gangs of agricultural laborers, grew vegetables in the countryside, peddled goods, and worked as artisans or at unskilled jobs in town. Fried rice Core aspects of Cuban and Chinese food are similar in their use of white meats such as pork and starches such as rice. The Cuban-Chinese cuisine itself is the cultivation of the food culture of both countries within one restaurant. The Chinese aspect brings dishes such as fried rice, chow mein or shrimp with black bean sauce, while the Cuban aspect brings dishes such as ropa vieja or platanos maduros. Both have ingredients that help distinguish their dishes. In Chinese cooking vegetables such bok choy, amaranth or broccoli play a big role in the development of popular Chinese dishes such as a stir fry. The Chinese style of cooking also relies a lot on oils, sauces and vinegars; including the most commonly known soy sauce as well as others such as rice vinegar, sesame oil and oyster sauce. The Cuban style uses spices such as garlic, cumin, oregano, bay leaf and cilantro, while also using vegetables like onions, bell peppers and tomatoes. Ropa vieja One of the oldest and largest Chinatowns is located in Havana, known as . Most Chinese merchant communities were forced to relocate after the Cuban Revolution.  Peru   United States  = Puerto Rico = = New York = Chino-Latino cuisine in New York City is primarily associated with Chinese Cubans who immigrated following the Cuban Revolution. Despite that fact Chino-Latino restaurants are rarely found in the Chinatowns of the United States. On the contrary, they tend to be concentrated in the Spanish-speaking areas of the five boroughs. The distinct Cuban-Chinese or Latino Chino identity was not found in New York City until the late 1960s and early 1970s when thousands of Chinese remigrated to the United States. Local conditions, including political and economic instability, have caused the remigration of Chinese to the United States from other parts of Latin America, including Peru, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Ecuador. When arriving into the United States, a country in which binary racial categories had now been geared toward the racial segregation of Latinos and Asians which has slowly began to be accepted. Individuals that had previously owned restaurant locals in Cuba's \\"Barrio Chino de la Habana\\", initiated the adjustment to personal preference. Once these previous business owners arrived and settled in East Harlem, people began to establish new businesses based on the immersion within foods they have learned when cultured in Cuba, to honor their heritage and establish their economic stability. For incoming immigrants, these restaurants had a homelike feeling due to the authentic qualities and similarities between their settling area and their home country. It had been a minimal aspect of their home country such as, food that allows people to feel comfortable and adapt within their area of settlement. However, just as this concept had emerged in an accepting manner within present day these restaurants are considered to be disappearing this is due to the lack of the Chinese population migrating directly from Cuba in order to keep the tradition upheld. The last Chinese migration directly from Cuba had occurred in 1959, which has caused doubt on how much longer part of the Cuban and Chinese culture can progress. The process of acculturization allowed the younger generations to lose touch of their roots, compared to others who want to stand by where they come in order to keep heritage alive.

Kuykendall, The Hawaiian Kingdom The Fair American was captured by the Spanish during the Nootka Crisis and taken to Mexico, but quickly released. The Metcalfes had earlier agreed to rendezvous in the Hawaiian Islands at Kealakekua Bay. The Eleanora had arrived by January 1790, and met chief Kameeiamoku who boarded the ship to welcome them. An unknown action by the chief offended Simon Metcalfe, who had him flogged. This was to have severe consequences later. The Eleanora then sailed north to the island of Maui to trade and resupply. One night a small boat was stolen and the night watchman was killed. Captain Metcalfe fired his cannons into the village, and captured a few Hawaiians who told him the boat was taken by people from the village of Olowalu. He sailed to Olowalu but found that boat had been broken up for its nails. Nails were treasured in ancient Hawaii, which lacked metal smelting technology. Metcalfe invited the villagers to meet the ship, indicating he wanted to trade with them. However, he had all the cannons loaded and ready on the side where he directed the canoes to approach. They opened fire, killing about one hundred Hawaiians, and wounded many others. About five or six weeks later the Fair American arrived at the Island of Hawaii where Kameeiamoku was waiting at Ka≈´p≈´lehu. The schooner's crew of five were easily overwhelmed and four were killed, including Thomas Metcalfe. The lone survivor was Isaac Davis.

The residential neighborhood was initially developed as a streetcar suburb by the Highland Park Improvement Association, which underwent several iterations between 1893 and 1930.

Within a year of their first meetings, ultimately their plans, including a bridge across the river decades before the Muller Bridge, would fall apart, and Whittlesey would see litigation taken against him by his associates. The Highland Park Improvement Association dissolved shortly after the splitting of its associates, and in 1896 the land was deeded to the firm Whitcomb & Pearsons, who laid out the initial plots and tentative roads, keeping with the idea that the suburb was one for mill management and an upper-middle class. In 1909, Whitcomb would leave the project and the firm Plimpton, Pearsons, and Richards would assume the development role. That same year, Samuel Osborne Hoyt arrived in the city. A developer himself, he would work under the new firm until in 1914 he bought out the shares of his associates and made it his own contracting firm. Although the neighborhood began with a more turbulent history, within ten years Hoyt would become known as the \\"father of Highland Park\\" in the way that other streetcar suburbs like Oakdale and Springdale had their own respective developer-founder figures. =Community club and culture= Highland Park would largely be shaped after 1909, as in that same year the city would purchase Smith's Ferry to the north, from Northampton, and the Olmsted Brothers were commissioned to design Jones Point Park, previously identified on maps as Highland Park or \\"Monte Vista\\". In 1909, Pleasant Street was opened as a public thoroughfare north of the dingle, as the \\"Ivy League\\" streets were gradually built out with more residences. In 1910, the remaining undeveloped tracts to the north would host a grand exhibition for the aviation stunts of Charles F. Willard. In the history of aviation, Willard was the first barnstormer, first person to fly 3 passengers in the United States, and first person to be shot out of the sky by a bullet‚Äî that of an annoyed farmer. Willard's feats would attract a crowd of more than 7,000 for the YMCA benefit exhibition, and thousands more would view his escapades from South Hadley and boats on the Connecticut River. It was reported that 24 streetcars were dedicated to moving out the crowd at the show's conclusion.   * By 1911, the Holyoke Street Railway was being extended through the neighborhood along Pleasant street toward Northampton Street and Mountain Park. Although not well documented, at some point leading up to 1911, the neighborhood was also considered as a railway stop for the Boston and Maine Railroad, whose former tracks run between its homes and the Connecticut River. In 1913 the new neighborhood's residents began to organize, hosting banquets and plays, forming the Highland Park Club. Seeking a clubhouse and amphitheater, Hoyt and his associates would donate a plot of land at 250 Pleasant Street to the club for these purposes, and before 1919 a club house in the Tudor Revival style was constructed on that spot.HLY.1233, Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS). Up through the mid 1920s the community house would serve as a social space for neighborhood dances, mayoral political campaigns, and even received Second Lady Grace Coolidge for a reception after her husband had become Warren G. Harding's Vice-President. In 1923, the community house began functioning as a private school, known as the Lovering School, and was partially reconstructed after a fire that same year. It would continue to be used in this capacity until its last class graduated in 1939, and was converted to a private residence thereafter.

It is staffed from Memorial Day (May) weekend to October by park rangers dressed in colonial attire who offer programs daily. The building is in the saltbox style. History The building, whose main fa√ßade faces south, was originally constructed as a home for Ephraim Hartwell (1707‚Äì1793) and his newlywed wife, Elizabeth (1714‚Äì1808), in 1733. It was given to them by Ephraim's father, Samuel (1666‚Äì1744), who lived in a home with his wife, Mary, about 700 feet east along Battle Road. Built in the 1690s, only the central chimney of Samuel and Mary's house still stands, amongst a basic reconstruction of the building.Samuel Hartwell House site - NPS.gov The gifted home stood on 18 acres of land. The building viewed from Battle Road The Hartwells raised a family and, in 1756, when they had nine children living in the house, Ephraim applied for a license to run the home as an inn. It was run as such until the 1780s. When Samuel died in 1744, aged 78,Samuel Hartwell (1666‚àí1744) at FindAGrave.com Ephraim inherited his portion of the family farm. By 1749 the farm was one of the most productive in Concord and consisted of 141 acres.\\"The Hartwell Tavern and the Hartwell Family in Closer Detail\\" - NPSHistory.com The property was part of Concord until 1754, when the town of Lincoln was incorporated. Ephraim died in 1793, aged 86.Ephraim Hartwell (1707‚Äì1793) at FindAGrave.com Elizabeth survived her husband by fifteen years; she died in 1808, aged 94.Elizabeth Hartwell (1714‚Äì1808) at FindAGrave.com The house continued to be a residence up until its purchase by the National Park Service in 1967. Over the years that followed, the building was modernized and changed. In the 1980s, the Park Service restored it to its 1775 appearance, yet kept its 1783 and 1830 additions. The main structure, the foundation, most of the walls and some of the flooring are 1733 originals. It is estimated that about 65% of the original structure remains within the restored building. =Battles of Lexington and Concord= The Battle of Lexington and Concord took form before dawn on April 19, 1775. Soldiers passed by the tavern on their way to Concord, and again on their way back to Boston. Three of the Hartwells' children ‚Äî Samuel, John and Isaac ‚Äî were in the Lincoln minutemen that fought at Old North Bridge and on the battle road. All three later served in the Revolutionary War. Paul Revere and William Dawes were detained by a British Army patrol nearby during the \\"Midnight Ride\\" to Concord of April 18. Samuel Prescott, who was also riding with them, escaped by jumping his horse over a wall and into the woods. Prescott emerged at the Hartwell Tavern, awakened Ephraim and informed him of the pending arrival of the British soldiers. Ephraim sent his black slave, Violet, down the road to alert his parents. Mary then relayed the message to Captain William Smith, commanding officer of the Lincoln minutemen, who lived a little to the west and whose home still stands along Battle Road. The minutemen received the noticed in time, and arrived at Old North Bridge before their enemy. Prescott made it to Concord.

Kilner FRES is a British evolutionary biologist, and a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Cambridge.  Education and career  Kilner studied a BA in Zoology at the University of Oxford in 1992, and received a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology at the University of Cambridge in 1996. She worked as a Junior Research Fellow at Magdelene College, Cambridge, and in 1998 was a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellow; she was appointed Lecturer at the University of Cambridge in 2005 and a Reader in 2009. In 2013, Kilner was appointed Professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Cambridge, and in 2019, Kilner was made a Director of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology.  Research  Kilner's research looks at how social evolution can generate biodiversity and much of her work looks at burying beetles (Silphidae) and birds. Her earlier research looked at birds that are brood parasites, which take advantage of other species' nests and parental care. In particular she found that cuckoos are able to produce eggs that mimic those of their host bird species. Kilner found that cowbirds, which are also brood parasites, do not try to outcompete the host chicks that they hatch next to (as with cuckoos) and instead cowbirds do better when the host chicks remain. Parental care is common in burying beetles. Kilner's work on burying beetles has shown that beetle parents can produce a slime mixture that can influence bacteria communities on the meat they provide for their larval offspring; the bacteria aid digestion in the beetle stomach and prevent decomposition of the meat, so that beetle larvae grow larger and healthier. She also examined what happens when parents are prevented from caring for larvae over 30 successive generations. She found that the beetle larvae evolved larger jaws to help them feed from carcasses better without help. She also found that motherless beetle larvae were less competitive between each other and had higher survival rates than when mothered larvae had to cope alone. Her research with burying beetles has also shown that they can form symbiotic relationships with mites. Smaller beetles which lose out in fights with larger beetles can benefit from the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi, which helps them to warm up and enables them to win contests with other beetles for a carcass food source. Awards *In 2010, Kilner was awarded the Zoological Society of London's Scientific Medal for her \\"outstanding contributions to behavioural ecology and the analysis of evolutionary processes\\". *In 2015, Kilner was awarded the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award for her research: How does social evolution generate biodiversity?

The 23rd depression and the 8th typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Mitag developed from a low pressure system near the Micronesia Islands on September 24. Tracking generally northwestward, the system gradually organised and the Japanese Meteorological Agency issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression 19W on September 27. It continued northeastward, gradually organizing and becoming less broad. It was then upgraded to Tropical Storm Mitag on September 28. The storm quickly intensified, becoming a Category 1 typhoon just a day later. It further intensified into a Category 2 typhoon, passing very close to Taiwan. It weakened thereafter, making landfall near Zhoushan in East China on October 1 before weakening back to a poorly organized tropical storm. It later made landfall in South Korea on October 2 before becoming extratropical in the Japan Sea on October 3.  Meteorological history  Mitag developed from a low pressure system near the Micronesia Islands on September 24. Tracking generally northwestward, the system gradually organised and the Japanese Meteorological Agency issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression 19W on September 27. Traipsing toward the Philippines and eventually entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility the next day with the Philippine Atmospherical, Geological and Astronomical Services Administration routinely named it Onyok. The JMA followed suit after the system intensified to become a tropical storm, naming it Mitag on September 28. The JTWC's projected track path lead Mitag toward the Ryukyu Islands, all while strengthening. Mitag, while gaining latitude, strengthened quickly on September 29 and within just hours became a severe tropical storm, and shortly after, a category 1 typhoon later on that same day. Tropical Storm Mitag approaching the alt= Developing a visible circulation and with thick bands of strong convection, it swiftly became a category 2 typhoon on the evening of September 30, with a small, clouded eye developing as it passed just east of Taiwan. Due to a sudden increase in wind shear and decrease in sea surface temperatures, Mitag began to quickly degrade after becoming a category 2 typhoon, and weakened to a category 1 typhoon before making its first mainland landfall on Zhoushan, exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The land interaction disrupted Mitag by quite some margin, and it weakened to a tropical storm relatively quickly during landfall. It quickly moved northeast towards South Korea as it began to enter it's extratropical transition on the evening of October 1. Mitag made its second landfall on South Korea on October 2 whilst surprisingly holding onto tropical storm strength and remaining a poorly organized tropical cyclone. Shortly after land interaction with South Korea, it's low-level circulation center was continually exposed by westerly wind shear and its cloud tops became displaced, leading to it weakening below tropical depression status on October 3 and becoming extratropical the next day. Preparations and Impact =The Philippines= As Mitag was initially forecast to come near the Philippines, a Signal 1 warning was raised for a portion of Luzon and the Batanes and the Babuyan Islands as the storm passed just northeast of the country as a category 1 typhoon. The PAGASA also noted that in its path it would bring showers and isolated thunderstorms over the Cagayan valley in its passing, and rough sea conditions as well. As forecast, the storm's outer bands produced heavy rainfall, rough sea conditions, and gusty winds in Northern Luzon, but no damage was reported. =Taiwan= As Mitag approached Taiwan from the southeast, an Orange Tropical Cyclone Alert was raised for Taiwan on September 29, the second-highest possible. On the same day, the Taiwanese government ordered a total closure of all financial markets and schools in the country as Mitag advanced towards Taiwan, while airlines in the country also cancelled dozens of flights amid warnings of floods and high winds issued by the country's meteorological agency. =South Korea= References Category:2019 Pacific typhoon season Category:Typhoons in China ","title":"Typhoon Mitag (2019)"},{"id":"62591392","text":"Ludv√≠k W√°gner (born 1885, date of death unknown) was a Czech weightlifter.

The film was prompted by the 2012 discovery of Renia Spiegel's diary, which she kept from 1939 until her death at the age of 18 in 1942. Broken Dreams premiered on May 2, 2019 at the United Nations in New York, and on September 18, 2019 in Warsaw, Poland.  Synopsis  The documentary revolves around the diary of Renia Spiegel, who spent the early years of World War II in the Polish city of Przemy≈õl, along with her sister, Ariana Spiegel (now Elizabeth Bellak). Ariana was a child film star in Poland, while Renia was more reserved, a typical Polish youth. In her diary, Spiegel writes about everyday teenage life, as well as the growing war, eventually covering her imprisonment in the Przemy≈õl ghetto. After escaping the ghetto, Spiegel was killed at the age of 18 by Nazi police when her hiding place was discovered. Spiegel's diary was preserved by her boyfriend, Zygmunt Schwarzer, who eventually brought it to Spiegel's mother and sister in New York after the war. The diary remained unread until 2012, when Elizabeth Bellak's daughter had it translated to English, leading to its publication in 2019 and the creation of Broken Dreams. Portrait of Renia Spiegel Broken Dreams tells the story of the Spiegel sisters through interviews with Bellak and readings of Renia's diary by Polish actress Aleksandra Bernatek. In addition to telling Renia's story, the documentary also spends substantial time telling Bellak's story of being a child actress.  Production and release  After Elizabeth Bellak's daughter, Alexandra Renata Bellak, rediscovered Spiegel's diary in 2012, she approached Polish filmmaker Tomasz Magierski. After reading the diary, Magierski agreed to make a film, telling Agence France-Presse, \\"But I couldn‚Äôt stop reading it! I read this thing over probably four or five nights...I got used to her handwriting and to be honest I fell in love with her. I fell in love with Renia.\\" Broken Dreams premiered at the United Nations in New York on May 2, 2019, which was Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day). This screening was conducted by the Department of Global Communications and the Permanent Mission of Poland to the United Nations. The documentary's Polish premier took place in Warsaw on September 18, 2019.  Reception  Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Gary Goldstein called Broken Dreams \\"vital and intriguing\\" but said that the production is \\"a bit cursory and cobbled together\\". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the documentary is \\"deeply moving\\" and that it is one of the most powerful films providing a first-hand account of the Holocaust. He also praised Aleksandra Bernatek, who reads from Spiegel's diary, saying that she \\"delivers emotive readings that fully convey Renia's girlishness, passion and inner strength\\".

It mostly studies constraint satisfaction problems related to ground states of local Hamiltonians; that is, Hermitian matrices that act locally on a system of interest. The constraint satisfaction problems in quantum Hamiltonian complexity have led to the quantum version of the Cook‚ÄìLevin theorem. Quantum Hamiltonian complexity has helped physicists understand the difficulty of simulating physical systems. Local Hamiltonian problem Given a Hermitian matrix H, let \\\\lambda_0 denote the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian H, and let a and b be non-negative real numbers with b \\\\geq a + 1. If \\\\lambda_0 \\\\leq a, output Yes. If \\\\lambda_0 \\\\geq b , output No. The k-local Hamiltonian problem is similar except the Hamiltonians have k-local interactions. This problem has been shown to be QMA-complete for k \\\\geq 2 . Area law The area law explains the structure of entanglement present in ground states of physically relevant systems. It states that the entropy of a reduced density matrix of a quantum system in its ground state is proportional to the boundary length of the area. The area law has been useful in finding efficient ways to simulate entangled quantum systems. Quantum analog of the PCP theorem The classical PCP theorem states that simulating the ground states of classical systems is hard. The quantum analog of the PCP theorem concerns simulations of quantum systems. Proving the quantum analog of the PCP theorem is an open problem.

For years it has been the largest commercial facility in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, with an area of almost 90,000 sq m. and over 2,000 permanent sales outlets. History Stalls in the market, May 2020 In the early 90s with the collapse of the Communist bloc and the People's Republic of Poland and the liberalization of trade and transformation to market economy, the city hall was searching a place to hold a retail market instead of the existing one in Bema Street which had become too small. The location that was decided was the former harvest square in Kawaleryjska street. Due to concerns from the retailers' side regarding the relative distance of the location from the city center, the authorities made a commitment that they would not establish another market in the city center. A major mark point was 1994, the year the trade in Belarus was liberalized, a step that contributed to the growth of trade and activity in the market. The years 1995 to 1998 saw high growth and thousands of cars from Lithuania and Belarus arrived to sell their stock. In 1998 there was a slump, even a collapse of the market since the Polish government limited cross-border trade by introducing visas, a decision that led to demonstrations.

This artist, active in Naples Italy, is best known for his sometimes humorous and intricate genre works.Metropolitan Museum collections. Description The painting depicts is a blunt allegory showing Margaret of Cortona, the 13th-century Franciscan tertiary, as underscored by the knotted belt of rope or cincture of the order. Margaret sits in a plain room, listening entranced to the words of an angel, whose hands finger a crown of thorns and partially obscure a skull; in her left hand, she cradles a crucifix. In the background, a bat-winged satanic figure departs, with his hands hiding his face. His wings have cryptic circles. St Margaret in her writings recalled that she served as a mistress and step-mother to an aristocratic noble. But he was murdered, and her dog was able to lead her to his corpse. These events triggered her departure from a sinful life in the world to a eremetic live of devotion. The arc of her life would have held resonance for women seeking absolution in joining the tertiaries, which did not require vows of absolute poverty and chastity. The veneration of Saint Margaret of Cortona was prominent in her native Tuscany, but did spread through Italy.

Biography Patolla was born in Santos, S√£o Paulo on March 30, 1959. He began his career, initially as a musician, in the late 1970s playing for cover bands Rock Memory and Rock Cover. In the early 1980s, alongside former Patrulha do Espa√ßo bassist Oswaldo \\"Cokinho\\" Gennari, Leonardo Giordano and Maur√≠cio Pedrosa, he formed the \\"one-hit wonder\\" band Telex, whose only release prior to their disbandment was the 7\\" single \\"S√≥ Del√≠rio\\" through CBS Records International in 1984. In 1986 he formed the pop/comedy rock band Lagoa 66, who had shortened their name only to \\"Lagoa\\" by the time of the release of their only studio album, Agora Sai!, in 1995. In 1988 he debuted as a producer, on Skowa e a M√°fia's album La Famiglia. In 1994 he was acquainted with the up-and-coming band Charlie Brown Jr. through its bassist, Champignon, who sent him over a demo so he could evaluate their work. Patolla then approached the band's vocalist, Chor√£o, convincing him to sing in Portuguese rather than the \\"broken English\\" he used to, and to \\"experiment\\" more with other genres such as hip hop, reggae, ska and hardcore punk, thus developing the eclectic sonority Charlie Brown Jr. would be known for. Alongside Rick Bonadio, Patolla produced the band's 1997 debut, Transpira√ß√£o Cont√≠nua Prolongada, and his band Lagoa, in one of its final credited works prior to its break-up, made a guest appearance on the track \\"Escalas Tropicais\\"; he would produce other further five albums for Charlie Brown Jr., and also be a guest musician on their 2003 Ac√∫stico MTV live album/DVD. When Champignon left the band in 2005 to form his own project, Revolucionn√°rios, Patolla produced their only release, Retratos da Humanidade; he also produced Contra Insetos Parasitas in 2008, the only release by TH6, a project by also former Charlie Brown Jr. member Marc√£o. Patolla has also worked with other bands and artists such as Biquini Cavad√£o, Deborah Blando, Jorge Ben Jor, Wilson Sideral, Aliados and Strike. In 2012 he won a Latin Grammy Award for his work in Beto Lee's Celebra√ß√£o & Sacrif√≠cio. In 2019 he launched the indie band Curinga Roque, producing their debut single \\"N√£o V√° Embora\\".

Pyrrhus and Demetrius was the second most successful opera in early 18th century London, after Camilla. It had 58 or 59 performances between 1708 and 1717. The opera marked the London debut of the castrato Nicol√≤ Grimaldi (Nicolini). Score and libretto The London version was prepared by Nicola Haym, who composed a new overture and 24 new arias, retaining only 14 of Scarlatti‚Äôs original arias. Haym also inserted an aria by Handel from Agrippina: Ho un non so che nel cor. The English libretto was created by Owen Swiny. In January 1709 Walsh, Randall, and Hare printed the overture and 54 arias in Songs in the Opera Call'd Pyrrhus and Demetrius. In May 1709 a different edition of The Songs in the Opera of Pyrrhus and Demetrius was published by John Cullen. Roles and action The roles in the opera are: Pyrrhus, king of Epirus; Demetrius king of Macedonia; Climene, daughter of King Lysimachus, enemy of Demetrius; Climene, sister of Pyrrhus; Clearte, lover of Deidamia; Arbante, a knight; Marius, son of Arbante; Breno, servant of Deidamia. The action is set in ancient Macedonia. Demetrius has seized the throne after having murdered Alexander, himself the murderer of his mother Thessalonice. He then wants to invade Asia, but Ptolemy, Seleucus and Lysimachus join forces against him, joined by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Pyrrhus succeeds in driving out Demetrius and replacing him on the throne, before himself being driven away by Lysimachus. Performance history The opera opened at the Queen's Theatre on December 14, 1708, with the castrato Nicol√≤ Grimaldi (Nicolini) starring as Pyrrhus, who had sung in the original 1694 production in Naples; another castrato Valentino Urbani, (Valentini) in the role of Demetrius, Littleton Ramondon (Cleartes), Purbeck Turner (Arbantes), Margherita de L‚ÄôEpine (Marius), Cook (Brennus), Catherine Tofts (Climene), Joanna Maria Lindelheim (Deidamia). The two castrati sang in Italian, the other singers in English. The sets for the first production were created by Marco Ricci and Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini. The opera had a significant impact on the business of running an opera house in England. Nicolini brought with him a detailed account of the economics of Venetian opera houses, and the management of the Queen‚Äôs Theatre adapted its business model accordingly. In accordance with Nicolini‚Äôs advice a subscription of 1000 guineas was raised from Queen Anne and both subscriptions and ticket prices were increased. Critical reception Richard Steele described the opera as 'a noble entertainment,' and praised Nicolini who, ‚Äòby the grace and propriety of his action and gesture, does honour to an human figure.‚Äô The author of A Critical Discourse stated that the opera was considered to be the best Scarlatti ever wrote, having achieved universal applause wherever it was performed. He also praised the judicious composition and addition of new material in the Lindon adaptation, which he contrasted with the incoherent efforts of earlier ventures such as Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus.

Background  Bernice Kentner was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming and later moved to North Platte, Nebraska. In the 1980s, Kentner relocated to Concord, California. Bernice Kentner was a leading proponent of seasonal color analysis in the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, Jo Peddicord still considered Kentner's philosophy of color to be one of the most prominent color analysis systems in the United States, and Peddicord acknowledged that Kentner had an international following. In 2003, The Register-Guard stated that Kentner's book Color Me a Season \\"helped spur the 1980s boom in color analysis.\\" In the 2010s, some authors argued that Kentner's system had become outdated, such as June McLeod, who wrote in 2016 that \\"today there are few people in the colour world who still follow her work by using the four season system.\\"  Seasonal color analysis  The color analysis system developed by Bernice Kentner differs from the other notable system that Carole Jackson developed in the 1973 publication Color Me Beautiful; Kentner's system focuses more specifically on skin color, while hair color is considered secondary. In the book Going Gray, Anne Kreamer dedicates an entire chapter to apparel called \\"It's Not The Gray, It's the Clothes.\\" Kreamer states that the seasonal metaphors of the cosmetologist Bernice Kentner's Color Me a Season system have allowed beauticians \\"to find the best tone and hue for clients' particular complexions and coloring and hair.\\" Kreamer also discusses her surprise when she discovered that she herself is a Summer according to Kentner's system. In 2011, Jules Standish wrote that Pat Scott Vincent's color analysis system Colourflair was \\"based on Bernice Kentner's methods.\\" In their article \\"Color Analysis in the Marketplace,\\" Jo Ann Hilliker and Jean Rogers also wrote that Bernice Kentner's system \\"classifies individuals similar to the Color Me Beautiful approach, but she also recommends examining the iris of the eye to determine the right season. The Summer eye has a 'cracked glass' pattern. The Winter eye has 'spokes' from the pupil to the edge of the iris. A 'sunburst' surrounds the pupil of the Spring eye and the Autumn eye is distinguished by a ring of gold or brown around the pupil and brown flecks in the iris.\\"  Personal life  Bernice Kentner was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She married Dean Kentner in the Spring of 1948.  In popular culture  Bernice Kentner is the subject of the eponymously named song by Canadian indie rock band Baby Jey.

His early education was received at public schools, graduating from the Brimmer School and the Boston Latin School. thumb In December 1858 he sailed to Honolulu, Hawaii, on a long ocean voyage via Cape Horn on the clipper ship Syren, seeking to improve his health. Career A young Joseph Ballard Atherton, Shortly after his arrival in Honolulu (with letters of introduction to Samuel Northrup Castle and others), he took a job as a bookkeeper at Castle & Cooke, a sugar cane producer. In 1865, he was named a junior partner, and in 1894 he became senior member; and then its president.

The ranch is private property but offers frequent public and private events and tours. A large portion of the ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The listing included 19 contributing buildings, five contributing structures, a contributing site, and a contributing object on . The buildings are distributed among four historic building groups created by two homesteaders and a rich heiress. The four groups are: *Ranch Headquarters, originally the John Blunt Homestead and later known as Amnicola *Cherokee Castle *the Flower Homestead (Chickamauga), and *the Johnson ranch buildings. The first part of the property eventually assembled was homesteaded by Maine- born John E. Blunt. A former Union soldier, he arrived with his family in 1868 from Kansas in a covered wagon which brought apple tree slips. He settled on land along East Plum Creek at homestead site now on the south side of U.S. Highway 85. It was extremely cold in winters along the creek, so they moved to higher ground in 1873 and built a wood frame house at the current location of ranch headquarters. An original apple tree brought to the new site survived in 1994. Blunt acquired others' homestead properties and eventually what he called Sunflower Ranch had on which he farmed wheat, sorghum, and steers. The ranch was sold by Ray Blunt in 1954 to Mildred Montague Genevieve Kimball, known as \\"Tweet\\" Kimball, who chose to call it Amnicola after her property in Chattanooga on the Tennessee River. Tweet Kimball, known as \\"a delightfully eccentric international traveler, philanthropist, equestrian, award-winning cattlewoman and legendary hostess\\", lived 55 years in Cherokee Castle. Her first of four husbands was Merritt Kirk Ruddock, of aristocratic family and C.I.A. connections. The ranch has on both south and north of U.S. Highway 85, but the listing is limited to the property north of 85, which includes four historic building groups. The four are: *Cherokee Castle, originally known as Charlford Castle, which is a 20th century copy of a 15th century Scottish castle. It is the main residence of the ranch and was built during 1926-28. It was designed by Denver architect Burnham F. Hoyt, who is known for his later design of the Red Rocks Park Amphitheater. *the Flower Homestead (Chickamauga), began with English-born Frederick Gerald Flower ploughing of land and stringing barbed wire and then, in 1894, filing a homestead claim. He built a stone house on the edge of a high plateau with views of the Front Range, and his wife and sister moved in in 1895. His remote property was accessed by a track which later became Daniels Park Road. Flower prospered and accumulated a total of , which was sold to Charles Johnson in 1924. *the Johnson ranch buildings. The Wauhatchie Barn, an element of the Johnson Dairy Farm, has recently been restored. The listing covers property north of U.S. Route 85 and south of Daniels Park Road.

It is a special example of the more general concept of a direct limit in a category. The technique was developed in the 1950s by its namesake, French logician Roland Fra√Øss√©. The main point of Fra√Øss√©'s construction is to show how one can approximate a (countable) structure by its finitely generated substructures. Given a class \\\\mathbf{K} of finite relational structures, if \\\\mathbf{K} satisfies certain properties (described below), then there exists a unique countable structure \\\\operatorname{Flim}(\\\\mathbf{K}), called the Fra√Øss√© limit of \\\\mathbf{K}, which contains all the elements of \\\\mathbf{K} as substructures. The general study of Fra√Øss√© limits and related notions is sometimes called Fra√Øss√© theory. This field has seen wide applications to other parts of mathematics, including topological dynamics, functional analysis, and Ramsey theory.  Finitely generated substructures and age  Fix a language \\\\mathcal{L}. By an \\\\mathcal{L}-structure, we mean a logical structure having signature \\\\mathcal{L}. Given an \\\\mathcal{L}-structure \\\\mathcal{M} with domain M, and a subset A \\\\subseteq M, we use \\\\langle A \\\\rangle^\\\\mathcal{M} to denote the least substructure of \\\\mathcal{M} whose domain contains A (i.e. the closure of A under all the function and constant symbols in \\\\mathcal{L}). A substructure \\\\mathcal{N} of \\\\mathcal{M} is then said to be finitely generated if \\\\mathcal{N} = \\\\langle A \\\\rangle^\\\\mathcal{M} for some finite subset A \\\\subseteq M. The age of \\\\mathcal{M}, denoted \\\\operatorname{Age}(\\\\mathcal{M}), is the class of all finitely generated substructures of \\\\mathcal{M}. One can prove that any class \\\\mathbf{K} that is the age of some structure satisfies the following two conditions: Hereditary property (HP) : If A \\\\in \\\\mathbf{K} and B is a finitely generated substructure of A, then B is isomorphic to some structure in \\\\mathbf{K}. Joint embedding property (JEP) : If A, B \\\\in \\\\mathbf{K}, then there exists C \\\\in \\\\mathbf{K} such that both A and B are embeddable in C.  Fra√Øss√©'s theorem  A commutative diagram illustrating the amalgamation property. As above, we noted that for any \\\\mathcal{L}-structure \\\\mathcal{M}, \\\\operatorname{Age}(\\\\mathcal{M}) satisfies the HP and JEP. Fra√Øss√© proved a sort-of-converse result: when \\\\mathbf{K} is any non-empty, countable set of finitely generated \\\\mathcal{L}-structures that has the above two properties, then it is the age of some countable structure. Furthermore, suppose that \\\\mathbf{K} happens to satisfy the following additional properties. Amalgamation property (AP) : For any structures A, B, C \\\\in \\\\mathbf{K}, such that there exist embeddings f: A \\\\to B, g: A \\\\to C, there exists a structure D \\\\in \\\\mathbf{K} and embeddings f': B \\\\to D, g': C \\\\to D such that f' \\\\circ f = g' \\\\circ g (i.e. they coincide on the image of A in both structures). Essential countability (EC) : Up to isomorphism, there are countably many structures in \\\\mathbf{K}. In that case, we say that K is a Fra√Øss√© class, and there is a unique (up to isomorphism), countable, homogeneous structure \\\\operatorname{Flim}(\\\\mathbf{K}) whose age is exactly \\\\mathbf{K}. This structure is called the Fra√Øss√© limit of \\\\mathbf{K}. Here, homogeneous means that any isomorphism \\\\pi: A \\\\to B between two finitely generated substructures A, B \\\\in \\\\mathbf{K} can be extended to an automorphism of the whole structure.  Examples  The archetypal example is the class \\\\mathbf{FCh} of all finite linear orderings, for which the Fra√Øss√© limit is a dense linear order without endpoints (i.e. no smallest nor largest element). Up to isomorphism, this is always equivalent to the structure \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{Q}, < \\\\rangle, i.e. the rational numbers with the usual ordering. As a non-example, note that neither \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{N}, < \\\\rangle nor \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{Z}, < \\\\rangle are the Fra√Øss√© limit of \\\\mathbf{FCh}. This is because, although both of them are countable and have \\\\mathbf{FCh} as their age, neither one is homogeneous. To see this, consider the substructures \\\\big\\\\langle \\\\\\\\{ 1, 3 \\\\\\\\}, < \\\\big\\\\rangle and \\\\big\\\\langle \\\\\\\\{ 5, 6 \\\\\\\\}, < \\\\big\\\\rangle, and the isomorphism 1 \\\\mapsto 5,\\\\ 3 \\\\mapsto 6 between them. This cannot be extended to an automorphism of \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{N}, < \\\\rangle or \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{Z}, < \\\\rangle, since there is no element to which we could map 2, while still preserving the order. Another example is the class \\\\mathbf{Gph} of all finite graphs, whose Fra√Øss√© limit is the Rado graph.  œâ-categoricity  Suppose our class \\\\mathbf{K} under consideration satisfies the additional property of being uniformly locally finite, which means that for every n, there is a uniform bound on the size of an n-generated substructure. This condition is equivalent to the Fra√Øss√© limit of \\\\mathbf{K} being œâ-categorical. For example, the class of finite dimensional vector spaces over a fixed field is always a Fra√Øss√© class, but it is uniformly locally finite only if the field is finite.

(2019). AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway (taxonomic information republished from AlgaeBase with permission of M.D. Guiry). Halosaccion glandiforme (S.G.Gmelin) Ruprecht, 1850. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=372579 on 2019-12-29 It was first described to science by S. G. Gmelin in 1768, in what is arguably the first book to focus on marine biology, Historia Fucorum. Franz Josef Ruprecht is responsible for the current taxonomic description. The type specimen was collected in Kamchatka, Russia.  Description  Halosaccion glandiforme The thallus, or body, of this algae is a hollow, torpedo-shaped sac. This ellipsoid shape has low drag through the water allowing the algae to inhabit areas with significant wave and current energy. The sac is reddish- purple to yellowish-brown in color. It can be as long as , but is usually shorter. The sac can be up to in diameter. The sac wall is up to thick. There are 5 to 15 small pores in the thallus that allow sea water into and out of the sac. These pores are to in diameter. When submerged, the elasticity of the sac walls draws water into the thallus through the pores. Rapid photosynthesis produces a small oxygen bubble inside the sac which holds it toward the surface and the energy of the sun. The sac tapers to a short stipe, or stem, that connects to a small, disc-shaped holdfast which anchors the algae to the bottom. The stipe is relatively weak, but sufficient to anchor the algae given the low drag of the thallus. When the tide goes out, the algae desiccates in the open air. Water from the sac leaks out of the pores, keeping the thallus cool and moist. As the water leaks away, the sac deflates and may appear flattened. While a deflated sac will perish in the sun within three hours, sacs that are water-filled when the tide goes out remain moist and cool, surviving until the next tide covers them. Older sea sacs sometimes have their tips abraded away, leaving them without their internal supply of water.  Distribution and habitat  Sea sacs are widely distributed in the north Pacific Ocean. The species is found from the Russian Far East to the Bering and Chukchi Seas, the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska and south along the coast of North America to Point Conception, California. Sea sacs are found in Puget Sound. This is a shallow water species growing in the low to middle intertidal zone. It usually grows on rock, showing a very marked preference for the rough, exposed points of rock rather than the cracks and valleys in rock. It may also grow on algae, including Corallina vancouveriensis and Neorhodomela larix. It will grow in areas that are exposed to waves and in semi-protected areas.  Life history  This algae is an annual, appearing in the Spring and degenerating in the Fall. It has a complex reproductive strategy. The obvious sea sacs that are seen in the intertidal zone are a mix of male gametophytes and asexual tetrasporophytes. They appear to be identical, but close examination reveals the thalli of the tetrasporophytes to be dotted with the red tetraspores. The female gametophyte is microscopic and unlikely to be noticed outside of a laboratory. The reproductive cycle of sea sacs proceeds as follows: # The mature male gamtophyte produces its gametes, spermatia, on the surface of its thallus. These are released into the sea in strands of mucus in summer. The mature female gametophore has a carpogonium containing its genetic material and two hair-like trichogynes, which capture the sprematia prior to fertilization. Given the almost immediate maturity of the female, and the over-wintering of the male gametophore, females are fertilized by the previous generation's males. Once fertilized, the zygote develops into a small disc that grows into the asexual tetrasporopyhte at the start of the next spring. #The tetrasporophyte has spore producing bodies, sporangia, on the surface of its thallus. Each sporangia produces four spores through meiosis. The spores are released in summer. When these spores germinate, they become two male and two female gametophytes. The males divide repeatedly, each creating a disc from which a new male sea sac will mature at the start of the next spring. The female gametophytes mature very rapidly, within 24 hours of germination. Sea sacs generate all their energy from photosynthesis. They are eaten by limpets and the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis. They are edible by humans, either raw or in soups. Small amphipods may chew their way into a sac and live there, safe from predators.

However, little is known about his activities in the diocese; he likely spent a lot of time in Vilnius and not in Samogitia. In 1569, together with other bishops, he signed the Union of Lublin. He supported reconstruction of the Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard in Vilnius and bequeathed religious paintings from Holland, liturgical objects and robes to Varniai Cathedral. In his last will, Petk≈´nas left 1,700 kopas of Lithuanian groschens to send twelve students to the Jesuit Academy in Vilnius. The money was used by his successor Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis to construct a house in Vilnius for Samogitian clerics. In 1573, Petk≈´nas promoted his nephew Petras Petk≈´nas, ordained only as an acolyte, to a canon of the cathedral chapter in Varniai and gave him parishes in Betygala and Viduklƒó. However, Petras Petk≈´nas neglected his parishes and frequently lived in Vilnius. Petk≈´nas died in 1574 and was buried in a crypt of the Varniai Cathedral. Evaluation In letters of Cardinal Michele Bonelli, before his appointment as bishop, Petk≈´nas was evaluated as having two undesirable traits ‚Äì relatively low birth and enjoying alcohol more than what would be appropriate for a bishop. Petk≈´nas was ridiculed in In quendam antistitem, a Latin poem by , a Spaniard working in Vilnius, for neglecting his duties and spending his time hunting. The poem was quoted by Bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius in his influential history of the Diocese of Samogitia. Valanƒçius also quoted Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz who claimed that at the time of Petk≈´nas, the diocese was so neglected that it had just seven priests. This evaluation persisted in historiography, but according to Lithuanian historian Zenonas Ivinskis, it is too critical. According to Ivinskis study, the diocese probably had about 17 to 20 priests. During Petk≈´nas tenure, only one new parish church was built (in Kvƒódarna in 1569).

J. Glave was born in Ripon, England. After graduating from school, Glave became an administrative clerk in London, but this did not particularly satisfy him personally. He entered the service of the Congo Free State, under the control of Belgium, and arrived in Vivi on 12 June 1883. Henry Morton Stanley, King Leopold's colonial agent in the Congo, was impressed by the young Glave.M. Coosemans: \\"Edward James Glave,\\" in Biography Coloniale Belge, Volume II, 1948, columns 415-417. Stanley, who had no children of his own, later saw his foster son in Glave.Tim Jeal, Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer, Yale University Press, 2007, Glave was allowed to accompany Stanley on the expedition up the Congo river. He was tasked to build an exploratory station in Lukolela while Stanley continued. Glave built the station and managed to make good contacts with the locals. He stayed in Lukolela for two years; on 2 November 1885, he was appointed head of Bolobo station and a month later head of Equator station in Mbandaka. When his contract with the Congo Free State expired in April 1886, he returned to England on June 10, 1886. Glave then offered his services to the American diplomat and businessman Henry Shelton Sanford and was back in the Congo in 1887. In 1889 he returned to England again. Glave went to the United States where he could profit from lectures on his African experiences. In New York, in 1890, he joined an expedition sponsored by Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper (published by Frank Leslie) to Alaska and British Columbia. His participation was used for advertising by the newspaper. He was the deputy leader and draftsman of the expedition.Robert Bruce Campbell, In Darkest Alaska: Travels and Empire Along the Inside Passage, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007 . Glave's travelogues were printed in the newspaper. The following year, he took an expedition over the Chilkoot Pass. After his travels on the American continent, Glave wanted to go back to Africa, this time to report on the slave trade. With Stanley's help, he managed to convince The Century Magazine to fund the expedition for him. On 25 June 1893, Glave left London. His route began on the east coast of Africa at the Rovuma estuary. Glave managed to find the so-called \\"Livingstone Tree\\" on Lake Bangweulu, the tree under which the heart of David Livingstone is supposed to have been buried. Via the Congo, he reached Lukolela station, which he had built years earlier. He collected material for a report on the cruel conditions under Belgian rule. However, this was only published after his death, because he died on 12 May 1895 in the Congolese port city of Matadi.  Reception  Glave's writings on conditions in the Congo were well-cited by contemporary writers. Poet Richard Watson Gilder wrote of his death, \\"Hero and martyr of humanity, // ‚Å†Dead yesterday on Afric's shore of doom!\\" His account of the Congo was discussed at length by Arthur Conan Doyle in his pamphlet The Crime of the Congo (1909), and quoted by W. E. B. Du Bois in his memoir Darkwater (1920), amongst others.

(link to text from the website doubledummy.net) After graduating from Chatham House Grammar School, Whitfeld matriculated in 1876 at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated there in 1880 with B.A. as twelfth wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos and in 1884 with M.A. For several years he was a tutor and lecturer at Cavendish College, Cambridge. In 1880 he published some double-dummy problems in whist in The Cambridge Review: A Journal of University Life and Thought (an undergraduates' journal founded in 1879). His famous problem now known as \\"Whitfeld Six\\" was published in the London magazine The Field in the January 31st 1885 issue. Whitfeld's whist problems are related to the mathematics of nested balanced incomplete block designs. He wrote the article Bridge for the 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He also wrote a 6-page essay entitled Probabilities for the 1902 book Principles and Practice of Whist. In 1890 he married Ida Alberta Russell. They had three sons and two daughters.

The Vila Velha Theater is based in the Teatro dos Novos Society (, STN), the first professional theater group dating to the 1950s. The group was led by led by Jo√£o Augusto de Azevedo (1928-1979), a professor at the Federal University of Bahia. A group of dissident students, which consisted of Echio Reis, S√¥nia Robatto, Carlos Petrovich, Othon Bastos, Thereza S√°, and Carmem Bittencourt, led the creation of a permanent theater.

The march started in Northland on September 14, travelling the length of the North Island arriving in Wellington on October 13, 1975.  Background  Why We March In 1953, the government under Prime Minister Sidney Holland forced the Maori Affairs Act to use so- called unproductive MƒÅori land. Anyone who wanted could now report unused land to the MƒÅori Land Court and apply to borrow the land through an appointed trustee. The Maori Affairs Amendment Act 1967 introduced compulsory conversion of MƒÅori freehold land with four or fewer owners into general land. It increased the powers of the Maori Trustee to compulsorily acquire and sell so- called uneconomic interests in MƒÅori land. MƒÅori worried that the law would result in further alienation of what land remained. As the protests increased, the MƒÅori realized that the New Zealand MƒÅori Council , which had existed since 1962, and the MƒÅori Women's Welfare League, founded in 1951, were not strong enough to represent their rights and political demands as their previous advocacy groups. In early March 1975, a Hui (congregation) was called at Te Puea Marae in Mangere, with 79-year-old Whina Cooper present . Cooper had earned much recognition and respect over the many years of her social and political engagement among the MƒÅori and was one of the few women in the MƒÅori community recognized as a leader. The idea of a ‚ÄòMaori Land March‚Äô from Te Hapua in the far north to Parliament was discussed. The aim would be to dramatise the entire package of Maori demands and aspirations which had yet to be addressed. The march would focus on the most iconic element of Maori losses and hopes: the land. The planned land march would combine the forces of Nga Tamatoa (The Young Warriors) type radicalism with the wishes and protocols of traditionalist elders, attracting the support of Maori from both urban areas and rural Marae throughout the country. The march was to be focused on the ‚Äòtwin themes of landlessness and cultural loss‚Äô. The following four months were used for planning and fundraising. In August all preparations were made and support and accommodation provided at the various marae .  The March  MƒÅori Land March crossing Auckland Harbour Bridge Fifty marchers left Te HƒÅpua in the far north on 14 September for the 1000-km walk to Wellington. Led by 79-year-old Cooper, the hƒ´koi quickly grew in strength. As it approached towns and cities, local people joined to offer moral support. The marchers stopped overnight at different Marae, on which Cooper led discussions about the purpose of the march. Leaflets were distributed explaining why the march was required titled 'Why We March.' Route of March The march, accompanied by two trucks and a bus, led in 29 days from Te Hapua; Kaitaia; Mangamuka; Otiria; Hikurangi; Waipu; Wellsford; Orewa; Auckland; NgƒÅruawƒÅhia; Kihikihi; Te Kuiti; Taumarunui; Raetihi; Whanganui; Ratana; Palmerston North; Shannon, New Zealand; ≈åtaki, New Zealand; Porirua to Wellington.  Impact  Upon arriving at Parliament, Whina Cooper presented a petition signed by 60,000 people from around New Zealand to Prime Minister Bill Rowling. The petition called for an end to monocultural land laws which excluded MƒÅori cultural values, and asked for the ability to establish legitimate communal ownership of land within iwi. The hikoi represented a watershed moment in the burgeoning MƒÅori cultural renaissance of the 1970s. It brought unprecedented levels of public attention to the issue of alienation of MƒÅori land, and established a method of protest that was repeatedly reused in the following decades, such as the occupation of the land at Bastion Point. This action brought treaty issues to public attention more strongly than at any time since the 19th century.

In its first formation in the far north it had an unusual shtat (table of organization and equipment) probably to facilitate its movement in the roadless tundra and forests of that region. During the Winter War against Finland it saw action in the fighting around Salla. Its organization again proved beneficial in the spring of 1942 during the first stages of the Great Patriotic War. It played a large role in holding and then pushing back the Finnish III Army Corps during Operation Silver Fox and for this success was redesignated as the 23rd Guards Rifle Division. A new 88th began forming in April, 1942 based on the first formation of the 39th Rifle Brigade, mostly in the Moscow Military District and was soon assigned to the 31st Army of Western Front; it would remain in that Army for the duration of the war. It took part in the savage and mostly fruitless fighting around the Rzhev salient into the winter of 1942/43 and then in the summer offensive that liberated Smolensk. During the following fall it became badly depleted as Western Front repeatedly attempted to batter its way through the German defenses to Orsha. After rebuilding in the spring of 1944 it served as part of 3rd Belorussian Front during Operation Bagration, soon being awarded a battle honor as well as the Order of the Red Banner. During this offensive it reached the border of East Prussia and won a second decoration in the unsuccessful Gumbinnen-Goldap Operation. During the East Prussian Offensive in January, 1945 it made steady progress, eventually earning its third Order after the battle for the Heiligenbeil Pocket. After the East Prussian campaign the 31st Army was railed south to Czechoslovakia where the 88th ended the war marching on Prague. Despite a fine record as a fighting unit the division was soon disbanded. 1st Formation The 88th Rifle Division began forming for the first time on the day the war began in Europe, September 1, 1939 at Arkhangelsk in the Arkhangelsk Military District. During November it was transported across the White Sea to Belomorsk. By December 1 the division was developing a two-pronged attack on Salla in cooperation with the 122nd Rifle Division. The intermediate objective was the town of Kemij√§rvi en route to Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland. By December 17 the 122nd Division was less than 30km from the former when it was struck by Finnish counterattacks and forced to retreat on some sectors. As the 88th came up it was fed into the fighting piecemeal with little result. By the end of the month the two Soviet divisions were hard-pressed to hold the ground they had gained and under fresh attacks beginning on January 2, 1940 were forced back to a line of ridges 3km west of M√§rk√§j√§rvi. There they dug in and remained for the duration of the war.William. M. Trotter, A Frozen Hell, Workman Publishing, New York, NY, 1991, pp. 53-54, 179-80 Maj. Gen. Andrei Ivanovich Zelentsov took command of the division on June 14, 1940. As of June 22, 1941 the division's order of battle was as follows: * 426th Rifle Regiment * 611th Rifle Regiment * 758th Rifle Regiment * 401st Light Artillery Regiment * 269th Antitank Battalion * 147th Reconnaissance Battalion * 222nd Sapper Battalion * 221st Signal BattalionCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. VIII, Nafziger, 1996, p. 47 * 368th Mortar Battalion (until October 16, 1941) * 288th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 128th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company * 184th Motor Transport Battalion * 154th Field Bakery * 189th Field Artillery Remount Workshop * 191st Field Postal Station * 373rd Field Office of the State Bank Zelentsov also served as the acting commander of Arkhangelsk Military District from June 27 to July 5. The division remained near Arkhangelsk until the beginning of August, when it was shipped across the White Sea to Murmansk. Sharp states that it's possible the 88th had a special organization for operations in the roadless arctic terrain because it did not have a howitzer regiment and when it was disembarked from 10 small transports from August 9‚Äì14 it had just 7,818 personnel on strength with 58 artillery pieces of all calibres, 22 trucks and 1,928 horses in total. It also had a full reconnaissance battalion versus the standard company. This does not match any prewar shtat but appears to be a lightly-armed organization utilizing horse packing for most of its transport needs.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 47 The German-Finnish Operation Silver Fox had begun on July 1 with the goal of cutting the Murmansk railway and on August 7 the Finnish III Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Hjalmar Siilasvuo, captured Kestenga. By now he was 65 km short of his objective of Loukhi. The Soviet 14th Army sent in a group of reserves known as the Grivnik Brigade which slowed the Finnish drive. At this point the 88th joined the Kemskaya Operations Group and took over defense of the Kestenga-Loukhi road, one of the few avenues of operation in this mostly trackless wilderness. On August 15, while leading the division as it attempted to establish defensive positions along the Sofiangi River, General Zelentsov was killed in a German air attack; he was replaced five days later by Col. Vladimir Aleksandrovich Solovyov.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. & trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, p. 37 By this time the Finnish forces were exhausted and on August 25 General Siilasvuo called a halt to regroup.John R. Elting, Battles for Scandinavia, Time-Life Books Inc., Chicago, IL, 1981, p. 127 After being reinforced by units of the German XXXVI Mountain Corps the Finns resumed their offensive on October 30. The 88th Division had also been reinforced and had had time to improve its positions. Despite this the attackers made progress and by November 6 two battalions of the 426th Rifle Regiment and a company of the 611th Regiment were fighting in encirclement. The next day two Finnish and one German battalion that had earlier infiltrated between the two Regiments were driven back 45 km along the Kestenga-Loukhi road by other Soviet forces. On November 9 the encircled battalions of the 426th, low on ammunition and without food, were forced to break out; only 275 men returned to friendly lines. On November 16 the offensive subsided, in part due to heavy casualties on the Axis side but also due to diplomatic pressure from the United States government which threatened consequences for Finland if its supply deliveries to the USSR were interrupted. However this might have been, the division was credited with stopping the Finnish drive and largely in recognition of this it was redesignated as the 23rd Guards Rifle Division on March 17, 1942, one of only two Guards divisions created (the other being the 10th Guards Rifle) in the Arctic.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 47 On February 22, 1943 two soldiers of the division would be posthumously made Heroes of the Soviet Union for their roles in the November battles. Krasnoarmeets Mikhail Egorovich Rodionov had been a machinegunner in the 2nd Battalion of the 426th Rifle Regiment. While fighting in encirclement Rodionov helped to drive off seven enemy attacks with his fire, despite being wounded. Following a second wound he lost consciousness; when he revived he killed himself with a grenade before being captured.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4723.

On November 24, while fighting for the railway station on the Loukhi-Kastenga line his battalion was surrounded by enemy tanks and infantry. In order to help his comrades to break through to friendly lines Luzan called in artillery fire on his own position. Soon after, as SS troops were breaking into his dugout, he blew up himself and his radio with a grenade, taking several attackers with him.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4609.

Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 83 It was formed from the Alma-Ata and Fruzensk Rifle-Machine gun Schools, largely with students of Kazakh nationality. In December the brigade was shipped north and by January 1, 1942 was in the reserves of Northwestern Front, under command of Col. V. G. Noziyak. It was then assigned to 4th Shock Army taking part in the Toropets-Kholm Offensive and on January 21 was one of the units recognized for its role in the liberation of Toropets and the capture of the German supply base there. By the end of the month 4th Shock came under command of Kalinin Front and the brigade remained in the Toropets salient to the west of the German-held Rzhev salient until April when it was pulled back well east of Moscow where it was disbanded to form the cadre for the new 88th Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, pp. 25-26 Although it physically formed in the Urals the new 88th Division, based on an existing cadre, was very soon assigned to the Moscow Military District.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, p. 111 Its order of battle was similar to that of the 1st formation: * 426th Rifle Regiment * 611th Rifle Regiment * 758th Rifle Regiment * 401st Artillery Regiment * 269th Antitank Battalion * 222nd Sapper Battalion * 147th Reconnaissance Company * 221st Signal CompanySharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol.

Andrei Filippovich Bolotov was assigned to command of the division on the day it began forming. In June it was assigned to the 4th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and then in July to 31st Army in Western Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 134, 145 =Battles for Rzhev= Western Front began its part in the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation on August 4. A powerful artillery preparation reportedly knocked out 80 percent of German weapons, after which the German defenses were penetrated on both sides of Pogoreloe Gorodishche and the 31st Army's mobile group rushed through the breaches towards Zubtsov. By the evening of August 6 the breach in the German 9th Army's front had expanded up to 30 km wide and up to 25 km deep. The following day the STAVKA appointed Army Gen. G. K. Zhukov to coordinate the offensives of Western and Kalinin Fronts; Zhukov proposed to liberate Rzhev with 31st and 30th Armies as soon as August 9. However, heavy German counterattacks, complicated by adverse weather soon slowed the advance drastically. On August 23 the 31st Army, in concert with elements of the 29th Army, finally liberated Zubtsov. While this date is officially considered the end of the offensive in Soviet sources, in fact bitter fighting continued west of Zubtsov into mid-September. At dawn on September 8, 29th and 31st Armies went on a determined offensive to seize the southern part of Rzhev. Despite resolute attacks through the following day against the German 161st Infantry Division the 31st made little progress. It suspended its attacks temporarily on September 16 but resumed them with three divisions, including the 88th, on its right flank on September 21‚Äì23 with similar lack of success. Over the course of the fighting from August 4 to September 15 the Army suffered a total of 43,321 total losses in personnel.Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 74, 82-83, 85-87, 94-95, 99 In the planning for Operation Mars a directive was sent on September 28/29 from the command of Western Front to 31st Army, \\"consisting of the 88th, 239th, 336th and 20th Guards Rifle Divisions, the 32nd and 145th Tank Brigades... [to advance] along the Osuga, Artemovo, and Ligastaevo axis.\\" The offensive finally began on November 25 when the Army's shock group, consisting of the above forces minus the 20th Guards, attacked the German 102nd Infantry Division. That division's history recorded:In three days of fighting the tank brigades were decimated and the rifle divisions suffered heavy losses, up to 50 percent on the first day alone.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 43, 475 The Army then went over to the defense. On December 11 it went back to the attack, in support of 20th Army. These attacks continued until the 18th. In February, 1943 the armies of Western and Kalinin Fronts began preparing for what would become the Rzhev-Vyasma Offensive Operation. 31st Army was to be prepared to attack by February 20‚Äì21. In the event these plans were delayed and eventually superseded when German 9th Army launched Operation B√ºffel on March 1 and began its phased withdrawal from the salient, pursued by 31st and other armies through the rest of the month.Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, pp. 111-12, 117, 129, 135-37 Into Western Russia and Belarus In June the 88th was assigned to the new 45th Rifle Corps, along with the 220th and 331st Rifle Divisions.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 160 On August 7, the first day of Operation Suvorov, the only real Soviet success was achieved by 31st Army against XXXIX Panzer Corps in the Yartsevo sector. The main effort was made by the 36th and 45th Corps, the latter of which had the 220th and 331st Divisions in first echelon and the 88th in second. The attack gathered steam late in the day as the Corps attacked east of the Vop River. It faced the inexperienced 113th Infantry Division which had only been at the front for two weeks. Between 1800 and 2000 hours the Corps overran one German battalion and threw another aside; an hour later an artillery battalion had also been overrun and it was clear the 113th's front was breaking apart. During the night two German regiments fell back 2 km where a main battle line was reestablished behind the 6m-wide Vedosa River. Sensing confusion in the German ranks the commander of 31st Army, Maj. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovsky, committed his mobile group to break through to the Minsk-Moscow highway just 6 km to the south. For a brief moment it seemed the 45th Corps and the 42nd Guards Tank Brigade might achieve a breakthrough.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Osprey Publishing Ltd., Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed. The attack was resumed at dawn on August 8 and gained more ground from the 113th Infantry which was now near collapse. By early afternoon the 260th Grenadier Regiment cracked after losing a key position and the 220th Division surged into the gap just east of the Vop. The only substantial reserve available to German 4th Army was the 18th Panzergrenadier Division which was ordered into the counterattack. As it arrived it could only fill the gap left by the routed units of the 113th. The next day the two Soviet corps continued to try to batter their way through the German line but were stymied by 18th Panzergrenadiers; during this fighting Colonel Bolotov was killed by German tank or assault gun fire on his command post. He would be replaced by Col. Gavrill Alekseevich Bulanov on August 12. The 42nd Guards Tanks failed to reach the highway and lost 35 tanks in the process. On the other hand a major counterattack by 18th Panzergrenadier failed to restore the original front line due to heavy Soviet artillery fire and the obstacle of the Vedosa. After three days of fighting the situation was a stalemate, but the German reserve was fixed in place.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. Within a few days the stalemate on the Smolensk front had become general. As of September 1 the 45th Corps consisted of the 88th and 251st Rifle Divisions.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 217 Western Front's offensive finally resumed on September 15 and by the end of the day Yartsevo was finally liberated. 45th Corps was transferred to 68th Army on September 18 and over the following week the 68th and 31st Armies pressed to encircle Smolensk, which was finally taken early in the morning of September 25.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. On October 9 the 88th came under the command of Col. Fyodor Trofimovich Kovtunov. During this month the division continued to advance towards the Belorussian border with 68th Army, but later that month 45th Corps rejoined the 31st Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 275 =Orsha Offensives= 68th Army advanced westward south of the Dniepr River in early October with 45th Corps to the rear, closing up to the defenses of the German XXVII Army Corps late on October 8. The 88th immediately reinforced the assault of the 159th Rifle Division across the Mereya River, forcing the 18th Panzergrenadiers to withdraw westward. The division formed a forward detachment to pursue but the German division turned back towards the east and took up new defensive positions along the Rossasenka River on October 11. The Army prepared to resume its attacks the next day, but by now the 45th Corps was marching north to rejoin 31st Army.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 66-67 31st Army also began a new attempt to reach Orsha on October 12 with 45th Corps (now including the 220th Division) serving as its second echelon and reserve. The Army was positioned astride the Smolensk-Orsha highway north of the Dniepr. Western Front's offensive began after an artillery preparation of 85 minutes but 31st Army immediately stalled without any appreciable gains and at considerable cost. The offensive resumed the next day with reinforcements from the second echelon with no better results. Over the course of the fighting from October 12‚Äì18 the Front lost 5,858 personnel killed and 17,478 wounded. In preparation for a new effort 31st Army was further reinforced and regrouped its three corps south between the highway and the Dniepr, with 45th Corps in the center; the 88th and 251st Divisions were in first echelon and the 220th in second. The attack began early on October 21 following two hours and ten minutes of artillery fire. The shock groups smashed the defenses of the 197th Infantry Division between the villages of Redki and Novaya, at considerable cost and by early evening had penetrated 4 km deep on a front 1,000m wide toward the village of Kireevo, on the main rail line to Orsha. Two brigades of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps were committed into the penetration but were soon halted by heavy German fire from the flanks. The attack was resumed the next day but gained 1,000m at most. On October 24 the second echelon divisions were committed in a final effort to break the German defenses but failed in part due to artillery ammunition shortages. The offensive was halted at nightfall on October 26 by which time the offensive capabilities of 10th Guards and 31st Army were completely exhausted after gaining 4‚Äì6 km at a combined cost of 4,787 killed and 14,315 wounded.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 71, 73-75, 79, 82-83, 85-87 In early November Western Front prepared for another attempt to break through the German defenses. The Front's first shock group consisted of the 10th Guards and 31st Armies on both sides of the Minsk highway, but by now their rifle divisions averaged only 4,500 personnel each. 45th Corps, south of Kireevo, faced the 119th Panzergrenadier Regiment of 25th Panzergrenadier Division. The 88th was in the first echelon when the attack began on November 14 after a three-and-a-half hour artillery and air preparation, but was soon stopped in its tracks due to heavy machine gun fire. The fighting continued over the next four days but 45th Corps gained no more than 400m at considerable cost. The STAVKA, however, ordered the offensive to continue, which it did beginning on November 30 after another regrouping. 31st and 10th Guards Armies were concentrated on a 12 km-wide sector from Osintori to the Dniepr, with the 31st focused on just 3 km of that with four divisions in first echelon and five in the second. In the event the attack made virtually no ground even after the second echelon was brought up, and the Front went over to the defense on December 5. The failure of the Orsha offensives was ascribed, apart from the strength of the German defenses, to a lack of training of Red Army replacements and a stereotyped use of artillery which did more to warn the German forces of attacks than to actually inflict damage. During December the STAVKA ordered Western Front to shift its efforts towards Vitebsk.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 156-59, 162, 165-71 Operation Bagration By the beginning of January, 1944 the 88th, one of just four divisions remaining in 31st Army, had been assigned to the 114th Rifle Corps with the 251st Division, but by a month later it was a separate division. In February it came under command of 71st Rifle Corps with the 331st Division;Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 13, 40, 70 it would remain in this Corps for most of the rest of the war. On February 27 General Gluzdovsky was ordered to prepare yet another assault on the Orsha axis in cooperation with 49th Army to his south. Since most of his Army was involved in offensive operations in the Babinavichy sector he only had his 71st Corps for this new attack, which began on March 5 and continued over the next four days. In the event the effort was unsuccessful at the cost to the two armies of another 1,898 killed and 5,639 wounded.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 381-83 On April 11 Western Front was disbanded and 31st Army was assigned to the new 3rd Belorussian Front, where it would remain until the last month of the war. Over the next two months the 88th got a much needed respite for rebuilding and replenishment. In the buildup to the Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Center on June 12‚Äì13 the 88th and 192nd Rifle Divisions of 71st Corps were shifted north to make room for the deployment of 11th Guards Army on the sector north of the Dniepr. When the offensive began with probing attacks on June 22 those of 31st Army were driven back by heavy artillery and mortar fire. The following day the first echelon divisions of 71st Corps broke the German defense north of the Dniepr, and advanced 3 km before being halted by increasing enemy resistance.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 139-41 During the fighting near the Kireevo railway station Sen. Lieutenant Anna Alekseevna Nikandrova, a Komsomol leader of the 426th Rifle Regiment, was distinguished for her gallantry. She used a hook ladder to help the soldiers of her company through an antitank ditch; later that day she blocked the embrasure of a German machinegun bunker with her body and was killed. On March 24, 1945 she was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1632. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved December 22, 2019. Over the next two days the 11th Guards and 5th Armies developed much more momentum along the Orsha and Bogushevsk axes, leaving 31st Army behind. Meanwhile, in the fighting around the Vitebsk salient, by June 24 the Soviets were torn by the classic dilemma of blitzkrieg warfare‚Äîhow many units to use to close the pocket and how many to keep pressing forward before the enemy had time to create defensive positions. 39th Army, which was responsible for 3rd Belorussian Front's part of this encirclement, had only its 84th Rifle Corps available for the battle for the city itself. As a result the 88th was moved north and attached to this Corps.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, p. 104Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 3 Elements of 39th Army linked up with forces of the 1st Baltic Front late on the 24th, leaving the German LIII Army Corps trapped in Vitebsk and in several smaller pockets along the road leading to the southwest. Over the next two days, as Hitler refused permission for the Corps to break out, the Soviet forces prepared to liquidate the pocket, which began at 0900 hours on June 27, preceded by a massive barrage of artillery and rockets. By noon the defenders had been broken into small pockets and during the afternoon the remnants surrendered. The German Army lost 20,000 killed and 10,000 prisoners.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp. 105, 108 For its part in this fighting the division was awarded a battle honor: =Minsk Offensive= Map of the Minsk Offensive. Note route of 31st Army.After the battle for Vitebsk the division advanced along the highway to Minsk to rejoin 71st Corps as it and the 36th Rifle Corps were consolidating the success of 5th Guards Tank Army which was operation ahead. 31st Army had been assigned a leading role in the liquidation of the defeated and mostly- encircled German 4th Army and the liberation of the Belorussian capital, which was completed on July 4.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 3 On the previous day a decree of the STAVKA read, in part:In addition to these battle honors on July 23 the 88th as a whole would receive the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the clearing of the city. =Vilnius-Kaunas Offensive= During July 5‚Äì6 the 71st Corps pursued the German forces to the west, advancing up to 40 km and reaching a line from Pershaie eastward along the north bank of the Islach River as far as Rakuv. Over the next two days the entire Front continued its pursuit in the direction of Vilnius, which was reached by 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps on the morning of July 7. At the same time the 71st Corps was overcoming limited resistance in the Naliboki forest with the assistance of partisans and reached the Berezina River by the end of the day. The battle for Vilnius would continue until July 13, but meanwhile on July 8 the 31st Army had advanced another 25‚Äì30 km towards the Neman River.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8 Hitler regarded this as his \\"line of catastrophe\\" to be held at any price.Charles J. Dick, From Defeat to Victory, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, p. 115 During July 12‚Äì13 the Army successfully pursued the German forces 55‚Äì60 km while its left flank advanced towards Grodno. By the next day most of the remaining defenders had begun deploying along the river line as 3rd Belorussian Front began preparing to force the Neman and also to liberate Kaunas.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8 That day a forward detachment of 36th Corps seized a crossing north of Grodno. On July 15 it was joined by elements of 71st Corps which took two more bridgeheads in the same area. At this point the Army commander, Col. Gen. V. V. Glagolev, was ordered to regroup his forces to the right flank and force the Neman along the Army's entire front. By the end of July 17 the 11th Guards, 5th and 31st Armies had together breached the river line on a 110 km front and repelled all counterattacks. After further gains the STAVKA ordered the Front over to a temporary defense on July 20.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8 In recognition of the 88th's success in the Neman crossing on August 12 the 426th Regiment would be decorated with the Order of the Red Banner, while the 611th and 758th Regiments would each receive the Order of Aleksandr Nevsky. Into Germany The temporary defensive was in part to prepare the Front for an invasion of East Prussia, which began at 0840 hours on July 29 following a 40-minute artillery preparation and airstrikes. On the first day 31st Army advanced as much as 15 km. On the following day the entire German defense along the Neman was crushed and the Front advanced rapidly towards Vilkavi≈°kis. However the Army soon ran into woodland and lake terrain which slowed the advance as stubborn resistance developed. The operation was generally halted on July 31.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8 =Goldap-Gumbinnen Operation= A new offensive into East Prussia began on October 16; 3rd Belorussian Front planned to drive directly from Gumbinnen through Insterburg to K√∂nigsberg. However, heavy German resistance soon stalled and even reversed this offensive. Goldap, to the south of the main drive, was soon taken, but German 4th Army committed its 102nd Panzer and F√ºhrer Grenadier Brigades to the fighting and retook it on October 25. In a surprise attack by 31st Army on October 28 the town again changed hands, but the situation soon deteriorated as further counterattacks struck home. By November 3 the 611th Rifle Regiment was surrounded and was ordered to break out to friendly lines the next night. The regimental banner was entrusted to Sen. Sergeant Andrei Nikolaievich Elgin, a squad leader of the regiment's sub- machine gun company. Elgin had the banner wrapped around his torso under his uniform before leading a team of four men out of the town along a single path through the woods and marshland to the east. When the route was blocked by a German machine gun post he charged it, throwing grenades until it was destroyed with the help of his men. Although wounded, Elgin refused to give up the banner and continued on. Later, while crossing between the lines the party was spotted by the light of flares and a German group attempted to capture it. With his sub-machine gun and grenades Elgin killed eight of the enemy but received a second wound which proved fatal. He finally handed over the banner to a rescue group before he died. On March 20, 1945 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=22932. In Russian, English translation available. Retrieved December 27, 2019. Despite the overall failure of the Goldap-Gumbinnen operation the 88th received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, for its efforts on November 14. On December 19 Colonel Kovtunov handed his command of the division to Col. Aleksey Avkcentevich Kuzenny. This officer was in turn replaced on January 26, 1945 by Col. Ivan Sergeevich Lobanov, who was succeeded on February 14 by Col. Andrei Prokofevich Maltzev. Just two weeks later Maj. Gen. Nikita Sergeevich Samokhvalov took over command and continued to lead the 88th for the duration of the war. =East Prussian Offensive= The second attempt to destroy the German forces in East Prussia began on January 12, 1945. The objective of 3rd Belorussian Front was much as before: to penetrate the defenses north of the Masurian Lakes in the Insterburg region and then advance to launch a frontal attack on K√∂nigsberg. 31st Army remained on the Front's left flank and in the early going was ordered to firmly defend the front south of Goldap. The 88th remained in 71st Corps with the 220th and 331st Rifle Divisions. The Army went over to the offensive on January 22 and by the next day the German grouping facing it was in retreat. During that day the Corps captured the important road junction of Benkheim while the Army developed the offensive toward Angerburg and L√∂tzen, advancing more than 45 km before storming the heavily fortified strongpoint at the former location. The advance continued during the following days and on January 31 the division helped to take Heilsberg and Friedland.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 120, 124, 227 On April 5 the 426th Regiment would be recognized for its role in this fighting with the award of the Order of Aleksandr Nevsky. 31st Army resumed its offensive on February 2 and soon captured the major road junction of Landsberg. However this was a crucial point for the German forces attempting to break out of the pocket that was forming around K√∂nigsberg. The 129th Infantry and 558th Grenadier and 24th Panzer Divisions launched powerful counterattacks in an effort to encircle the 71st Corps and while they were unable to break into Landsberg they isolated it for several days, bypassing to the north and south and causing considerable havoc in the Soviet rear areas. Once communications were restored the Corps continued its advance in the direction of Kanditten.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, p. 233Boris Gorbachevsky, Through the Maelstrom, ed. & trans.

On March 24 Sen. Sergeant Nikolai Mikhailovich Lazkov, an engineer reconnaissance squad leader of the 222nd Sapper Battalion, was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his work in Belarus from January to June 1944, during which time he led 96 night searches and defused 586 mines with his group. At the start of Operation Bagration, while operating behind enemy lines, his unit captured a bridge over the Orshitsa River north of Orsha and he organized its defense until relieved. He went on to a lengthy career in the postwar Soviet Army, eventually reaching the rank of colonel.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=23403. In Russian, English translation available.

It is a sequel to the 2002 film Undercover Brother.  Plot  Undercover Brother tracks The Man to his lair in Vienna, Austria, but he and his younger brother Lionel are buried in an avalanche. Holding their breath, they survive for 16 years before being rescued. Undercover Brother is left in a coma and his younger brother Lionel is recruited by B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. to aid them in their work. Lionel disguises himself as a white cowboy and befriends The Man, who has fallen on hard times and become homeless due to losing control of his company to his gay son Manson. Manson begins releasing a drug called \\"Woke\\" on the population to cause them to be hypersensitive and argumentative with each other, thereby dividing the population and installing himself as leader. The members of B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. identify the caf√© chain Resistance Brews as a front for Manson, who is putting \\"Woke\\" in the coffee. Lionel is disguised as a hipster and sent to Resistance Brews, but The Man follows him and attempts to take control of his empire back from his son. Manson ingests an ultra-pure form of the drug known as \\"Woke AF\\", causing his head to explode. The Man splashes some \\"Woke AF\\" on Lionel then escapes and sets up a chain of caf√©s known as Blak Coffee to distribute his \\"Woke AF\\".

He concluded, \\"It‚Äôs not the least bit funny, and its desperation makes it even less so. Undercover Brother 2 doesn‚Äôt deserve to see the light of day.\\" Reviewer Jordi of The Serious Tip wrote, \\"Overall, Undercover Brother 2 was very underwhelming. It was the result of many bad decisions. And I made a bad decision in buying it.\\" World Film Geek called the film \\"not so solid\\" and gave it a rating of C-, writing, \\"Undercover Brother 2 is a very unnecessary sequel that attempts to launch a new star\\".

Synopsis  The film portrays the Caracas of the time, chaotic and diverse, where immigrants from around the world meet. Libertador Morales, a former policeman who now works as a motorcycle taxi driver, must face the problems of insecurity in his neighborhood and the death of his wife, for which he is to blame. Tired of this reality, he decides to take charge of his future and becomes a justiciero, a kind of vigilante, dressing in black and using his motorcycle to take down local criminals.  Production  The production saw some troubles. It was pre-produced and filmed in 2007, a very rainy year; the number of weeks for filming had to be extended and the schedule changed because of the rain. Post-production began within a week after filming was completed, but this was stalled when Charlambidis' father died at the end of the year. Upon Charlambidis' return to the project, the projected scope of it was reduced so it could be managed; Charlambidis has said that the sound element of post-production was the hardest. Some of the original sound recordings had been lost or were unable to be used because they were ruined by the rain; re-recordings had to take place. The film's intended release was at the end of 2008, but this was not achieved because of the various struggles. Shortly after this date passed, a fire broke out at the Villa del Cine, which set the production back further.  Responses  Pablo Abraham writes that the film portrays life under the struggling Bolivarian Revolution Venezuela. He suggested that cinema in the 1970s had often depicted the reality of hardships in Venezuela, but that after the government of the Bolivarian Revolution introduced more control over filmmaking, it became hard to depict this reality in cinema. Abraham says that Libertador Morales \\"should be celebrated\\" for showing this, but also criticizes that the film does not take the opportunity to provide social criticism. The character of Libertador Morales has been described as a Robin Hood figure; the director, Charlambidis, explains that Morales is more lawful, saying, \\"sometimes I say Robin Hood because of the methods he uses, but it is not necessarily stealing from the rich, it is to return things that have been stolen to whom they belong.\\" References  External links   Libertador Morales, el Justiciero on YouTube Category:Venezuelan films Category:2009 films ","title":"Libertador Morales, el Justiciero"},{"id":"62593409","text":"DYOD (106.3 FM), broadcasting as 106.3 DABIG C Radio, is a radio station owned and operated by Prime Broadcasting Network.

The tree is located near milepost 254, approximately north of downtown Phoenix, Arizona, between Sunset Point and Cordes Junction. Background The one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) tree has been decorated annually for over 30 years and is famous around the state. Unlike a traditional Christmas tree, it is actually shaped like a bush, being nearly as wide as it is tall. Decorations include Christmas ornaments, tinsel and garland, stuffed animals, bows, flags, and it is topped with a silver star. The tree is at a point where the terrain necessitated a wide separation between the northbound and southbound lanes of I-17, and the median is over wide. The median is under the jurisdiction of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), who have said \\"that for years, no one has been able to figure out who is responsible\\". The tree is surrounded by four water storage barrels and plastic drip tubing to supplement the sparse natural rainfall in the area. The irrigation system is also believed to have been installed by the unknown tree decorators. In 2013, ADOT spokesman Doug Nintzel said people have told him that they know who is responsible but have not said who it is. The decorations are placed before Thanksgiving and removed after New Year's Day. In 2011, a former ADOT district engineer who retired in 2005 said he knew who decorates the tree but honors their request to remain anonymous. Due to the danger of stopping on the highway, neither ADOT nor the Arizona Department of Public Safety formally condone the activity in the median. There are also patriotic decorations placed on the tree for the Fourth of July. Brush fires The median is often the site of brush fires ignited by passing vehicles, and the tree has survived many of them. A fire in August 2011 was close enough to melt the tree's plastic irrigation system, but the tree was not seriously harmed even though the fire burned the surrounding vegetation and scorched some of the tree's lower branches. Some reports say the fire burned out on its own, while others say the tree was helped by ADOT employees, as well as citizens and \\"a firefighter or two\\". ADOT employees say they \\"have seen the tree somehow survive over and over again\\". The tree was saved again in August 2019 by firefighters. This time, the efforts of the firefighters received at least 150 comments of gratitude on Facebook.

While they reject the \\"anti-vaccine\\" label, they repeat messages common to other anti-vaccination groups about the alleged lack of testing of multiple vaccines, while denying vaccination was effective in eliminating infectious diseases such as polio. Scientists and medical experts have countered many of these statements, arguments against vaccination being contradicted by overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Several experts such as Paul Offit have said campaigns by groups such as the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice contribute to vaccine hesitancy, even as New Jersey's vaccination rates decline, putting the population in increasing danger. New Jersey vaccine exemptions New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice was instrumental to bringing some 400 protesters to the New Jersey State House on December 12, 2019, as legislators were debating a measure meant to tighten the state's vaccine exemption regulations. Supported by anti-vaccination activist Del Bigtree, some of the parents said they would take their children out of school rather than have them vaccinated. A call for action by the group brought an angry crowd to committee hearings in 2018 when state legislator were debating a similar measure. A 2009 meeting between representatives of the group, including anti- vaccination activist Louise Kuo Habakus, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie put the governor in political difficulty when he seemed to agree with the debunked belief that vaccines cause autism.

It begins Johannes, Dei gratia in wirziburgensi ecclesia, id quod est, dilecto suo socio et domestico Dietrico salutem et supernae Jerusalem... (\\"John, who by the grace of God is that which he is in the church of W√ºrzburg, wishes health and a sight of the heavenly Jerusalem to his beloved friend and follower Dietrich...\\") John of W√ºrzburg (Latin Johannes Herbipolensis) was a German priest who made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 1160s and wrote a book describing the Christian holy places, the Descriptio terrae sanctae (Description of the Holy Land).Stewart, \\"Preface\\" to John of W√ºrzburg 1890, pp. ix‚Äìxii. Life All that is known of John's life is what he records in his Descriptio. He says that he was a priest of the church of W√ºrzburg and he dedicated his work to a friend named Dietrich (Theoderic). The Tegernsee manuscript calls John the bishop of W√ºrzburg, but there was no bishop named John. Possibly the copyist or whoever added the description of John to the Tegernsee manuscript confused him with his friend, who is sometimes identified with Dietrich of Hohenburg, who was bishop of W√ºrzburg in 1223‚Äì24. This identification is not certain. Nor is the identification of Dietrich with the man of the same name who went on a pilgrimage around 1172 and wrote his own account of it, the Libellus de locis sanctis.. John's pilgrimage took place while the holy places belonged to the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, but before the major renovation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. He may have written his Descriptio several decades after the pilgrimage, possibly after 1200.So the early modern historians Johann Albert Fabricius and Bernhard Pez believed. His account is not entirely based on what he himself saw, he admits that he made use of eyewitness reports and in some cases borrowed from other travel guides (especially Fretellus). He probably landed at Acre, when he travelled to Nazareth, Jenin, Nablus, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jaffa, where he took ship home. His description of these places is mostly that of an eyewitness. Descriptio The Descriptio is known from four manuscripts. The earliest and longest, now Clm. 19418 in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich, dates to the late 12th or early 13th century and comes from Tegernsee Abbey. John's Latin is educated but ordinary. John's purpose in writing was to update the 7th-century description of the Holy Land, De locis sanctis, which he knew from the version edited by Bede, based on the construction projects that had taken place since the First Crusade. The text is structured around the life of Jesus and divided into seven sections highlighting his birth, baptism, passion, descent into Hell, resurrection, ascension and judgement. This structure was considered irrational by Titus Tobler, who rearranged the text for his edition. The Descriptio is the earliest western source to contain information about the different Christian denominations in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Jonathan Rubin, Learning in a Crusader City: Intellectual Activity and Intercultural Exchanges in Acre, 1191‚Äì1291 (Cambridge University Press, 2018), p. 140. It has also aroused interest for its early indications of the rise of national feeling in Europe. John was a German patriot who laments the lack of credit given to the German crusaders. In his thirteenth chapter, he writes: > Three days afterwards is the anniversary of noble Duke Godfrey [of Bouillon] > of happy memory, the chief and leader of that holy expedition, who was born > of a German family.

Her novel Cold White Sun was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2019.  Biography  Kafa Al-Zou'bi was born in 1965 in Ar-Ramtha, Jordan. She graduated from Ramtha Secondary School for Girls in 1984. She earned a B.Sc. in civil engineering from Leningrad State University in 1992. She lived in St. Petersburg, Russia for a substantial period of time, experiencing the end of the Soviet Union. She left Saint Petersburg in 2006, and now lives in Amman, Jordan, where she works as a journalist as well as a novelist, though she maintains strong ties to both cities.  Novels  Al-Zou'bi has written six novels, five in Arabic and one in Russian. Al-Zou'bi's novels are generally interested in Arab intellectual life and existentialism. * ( (\\"A Clay Roof\\")).

Beirut: Dar al-Adab, 2018. = Reception = The novels S and Laila, the Snow and Ludmilla were the subject of a symposium debate between translator Alexander Habash and the novelist Faten Al-Murr at the 2015 Beirut International Book Fair. The discussion focused on interpreting the two novels as potentially feminist texts. The literary critic Ali Hassan Al-Fawaz responded with an article rejecting the premise, describing Al-Zou'bi's writing as transcending simple political interpretations; Al-Zou'bi's novels, he argues, require a reader who will rise to the semiotic challenges of her symbolic writing. Cold White Sun was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2019. As a shortlisted book, it was one of 6 titles selected from 134 candidates. Being shortlisted comes with a prize of $10,000. Despite this international success, the novel faced censorship in Jordan. In February 2018, the Media Commission forbade circulation of the novel within Jordan and asked distributors to re- export any copies they had in their possession. The Commission declined to give a specific reason for the ban. The novel is about a young intellectual who feels alienated from the conservative society of Amman. Much of the book takes the form of the diary of an old man who was the prior occupant of his windowless room. This narrative raises existential questions about eternity and futility, and the suppression of Arab intellectual culture. The literary critic Walid Abu Bakr described the novel as a combination of the myth of Enkidu in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the myth Sisyphus, contrasting heroic and absurd models of eternity. Issue 66 of Banipal, the Magazine of Modern Arab Literature takes Al-Zou'bi as its featured author, with an essay on her literary influences, an excerpt of Cold White Sun translated into English, and a review of the novel. This excerpt is the only writing by Al-Zou'bi available in English, as of 2019.

Biography  Isaac Lumago was born in 1939. He was an ethnic Nubian, and a cousin of Idi Amin. Lumago worked as a customs official before being recruited into the Uganda Army in 1963 by British officers. After undergoing training at the Sudanese Military Academy in Omdurman, he was made a second lieutenant and posted to Moroto. He underwent additional training over the following years and received steady promotions. By 1971 he held the rank of captain, and he was supportive of Colonel Idi Amin's military coup that year. Under Amin's rule Lumago became Minister of Industry and Power before‚Äîat the rank of colonel‚Äîbeing appointed Uganda's High Commissioner to Lesotho in 1975. Operating from Maseru, he also was given responsibility for Uganda's relations with 12 other states in southern Africa. In July 1976 he was in Kenya, and he overheard Kenya Air Force officers on 4 July, discussing plans by Israel to carry out a raid against Entebbe International Airport to free hostages who were held there by Palestinian and German airplane hijackers with the complicity of the Ugandan government. Lumago and Colonel Gad Wilson Toko, who was in Nairobi for non- military reasons, managed to telephone Brigadier Isaac Maliyamungu after failing to reach Uganda Army Chief of Staff Mustafa Adrisi. Maliyamungu, who was reportedly drunk at a night club, dismissed the warning and told both men that since they were acting in civilian capacities they both should not involve themselves in military matters. The Israelis subsequently launched Operation Entebbe, rescuing the hostages and destroying a significant portion of the Uganda Army Air Force. Lumago was recalled from his diplomatic post back to Uganda later that year. In January 1977 Lumago, at the rank of general, was appointed Chief of Staff of the army and Minister of State for Defence. Lumago did little to exercise responsibility over his ministerial portfolio. At the time, he was regarded as follower of Adrisi who had been appointed Vice President. In early 1978, a political rivalry between Adrisi and President Idi Amin gradually escalated until the latter was injured in a suspicious car accident. The Vice President was consequently flown to Egypt for treatment, whereupon Amin purged his followers from the government. In April 1978, Lumago was among those officers who were deeply criticised by Amin in a public radio broadcast. Afterwards, on 8 May he was dismissed as Chief of Staff and Minister of State for Defence and relegated to inspecting the equipment of the army's mechanised regiments. In 1979 Tanzanian forces and Ugandan rebels invaded Uganda and overthrew Amin. Lumago fled from his mansion in Koboko, which was subsequently destroyed. He went to Zaire, from where he organised remnants of the Uganda Army into a rebel force. Together with other pro-Amin groups, Lumago's force invaded the West Nile region in 1980, starting the Ugandan Bush War. He eventually rose to commander of the pro-Amin insurgent group known as Former Uganda National Army (FUNA). In July 1985, the Ugandan government under Tito Okello invited him and about 1,500 FUNA fighters to return. He accepted, joined Okello's government, and consequently began to fight against another rebel movement, the National Resistance Army (NRA) of Yoweri Museveni. Lumago set up his headquarters in a hotel in Kampala from where he gave interviews and directed his troops. Meanwhile, FUNA was accused of gross indiscipline, reportedly raping and murdering civilians in the capital and other areas, though Lumago denied these charges. He also lobbied for an anmesty to allow Idi Amin to return to Uganda. Lumago's troops fought with the UNLA to defend Kampala from a NRA offensive in January 1986, but were defeated. He was forced to flee back into Zaire. Lumago still served as one of the commanders of FUNA by 1990, serving alongside Dusman Sabuni and Abdulatif Tiyua. He later became an associate of the West Nile Bank Front. Despite appeals by Ugandan government officials to peacefully return to Uganda, Lumago initially refrained from laying down his weapons out of fears of reprisals due to his long opposition against Museveni. He continued to live in exile until 1997. In late 2011 Lumago was made adviser to President Museveni for security in the West Nile sub-region. In 2012 Lumago fell ill and was taken to a medical clinic in Koboko. The clinic referred him to Arua Referral Hospital in Arua, where he was taken and admitted into the intensive care unit. His health continued to deteriorate until he died on 8 May at the age of 73.  Personal life  Lumago was Christian. By the time of his death, he had three wives and about thirty children. Lumago was a close friend of Andrew Mukooza, the last commander of the Uganda Army Air Force.
