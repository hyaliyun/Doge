It is a common resident breeder in southernmost Angola, western Namibia and western South Africa. Its habitat is Karoo and desert scrub, hummock dunes and gravel plains. Taxonomy The tractrac chat was illustrated and described by the French naturalist François Levaillant in Volume 4 of his Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d'Afrique published in 1805. He named the bird, \\"Le tractrac\\", an onomatopoeia based on its call. The first formal description of the tractrac chat was by the English publisher John Wilkes in 1817 under the binomial name Motacilla tractrac. The title page is dated 1819. The species was subsequently placed in the genus Cercomela introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. It was moved to its current genus, Emarginata, after molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2010 and 2012 found that Cercomela was polyphyletic. There are 5 subspecies: * E. t. hoeschi (Niethammer, 1955) – southwestern Angola and northwestern Namibia * E. t. albicans (Wahlberg, 1855) – western Namibia * E. t. barlowi (Roberts, 1937) – southern Namibia * E. t. nebulosa (Clancey, 1962) – southwestern Namibia * E. t. tractrac (Wilkes, 1817) – western South Africa Description The tractrac chat is 14–15 cm long with a weight of 20 g. Its tail is white with a dark inverted “T” at the tip, reminiscent of the pattern shown by several wheatears. The short straight bill and the legs and feet are black. It has a dark eye. The Namib form found on hummock dunes and at the coast has almost white plumage with grey wings and grey tail marking. The south-eastern form, found in gravel plains has brown upperparts with blackish flight feathers and tail markings. Its underparts are white. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile is more mottled than the adult. This species is smaller than the Karoo chat which also has the white of the outer tail feathers extending to the tip. It is paler and greyer than Familiar and sickle-winged chats, both of which have a darker rump. The tractrac chat has a soft fast \\"tactac\\" song and a loud chattering territorial defence call. Behaviour The tractrac chat builds a cup-shaped nest of straw and leaves on the ground, usually under a bush or shrub. It lays two to three red eggs. This species is monogamous, mating for life. It is usually seen singly or in pairs. It forages from the ground for insects including butterflies, bees, wasps, locusts and ants. Prey is typically taking in a short flight. Conservation status This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 1,000,000 km². The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

They won the Yamaha Light Music Contest in Junior category soon after forming the band. Due to some of the members being high school students at the time they were approached with a record deal they waited until those members finished high school. They made a debut on 21 September 1983 and split up on 31 December 1992. All of their single releases entered top 10 in Japanese charts, many of them making it to No 1. Fumiya Fujii, who was the lead singer and the main lyricist, went on to pursue a successful solo career. Although it was a band which produced their own songs, they were frequently regarded as just male aidoru by Japanese rock fans because of their early marketing promotion.

In 2008, Toni became the first character on the show to give birth, get married and die on screen. Creation and casting Following the departures of Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield), Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm), Kirsty Knight (Angela Dotchin), Jenny Harrison (Maggie Harper) and the axing of David Kearney (Peter Elliott), in 1998 and 1999, ratings for the show dropped dramatically in 2000 and producers decided to reinvent the show to boost audience interest. Jason Daniel was hired as a consultant to drastically alter the show, making it more representative of the social climate of the time. This included eliminating several characters, redesigning the hospital, toning down make up and clothing choices, and introducing a new cast. One of the characters created by Daniel was 'Melanie Thompson', who would be renamed 'Toni' by her debut in early 2001. Laura Hill was cast in the role. Toni was the first of the new cast to appear. In 2007, Hill took 6 months leave to appear in a play in Christchurch. However Toni's exit on screen was left ambiguous so as to appear she may have left permanently. Hill published an open letter assuring her fans that this was not the case and pressed her imminent return. Hill returned to the show in late 2007 but acknowledged that, \\"they weren't going to have too many options with the character\\". Instead of using the show as a \\"net\\" and under the desire to expand her acting resume, Hill quit the show. She cited health reasons under her resignation and stated, \\"Shortland Street’s been a big part of my professional life and a time of enormous change and growth for me. That has been great and, although I was ready to leave, it still was a passing of an era.\\" The character was killed off in June 2008 after coming down with norovirus. Storylines Toni arrived in early 2001 and quickly started a relationship with Matt (Roy Snow) though she later dumped him and moved in with Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi). After a short lived relationship with Adam (Leighton Cardno), Toni started a purely sexual partnership with senior surgeon Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). She fell pregnant and was unsure whether the baby was Chris' or Adam's. In May 2002 she gave birth to Harry (Joshua Thompson) and got back together with Adam after Chris was proven as the father. The two broke up but reconciled when Adam was stabbed, before breaking up again in 2003. In 2003 Toni decided she loved Matt and the two married while on holiday. With the arrival of Chris' mother Margot Warner (Dinah Priestley), Toni and Chris' relationship was deemed possibly incestuous but the rumour was proved wrong when Toni's brother Dom (Shane Cortese) insisted he was really Chris' half brother. Toni divorced a cheating Matt and got back with Adam, only for him to leave her later that year. She briefly dated Logan (Peter Muller) but he went psychotic and kidnapped Harry. Toni and Chris reunited in Fiji and after Dom died while trying to murder Chris, he and Toni got engaged and she found out she was pregnant. The two married in 2005 but Toni miscarried and they separated. Toni decided to try the marriage again only to nearly get murdered by Chris' mistress Greta Saunders (Meryl Maine). In 2007 Toni discovered Chris had cheated on her multiple times and having found her previous fun life with Chris' half brother Guy (Craig Parker), she fled with him, Harry (Henry Williams) and Tuesday (Olivia Tennet). Chris tracked them down 6 months later, but Toni and Guy fled and ended up nearly dying after getting in a serious car crash. Toni survived however, only suffering a burst kidney. Toni and Guy continued their relationship in 2008 however she dumps him and eventually reconciles with Chris, only to suddenly die after contracting Norovirus. Character development =Characterisation= Upon arrival, Toni was labelled a \\"good time girl\\". It was said she; \\"throws herself into the hurly-burly of a wild social life.\\" She was also said to make friends and enemies easily and despite her love of social activity, she is a commitment phobe. Laura Hill found it interesting how fast Toni transformed from a \\"party girl\\" to a hard working mother in such a short time but said it was hardly surprising following the \\"roller coaster\\" of a time the character experienced. Reception Toni was described as \\"popular\\" by producer Jason Daniel. However actress, Laura Hill stated she thought Toni had lost popularity following her final story lines.

Galliard was born in Celle, Germany to a French wig-maker. His first composition instruction began at age 15. Galliard studied composition under Jean-Baptiste Farinel, the director of music at the Court of Hanover, and Abbate Steffani. In addition to his compositional ability, he was also a capable oboe and recorder player. Galliard made a step forward in his musical career when he performed one of his original compositions. This Sonata for oboe and two bassoons debuted at one of Farinel’s concerts. Galliard earned an esteemed seat in the chamber music of George, Prince of Denmark. Later, he moved to England where he became chapel-master of Somerset House. Galliard became a familiar face in high society due to his proximity to and frequenting of the royal residence. In response to war victories, Galliard composed a Te Deum, Jubilate, and three additional anthems. Bigger and better things seemed promising following his participation in the founding of the Academy of Ancient Music. However, in the kingdom-wide competition for directorial status, Galliard could not match Handel and Bononcini. He wrote the music to the opera Calypso and Telemachus upon the request of a friend, the poet John Hughes. Despite approval from his peers, musical politics caused its failure. As a result, he refocused on his oboe performance and joined Handel’s Italian Opera in 1713 as a soloist. Galliard composed several more cantatas to texts by Hughes and Congreve. He published an opera, music to the Morning Hymn of Adam and Eve taken from John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and a large number of pantomimes which he devised under contract to Rich, the enterprising manager of the Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields Theatre. His published instrumental music includes the following: Six Sonatas for a Flute and a Thorough Bass, Six Solos for the Violoncello, and Six Sonatas for the Bassoon or Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord.

Its mission is to bring jobs and economic impact to Northeast Ohio through the growth of a sustainable media production industry. It accomplishes this goal through a rigorous program of attraction, advocacy, and workforce development.  History  The Greater Cleveland Film Commission was founded in 1998 by its first President, Chris Carmody. Early on, the city attracted several independent productions like Welcome to Collinwood, Antwone Fisher and American Splendor. However, in the mid-2000s, it became readily apparent that for Cleveland, and Ohio, to compete with other states, a tax incentive would need to be implemented to lure productions away from other more established production centers. In 2006, Ivan Schwarz, an industry veteran with over 30 years of experience as a location manager and producer, was named the new president and CEO of GCFC. He immediately recognized that while Northeast Ohio had the locations and community support to make for a great production destination, it would never be a real player without a tax incentive. Schwarz began the long process of lobbying for some sort of financial incentive for the media industry in Ohio. In 2009, Ohio passed the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit, largely due to the efforts of Schwarz and GCFC. From there, Northeast Ohio quickly became a hotspot of production activity. In fact, in the summer of 2011, Cleveland hosted four feature film productions at the same time: Marvel's The Avengers, Alex Cross, Fun Size and Tomorrow You're Gone. Since 2009, nearly 200 productions have filmed in Northeast Ohio. As of right now does not sponsor or encourage \\"YouTube personality\\".  Programs and services  =Attraction= GCFC aggressively pursues media productions and businesses that can make a significant impact on the local economy. We serve as a one-stop shop for local, national and international filmmakers, ensuring and exceptional production experience. As a result of GCFC's advocacy efforts, the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit makes our state and our region competitive with any other state. From the biggest blockbusters, to single episodes of television series, Hollywood knows Ohio can handle any size production. Notably, productions attracted by GCFC represent more than 70% of those shot in Ohio. =Advocacy= Having successfully lobbied the state to pass the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit in 2009, the GCFC redoubled their efforts in 2016 and achieved an annual increase to $40 million. The GCFC is working closely with state and local officials, as well as industry decision-makers, to enhance the incentive even more and make sure that it does what the industry needs it to do. Since the tax credit passed, Ohio has generated an economic impact of $400 million from media productions and created over 1,700 full-time equivalent jobs. In fact, for every dollar spent by the state on the credit, $2.01 goes back into Ohio's economy. =Workforce Development= Workforce Development programs are designed to provide local talent with the training, experience and professional connections to enable them to succeed in the film industry. All workforce development programs are created in consultation with industry experts and local academic partners in order to yield relevant, employer- driven curricula and training. GCFC works closely with local colleges and universities on curriculum and staff development towards that end. Current workforce programs include industry training boot camps, seminars, academic programs and networking events. GCFC's series of workshops in 2016 has been one of their best received programs thus far. President Schwarz's experience and contacts in the industry ensure our access to industry veterans working at the highest level, whose experience we can leverage to teach local production professionals industry best practices. This year's workshops included: * James Madio (Band of Brothers, Hook, the Basketball Diaries, Law & Order: SVU) beginner and advanced acting workshops. * Billy Fox (Straight Outta Compton, Band of Brothers, Law & Order) editing workshop. * Patrick Murray production financing workshop. (Senior finance and operations executive for a number of entertainment companies, including HBO, IMAX Corporation, Avenue Pictures and InterMedia. Financed, produced and/or distributed over 75 feature film and television projects.) * Entertainment Law Forum with Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association featuring LA-based attorneys Peter Kaufman and Elsa Ramo, and Cleveland attorney Ricky Volante. Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit The Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit (established in 2009) provides for a refundable credit against the corporation franchise or income tax for motion pictures produced in Ohio. The term \\"motion picture,\\" as utilized within the context of the legislation, is broadly defined and means entertainment content created in whole or in part within the State of Ohio for distribution or exhibition to the general public. The following types of products could be eligible for the Ohio Film Tax Credit: :* Feature-length films :* Documentaries (long-form, specials, mini-series, series and interstitial television programming) :* Interactive web sites :* Sound recordings :* Videos :* Music Videos :* Interactive television :* Interactive games :* Video games :* Commercials :* Any format of digital media :* Any trailer, pilot, video teaser or demo created primarily to stimulate the sale, marketing, promotion or exploitation of future investment in either a product or a motion picture my any means and media in any digital media format, film or videotape provided the motion picture qualified as a motion picture. The tax credit is equal to 30% of all qualifying Ohio expenditures (minimum spend of $300,000), above and below the line. There is no per-project cap and it renews at $40 million each fiscal year.

On 9 March 2015, the network was relaunched under History's logo and branding, while maintaining the Historia name. On October 17, 2017, Bell Media announced its intent to acquire Historia and Séries+ from Corus for $200 million, pending regulatory approval. Corus cited the two channels as not being part of the company's \\"strategic priorities\\" at this time; the deal came shortly after an announcement that Corus no longer planned to commission original programs for the two channels. On 28 May 2018, both transactions were blocked by the Competition Bureau, as a violation of conditions placed on Bell's acquisition of Astral Media, which barred it from re-acquiring any of the properties it divested in the merger for 10 years. As a result, Bell and Corus mutually agreed to shelve the sale. High-definition feed On October 30, 2006, Astral Media launched a high definition simulcast feed of Historia.

A promontory is a raised mass of land that projects into a lowland or a body of water (in which case it is a peninsula). Most promontories either are formed from a hard ridge of rock that has resisted the erosive forces that have removed the softer rock to the sides of it, or are the high ground that remains between two river valleys where they form a confluence. Throughout history many forts and castles have been built on promontories because of their inherent defensibility. The promontory forts in Ireland are examples of this. Similarly, the ancient town of Ras Bar Balla in southern Somalia, which in the Middle Ages was part of the Ajuran Sultanate's domain, was built on a small promontory. River confluences consistently provide an added defensive advantage to promontories, acting as a reliable natural moat for the enemy to overcome. The Citadel of Namur, a prime fortified location from the 10th century to this day, lies on the promontory at the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers in the Walloon capital city of Namur, Belgium. Another good example of a confluence promontory fort is Fort Pitt, an English fort during the American Revolution that had previously belonged to the French as Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. The surrounding location is known as the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A headland, or head, is type of promontory.

Australia In 1984, Geoffrey Blainey, an Australian historian and academic criticised a comment by a spokesman to Immigration Minister Stewart West of the Australian Labor Party that \\"the increasing Asianisation was inevitable\\". Blainey responded, \\"I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better\\".Source: The Age, 20 March 1984 In the 1996 Australian election, Pauline Hanson was elected to the Division of Oxley. In her controversial maiden speech to the Australian House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia \\"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\\". Hanson went on to form the One Nation Party, which initially won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections before it entering a period of decline because of internal disputes. The name \\"One Nation\\" was meant to signify national unity in contrast to what Hanson claimed as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favouring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians.

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, however, stated that Arabs in Israel should be treated equally to any other Israeli citizens and be allowed to have children just like any other citizen.Does A High Arab Birthrate Threaten Israel? A 1967 Maariv editorial suggested that Jews should be encouraged to have large families, while Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and in Israel should be encouraged to adopt birth control measures. Schnitzer also advocated for the adoption of an open policy encouraging Arabs to emigrate from Israel.Masalha, 2000, pp. 200-202. In 2003, Benjamin Netanyahu opined that if the percentage of Arab citizens of Israel rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel would not be able to retain a Jewish demographic majority, the basis of Israel's self-definition as a \\"Jewish democratic state\\". Netanyahu's comments were criticized as racist by Arab Knesset members and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. In May 2009, Michael Oren wrote an article in Commentary in which he discussed the \\"Arab Demographic Threat\\" as one of \\"Seven Existential Threats\\" facing Israel. In 2005, Shimon Peres told US officials that Israel had \\"lost\\" land in the Negev \\"to the Bedouin\\" and would need to take steps to \\"relieve\\" the \\"demographic threat\\". In 2010, Netanyahu warned in a government meeting that a Negev \\"without a Jewish majority\\" would pose \\"a palpable threat\\". In February 2014, then Israeli finance minister Yair Lapid said failure to establish a Palestinian state would leave Israel facing a demographic threat that could undermine its Jewish and democratic nature. Malaysia The Malaysian government has been accused of masterminding Project IC to alter the demographic pattern of the East Malaysian state of Sabah. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, Protestants are more likely to favour continued political union with the UK, while Catholics are more likely to favour political union with the rest of Ireland. When Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s and Northern Ireland came into existence, Protestants were roughly 60% of the population, but as a result of higher fertility rates among Catholics, their share of the population has dropped to less than 50% in the 2011 census, while Catholics numbered only slightly fewer than Protestants. There is debate over whether and to what extent this trend will continue and its possible impact on the political situation. Russia Russia fears the \\"demographic threat\\" posed by the potential for \\"large-scale Chinese immigration\\" to its thinly populated far east.Russia's Far East: a region at risk By Judith Thornton, Charles E. Ziegler, University of Washington Press, 2002, p.22 Illegal immigration of Chinese nationals is a special concern.Security and Migration in Asia: The Dynamics of Securitisation, By Melissa Curley, Siu-lun Wong, Taylor & Francis, 2007, p. 87 There were also fears of a Muslim-majority Russia eventually coming into fruition (for instance, by Paul A. Goble), though such fears have also been criticized as being unrealistic, irrational, and/or unfounded.  Sweden  Sweden's main statistics bureau, Statistics Sweden (SCB), does not keep any record of ethnicity, but about 20% of Sweden's population is of foreign background. Some immigrants in Sweden feel that they experience \\"betweenship\\" that arises when others ascribe them an identity that they do not hold. The growing numbers of immigrants has coincided with the rise of and anti-immigration political party, the Sweden Democrats, which believe in a demographic threat, especially by the rise of Islam in Sweden. Since the 1990s, polls show that people in Sweden have gradually become more positive to asylum-seekers. Recently, the Sweden Democrats have become one of the most popular parties in Sweden and have sparked widespread debate about a possible increase of xenophobia and racism in Sweden. United States Some in the United States have expressed concern about the \\"demographic threat\\" posed by migrants from Latin America, particularly Mexico, and their descendants.Keeping Out the Other: A Critical Introduction to Immigration Enforcement Today, David Brotherton, Philip Kretsedemas, Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 17 In a similar vein, in 2000, Peter Brimelow of the immigration restrictionist website VDARE expressed concern that the United States Democratic Partywith the support of the United States Republican Partyis importing a new, less white electorate that is more favorable to them.

The film stars Dev Anand, Tina Munim, Girish Karnad, Mehmood and Simple Kapadia. The film's music is by Rajesh Roshan while the lyrics were penned by Amit Khanna himself. A couple of songs from the film had become popular. Although the film is dedicated to George Bernard Shaw—with the implication that it is based on his 1913 play Pygmalion—according to Dev Anand, the film was actually based on the 1964 film My Fair Lady.https://www.filmcompanion.in/features/bollywood- features/basu-chatterjees-gentle-middle-of-the-road-cinema-was-that-of-the- people-next-door-baradwaj-rangan/amp/Comparison This film is based on Marathi drama Ti Fulrani penned by P L Deshpande, which is in-turn based on George Bernard Shaw' famous play Pygmalion. Plot Best friends and musicologists Pratap (Dev Anand) and Kashinath (Girish Karnad) make a bet that Pratap can transform any unpolished girl into a graceful and talented singer in only six months' time. Kashinath agrees that he will marry the girl if Pratap is successful. One night they accidentally take the wrong train after a party. They encounter Kamli (Tina Munim), a loud-mouthed vendor of neem branches on the train and Pratap tells her that she could become a skilled singer. At first, Kamli laughs at him, but changes her mind and comes to see him the next day, saying she will pay him for music lessons. Kamli moves in with the acerbic and bossy Pratap to become his full-time pupil. With the help of his invention the scalograph, Pratap teaches Kamli to sing classical music and play the tambura. Meanwhile, soft-spoken and gentlemanly Kashinath teaches her the culture of music, proper etiquette and how to talk correctly. Kamli's shiftless father Popatlal (Mehmood) shows up to complain about the unorthodox living arrangement, but the two men pay him off and send him away. They decide to test their protege and take Kamli to a party where they pass her off as part of a royal family. Unfortunately, she drinks too much and gives the game away. After the party, Kamli gives Pratap's secretary a month off and takes over his duties, becoming indispensable to her teacher. Finally, the big day arrives and Kamli performs in front of a large audience where she is a great success. Afterwards, Pratap and Kashinath congratulate themselves on their great success, forgetting Kamli's hard work. In despair about her uncertain future and filled with sadness that Pratap does not care for her, she fights with him and leaves. Pratap pretends to be indifferent. Kashinath, knowing his friend well, points out that he has obviously fallen in love with her and releases him from the bet. Pratap is miserable without Kamli, but he is too proud to ask her back. Just when he thinks she is gone forever, she returns to him.

She was the first great-grandchild of the Emperor Augustus. Biography =Early life= She was the first great-grandchild of Emperor Augustus and the noblewoman Scribonia, being the firstborn child of Julia the Younger, who was their only daughter Julia the Elder's first daughter. Her father was Lucius Aemilius Paullus, who was the son of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus, and grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus, and therefore a great-nephew of the triumvir Lepidus, and of a distinguished and ancient patrician family, the Aemilii Lepidi,. She may possibly have a brother named Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (6-39) who was married to Caligula's favorite sister Julia Drusilla.Barrett, Anthony, 'Caligula: The Corruption of Power' (Routledge, 1989), p.82-3. =Marriage= In her younger years, Lepida was betrothed to Claudius, but her parents fell out of favour with Augustus so the emperor broke off the engagement. In AD 8, her mother Julia the Younger (otherwise called Vipsania Julia) was exiled for adultery, like her own mother Julia. Her father Lucius was executed in 14 for participating in a conspiracy against Augustus. By AD 13, Lepida had married Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the patrician branch of the ancient gens Junia. Their children were: * Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus (AD 14-54), consul in 46, put to death in order to ensure the succession of Nero, and to prevent him from avenging the death of his brother, Lucius. * Junia Calvina (fl. AD 79), married Lucius Vitellius, a brother of the future emperor Vitellius. Accused of incest with her youngest brother, she was exiled by Claudius, only to be recalled ten years later by the emperor Nero. * Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus (d. AD 64), consul in 53, forced by Nero to commit suicide after being accused of boasting of his descent from Augustus. * Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus (d. AD 49), praetor in 48, he was engaged to Octavia, daughter of Claudius. Agrippina spread a rumor that he had committed incest with his sister, as a result of which he was expelled from the Senate and deprived of his office. He committed suicide on the day that Claudius and Agrippina were married. * Junia Lepida who married Gaius Cassius Longinus, and raised her nephew Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus the younger (50-66) after his father, Marcus, was murdered.Barrett, Anthony, 'Caligula: The Corruption of Power' (Touchstone, 1989), p.viii-ix. Junia Lepida was the grandmother of Empress Domitia Longina The time of her death is not known. She is sometimes said to have been poisoned on the orders of Agrippina the Younger during the reign of Nero, but this Lepida was evidently Domitia Lepida Minor, the mother of Valeria Messalina and the second wife of Appius Junius Silanus.

The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir.Barrett (1989), p. 81 In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus.Barrett (1989), p. 90Philo, XVIII 151 Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor.Suetonius, 24.3 Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome.Ferrill (1991), p. 121 Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death.

Óc Eo may have been a busy port of the kingdom of Funan between the 2nd century BC and 12th centuries. Scholars use the term \\"Óc Eo Culture\\" to refer to the archaeological culture of the Mekong Delta region that is typified by the artifacts recovered at Óc Eo through archeological investigation. Óc Eo is also one of the modern day communes of Vietnam. Archaeological site This map shows the locations of archeological sites associated with Óc Eo culture. It is located at the Museum of Vietnamese History, Ho Chi Minh City. Excavation at Óc Eo began on February 10, 1942, after French archaeologists had discovered the site through the use of aerial photography. The first excavations were led by Louis Malleret, who identified the place as the Cattigara of Roman merchants in the first centuries of the Roman empire.Roman merchants in Indochina The site covers 450 ha. Óc Eo is situated within a network of ancient canals that crisscross the low flatland of the Mekong Delta. One of the canals connects Óc Eo to the town's seaport while another goes north-northeast to Angkor Borei. Óc Eo is longitudinally bisected by a canal, and there are four transverse canals along which pile-supported houses were perhaps ranged.Paul Lévy, \\"Recent Archaeological Researches by the École Français d’Extrême Orient, French Indo-China, 1940–1945\\", in Kalidas Nag (ed.), Sir William Jones: Bicentenary of his Birth Commemoration Volume, 1746–1946, Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1948, pp.118-19; paraphrased in R. C. Majumdar, Ancient Indian colonisation in South-East Asia, Baroda, B.J. : Sandesara, 1963, pp.12-13. Archaeological sites reflecting the material culture of Óc Eo are spread throughout southern Vietnam, but are most heavily concentrated in the area of the Mekong Delta to the south and west of Ho Chi Minh City. The most significant site, aside from Óc Eo itself, is at Tháp Muời north of the Tien Giang River, where among other remains a stele with a 6th-century Sanskrit text has been discovered. Aerial photography in 1958 revealed that during the Funan period a distributary of the Mekong entered the Gulf of Thailand in the vicinity of Ta Keo, which was then on the shore but since then become separated by some distance from the sea as a result of siltation. At that time, Ta Keo was connected by a canal with Oc Eo, allowing it access to the Gulf.Aulis Lind, \\"Ancient canals and environments of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam\\", Journal of Geography, vol.79, no.2, February 1980, pp.74-75. The distributary of the Mekong revealed in the aerial photography was probably the Saenus mentioned in Ptolemy’s Geography as the western branch of the Mekong, which Ptolemy called the Cottiaris.Identified as such by C. E. Gerini, Researches on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia; Asiatic Society Monographs, Vol. I, 1909, pp.193, 775 and Albert Herrmann, „Die alten Verkehrswege zwischen Indien und Süd-China nach Ptolemäus\\", Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin, 1913, pp.771-787, p.784.

Remains This statue of Visnu, Hindu deity of Indian-origin religion, from the 6th or 7th century AD was found in Óc Eo and is now housed in the Museum of Vietnamese History. The remains found at Óc Eo include pottery, tools, jewelry, casts for making jewelry, coins, and religious statues.Louis Malleret, \\"Le trace de Rome en Indochine\\", in Zeki Velidi Togan (ed.), Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Congress of Orientalists held at Istanbul, 1951, Vol.II, Communications, Leiden, Brill, 1957, pp.332-347.

Roman golden medallions from the reign of Antoninus Pius, and possibly his successor Marcus Aurelius, have been discovered at Óc Eo, which was near Chinese-controlled Jiaozhou and the region where Chinese historical texts claim the Romans first landed before venturing further into China to conduct diplomacy in 166.Gary K. Young (2001), Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy, 31 BC - AD 305, , p. 29. Many of the remains have been collected and are on exhibition in Museum of Vietnamese History in Ho Chi Minh City. Among the coins found at Óc Eo by Malleret were eight made of silver bearing the image of the hamsa or crested argus, apparently minted in Funan.Lương Ninh, \\"Óc Eo – Cảng thị quốc tế của Vương quốc Phù Nam (Óc Eo – International Trade Port of Funnan Kingdom)\\", Khảo cổ học / Vietnam Archaeology, 3, 2011, pp.39-44. Óc Eo and Funan The archeological site of Gò Cây Thị, Ba Thê Óc Eo Óc Eo has been regarded as belonging to the historical kingdom of Funan (扶南) that flourished in the Mekong Delta between the 2nd century BC and the 12th century CE. The kingdom of Funan is known to us from the works of ancient Chinese historians, especially writers of dynastic histories, who in turn drew from the testimony of Chinese diplomats and travellers, and of foreign (including Funanese) embassies to the Chinese imperial courts. Indeed, the name \\"Funan\\" itself is an artifact of the Chinese histories, and does not appear in the paleographic record of ancient Vietnam or Cambodia. From the Chinese sources, however, it can be determined that a polity called \\"Funan\\" by the Chinese was the dominant polity located in the Mekong Delta region. As a result, archeological discoveries in that region that can be dated to the period of Funan have been identified with the historical polity of Funan. The discoveries at Óc Eo and related sites are our primary source for the material culture of Funan. The Vietnamese archaeologist and historian Hà Văn Tấn has written that at the present stage of knowledge, it was impossible to demonstrate the existence of a Funan culture, widely spread from the Mekong Delta through the Chao Praya delta to Burma, with Óc Eo as the typical representative: the presence of similar artefacts such as jewelry and seals from sites in those areas was simply the result of trade and exchange, while each of the sites bore the signs of their own separate cultural development. He supported the view of Claude Jacques that, in view of the complete lack of any Khmer records relating to a kingdom by the name of Funan, use of this name should be abandoned in favour of the names, such as Aninditapura, Bhavapura, Shresthapura and Vyadhapura, which are known from inscriptions to have been used at the time for cities in the region and provide a more accurate idea of the true geography of the ancient Khmer territory.Claude Jacques, \\"‘Funan’, ‘Zhenla’: The Reality Concealed by these Chinese Views of Indochina\\", in R. B. Smith and W. Watson (eds.), Early South East Asia : Essays in Archaeology, History and Historical Geography, New York, Oxford University Press, 1979, pp.371-9. Hà Văn Tấn argued that, from the late neolithic or early metal age, Óc Eo gradually emerged as an economic and cultural centre of the Mekong Delta and, with an important position on the Southeast Asian sea routes, became a meeting place for craftsmen and traders, which provided adequate conditions for urbanization, receiving foreign influences, notably from India, which in turn stimulated internal development.Ha Van Tan, \\"Óc Eo: Endogenous and Exogenous Elements\\", Viet Nam Social Sciences, 1-2 (7-8), 1986, pp. 91-101. Funan was part of the region of Southeast Asia referred to in ancient Indian texts as Suvarnabhumi, and may have been the part to which the term was first applied.Pang Khat, «Le Bouddhisme au Cambodge», René de Berval, Présence du Bouddhisme, Paris, Gallimard, 1987, pp.535-551, pp.537, 538; Amarajiva Lochan, \\"India and Thailand: Early Trade Routes and Sea Ports\\", S.K.

The plea in 1979 by Jeremy H.C.S.

Watson (eds.), Early South East Asia: Essays in Archaeology, History, and Historical Geography, New York, Oxford University Press, 1979, pp.215-222, see p.216. The eighteenth-century French geographer, Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, located Cattigara at the mouth of the Mekong (Cottiaris) River, where it is shown on his map, Orbis Veteribus Notus (The World Known to the Ancients).Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d' Anville, Eclaircissements géographiques sur la carte de l'Inde, Paris, Imprimerie Royale, 1753, pp.160-161; Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d' Anville, A Geographical Illustration of the Map of India, Translated by William Herbert, London, 1759, p.78; Atlas de d'Anville, 1786. Orbis Veteribus Notus Cattigara located at the outlet of the river Mekong (Cotiaris), by d' Anville, Orbis Veteribus Notus (The World Known to the Ancients). The Swedish yachtsman and writer Bjorn Landström also concluded, from the sailing directions given by the ancient merchant and seafarer Alexander, that Cattigara lay at the mouth of the Mekong.Bjorn Landström, The quest for India : a History of Discovery and Exploration from the Expedition to the Land of Punt in 1493 B.C. to the Discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 A.D., in words and pictures, London, Allen & Unwin, 1964, p.56. The \\"father of Early Southeast Asian History\\", George Coedès, has said: \\"By the middle of the 3rd century Fu-nan had already established relations with China and India, and it is doubtless on the west coast of the Gulf of Siam that the furthest point reached by Hellenistic navigators is to be found, that is the harbour of Kattigara mentioned by Ptolemy\\".George Coedès, \\"Some Problems in the Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia\\", Journal of Southeast Asian History, vol.5, no.2, September 1964, pp.1-14. Coedès clarified what he meant in his book, Les Peuples de la Péninsule Indochinoise: Histoire – Civilisations (Paris, Dunod, 1962, pp.62, translated by H.M. Wright, The Making of South East Asia, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1966, p.58-59): \\"Now Fu-nan occupied a key position with regard to the maritime trade routes, and was inevitably a port of call both for the navigators who went through the Straits of Malacca and for those – probably more numerous – who made the transit over one of the isthmuses of the Malay Peninsula. Fu-nan may even have been the terminus of voyages from the Eastern Mediterranean, if it is the case that the Kattigara mentioned by Ptolemy was situated on the western coast of Indochina on the Gulf of Siam\\". A.H. Christie said in 1979 that \\"the presence of objects, however few in number, from the Roman Orient\\" added some weight to the conjecture that Óc-eo was the Ptolemaic Kattigara.A.H. Christie, \\"Lin-i, Fu-nan, Java\\", in R. B. Smith and W. Watson (eds.), Early South East Asia: Essays in Archaeology, History, and Historical Geography, New York, Oxford University Press, 1979, pp.281-7, see p. 286. The distinguished German classical scholar, Albrecht Dihle, supported this view, saying: > From the account of the voyage of Alexander referred to by Ptolemy, > Kattigara can actually be located only in the Mekong delta, because > Alexander went first along the east coast of the Malacca peninsula, > northward to Bangkok, from thence likewise only along the coast toward the > south east, and so came to Kattigara.

Columbus' search for Ciamba Guided by Ptolemy, the discoverers of the New World were initially trying to find their way to Cattigara. On the 1489 map of the world made by Henricus Martellus Germanus, revising Ptolemy's work, Asia terminated in its southeastern point in a cape, the Cape of Cattigara. Writing of his 1499 voyage, Amerigo Vespucci said he had hoped to reach Malacca (Melaka) by sailing westward from Spain across the Western Ocean (the Atlantic) around the Cape of Cattigara into the Sinus Magnus (\\"Great Gulf\\") that lay to the east of the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula), of which the Cape of Cattigara formed the southeastern point. The Sinus Magnus was the actual Gulf of Thailand.Albert Herrmann, \\"Der Magnus Sinus und Cattigara nach Ptolemaeus\\", Comptes Rendus du 15me Congrès International de Géographie, Amsterdam, 1938, Leiden, Brill, 1938, tome II, sect. IV, Géographie Historique et Histoire de la Géographie, pp. 123-8 Christopher Columbus, on his fourth and last voyage of 1502–1503, planned to follow the coast of Champa southward around the Cape of Cattigara and sail through the strait separating Cattigara from the New World, into the Sinus Magnus to Malacca. This was the route he thought Marco Polo had gone from China to India in 1292.George E. Nunn, ‘The Three Maplets attributed to Bartholomew Columbus’, Imago Mundi, vol.9, 1952, 12-22, p.15; Helen Wallis, ‘What Columbus Knew’, History Today, vol.42, May 1992, pp.17-23; Edmundo O'Gorman, The Invention of America: An Inquiry into the Historical Nature of the New World and the Meaning of its History, Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1961, pp.106-122. Columbus planned to meet up with the expedition sent at the same time from Portugal around the Cape of Good Hope under Vasco da Gama, and carried letters of credence from the Spanish monarchs to present to da Gama.The letter, dated 14 March 1502, is published in Martin Fernandez de Navarrete, Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos, 2nd. edn., Madrid, Imprenta Nacional, 1858, p.430; the covering letter to Columbus is published in A. Millares Carlo (ed.), Historia de las Indias por Fray Bartólome de las Casas, México, Fondo de Cultura Economica, 1951, Lib.2, cap.iv, pp.219-20. On reaching Cariay on the coast of Costa Rica, Columbus thought he was close to the gold mines of Champa. On 7 July 1503, he wrote from Jamaica: \\"I reached the land of Cariay...Here I received news of the gold mines of Ciamba [Champa] which I was seeking\\".Letter dated 7 July 1503; quoted in J.M.

It has a passive infrared sensor, and a magnetic influence sensor which allow it to be used as a demolition munition, off-route mine or full width belly attack mine. Overview The SLAM is compact and weighs only 1 kilogram, so it is easily man-portable. The SLAM is intended for use against APCs, parked aircraft, wheeled or tracked vehicles, stationary targets (such as electrical transformers), small fuel-storage tanks (less than ), and ammunition storage facilities. When the mine is triggered, the Misznay-Schardin effect generates a copper explosively formed penetrator (EFP), which can penetrate 40 millimeters of armor at a range of eight meters. The SLAM has an anti-tamper feature that is only active in the bottom- and side-attack modes. The SLAM will detonate when an attempt is made to change the selector switch's position after arming. The SLAM is produced in three versions: * M2 - Solid green, with no labels, which silently self-neutralizes at the end of its active period (either 4, 10 or 24 hours) * M3 - Can only be used in the command detonated mode. * M4 - Green with a black painted warhead face, which self-destructs at the end of its active period (either 4, 10 or 24 hours) The M4 is normally used by units designated as light, airborne, air assault, crisis response, and rapid deployment. Modes of operation The SLAM has four possible modes of detonation—bottom attack, side attack, timed demolition, and command detonation. =Bottom attack= The SLAM has a built- in magnetic influence sensor, that allows it to be used as a full width belly attack munition against vehicles. It can be concealed along trails and roads where target vehicles operate and can be camouflaged with dry leaves, grass, and so forth without affecting EFP performance. Mud, gravel, water, and other debris that fill the EFP cup have minimal impact on EFP formation and effectiveness as long as the debris does not extend beyond the depth of the EFP cup. The magnetic sensor is designed to trigger detonation when it senses a vehicle passing overhead. For the EFP to form properly, it needs a minimum of from the point of emplacement to the target. The bottom-attack mode is active when the selector switch is set to 4, 10, or 24 hours and the passive infrared sensor (PIRS) trigger cover is in place. =Side attack= The SLAM is equipped with a passive infrared sensor (PIRS) that was specifically developed for the side-attack mode. The PIRS detects trucks and light armored vehicles by sensing the change in background temperature when a vehicle crosses in front of the PIRS port. The PIRS is directional and aligned with the EFP when the device is aimed. The side-attack mode is active when the SLAM selector switch is set to 4, 10, or 24 hours—and the PIRS cover is removed to expose the PIRS. =Timed demolition= The SLAM's built-in timer will trigger detonation at the end of a selected time. The timed-demolition mode is active when the SLAM selector switch is set to 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes. In this mode, the magnetic sensor and the PIRS are inoperable, and the SLAM will detonate after the selected time has expired. =Command detonation= This mode provides manual warhead initiation using standard military blasting caps and a priming adapter. The command-detonation capability bypasses the SLAM's fuse and safing and arming (S&A;) assembly.

The focus is on helping the children and building a better environment for the next generation. The charity was founded in 2003/4 by its President, Richard Martin, and formally launched in London in 2005, with the aim of protecting all of the children in the region – be they secular, Christian, Jewish or Muslim – from the arbitrary consequences of conflict. The charity works with a network of community-based organisations and non- governmental organisations in Bahrain, Egypt, Gaza, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Turkey and the West Bank, who sign up to the notions of peaceful co- existence and cooperation. This is known as the Coalition of Peace and is now the single largest peace alliance across the MENA. The charity acts as a catalyst for interaction and interchange, funding projects that adhere to notions of conflict resolution, child protection and a refusal to take sides. Affiliates receive a quarterly online newsletter, Peace Child, which acts as a platform for contact and exchange. Children of Peace is based in Uckfield, East Sussex, United Kingdom, and is structured around a Management Committee of Trustees, advisors and various sub-committees, including a Compliance Team, a Grants Committee and a Media Committee.

It acts as an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist with high uroselectivity (selectivity for the prostate).  Medical uses  Silodosin is used for the treatment of BPH in adult men.  Contraindications  According to European labels, silodosin has no contraindications apart from known hypersensitivity. Another source names recurring urinary retention, recurring urinary infections, uncontrolled macrohematuria, bladder stones, hydronephrosis, combination with other α1-antagonists or dopamine agonists, and severe renal or hepatic impairment as contraindications.  Side effects  The most common adverse effect is loss of seminal emission. This seems to be caused by silodosin's high selectivity for α1A receptors. Other common adverse effects (in more than 1% of patients) are dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, and clogged nose. Less common (0.1–1%) are tachycardia (fast heartbeat), dry mouth, nausea, skin reactions, and erectile dysfunction. Hypersensitivity reactions occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients. There have been reports about intraoperative floppy iris syndrome during cataract extractions. These side effects are similar to those of other α1 antagonists.  Interactions  Combining silodosin with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, significantly increases its concentrations in the blood plasma and its AUC. Less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem have a less pronounced effect on this parameters, which is not considered clinically significant. Inhibitors and inducers of the enzyme UGT2B7, alcohol dehydrogenases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases, as well as the transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), may also influence silodosin concentrations in the body. Digoxin, which is transported by P-gp, is not affected by silodosin; this means that silodosin does not significantly inhibit or induce P-gp. No relevant interactions with antihypertensive drugs or with PDE5 inhibitors have been found in studies; although combination with other α1-antagonists is not well studied.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Silodosin has high affinity for the α1A adrenergic receptor in the prostate, the bladder, and the prostatic urethra. By this mechanism it relaxes the smooth muscle in these organs, easing urinary flow and other symptoms of BPH. on Rapaflo. Accessed 2020-01-03. = Pharmacokinetics = The absolute bioavailability after oral intake is 32%. Food has little effect on the AUC. When in the bloodstream, 96,6% of the substance are bound to blood plasma proteins. Its main metabolite is silodosin glucuronide, which inhibits the α1A receptor with 1/8 of the affinity of the parent substance. 91% of the glucuronide are bound to plasma proteins. The enzyme mainly responsible for the formation of the glucuronide is UGT2B7. Other enzymes involved in the metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases and CYP3A4. Silodosin is almost completely excreted in form of its metabolites; 33.5% via the urine and 54.9% via the feces. The biological half-life of silodosin is 11 hours on average, and that of the glucuronide is 18 hours or 24 hours. (Sources are contradictory on this.) File:Silodosin glucuronide.svgSilodosin glucuronide File:Silodosin acid.svgKMD-3293, the other main metabolite  History  Silodosin received its first marketing approval in Japan in May 2006, under the brand name Urief, which is jointly marketed by Kissei Pharmaceutical and Daiichi Sankyo. Kissei licensed the US, Canadian, and Mexican rights for silodosin to Watson Pharmaceuticals in 2004. The FDA approved silodosin on 9 October 2008 as Rapaflo.  Society and culture  = Brand names = Other brand names include Urorec (European Union), Silotrif, Silorel (Jamaica), Sildoo, Silodal, Silodosia, Silofast (India) Thrupas (South Korea), Flopadex (Egypt), and Urorec (Russia).  Research  As α1A adrenoceptor antagonists are being investigated as a means to male birth control due to their ability to inhibit ejaculation but not orgasm, a trial with 15 male volunteers was conducted. While silodosin was completely efficacious in preventing the release of semen in all subjects, 12 out of the 15 patients reported mild discomfort upon orgasm. The men also reported the psychosexual side effect of being strongly dissatisfied by their lack of ejaculation.

History 1936 Map of Areas now incorporated as Glenelg East On 23 November 1947, Glenelg Council amalgamated and renamed the numerous settlements in the area to Glenelg East, Glenelg, Glenelg North and Glenelg South. Glenelg East was formed by combining Grovene, Helmsdale, Dunleath and Da Costa Park. The township of Grovene was originally part of the City of West Torrens, while Da Costa Park was taken over from the Marion District Council. These amalgamations were in accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Local Government Areas. The original residential development was the result of a block of land in the south-west corner of the West Torrens District Council area being subdivided in 1911, the subdivided area being name Helmsdale and sold for building blocks. The area was adjoining Glenelg, situated to the east of Brighton Road, west of Sixth Avenue and between the Anzac Highway and the Glenelg Tramline. Later, between 1925 and 1926 land in Dunleath, since incorporated into Glenelg East, and located south of the Glenelg Tramline to Farr Terrace, was released for residential development.The Advertiser 1926-08-26 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58526292? On being released, land was in demand with reports of 85 blocks being sold in a morning for a total of £24,067, with properties fronting Brighton Road selling for double the price of other allotments.The Mail 1925-03-25 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59711500? A second portion of Dunleath was released in January 1946 by Miss Charlotte I. Sandison, of Glenelg and the estate of her sister. Miss Sandison and her sister had inherited the land from Mr. E. L. J. McHenry son of Dr. McHenry, the original owner. As Mr McHenry had no descendants and the Sandison's family had been tenants on the property 87 years prior, the land was willed directly to the sisters.The Advertiser (Adelaide) 1946-01-17 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48686803?The Register (Adelaide) 1913-10-03 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59114214?

Early life He was a member of the gens Furia, whose origin had been in the Latin city of Tusculum. An early member of this family was Marcus Furius Camillus (c. 446 - 365 BC), who was known as the Second Founder of Rome for his victory over the Gauls during the Gallic siege of Rome. The family had declined over the centuries and by the time of Augustus they were relatively unimportant. Career Information about his early career is not known but if he had followed the cursus honorum he would probably have been 33 years old at the time of his consulship in 8 AD. This was the normal age for a man of patrician rank to become consul under the Principate as opposed to during the Roman Republic when the minimum age was 40. From this information we can guess that he had been a Quaestor (1 BC), an Aedile (2 BC), Praetor (5 BC) and a governor of a small province before becoming Consul. After his year as Consul he was named Proconsul of Africa and inherited a war against the Numidian insurgent Tacfarinas. The war proved to be a difficult one because the tribes of this region did not live in towns which the Romans could attack. Camillus then had to fight a tough campaign of guerrilla warfare against the tribes who were very adept at this type of war and would not be easily subdued. Incredibly for a man without previous military experience, he was completely victorious and was even praised in public by the Emperor and awarded triumphal honours, a rare achievement for someone outside of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The historian Tacitus wrote about him: \\"for the first time in centuries, a member of the Furius family had achieved military fame\\". Family He was the father of Livia Medullina Camilla who was betrothed to Claudius allegedly at Tiberius's instigation to reward a loyal friend; however, Livia died the day of her wedding, in 9 AD or 10 AD. Camillus was also the father of Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus, consul of 32. Scribonianus was the instigator of the first major attempted coup of Claudius' reign, while governor of Dalmatia in 42. References *Levick, Barbara. Claudius Yale University Press.

Family Born Marcus Furius Camillus Scribonianus, the natural son of Marcus Furius Camillus, consul in AD 8, and brother of Livia Medullina Camilla, who had been betrothed to the future emperor Claudius, but fell ill and died suddenly on her wedding day.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Claudius\\", 26. The Furii were an ancient patrician gens, and Camillus' namesake, Marcus Furius Camillus, was one of the greatest heroes of the early Republic, but by the first century his descendants had fallen into obscurity. Camillus' father was the first to achieve military fame in three hundred years, when as proconsul of Africa in AD 17, he defeated Tacfarinas and his allies, and was rewarded with the triumphal insignia by the emperor Tiberius.Tacitus, Annales, ii. 52. Camillus was adopted by Lucius Arruntius, who had been consul in AD 6, and whose name he assumed in accordance with Roman custom, although some sources continued to refer to him as Furius Camillus Scribonianus, while others refer to him as Camillus Arruntius. Camillus' wife was Vibidia, and they had two children: a son, who, like his father, is variously called Marcus Furius Camillus Scribonianus and Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus in different sources, and a daughter, Arruntia Camilla, known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 592 (\\"Furius Camillus\\", No. 7).PIR, vol. I, pp. 146, 147. Career In AD 32, the year after the downfall of Sejanus, Camillus was consul with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, father of the future emperor Nero.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 1.Cassius Dio, lviii. 17. The year was marked by growing suspicion between Tiberius and the senate, and the prosecution of those whose loyalty was in doubt because of their association with Sejanus. The emperor declined a proposal that he should be accompanied by twenty armed senators, and banished Junius Gallio, who had proposed additional privileges for the praetorian guard; but he also spared some of the former intimates of Sejanus, whose association he deemed harmless. Camillus' consulship lasted for six months; on the Kalends of July he was replaced by Aulus Vitellius, who finished out the year with Ahenobarbus.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 2–14.Cassius Dio, lviii. 17–20.Fasti Ostienses, . During the remainder of Tiberius' reign, Camillus' family faced increasing peril. His adoptive father, Lucius Arruntius, whom Augustus on his deathbed had described as a man fit to hold the empire, was twice accused. On the first occasion he was acquitted, and his accusers punished;Tacitus, Annales, vi. 5, 7. on the second, when he was said to have conspired with Albucilla, he took his own life, even though his friends urged that the emperor, who was gravely ill, should die before Arruntius could be tried, for Arruntius knew the character of Caligula, and felt no comfort in the prospect of his accession.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 47, 48. When, four years later, Caligula fell at the hands of an assassin, Camillus, then governor of Dalmatia, was one of those considered as a possible successor.Cassius Dio, lx. 15. However, before the senate could act, the praetorian guard proclaimed Claudius emperor.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Claudius\\", 10. Camillus, who was aware of his support among the senate, began making plans to contest the succession by force of arms. Revolt In the following year, AD 42, Lucius Annius Vinicianus, who had also been considered for the throne, sought Camillus' support. Camillus agreed to rise against Claudius, and a number of legions went over to him. He promised to restore the senate to its former authority, which gave him the support of a number of the equites and many senators. Claudius considered abdicating in favour of Camillus, but was dissuaded when he sought the advice of leading men.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Claudius\\", 35, 36. Although Camillus' army was sizeable, it contained a large number of provincials and untested soldiers, and soon fell into disarray. Suetonius describes a superstitious dread that had come over the legions that had taken Camillus' side, when they could not obtain the customary garlands and perfumes to adorn their standards, and then found that they could not remove them from the ground, a particularly ill omen.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Claudius\\", 13. Within five days the rebellion was over, although it is not clear whether the two sides ever engaged in battle. With his army refusing to obey his orders, Camillus fled to the island of Issa, where he perished by his own hand.Tacitus, Historiae, i. 89. Aftermath Within a few years after the failed revolt, Camillus' son was appointed an augur, and subsequently praefectus urbi. However, in AD 52, he and his mother were exiled, on a charge of having asked astrologers to predict the time of the emperor's death. The younger Camillus died not long afterward, some said by an illness, others by poison.Tacitus, Annales, xii. 52, Historiae, ii. 75.

He resigned from his most recent position as the head coach of Olimpia Milano in the Italian LBA after the team was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 2011 Italian league playoffs. The team then announced that he would assume another role with the club. He is nicknamed \\"The Coach\\" for his legacy in Italian basketball. Biography Peterson went to Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois He received his undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in Evanston and a master's degree from the University of Michigan. He served as assistant coach for NAIA school McKendree College from 1962 to 1963. From 1963 to 1964 he served as freshmen coach at Michigan State. After MSU, for one season, he was plebe coach at the United States Naval Academy. The next year, at the age of 30, he became head coach at the University of Delaware. In five years there, he assembled a record of 69 wins and 49 losses.Delaware Men's Basketball Coaching Records In 1971, he went abroad, acting as head coach of the Chile national basketball team until 1973. Peterson took his Chilean team on a grueling tour of the United States in 1972.Sports Illustrated article From 1973-1978, he coached Virtus Bologna in the Italian LBA, winning the 1974 \\"Coppa Italia\\" and, in 1976, the Italian League title. In 1978, he was hired as head coach of Olimpia Milano, where he won four Italian League titles (1982, 1985, 1986, 1987), two more Italian Cups (1986, 1987), a Korać Cup (1985), and one European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) title, which is the highest title in Europe for pro club basketball. In 1987, he retired after coaching in Italy for 24 years, but he resumed coaching on January 3, 2011, with Olimpia Milano. He still holds records for a coach in the Italian League playoffs, with 11 Final Four appearances in 11 years (after which a playoff format was introduced), 9 finals, 4 titles, 74 games coached, and 51 games won. On January 3, 2011, he became the new head coach of Olimpia Milano, after the dismissal of Piero Bucchi. He left in June, succeeded by Sergio Scariolo. Commentator After his retirement, he became a popular sports commentator (basket and wrestling) for many Italian television channels. Awards He received the Coach of the Year award for Europe from the WABC and the Coach of the Year for Italy twice. Following his retirement from coaching, he was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2007, Peterson was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Evanston Township High School.ETHS Distinguished Alumni In 2008, he was named one of the 50 most influential European club basketball personalities over the previous half- century.Euroleague Basketball article A poll said that he is the foreigner with the sexiest voice in Italy.Dan Peterson spinge la nuova Carife  See also  * List of EuroLeague-winning head coaches  References  External links *Italian League Coach Profile Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:American emigrants to Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in Chile Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Illinois Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens men's basketball coaches Category:EuroLeague-winning coaches Category:Evanston Township High School alumni Category:McKendree Bearcats men's basketball coaches Category:Michigan State Spartans men's basketball coaches Category:Navy Midshipmen men's basketball coaches Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:Olimpia Milano coaches Category:Sportspeople from Evanston, Illinois Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna coaches Category:American expatriates in Italy ","title":"Dan Peterson"},{"id":"11219138","text":"Tsamassi is a musical style of the Bamileke of Cameroon.

Organisation The police force itself comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whereas the National Security Committee and the Procurator General's office are responsibly for intelligence gathering and investigation respectively. From 1992 Kazakhstan became a member of INTERPOL. Its law enforcement agencies are closely tied with those of Russia, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan. The court system in Kazakhstan operates at three levels, local, province, and supreme court, and operates under a system of guaranteed legal representation (similar to that of the United States of America). There are reasons to believe that the police force is indeed corrupt as they are not paid well and they need another way of making money. As the government is corrupt the law enforcement agencies could highly be corrupt as well. Human rights allegations The website of the US Embassy in Kazakhstan notes that in 2004-2005 the Kazakhstan government's human-rights record \\"remained poor,\\" and \\"the Government continued to commit numerous abuses.\\" Observer group Freedom House ranks this former Soviet state with a 6 in Political Rights and a 5 in Civil Liberties (scale of 1-7; 1 is the highest), denoting it as \\"Not Free.\\" Political expression was reported to be restricted in Kazakhstan in the months leading up to presidential elections in December, according to observers, including Human Rights Watch and Freedom House.

While the government funding for the prison system is still seen to be inadequate, prison conditions have improved, and several outdated penitentiaries have been closed. Crime rates Kazakhstan has suffered from growing crime rates in the 1990s, with a rate of 50 crimes per 10,000 population being cited, most commonly violent crime and narcotics, (cannabis and opium in particular, it was estimated that there are 1,380 km² of cannabis plantation). The 2018 International Crime Victims Survey showed low crime rates in the country. The police are also reportedly underfunded and understaffed, in some cases by as much as 2000 officers.

In the UK, purchasing cards are usually referred to as procurement cards. Purchasing Cards are usually issued to employees who are expected to follow their organization’s policies and procedures related to P-Card use, including reviewing and approving transactions according to a set schedule (at least once per month). The organization can implement a variety of controls for each P-Card; for example, a single-purchase dollar limit, a monthly limit, merchant category code (MCC) restrictions and so on. In addition, a cardholder’s P-Card activity should be reviewed periodically by someone independent of the cardholder. Regular reviews should be part of an organization's ongoing Purchasing Card program management efforts. A variety of factors can contribute to its success or, conversely, its stagnation. There are common P-card program pitfalls to avoid, with the goal of developing success strategies that can put (or keep) a program on the right path.Purchasing Card Program Pitfalls and Success Strategies, 2010  History  Use of Purchasing cards has seen a dramatic rise in recent years with many government organizations now using them to remove “red tape” and reduce costs.Using Purchasing cards to streamline the Purchasing Process For example, In 2001 the Department of Defense (DOD) had 230,000 card holders with an annual spend of $6.1 Billion.Purchase Cards: Control Weaknesses Leave Army Vulnerable to Fraud, Waste, and Abuse By Gregory D. Kutz, Organizations typically use purchasing cards to target low value goods and services, as it offers a mechanism to do these transactions at a significantly lower cost than traditional methods. There are a variety of software solutions available to help manage purchasing card programs, in particular the electronic statements that are provided by card companies in place of traditional purchase invoices. Organizations have started to use purchasing cards as a strategic form of payment in accounts payable (A/P), in addition to the traditional high-volume, low-dollar transactions. Organizations are replacing checks with purchasing cards and automating the payment to the supplier. This is one of the fastest growing uses of purchasing cards. According to the 2005 Purchasing Card Benchmark Survey Results (Palmer and Gupta, 2007),Palmer, R., & Gupta, M. (2007). The 2005 Purchasing Card Benchmark Survey Results. traditional purchasing card transactions below $2000 grew 1.4% from 2003 to 2005. The most dynamic growth was in transactions from $2000 – $10,000 representing a 6.1% growth. A/P transactions fall within this range and can extend into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. = Statistics = According to the 2005 Purchasing Card Benchmark Survey (Palmer and Gupta, 2007) * 2003 pcard spend = $80 billion * 2005 pcard spend = $110 billion * 43% of eprocurement transactions are paid via check * By 2008 over 70% of all organizations will have a pcard program, up from 60% in 2005 The study goes on to discuss moving a purchasing card program to A/P. “The basic idea is to use the card to settle P.O.-driven transactions, like you would use ACH or check. The company captures the rebates associated with p-card transactions and sidesteps the work processing check payments involve. Although these cards currently are not in widespread use, their popularity is growing,” Susan Avery (2005)Avery, Susan. (2005).PurchasingCards Pack More Punch., from Purchasing Magazine Web site: http://www.purchasingmagazine.com states that according to the Aberdeen Group purchasing card benchmark report, best practice purchasing card programs “do not confine” purchasing to the traditional spending of low-dollar, high- transaction goods and services. These purchases include off-contract, non- traditional, non-purchase order, ad hoc, and incidental purchasing. Best practice purchasing card programs expand the purchasing card to the AP department. Issues One hurdle in the A/P pcard payment conversion is supplier enablement. This is often referred to as purchasing card supplier enablement or pcard supplier enablement. Every supplier must be contacted and informed of the payment change from check to the purchasing card, even if the supplier is already a purchasing card supplier. Some banks offer help in the conversion process (purchasing card supplier enablement) and other software companies provide technology to make the conversion efficient and easy for the financial institution, client, and supplier. According to a joint industry survey,2010 Survey: Suppliers Acceptance of Card Payments “In terms of impeding an organization’s card program growth, 61% of end-user respondents reported that suppliers’ resistance to (or non-acceptance of) card payments is, at a minimum, somewhat of a problem. Not surprising, the transaction acceptance fee factor is overwhelmingly the number-one reason suppliers give end-users for resisting or not accepting card payments. Further, nearly 50% of respondents stated they sometimes or frequently encounter suppliers that impose a surcharge in conjunction with card acceptance. End-users employ varying approaches in response to the challenges; for example, educating suppliers on the benefits of card payments—a task that is often completed by program management and/or procurement staff.\\"  References  Category:Business terms Category:Accounts payable Category:Procurement ","title":"Purchasing card"},{"id":"11219204","text":"FC Spartak Nizhny Novgorod were a Russian football club based in Nizhny Novgorod.

It consists of one larger island, called Vela or Velika ('Great') Palagruža, and a smaller one, Mala ('Little') Palagruža, as well as a dozen nearby rocks and reefs composed of dolomite. All the main islets are in the form of steep ridges. The place is some south of Split, Croatia, and east of the Gargano peninsula, Italy. It is visible from land only from other remote islands of Italy and Croatia. Palagruža is further south than the mainland peninsula of Prevlaka, making it the southernmost point of the Republic of Croatia. It is uninhabited, except by lighthouse staff and occasional summer tourists. It can be reached only by a chartered motorboat, requiring a journey of two to three hours from the island of Korčula. Name The place is known in Italian as Pelagosa, derived from Ancient Greek Pelagousae (, 'sea'). This is the source of the current Croatian name, as well as of the name of pelagosite. Gruž also means 'ballast' in Croatian, and the term is therefore well known in two ways to seafarers. Legend and history For some, Palagruža is associated with the Homeric hero Diomedes, King of Argos, who is reputed to be buried here, though it is hard to imagine where. Speculation is fueled by the discovery of a painted 6th- century BC Greek potsherd with the name Diomed[es] on it (see image on Adriatica), making a shrine by the Cult of Diomedes on Palagruža seem plausible. Authentic archaeological finds of the Neolithic, Greek, Roman, and early medieval periods have been recorded. It is recorded that the galley- fleet of Pope Alexander III landed on Palagruža on 9 March 1177. In the 15th and 16th centuries, there was a rise in fishing in the area, making the island the centre of a traditional fishing-ground of the community of Komiža, island of Vis, Croatia. Palagruža is closer to Italy than to the Croatian mainland, being some from Monte Gargano. Before 1861, it belonged to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and after 1861 therefore to the Kingdom of Italy, but was unilaterally occupied by Austria-Hungary in 1873, without any declaration of war. The first action of the new authorities was to build the important lighthouse mentioned above, in 1875. After Italy's entry into the First World War, the country's armed forces occupied the island. Italy's Regia Marina submarine Nereide was sunk there on the 5th of August 1915 by Austria- Hungary's Imperial and Royal War Navy submarine U-5. It reverted to Italy between the two World Wars, as part of the Province of Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), and was ceded to Yugoslavia in 1947. Since the break-up of Yugoslavia, it has formed part of the sovereign country of Croatia. Topography, economy and ecology Vela Palagruža is some long and wide. The highest point of the archipelago, on Vela Palagruža (), is about above sea level, and on this elevation is a lighthouse.Lighthouses-Croatia.com Palagruza Palagruža is surrounded by dangerous waters, and landing can be difficult. It is uninhabited, except by lighthouse staff and by summer tourists who occupy two units of residential accommodation.Croatia Traveller.com Southern Dalmatia-Palagruza There is one beach of golden sand. The lighthouse is also the site of a meteorological station. Other important islands in this archipelago are Mala Palagruža (), Galijula () and Kamik od Tramuntane () Palagruža sits in the heart of fish-rich seas, including spawning grounds of sardines. It is a nature reserve, and the small amount of vegetation is of the Mediterranean type, for instance oleander (Nerium oleander) and tree spurge (Euphorbia dendroides). There are endemic plant species including a type of knapweed, Centaurea friderici Vis. (Palagruška zečina ). The algae, and their role in the production of the local mineral pelagosite, have been the subject of academic study (Montanari et al. 2007). The distinctive local fauna, including the black lizard now classed as Podarcis melisellenis ssp. fiumana and the related Podarcis sicula ssp. pelagosana (primorska gušterica in Croatian), was mentioned first by Babić and Rössler (1912). Geology Velika Palagruža is an apical part of subsurface geological complex, composed of carbonate, siliciclastic and evaporite rocks of different ages, ranging from Triassic (approx. 220 mil. years ago), through Miocene (approx. 10 mil. years ago), to Quaternary (recent deposition). Climate Palagruža has a weather station, established in 1894, which represents a major indicator of weather, especially wind, waves and precipitation on the open Adriatic. Weather conditions on the central Adriatic are dictated by movements of low-pressure area, which causes frequent changes of bora and scirocco (jugo) winds. Annually, Palagruža Island has 104 days with strong (6-7 Bf), and 21 days with stormy winds (>8 Bf). Due to its remote position in the middle of the sea, Palagruža exhibits more Mediterranean climate features than the Croatian coast. Summers are sunny and dry, while most of the rain falls in winter months. There are 2620 sunshine hours annually (1961–1990 average). Annual precipitation level of is the lowest of all Croatia. Maritime winds temper air temperatures compared with the mainland, with average summer daily highs of ; on the other extreme, winter average daily lows are .

Gazella granti) is a species of gazelle distributed from northern Tanzania to South Sudan and Ethiopia, and from the Kenyan coast to Lake Victoria. Its Swahili name is swala granti.Grant's Gazelle, Out of Africa It was named for a 19th-century British explorer, Lt Col Grant. Taxonomy and genetics Grant's gazelle is more genetically related to Soemmerring's gazelle (N. soemmerringii) and Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) with Soemmering's gazelle being the closest relative of the two species. Grant's gazelle shows high genetic variation among its populations, though there is no geographic isolation. The differentiation of the species may have evolved during repeated expansion and contraction of arid habitats during the late Pleistocene era in which populations were possibly isolated. Grant's gazelle was formerly considered a member of the genus Gazella within the subgenus Nanger before Nanger was elevated to genus status. Grant's gazelle =Subspecies= Listed alphabetically. * N. g. brighti (Thomas, 1901) – Bright's gazelle * N. g. granti (Brooke, 1872) – southern Grant's gazelle * N. g. lacuum (Neumann, 1906) – northern Grant's gazelle * N. g. petersi (Günther, 1884) – Peter's gazelle * N. g. robertsi (Thomas, 1903) – Robert's gazelle Description A skull of male exhibited at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C. The Grant's gazelle stands at the shoulder. The females weigh from and males from . Its coat is a beige orange on the back with a white belly. The Grant's gazelle looks similar to a Thomson's gazelle, except it is much larger and has lyre-shaped horns which are stout at the base, clearly ringed, and measuring 45–81 cm (18–32 in) long. The subspecies are segregated by different morphological characters, such as horn shape and slight differences in coat colour. These differences are not indicative of ecological separation as with some species. Ecology and behaviour Grant's gazelles at green grassland The Grant's gazelle is found in East Africa and lives in open grass plains and is frequently found in shrublands; it avoids areas with high grass where the visibility of predators is compromised. They also occur in semiarid areas and are relatively well adapted to dry areas, relying on more browse or leafy material during dry seasons to supplement their intake of water. They are migratory animals, but travel in the opposite direction of most of the other ungulates, such as Thomson's gazelles, zebras, and wildebeest, which are more water dependent. They can subsist on vegetation in waterless, semiarid areas, where they face little competition. Grant's gazelles at dry brushland The most common predators of the Grant's gazelle are cheetahs and wild dogs. Humans also tend to hunt gazelles. In the Serengeti, Grant's gazelle is a prey item for cheetahs, but the Thomson's gazelle is preferred. However, in Nairobi National Park, Grant's gazelle is preferred over Thomson's gazelle, making it an important resource to the cheetah. Jackals are major predators of fawns. Herd of Grant's gazelles The Grant's gazelle is a gregarious, territorial, and migratory species. The home ranges of does overlap with those of the bucks. Only male gazelles are territorial. Male gazelles will herd all females that cross their territories. When the females are in estrus, they are strongly guarded by the dominant male, which prevents other males from mating with them. Any doe that tries to leave is aggressively herded back. Most of the time, the buck's simple stance in relation to her is enough to keep the female from leaving. Bachelor groups are made up of adolescent and bucks not holding territory. Any new members must perform intimidation displays to enter the group. However, bachelor groups tend to be very loose and members can leave whenever they want. The larger, older males with thick horns have the best chance of establishing a territory. Conflicts between adult males are usually solved with intimidation displays. The bucks circle each other and swing their necks from side to side, displaying their neck power.Estes, R. (1991). The Behavior Guide to African Mammals, Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates. Los Angeles, The University of California Press. pgs. 75-80 Neck strength is important in an actual fight and the male that cannot keep up yields. Gazelles of nearly equal neck strength are more likely to engage in actual combat. Fighting occurs in young bucks more often than older ones. Dominant bucks can simply run off subordinates rather than having to display to them. Female and young Grant's gazelles =Diet= Grant's gazelles are generally mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats seems to be the determinant of their diets. The Grant's gazelle's diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the browsed plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, gazelles move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat red oats and small, tough plants,Cloudsley-Thompson, J. L. (1969). The zoology of tropical Africa. New York, W. W. Norton. which are avoided by the other ungulates. This allows the gazelles to survive in the brush during the dry season. Grant's gazelles eat mainly dicotyledons during the dry season and grass in the wet season. =Reproduction= Grant's gazelles sexually mature at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in bachelor groups. The courting ritual begins with a buck following a doe, waiting for her to urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus.Hart, Lynette A., and Benjamin L. Hart. \\"Species-specific patterns of urine investigation and flehmen in Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti), Thomson's gazelle (G. thomsoni), impala (Aepyceros melampus), and eland (Taurotragus oryx).\\" Journal of Comparative Psychology 101.4 (1987): 299. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days.Stuart, C. (1998). Field guide to the larger mammals of Africa. Sanibel Island, FL, Ralph Curtis Books. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence. Threats and conservation The Grant's gazelle is still a common species, despite having been eradicated in certain areas. Major threats have been habitat destruction and poaching.

In 2008, it was estimated to have 10,000 inhabitants. Plans for redevelopment were announced by President Edgar Lungu in 2019.  Foundation  Misisi was established in the mid 1960s as a shanty town or komboni located beside the Kafue Road, three kilometres south of the central business district of Lusaka, Zambia. The name Misisi came from the Nyanja word for \\"Mrs\\" which referred to Mrs Edwards, the owner of the farmland which was originally squatted. The first inhabitants lived in shacks made from mud, poles and grass roofs.  Living situation  At first, water supply was a difficulty, but as of 2014 the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) would rather connect people to the supply than risk the spread of disease. In 2008, it was estimated to have 10,000 inhabitants. Health problems result from factors such as overcrowding, bad sanitation and lack of transport and employment opportunities. Poor drainage of sewage leads to outbreaks of cholera. Lack of proper drainage also leads to regular flooding. Misisi is ranked as one of the five worst slums in Sub-Saharan Africa. While the official language spoken in Zambia is English, the people of Misisi tend to speak a number of local languages, in particular Nyanja and Bemba. Project Zambia Misisi is one of the main places in which Project Zambia works. Much of the work takes place in the adjoining St Lawrence's Centre, which houses the Home of Hope, an outreach programme removing street children from Lusaka and offering them a safe haven and attempting to reunite them with their families, a Community School, bakery, Agricultural Project for a few examples, but a significant amount also takes place in the compound itself, such as the provision of clean water. Project Zambia also works in the St Catherine's Centre, in the middle of Misisi; it is a school offering education to local children of Misisi. Project Zambia's continued work in the St Catherine's Centre, with the work of Mr Peter Tembo, the co-ordinator of the St Catherine's centre, has seen its expansion from a few buildings acting as a temporary school, to a walled compound that has continued expansion with each year that Project Zambia continues its involvement. Redevelopment In 2019, President Edgar Lungu announced plans to redevelop the Misisi and Chibolya settlements. They were one of four initiatives submitted to the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. Whilst residents were concerned about eviction, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure Development Ronald Chitotela announced that under the Urban Renewal plans, the government would build 12,500 housing units in Misisi and also Kuku, which would house 50,000 people.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2007 to 2015, representing the electorate of Port Stephens. He was elected as a member of the Liberal Party, but resigned to sit as an independent in 2014 following his admission of failing to properly disclose electoral donations in the course of Independent Commission Against Corruption proceedings. Political career Baumann was elected to Port Stephens Shire Council in 1987 and served as Deputy Shire President from 1989 until 1991. Re-elected to Council in 1991, Baumann served as Mayor in 1994. He again was elected to Port Stephens Council in 1999 and 2004 and served as Mayor from 2004 to 2006, when he stood down as Mayor to contest the 2007 election. Baumann was elected at the 2007 state election. Following two weeks of re-counts, he was elected on a two party preferred margin of 68 votes, making Port Stephens the most marginal electorate in New South Wales. Despite the small margin, Baumann received a 7.3% swing in his favour, and notably this was the first and only time since formation of the electorate in 1988 that the seat had been won by a Liberal Candidate. Before entering state politics, Baumann was mayor of Port Stephens. After a more significant victory in to 2011 election, Baumann was appointed by Premier Barry O’Farrell as Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Planning under Minister Brad Hazzard. In 2014 Premier Mike Baird re-appointed him under Minister Pru Goward. Following admissions by Baumann, at a hearing of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on 12 September 2014, that he had written sham invoices to cover up electoral donations received from developers during his election campaign in 2007, he resigned from the Parliamentary Liberal Party and moved to the crossbench of the Legislative Assembly for the remainder of the 2011-2015 parliamentary term. With the announcement that the ICAC wouldn’t bring down its report on Operation Spicer until after the 2015 state election, Baumann was forced to stand down as a candidate, with Kate Washington gaining the seat for Labor with a large 19.5% swing. The Operation Spicer report was handed down in 2016 and found that all donations Baumann received had been genuine political donations from parties not prohibited from making political donations. However it also found that Baumann had acted to avoid the election funding laws requiring the disclosure of these donations. Career outside politics Baumann is the owner and sole director of Valley Homes - a residential builder in the Hunter region. Baumann is a Chartered Professional Engineer, a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers Australia and a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Building. He was awarded a Centenary Medal in 2001 for \\"outstanding service to the development of the region through membership of the local Council\\". Personal life Baumann married Victoria Julie Angus in 1983 and they moved to Medowie in 1985 where they raised 3 sons Angus, Stuart & James.

Costa v. ENEL case, in Wolfrum, Rudiger (ed.): The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 824. Facts Mr. Costa was an Italian citizen who had owned shares in an electricity company, Edisonvolta, and opposed the nationalisation of the electricity sector in Italy. He asked to two lower courts in Milan (two different Giudice Conciliatore) to ascertain that the real creditor of his electricity bill (a relatively small amount of money, 1,925 lire) was the nationalised company, Edisonvolta, and not the newly established state company, Enel. He argued that the nationalisation of the electricity industry violated the Treaty of Rome and the Italian Constitution. The first Giudice Conciliatore of Milan referred the case to the Italian Constitutional Court and the second Giudice Conciliatore referred it to the European Court of Justice. The Italian Constitution Court gave judgement in March 1964, ruling that while the Italian Constitution allowed for the limitation of sovereignty for international organisation like the European Economic Community, it did not upset that normal rule of statutory interpretation that where two statutes conflict the subsequent one prevails (lex posterior derogat legi anteriori/priori). As a result the Treaty of Rome which was incorporated into Italian law in 1958 could not prevail over the electricity nationalisation law which was enacted in 1962. In light of the decision of the constitutional court, the Italian government submitted to the ECJ that the Italian court's request for a preliminary ruling from the ECJ was inadmissible on the grounds that as the Italian court was not empowered to set aside the national law in question, a preliminary ruling would not serve any valid purpose. Judgment The ECJ held the Treaty of Rome rule on an undistorted market was one on which the Commission alone could challenge the Italian government. As an individual, Costa had no standing to challenge the decision because that Treaty provision had no direct effect. However, Costa could raise a point of EC law against a national government in legal proceeding before the courts in that member state since EC law would not be effective if Costa could not challenge national law on the basis of its alleged incompatibility with EC law.Case 6/64 Costa v ENEL [1964] ECR 595 Significance This groundbreaking case established the principle of supremacy in EU law, which is an independent source of law that cannot be overridden by domestic laws.

It is one of several geographically transitional 'Karna–Mari fringe' languages that have not been convincingly classified, and is best considered an isolate branch within the Pama–Nyungan family. Gavan Breen provisionally includes Minkabari and the 'Ngura' dialect Pitjara/Bidjara/Bitharra, which together have been called the Bulloo River language. Gavan Breen is partly responsible for the variation in the spelling of the name 'Kalali'. The forms Garlali and Galarli are due to what he now considers a non-distinctive instance of retroflex rl, and he prefers the spelling Kalali. People and language Both the Kalali and the Wanggumara apparently lived by the Bulloo River and the Wilson River in South West Queensland. There is some debate whether they originated by the Bulloo River and migrated to the Wilson River or vice versa. For instance, Breen posited that some groups in southwest Queensland had abandoned their original languages (but not their names) and adopted the Wilson River language in the early days of Australian colonial settlement, when people moved from Thargomindah and the middle Bulloo River to Nockatunga (near the modern town of Noccundra). The Bulloo River Kalali lived around the area from Thargomindah southward to the Currawinya Lakes and perhaps west to Bulloo Lakes and north to Norley Station. Bulloo River Kalali was studied by Breen (from a speaker named Charlie Phillips). The informant Charlie Phillips aged 74 years, born at Backwood Station south of Hungerford in southwest Queensland, spoke the language fluently and confidently despite having not used the language conversationally for 40 years. A language labeled \\"Wonkomarra\\" in Myles (1886) is a different language from modern Wangkumara, and may be a variety of Kalali. On the other hand, the language spoken by the Kalali people that Wurm labeled 'Waŋkumara (Gaḷali)' was a variety of Wangkumara.

Pectobacterium carotovorum is a bacterium of the family Pectobacteriaceae; it used to be a member of the genus Erwinia. The species is a plant pathogen with a diverse host range, including many agriculturally and scientifically important plant species. It produces pectolytic enzymes that hydrolyze pectin between individual plant cells. This causes the cells to separate, a disease plant pathologists term bacterial soft rot. Specifically, it causes beet vascular necrosis and blackleg of potato and other vegetables (hence the name carotovora – \\"carrot-eater\\"), as well as slime flux on many different tree species. Currently, there are four described subspecies of P. carotovorum (carotovorum, brasiliense, odoriferum, and actinidiae). This bacterium is a ubiquitous plant pathogen with a wide host range (carrot, potato, tomato, leafy greens, squash and other cucurbits, onion, green peppers, African violets, etc.), able to cause disease in almost any plant tissue it invades. It is a very economically important pathogen in terms of postharvest losses, and a common cause of decay in stored fruits and vegetables. Decay caused by P. carotovora is often referred to as \\"bacterial soft rot\\" though this may also be caused by other bacteria. Most plants or plant parts can resist invasion by the bacteria, unless some type of wound is present. High humidity and temperatures around 30 °C favor development of decay. The cells become highly motile near this temperature (26 °C) when fructose is present. Mutants can be produced which are less virulent. Virulence factors include: pectinases, cellulases, (which degrade plant cell walls), and also proteases, lipases, xylanases, and nucleases (along with the normal virulence factors for pathogens – Fe acquisition, LPS integrity, multiple global regulatory systems).  Management  KENGAP, partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise have several recommendations for the management of P. carotovora including; washing hands and disinfecting tools regularly during and after harvestin, avoiding harvesting in warm and moist conditions. They also recommend frequent irrigation during head formation should be avoided to allow heads to dry and planting on ridges, raised beds or well drained soils prevents water logging around the plants. Plantwise partners also recommend thorough washing and disinfection of crates for to prevent post-harvest losses and that crop rotation with leguminous crops and cereals is practiced.

Biography Johnson started playing piano after her father when five years old and switched to guitar at twelve. She attended Edmonton County School in Edmonton, which is in North London, and part of the London Borough of Enfield, where she discovered rock music and played bass and piano in school bands. She went back to guitar and was already writing and playing her own material when she met her future bandmates at the age of 19. After her first encounter with Kim McAuliffe and Enid Williams in April 1978, she was immediately accepted in the ranks of the new band formed from the ashes of the group Painted Lady, which took the name of Girlschool. Girlschool full-on raucous guitar playing, tousled, leather- clad looks (and what one reviewer described as \\"stiletto in the groin\\" attitude) soon won the band a cult following, giving them prominence in the emerging new wave of British heavy metal, thanks also to their strong relationship with contemporaries Motörhead. Johnson and McAuliffe drinking bouts were otherwise memorable as much as their fast ascension to headliner band.Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss White Line Fever (2002) – Simon & Schuster pp. 126-128 . Johnson was a songwriter, playing lead guitar and singing both lead and backing vocals on the group's first four albums. She provided both a strong visual focus for the band with her tall figure and blonde hair and an excellent musical contribution with her trenchant guitar playing. On hearing Johnson's riffs on \\"Race With the Devil\\" guitarist Jeff Beck was quoted \\"There's no way that's a girl playing\\" a remark described by the DJ John Peel as the most sexist comment he had ever heard. Whilst Lemmy of Motörhead declared \\"I thought they were fucking great. I got them on the tour in the first place and everybody else went like, 'Ugh, girls,' and I said, 'Fuck you, they're as good as you.' Kelly Johnson, on a good day, is as good as Jeff Beck in his rock & roll days. She's a fucking brilliant guitar player.\\" Girlschool did not take feminist positions, but as an all-female band in a genre dominated by male musicians and often by machismo and sexist attitudes, their existence was a statement in itself. Moreover, Johnson professed from the beginning of her career a strong sensibility to environmental themes, which was expressed in some of her songs. She became later an environmentalist, an activist for animal rights and also a vegetarian. Girlschool had their best UK chart success in 1980 and 1981, with the EP St. Valentine's Day Massacre and the album Hit and Run, but their success soon declined and their approach to the US market with the album Play Dirty was not as successful as hoped. At the beginning of 1984, Johnson left the band. As Kim McAuliffe stated in 1997, \\"basically Kelly just got fed up with the whole thing (...) she wasn’t into heavy rock anymore\\". Johnson left England for the US, to start a new career and to live with Vicki Blue, former bassist of the American all-female band The Runaways, who was also her manager. In Los Angeles, she wrote her own music and recorded demos of mainstream rock with large use of synthesizers and electronic effects, but no label put her under contract. In 1987, she entered the rock band World’s Cutest Killers, which included on rhythm guitar and vocals former Painted Lady and The Go-Go's member Kathy Valentine. WCK changed their name to The Renegades and worked the local club circuit, but gained no record contract. Concluding her experience with this band after two years, she left music altogether to learn sign language and work with the deaf. In 1993, after almost ten years in the USA, she returned to the UK to resume her role as lead guitarist of Girlschool for a reunion tour. She remained with the band and toured incessantly until 1999, when she was diagnosed with cancer. After she left the band Johnson remained associated with Girlschool, playing the occasional gig, instructing her substitute Jackie Chambers and gathering photos and material for a band biography. Johnson died on Sunday 15 July 2007, aged 49, after a six-year battle against spinal cancer. That she had the disease was not widely known outside her close circle of friends and even closer family. At her memorial, her friend and former bandmate Tracey Lamb read the eulogy. Girlschool performed a tribute gig on 20 August 2007 at the Soho Revue Bar in London, with many of Johnson’s friends and former band members. Equipment During her first stint with Girlschool, Kelly Johnson used a 1980 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top guitar, modified with gold plated machine heads and DiMarzio pickups and an Ibanez Destroyer-II. She used Marshall 50 and 100 amplifiers and no pedals or effects.

In 1963 it was renamed Spartak, in 1973 Stal (meaning \\"steel\\"), in 1975 the team was renamed Spartak again. The team played in Class B until the restructuring of the leagues in 1971, when it entered the Soviet Second League. In 1990–1991 Spartak played in the Second League B. In 1992 Spartak entered the Russian Second League. In 1993 the team was renamed Oryol. In 1994 Oryol moved to the Third League, and in 1996 they were promoted back after finishing third. In 2003 Oryol finished first in the Centre zone of the Second Division and were promoted to the First Division. The sixth position in 2004 was the best in the club's history. In 2006 Oryol were relegated from the First Division after finishing 20th. The club faced financial problems, thus abandoning their place in the Second Division, was re-created as Spartak Oryol and joined the Amateur Football League. After a year in the amateur league, FC Oryol returned to the Second Division and was once again renamed, entering 2008 season as FC Rusichi Oryol. Rusichi finished mid-table in their first three seasons in the Second Division, with Yevgeni Polyakov becoming the central zone's top scorer with 20 goals in 2010. In winter 2011 rumours circulated that the team would change its name to FC Oryol. Despite being in top five for the most part of 2011/12 season, Rusichi once again finished mid-table (8th place).

Cayetano Brenna, a famous confectioner, commissioned Italian architect Francisco Gianotti in 1915 to design the building that would house a café on its ground floor. The café itself opened on July 9, 1916, and when completed in 1917 the building became one of the tallest in the city with a corner turret rising . Illuminated from the inside with electric lighting, the turret featured stained glass windows and decorative windmill sails. El Molino and Galería Güemes were two of Gianotti's greatest works and represent important examples of Art Nouveau style architecture in Buenos Aires. Under construction in 1915 Cayetano Brenna died in 1938 and Renato Varesse took over the business until 1950, when Antonio Armentano appeared, who in turn sold the goodwill in 1978. The new owners cause the bankruptcy of the confectionery, which happens to be acquired by Brenna's grandchildren, who introduce a series of improvements to adapt it to the new times. Over the years El Molino became a favourite meeting place for local cultural, business, and political figures. The café was closed on February 23, 1997, however, and today is only rarely opened to the public for events designed to advertise the urgent need to restore the building, prior further disintegration. The Confitería del Molino was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997. Congress approved its purchase by the Argentine Government in a bill passed unanimously on November 12, 2014. Plans include the restoration of the building and reopening of the namesake café, as well as the creation of a museum of early 20th century life in Buenos Aires. Officially, the building will be an annex of the Argentine Congress serving numerous functions, though the coffee shop itself is to be operated by the private sector.Avanza la expropiación de la Confitería El Molino - Presidencia de la Nacion, 29 September 2015.

It has rough, compacted bark on the trunk, sessile, egg-shaped to heart-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds covered with a white, powdery bloom, white flowers and cup-shaped fruit.U.N.E. fruitbark Description Eucalyptus crenulata is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has hard, rough, compacted, grey to brown or black bark on the trunk and smooth grey or yellowish bark on the branches. The leaves on young plants and coppice regrowth are egg-shaped to heart-shaped, arranged in opposite pairs, paler on the lower surface, long, wide and lack a petiole. The adult leaves are similar to the juvenile leaves except that the juvenile leaves are covered with a powdery white bloom that eventually wears off. The edges of the leaves have small, rounded teeth. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval to almost spherical, covered with a powdery bloom, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from September to February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel up to long with the valves enclosed below the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus crenulata was first formally described in 1939 by William Blakely and Wilfred de Beuzeville from a specimen collected near Buxton. The description was published in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium. The specific epithet (crenulata) is a Latin word meaning \\"having small, rounded teeth\\", referring to the scalloped leaf edges. Distribution and habitat Buxton gum grows in swampy sites in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range. It is only known from two natural populations, one near the Acheron River valley near Buxton and the other on the Yarra River floodplain at Yering in Victoria, Australia. The species is widely cultivated however, and there are many more specimens in cultivation than in the natural environment.

Thoby Stephen was the eldest son of Leslie Stephen and Julia Prinsep Stephen. The result of his mother's second marriage, he was therefore a half-brother of George and Gerald Duckworth, her sons with first husband Herbert Duckworth. Stephen was educated at Clifton College,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p192: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 after failing to gain a place at Eton. However, this did not hold him back, since he won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, from Clifton. He was a friend of Lytton Strachey, who was enchanted by his masculinity and introduced him to the \\"Reading Club\\". He was described as \\"over six feet tall and of somewhat ponderous build\\". Stephen is credited with starting the Bloomsbury Group's Thursday evening gatherings. He was expected to distinguish himself, but he contracted typhoid at the age of 26 while on holiday in Greece, and died shortly after he was brought back to England. Vanessa Bell's eldest son, the poet Julian Bell, was named after him. He is the basis for the character of Tibby Schlegel in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel Howards End.

Generally, such bracketing denotes some form of grouping: in evaluating an expression containing a bracketed sub-expression, the operators in the sub-expression take precedence over those surrounding it. Additionally, there are several uses and meanings for the various brackets. Historically, other notations, such as the vinculum, were similarly used for grouping. In present-day use, these notations all have specific meanings. The earliest use of brackets to indicate aggregation (i.e. grouping) was suggested in 1608 by Christopher Clavius, and in 1629 by Albert Girard.Cajori, Florian 1980. A history of mathematics. New York: Chelsea Publishing, p. 158 Symbols for representing angle brackets A variety of different symbols are used to represent angle brackets. In e-mail and other ASCII text, it is common to use the less-than (\`<\`) and greater-than (\`>\`) signs to represent angle brackets, because ASCII does not include angle brackets.. Unicode has pairs of dedicated characters; other than less-than and greater-than symbols, these include: * and * and * and * and * and , which are deprecated In LaTeX the markup is \`\\\\langle\` and \`\\\\rangle\`: \\\\langle\\\\ \\\\rangle. Non-mathematical angled brackets include: * and , used in East-Asian text quotation * and , which are dingbats There are additional dingbats with increased line thickness, and some angle quotation marks and deprecated characters. Algebra In elementary algebra, parentheses ( ) are used to specify the order of operations. Terms inside the bracket are evaluated first; hence 2×(3 + 4) is 14, is 2 and (2×3) + 4 is 10. This notation is extended to cover more general algebra involving variables: for example . Square brackets are also often used in place of a second set of parentheses when they are nested—so as to provide a visual distinction. In mathematical expressions in general, parentheses are also used to indicate grouping (i.e., which parts belong together) when necessary to avoid ambiguities and improve clarity. For example, in the formula (\\\\varepsilon \\\\eta)_X = \\\\varepsilon_{Cod \\\\, \\\\eta_X}\\\\eta_X, used in the definition of composition of two natural transformations, the parentheses around \\\\varepsilon \\\\eta serve to indicate that the indexing by X is applied to the composition \\\\varepsilon \\\\eta, and not just its last component \\\\eta. Functions The arguments to a function are frequently surrounded by brackets: f(x) . When there is little chance of ambiguity, it is common to omit the parentheses around the argument altogether (e.g., \\\\sin x). Coordinates and vectors In the Cartesian coordinate system, brackets are used to specify the coordinates of a point. For example, (2,3) denotes the point with x-coordinate 2 and y-coordinate 3. The inner product of two vectors is commonly written as \\\\langle a, b\\\\rangle, but the notation (a, b) is also used. Intervals Both parentheses, ( ), and square brackets, [ ], can also be used to denote an interval. The notation [a, c) is used to indicate an interval from a to c that is inclusive of a—but exclusive of c. That is, [5, 12) would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. Here, the numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any finite number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation [5,12[ is also used for this, and wherever comma is used as decimal separator, semicolon might be used as a separator to avoid ambiguity (e.g., (0 ; 1)). The endpoint adjoining the square bracket is known as closed, while the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as open. If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as closed or open as appropriate. Whenever infinity or negative infinity is used as an endpoint (in the case of intervals on the real number line), it is always considered open and adjoined to a parenthesis. The endpoint can be closed when considering intervals on the extended real number line. Sets and groups Braces { } are used to identify the elements of a set. For example, {a,b,c} denotes a set of three elements a, b and c. Angle brackets are used in group theory and commutative algebra to specify group presentations, and to denote the subgroup or ideal generated by a collection of elements. Matrices An explicitly given matrix is commonly written between large round or square brackets: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\begin{bmatrix} c & d \\\\end{bmatrix} Derivatives The notation :f^{(n)}(x) stands for the n-th derivative of function f, applied to argument x. So, for example, if f(x) = \\\\exp(\\\\lambda x), then f^{(n)}(x) = \\\\lambda^n\\\\exp(\\\\lambda x). This is to be contrasted with f^n(x) = f(f(\\\\ldots(f(x))\\\\ldots)), the n-fold application of f to argument x. Falling and rising factorial The notation (x)_n is used to denote the falling factorial, an n-th degree polynomial defined by :(x)_n=x(x-1)(x-2)\\\\cdots(x-n+1)=\\\\frac{x!}{(x-n)!}. Alternatively, the same notation may be encountered as representing the rising factorial, also called \\"Pochhammer symbol\\". Another notation for the same is x^{(n)}. It can be defined by :x^{(n)}=x(x+1)(x+2)\\\\cdots(x+n-1)=\\\\frac{(x+n-1)!}{(x-1)!}. Quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics, angle brackets are also used as part of Dirac's formalism, bra–ket notation, to denote vectors from the dual spaces of the bra \\\\left\\\\langle A\\\\right and the ket \\\\leftB\\\\right\\\\rangle. In statistical mechanics, angle brackets denote ensemble or time average. Polynomial rings Square brackets are used to denote the variable in polynomial rings. For example, \\\\mathbb{R}[x] is the polynomial ring with the x variable and real number coefficients. Lie bracket and commutator In group theory and ring theory, square brackets are used to denote the commutator. In group theory, the commutator [g,h] is commonly defined as g−1h−1gh. In ring theory, the commutator [a,b] is defined as ab − ba. Furthermore, in theory, braces are used to denote the anticommutator, where {a,b} is defined as ab + ba. The Lie bracket of a Lie algebra is a binary operation denoted by [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot]:\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\times\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g}. By using the commutator as a Lie bracket, every associative algebra can be turned into a Lie algebra. There are many different forms of Lie bracket, in particular the Lie derivative and the Jacobi–Lie bracket. Floor/ceiling functions and fractional part Square brackets, as in , are sometimes used to denote the floor function, which rounds a real number down to the next integer. However the floor and ceiling functions are usually typeset with left and right square brackets where only the lower (for floor function) or upper (for ceiling function) horizontal bars are displayed, as in or . Braces, as in , may denote the fractional part of a real number.

It is situated northeast of Terrace and northwest of Smithers and in 2016 had a population of 580 people, a decrease of 12.9% comparing to 2011. New Hazelton is one of the \\"Three Hazeltons\\", the other two being the original \\"Old\\" Hazelton located to the northwest very near to the confluence of the Skeena and Bulkley Rivers and South Hazelton, to the west. Economy New Hazelton is the service and commerce center for the Kispiox Valley, which includes several first nation communities as well as residents of South Hazelton and Old Hazelton. The population of this area is approximately 6500 people. Due to its location on Hwy 16 and CN Rail line, New Hazelton is home to most of the shopping, restaurants, and accommodations in the area. The New Hazelton railway station is served by Via Rail's Jasper – Prince Rupert train. Mayor and Council Mayor: Gail Lowry Councilors: Janet Wilson, Mike Weeber, Braunwyn Henwood, George Burns, Ray Sturney, Peter Newberry Administrator: Wendy Hunt Directions New Hazelton is east of Kitwanga, British Columbia (48 km), Terrace, British Columbia (139), Kitimat, British Columbia (197), and Prince Rupert, British Columbia (283 km). New Hazelton is west of Witset (33 km), Smithers, British Columbia (64), Telkwa, British Columbia (81), Houston, British Columbia (130), and Prince George, British Columbia (434 km). History In 1911, when the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was being constructed, there was a surge of interest in Central and Northern British Columbia, especially along the proposed route of the railway. While the Grand Trunk Pacific built many of the towns along the line, others like New Hazelton were purchased and promoted by land speculators, who bought the properties in advance of the railway. New Hazelton was originally Lot 882 and was purchased by Robert Kelly in 1911. He had chosen the location well: it was close to the Rocher de Boule and Silver Standard mines, both of which were huge potential customers for the railway. The GTP's land commissioner, George Ryley, agreed that Lot 882 was a good location and wanted the railway to have a share in the profits from selling lots in the new townsite. Kelly refused, so Ryley found another property, Lot 851, whose owners were willing to share their profits, providing they were promised a station. Ryley made the deal and the village of South Hazelton was born. When Robert Kelly learned of these new plans, he petitioned the Board of Railway Commissioners to force the GTP to build the station in New Hazelton, which was closer to the mines. The BRC decided in Kelly's favour, particularly after they heard evidence from the miners who said the cost of shipping the ore to South Hazelton would be $4 a ton more than to New Hazelton. The railway, however, ignored the directive and built the station in South Hazelton and continued to sell lots in the townsite. New Hazelton (1914) Craddock Bridge In 1913, to make his townsite more attractive, Robert Kelly decided to have a bridge built across Bulkley River and hired the firm of Craddock and Company to do the work. The bridge was completed that fall, but was very narrow, barely wide enough for a single vehicle. Furthermore, it was 266 feet above the water and had a tendency to sway in the gentlest of breezes. The bridge soon became shunned as even the most courageous and expert drivers felt seasick or damaged their cars while crossing it. Despite the lack of a station, New Hazelton prospered during rail construction. In 1913, it had 121 buildings and a population of 350 while South Hazelton had one tent and two restaurants. By that summer, the railway relented and built a station at New Hazelton in return for a share of three- sevenths of the profits. Robert Kelly also offered the opportunity for the people who had purchased lots in South Hazelton to transfer to New Hazelton, but the railway had no intention of letting South Hazelton to be abandoned entirely and they rejected the offer. South Hazelton survived and though it was never incorporated, in 2006 it had a population of 499 people. Union Bank robberies of 1913 and 1914 Union Bank In November 1913, the Union Bank at New Hazelton was robbed by gunmen. In the commission of the crime, a young bank teller by the name of Jock McQueen was mortally wounded. Even though a posse was swiftly formed to go after them, the bandits got away with $16,000, a great deal of money in those days. thumbleftThe 1st bandit to fall; Reverend Dan MacLean on right The second robbery occurred on April 7, 1914, already a red letter day for the area as the last spike of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was being driven 180 miles away in Fort Fraser. New Hazelton was a busy little town that morning and excitement was high over the completion of the railroad. Many residents and some visiting dignitaries were planning on taking the train to Fort Fraser to watch the ceremonies associated with the driving of the last spike. John Oliver, who would one day become premier and have the town of Oliver named after him, was one of the visitors on that historic day. Little did anyone know that an equally historic event was about to happen right there in New Hazelton, one that would be remembered in hundreds of Canadian history books. Luckily, someone was there with a camera. Those pictures would become among the most famous of that era in British Columbia. Wounded bandits in wagon At 10:30 that morning seven men walked up the street towards the bank, all of them were wearing long coats, but so many people were out and about that these men went unnoticed. Six of them entered the bank while the seventh stayed in front and pulled a rifle out from underneath his coat and began firing shots up the street and people dashed for cover. Inside the bank, the other six had also drawn rifles and were demanding money from the teller, Robert Bishop. Ray Fenton, the bookkeeper was also behind the counter working on the books. When the robbers demanded the money, Fenton and Bishop weren't able to oblige them. Barrie Tatchell, the bank manager, had not yet arrived and he was the only one who had the combination of the safe. Tatchell was nearby, however, and upon hearing the shots, rushed to the house of Dan \\"Doc\\" MacLean, a local minister, who was also a veterinarian. Dan had guns and knew how to use them. Across the street from the bank another resident was getting ready to defend the town: Arizona Smith, who owned the local boarding house, was running for his gun. Tatchell found Dan and Dan grabbed his Lee–Enfield rifle and followed Tatchell to the place where they would make their stand, behind a large boulder of silver ore that had been donated to the town by the Silver Standard Mine. Dead bandits on boardwalkSoon the guard in front of the bank had three men firing at him and he called out for assistance to his companions inside. When they came out, two were killed instantly and a third was mortally wounded. The four who were remaining, all of them wounded, fled off into the nearby woods. Dan MacLean and Sperry Cline got a posse together and caught three of them, but the seventh got away. The three wounded bandits were taken to the Hazelton hospital and once they recovered they were brought to trial. Judge Young from Prince Rupert came and presided over the proceedings. It came out in court that these were the same men from the first robbery and were therefore already guilty of murder and that the bullets they were using were dumdums, a clear indication that they were willing to commit murder again. Judge Young sentenced them all to twenty years at the provincial penitentiary in New Westminster. The song \\"New Town\\" by Smithers musician Mark Perry tells the story of these events.

From the start they made hard-paste porcelain, and produced both figurines and dishware of very high quality, somewhat reflecting in style the French origin of the business, especially in their floral painting. Initially they were a private business, but from 1761 were owned by the local ruler, like most German porcelain factories of the period. History The porcelain factory in Frankenthal was established in 1755 by the Hannong family, who had previously manufactured porcelain, as well as Strasbourg faience, in Strasbourg until Louis XVI established a state monopoly on porcelain in favour of the Sèvres factory and closed down all others. Karl Hannong transferred his business to an empty barracks in Frankenthal, just outside Mannheim, and staffed it with his Strasbourg workforce, under a privilege from the local ruler Elector Carl Theodor of Bavaria, who visited the factory himself in the following year, once production was well under way. In 1757 additional craftsmen were hired from Meissen porcelain and in 1759 Hannong was able to open a shop in Strasbourg. However, in 1760 Karl Hannong died and the business became the property of his two sons Joseph Adam Hannong and Peter Anton Hannong, who fell out over the \\"arcanum\\" (the formula of the paste). Their disagreements had a damaging effect on the business and by 1761 they had borrowed so much from the Elector that it was impossible for them to repay it. In 1762 therefore the Elector bought the factory from the Hannongs for 40,804 guilders, plus another 10,00 for the arcanum, and installed his own officials to manage it. Frankenthal Porcelain was always hard-paste, as Hannong senior had been in partnership in Strasbourg with an ex-employee of the Meissen factory. It is said that one of his sons sold the secret to Sèvres, although they were unable to obtain the right raw materials for some time. The years from 1762 to 1770 were extraordinarily successful: the products achieved high quality and established the factory's reputation. They retained some of the French style of Strasbourg. From 1770 all items were marked with a date mark. The earlier body was \\"a fine creamy white with a well-used glaze\\", but from 1774 the paste was made with local china clay, generally mixed with \\"Passau earth\\" (Passauer Erde), resulting in lower quality.Battie, 99 By 1776 the Frankenthal porcelain factory had shops in Aachen, Basle, Frankfurt am Main, Livorno, Mainz, Munich and Nancy. The Napoleonic Wars brought an end to the business. Frankenthal was occupied by the French in 1794, who closed the porcelain factory down in 1799. Production had been lower since at least 1790, and models and moulds had been moved to Nymphenburg,Battie, 99 which the elector also owned by then, having also become Prince-Elector of Bavaria. The Frankenthal factory was in operation for only 44 years (run for 7 years by the Hannongs, and for 37 by the electoral administration) and is thus the shortest-lived of the major German porcelain manufacturers. It was marked by an unusually numerous succession of directors and principal modellers, although some of the main painters spent a long time at the factory; painted mythological scenes were a Frankenthal speciality.Battie, 99 Collections of Frankenthal porcelain may be seen, among other places, in the Reiss Engelhorn Museum in Mannheim, the Kurpfälzisches Museum in Heidelberg, the Historisches Museum der Pfalz in Speyer and the Bavarian National Museum in Munich. Works of the brothers Paul and Johann Hannong are displayed in the Musée des Arts décoratifs, Strasbourg and in the Musée du pain d'épice in Gertwiller.

Sears attended Plano High School and the Aurora Seminary. After graduating in 1877, he took a job as the head of shipping for the Deering Harvester Company. A year later, he became a traveling salesman for the burgeoning company. When the company moved to North Chicago, founder William Deering moved to Evanston. He then sold his newly completed house to Albert Sears. Sears remained in Plano and co-founded the Plano Manufacturing Company, using the former Deering plant. The company manufactured farm implements and employed 70 people. Sears was on the board of directors and was General Superintendent of the plant until 1883.

It consists of mainly new villages formed from other older villages of other ranges. It is also the lowest range (also known as the Naga Foothills) and borders Assam, an Indian state. The range is first encountered by travellers along the Mokokchung-Mariani road at the Nagaland Gate (or the Tzutapela Gate, in Local Dialect). It consists of villages like Ao Senden, Ao Sungkhum, Chungtiayimsen (or New Chungtia), Watiyim, Longpayimsen, Moayimti, Medemyim, Longtho, etc. On penetrating deeper into the Hills, this range ultimately gives way to the Japukong and Changkikong ranges.

The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that common names included \\"Weeping Myall\\", \\"True Myall\\", and Indigenous People of Western Areas of New South Wales and Queensland referred to the plant as \\"Boree\\" and \\"Balaar'. Description Acacia bark The tree typically grows to a height of and a width of and has an erect, pendulous to spreading habit. It has hard fissured grey bark on the trunk and limbs. It has pendulous branches with angled or flattened branchlets that are covered in short fine hairs but becomes glabrous as it matures. The grey-green narrow phyllodes are about in length and wide and have a narrowly elliptic to very narrowly elliptic or sometimes narrowly oblong-elliptic shape and can be straight or curved The phyllodes have many longitudinal indistinct veins, a subacute apex with mucro and one gland near base. It flowers in the summer and autumn from around November to May and produces yellow flowers. The inflorescences mostly occur in groups of two to five on2–5 on an axillary axis. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of and contain 10 to 20 bright yellow flowers. The papery to leathery green seed pods that form after flowering are flat and straight to strongly curved and age to a brown colour. The pods are irregularly constricted between each of the seeds and are in length and . Seeds are often collected between October and January. Taxonomy The species was formally described by the botanist George Don in 1832 as part of the work A General History of Dichlamydeous Plants. It was reclassified as Racosperma pendulum by Leslie Pedley in 1987 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2014. The specific epithet is in reference to the pendulous habit of the tree. It is derived from the Latin word pendere meaning to fall. Distribution It occurs naturally in dry outback areas in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. In New South Wales the tree has a disjunct but widespread throughout inland areas usually to the east of the upper Hunter Valley. It is often situated on major river floodplains growing as part of woodlands, sometimes as the dominant species, where it grows well in heavy clay soils. In all states it is found to the west of the Great Dividing Range growing in alluvial soils consisting of sand, gravel, silt and clay in areas that receive of annual rainfall. Uses and cultivation In 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ it was also noted that \\"Stock are very fond of the leaves of this tree, especially in seasons of drought, and for this reason, and because they eat down the seedlings, it has almost become exterminated in parts of the colonies.\\" The tree is available commercially as seedlings or in seed form and has many desirable properties in areas of low rainfall since it is drought tolerant. It is also frost tolerant and will grow in heavy clay soils. It is useful as a shelter-tree or as a windbreak and attracts native birds, particularly parrots who use the seeds as a food source. The rhizobium nodules in the roots also assist in fixing nitrogen into the soil. The blue- grey foliage and weeping habit make it popular bot domestically and in overseas cultivation, including in Iran and Kuwait.

Its corporate headquarters are in Dublin which were opened by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on 18 January 2013. Sky's broadband services have no cap and are unlimited. Sky Ireland employs around 900 staff in Dublin.

They sell advertising opportunities across all of Sky's wholly owned channels including Sky One, Sky Witness, Sky Atlantic, Sky News and Sky Sports. In addition, they sell on behalf of media partners including Viacom International Media Networks Europe and Discovery Networks Northern Europe. *Sky operated an Irish version of Sky News called Sky News Ireland from 2004 to 2006. *As of January 2013: The company has 500 workers that work from its contact centre with a possible increase of 1,000 by year end. BSkyB chief executive Jeremy Darroch announced on 18 January 2013 that Sky Ireland will invest a further €1 billion over the next five years in Ireland. *As of September 2013: Sky Ireland now employ 800 people at its Dublin base. Sky Ireland have confirmed they expect to invest €1.25 billion with expansion into the Irish market with Irish specific productions and further expansion of its existing Irish telecommunications company. *In October 2013 Sky Ireland Launched the On Demand service to its Irish customers. *December 2013 Sky launched Ireland's biggest Catch-up TV Service. * In 2017 Now TV was launched in the Republic of Ireland. Broadcasting Sky Minidish =Transmission= When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E. This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat's Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 28A) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels.Sky on Eutelsat 28A & Astra 1N/2A/2B at 28.2°E - LyngSat The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom and Ireland. New Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 28A) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering  However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely. Sky is currently transmitted from the Astra satellites located at 28.2° east (2A/2C/2E/2F) and Eutelsat's Eutelsat 28A satellite at 28.5°E. =Standard definition broadcasts= Sky's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2, with the Sky Cinema and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard. Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including modems for a return path. Sky News, amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams. =Digital satellite receivers= Sky utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS, a Cisco Systems company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs (conditional-access modules). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the Personal video recorder (PVR) offering (branded Sky+). =Electronic programme guide= Technology Sky maintains an electronic programme guide (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. Channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit logical channel number which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed. The EPG in Ireland gives priority to Irish channels. All channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky Ireland. Sky Ireland has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality. In October 2007, Sky's parent company Sky plc (then BSkyB) announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing \\"very significant memory constraints\\" on many of its older digiboxes. In June 2012, Sky Ireland launched a new EPG for Sky+ HD boxes. The update boasts a new modernised look and improved functionality. Sky Ireland EPG The Sky EPG lists all channels carried on the Sky platform. Many channels are free, others are available only with a subscription. Sky Ireland Channels Channels on this list are owned by Sky and broadcast adverstising specifically for the Irish market. *Sky One *Sky Two *Sky Atlantic *Sky Witness *Sky News *Pick *Challenge *Sky Sports Racing (part owned by Sky) *Sky Sports News *Sky Sports Some other channels available on the Sky platform also carry Irish advertising, such as the channels provided by Channel 4. =Restrictions= Sky subscribers in Ireland have a different choice of channels compared subscribers in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. The standard Irish channels RTÉ One, RTÉ One +1, RTÉ2, RTÉjr, RTÉ News Now, Virgin Media One, TG4, Virgin Media Two and Virgin Media Three are available to all Irish subscribers. These channels are encrypted, but are included with the Sky Original and Sky Variety packages. These channels are also available on Saorview and Saorsat. The BBC provide a number of their channels on the Irish version of Sky's EPG. BBC One Northern Ireland, BBC Two Northern Ireland, BBC Four, CBBC and Cbeebies along with their HD variants are available on the EPG. Other BBC channels including BBC News, BBC Parliament and the BBC regions can be tuned in manually to all Sky boxes. Channel 4 provide all of their channels except 4Seven and 4Music on Sky Ireland's EPG. Welsh-language station S4C was carried by Sky Ireland for many years where its rugby union broadcasts were popular despite the language barrier; it was removed from the EPG in August 2018 due to rights issues. ITV and the Channel 5 family of channels have to be added manually to Sky boxes in Ireland. Sky Ireland Broadband In February 2013 BSkyB launched its broadband and telephone product in Ireland, and have made significant headway into the Irish market as one of the few providers offering 'triple play' (phone, broadband and digital TV) to the public. As Sky's broadband and phone services use the existing telephone network (LLU and non-LLU) and is widely available as a result. Sky Ireland has offered fibre broadband, using the network of former incumbent, eir, with speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s since 26 December 2014.

The drama won many awards at 2006 KBS Drama Awards and was a commercial success reaching a peak rating of 43.2% on its January 6 episode and an average viewership of 29.14%.  Plot  Yang Gook-hwa () is a nineteen-year-old country girl who leaves Yanbian and travels to Seoul because she is marrying Hong Soon-goo (), the third son in an average but respectable family. When she arrives in Seoul, however, she finds out that her fiancé has just died in a terrible car accident. Instead of returning to Yanbian, she decides to stay and create a new life in Korea while sending money back to her aunt and uncle. While she lives in Korea, she is taken in as a family member by Soon-goo's family. Hong Woo-kyung (), the son of Soon-goo's oldest brother Moon-goo (), especially cares for her like his own sister. Woo-kyung works in the marketing department of UT, a huge telecommunications company. His former classmate Park Yoon-hoo (), the son of UT's CEO, also works in the marketing department, in a higher position. Yoon- hoo's spoiled younger sister Yoon-jeong () attends college. The oldest child, Yoon-ji (), is estranged from the family due to her marriage to a poor car salesman. = Yoon-hoo and Gook-hwa story = Several stories go on throughout the show, and the main story is the one focusing on the development of Gook- hwa and Yoon-hoo's relationship. At the beginning, Gook-hwa and Yoon-hoo hate each other - Yoon-hoo despises her love for money and for behaving like a country bumpkin, while Gook-hwa detests Yoon-hoo's hot-tempered, icy exterior. He gives her the nickname \\"farm girl\\" because he finds her behavior crass. However, when Gook-hwa gets a job as Yoon-hoo's secretary, partly because of her ability to speak fluent Mandarin, Yoon-hoo gradually falls in love with her, as she is able to make him laugh and feel \\"alive\\" through her naivete and innocence. Shin-hyung (), Yoon-hoo's childhood friend whom Yoon-hoo's parents want him to marry, notices the change in Yoon-hoo's attitude toward Gook-hwa, and is uncomfortable when Yoon-hoo appears to be getting closer to Gook-hwa, despite their upcoming wedding date. Her insecurity also stems from Yoon-hoo's apparent lack of commitment to their marriage. Yoon-hoo tells Gook-hwa how he feels about her. She initially thinks he is drunk and rejects his feelings. Yoon-hoo tells his parents and Shin-hyung that he does not want to go ahead with the wedding. His father sends him to the company's Singapore office along with Shin-hyung, who also works in the same company, as a way to make Yoon-hoo forget Gook-hwa and get him to work on his relationship with Shin-hyung. Gook- hwa learns that Yoon-hoo is going to Singapore, and realizes that she does have feelings for Yoon-hoo. Yoon-hoo confronts Gook-hwa while he is drunk, and demands to know whether she wants him to stay. She denies any feelings for Yoon-hoo. When Yoon-hoo is at the airport waiting to board his flight, Gook- hwa constantly thinks if she should chase after him and tell him the truth. She finally makes up her mind and runs to the airport, proving her true feelings. Yoon-hoo calls her but she does not answer the phone. She eventually fails to make it to the airport before his flight, as she thinks she is crazy for running the airport. She decides to call Yoon-hoo, only to find out that he decided not to go to Singapore, and has chosen to leave his family, even giving up his credit cards and car. In episode 89, Yoon-hoo yells at Gook-hwa, saying that “I left my house to show my true feelings about you. Can't you be more honest and give me some courage? Now, you are the only one left for me!” Despite the objections from the world, Yoon-hoo keeps on dating with Gook-hwa. However, Shin-hyung is plotting revenge on Gook-hwa, in order to get Yoon-hoo back. Under pressure from Yoon-hoo's father, Yoon-hoo is rejected by many corporations. Gook-hwa learns that Yoon-hoo is having a hard time and decides to leave him. Meanwhile, Shin-hyung realizes that Gook-hwa really loves Yoon- hoo through the sacrifices that Gukhwa has made for Yoon-hoo's sake. Yoon-hoo takes Gook-hwa, who worked as a Chinese translator for him, on a business trip to Jeju Island where an important exhibition is taking place. Yoon-hoo's father, Chairman Park finds Gook-hwa and Yoon-hoo there, and soon, Yoon-hoo has returned to UT as a planning manager in the marketing department, with Gook-hwa as his secretary. Yoon-hoo also decides to help Gook-hwa become more sophisticated and sends her to an academy to help her prepare for her college entrance examination. However, Soo-jeong (), Yoon-hoo's ex-girlfriend, returns to Korea as a divorcee with her son from her previous marriage. Soo-jeong asks Yoon-hoo's mother what is she going to do if her son is Yoon-hoo's child. Yoon-hoo is shocked, and Gook-hwa comes to know about Soo-jeong's identity. Later on when Soo-jeong's lie is exposed, and Yoon-hoo proposes to Gook-hwa. Gook-hwa accepts Yoon-hoo's proposal, but persuades Yoon-hoo to return home, feeling that they have behaved rashly. Yoon-hoo agrees to her request, but Yoon-hoo's mother still opposes the marriage. On the other hand, Chairman Park decides to trust Yoon-hoo's decision, while Yoon-ji and Gwang Man support his decision as well, as Gook-hwa has gained the acceptance of Chairman Park, Yoon-ji and Gwang-man with her modesty and kind-heartedness. A year later, Gook-hwa is pregnant, and has passed the college entrance examination. The show concludes with a scene of Yoon-hoo and Gook-hwa on a cruise ship on the Han River, celebrating her passing of the college entrance examination. = Woo-kyung and Yoon-jeong story = At first, Woo-kyung and Yoon-jeong meet funeral of Gook-hwa's fiancé. This does not start any relationship. Later, Yoon-jeong (being a bad driver) hits Woo-kyung's car and claims that Woo-kyung was at fault. Woo-kyung continues to try to avoid her, but Yoon-jeong chases him. Even though Woo-kyung tells her he is not interested, but she chases him still. Eventually Yoon-jeong says that she won't chase him anymore and she will stop wasting her time. Woo-kyung then starts to miss her presence all around, so he begins to chase her. In episode 95, Woo-kyung begs Yoon-jeong not to go to the dating with Jin Soo and she came back to him. This eventually starts their relationship. When Yoon-jeong's mother finds out, she refuses saying that Woo-kyung has a poor background and family. However, Chairman Park, who is Yoon-jeong's father allows the marriage, claiming that Woo-kyung is too much for her. As the story goes, Yoon-jeong's mother doesn't let Yoon- jeong go out after she was greatly embarrassed in the public place by her and Woo-kyung. Woo-kyung goes to Yoon-jeong's house, firmly saying that he doesn't want Yoon-jeong to go to anymore dating. Yoon-jeong then asks her older sister Yoon-ji what she did so that she could get their mother to let the older sister to marry. The Older sister then told Yoon-jeong that she faked her own pregnancy. Yoon-jeong then fakes her own pregnancy to her mother and her mother believes it. When she fakes it, her mother says that Woo-kyung and Yoon-jeong must be married quickly since sex before marriage is very bad in Korea. Woo-kyung and Yoon-jeong set a date and when her mother tells Woo-kyung that, he gets extremely angry. So does her mother. Yoon-jeong begs Woo-kyung and her mother for her dishonesty. When Woo-kyung and Yoon-jeong get married, they go on a honeymoon/business trip because exhibition and honeymoon happened to be at the same time. Later in the story, you find out that Yoon-jeong actually got pregnant from Woo-kyung after their honeymoon. A recurring joke at this time is Yoon-jeong asking for something from Woo-kyung, he is going out to get it, and then she is telling him that she wants something else instead. A little later in the story, you also find out that Yoon-jeong is actually going to have twins. In the final episode, you see the twins born after the time lapse. Later in the part, when Mr. Hong, the grandfather collapses, Woo-kyung decided to inherit his grandfather's tailor shop. Also, inheriting his grandfather's tailor shop was what he truly wanted to do. Woo- kyung's mother opposes his plan, reminding the fact from 10 years ago. However, Woo-kyung pursues his plan, with his new business ideas. A year later, Woo-kyung's tailor shop became famous nationwide, earned his fame as a great tailor. Woo-kyung earned a lot of money, however, maintains his original personality.

In the SNI network, interdisciplinary teams of scientists conduct basic and applied research and actively support knowledge and technology transfer to industry. Within the study of nanoscience and the PhD School, the SNI trains young scientists and prepares them for careers in industry and academia. The SNI was founded in 2006 by the Canton of Aargau and the University of Basel to promote research and training in the nanosciences and nanotechnology in Northwestern Switzerland. Since then, numerous research projects have been successfully initiated in which researchers from various disciplines and institutions work together in one network. In addition to research and training, the SNI is also involved in public relations and provides targeted support for various initiatives, particularly those aiming to interest children and young people in the natural sciences.  SNI network  The success of the SNI is based on the interdisciplinary network that has been built up and consolidated over the years. This network includes various departments at the University of Basel, the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the Department for Biosystems Science and Engineering at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Basel (D-BSSE) and the CSEM (Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique) in Muttenz. Membership of the SNI, which is earned by participating in SNI projects, and regular academic conferences involving its members constantly stimulate and encourage the exchange of information within the network.  Bachelor and Master Program  In 2002, the University of Basel – under the leadership of the SNI’s predecessor institution – launched the Bachelor’s and master's degree programs in nanosciences. Today, this demanding degree program is firmly established. Around 40 students who begin the Bachelor’s program each year receive a solid basic education in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics and can subsequently choose from a wide range of courses that allow the students to focus on specific topics. Early on in their education, they have the opportunity to participate in various research groups, an activity that always proves particularly motivating.  PhD School  To promote the further training of young scientists and a wide spectrum of basic scientific research, the SNI initiated a PhD School in 2013. At the end of 2014, 24 doctoral students were enrolled. Within the SNI PhD School, each doctoral student is supervised by two members of the SNI network. They also become involved in internal events such as the Winter School and the Annual Meeting and take part in various courses to gain insights into areas such as intellectual property, communication and rhetoric.  Leaders in their field  Basic sciences form the foundation of research work at the SNI. In addition to the various projects funded as part of the PhD School, the SNI also supports the basic scientific research performed by Argovia professors Roderick Lim and Martino Poggio. Both were promoted to associate professor in 2014 and their research successes in nanobiology and nanotechnology have contributed to the SNI’s outstanding international reputation. The SNI also supports titular professors Frithjof Nolting and Thomas Jung, who work in the Department of Physics at the University of Basel and at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), and, from the end of 2014, Michel Kenzelmann who also works for the PSI and the Department of Physics.  Practical application  Since it was founded, the SNI has placed great value on the transfer of academic findings to industry. To optimize this process, the SNI started an annual call for applied research projects. This program entitled Nano Argovia supports about ten projects each year from broad ranging areas of nanotechnology in close collaboration with industrial companies in Northwestern Switzerland and has a total budget of around 1.5 million Swiss francs. With the Nano Argovia program, the SNI is building an important bridge between research and application. In several cases, this collaboration has led to Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) and other follow-on projects.  Services  The SNI views itself not only as a pure research institution, but also provides various services to industrial companies. In excellently equipped workshops for technology, electronics and mechanics, internal groups and industrial companies can harness the in-depth knowledge of the staff and the outstanding technical resources of the SNI and the affiliated departments.  Sharing the fascination with others  The SNI wishes to involve the public in its fascination with the natural sciences through active communication and participation in various events. For example, the SNI team is actively involved in science festivals and fairs both at home and abroad, provides schools and groups of interested visitors with an insight into everyday laboratory life, and strives to make scientific achievement  See also  * Science and technology in Switzerland  External links  * Swiss Nanoscience Institute Category:Research institutes in Switzerland Category:Nanotechnology institutions ","title":"Swiss Nanoscience Institute"},{"id":"11220181","text":"The African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), also known as the dwarf buffalo or the Congo buffalo, is the smallest subspecies of the African buffalo. It is related to the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer), the Sudan buffalo (Syncerus caffer brachyceros), and the Nile buffalo (Syncerus caffer aequinoctialis). However, it is the only subspecies that occurs mainly in the rainforests of central and western Africa with an annual rainfall around 1,500 mm.  Description  The African forest buffalo is a small subspecies of the African buffalo. Cape buffalo weigh anywhere from 400 to 800 kg (880–1760 lbs), whereas African forest buffalo are much lighter, weighing in at 250 to 320 kg (550–705 lbs).Korte 115 Weight is not the only differentiation, however; this subspecies has a reddish-brown hide that is darker in the facial area. The shape and size of the horns distinguish African forest buffalo from the other subspecies. African forest buffalo have much smaller horns than their savanna counterparts the Cape, Sudan and Nile buffalo.Melletti M. and Burton J. (eds). 2014. Cape buffalo horns often grow and fuse together, but African forest buffalo horns rarely fuse.  Ecology  Wild African forest buffalo at Loango National Park, Gabon African forest buffalo live in the rainforests of West and Central Africa;Melletti et al. 1312 however, their home ranges typically consist of a combination of marshes, grassy savannas and the wet African rainforests. Savannas are the area where the buffalo graze, while the marshes serve as wallows and help with the insects.Korte 123 African forest buffalo are very rarely observed in the unbroken canopy of the forests.Blake 81Melletti, Penteriani, and Boitani 186 They instead spend most of their time in clearings, grazing on grasses and sedges.Melletti et al. 1313 Consequently, their diet is primarily made up of grasses and other plants that grow in clearings and savannas.van der Hoek et al. 1 The mixture of habitats is essential for the African forest buffalo. Expansion and encroachment of the rainforest on the surrounding savannas and openings are major difficulties of maintaining the ecosystem. African forest buffalo enjoy old logging roads and tracks, where the forest is thinner and grass and other foods can grow. In these areas, African forest buffalo depend on the grass that is able to develop as a result of the areas that have been previously clear-cut.Bekheis, Jong, and Prins 674 In some areas park management staff burn off the savannas on a regular basis to keep the rainforest from growing onto the savannas and changing the ecosystem of the area. Large home ranges can be associated with less-productive habitats;Korte 122 however, a larger area of open grassland has been observed to have a positive relationship with herd size.Korte 234 Home ranges remain remarkably constant and stable year after year. The only documentation of the actual home range boundaries of these animals is relatively recent, so only time will tell how these boundaries remain over large lengths of time; however, studies have shown almost no movement in range boundaries from one year to the next. Although the area included in a home range is relatively constant over time, the preferences in regard to what part of the range is most used shift with the seasons. From March until August, African forest buffalo spend most of their time in the forest, while from September through February, they favor the savannas and marshes.Korte 121 African forest buffalo arrange themselves into herds, which help in defense against predators; however, they are not immune to assault. Among predators, the African leopard is the most common, but is generally only a threat to young buffaloes and will feast on them only when they have the opportunity. The Nile crocodile is the only predator which is capable of killing an adult buffalo.Korte 116  Social behavior  Head of an African forest buffalo African forest buffalo have relatively small herds compared to the well- studied Cape buffalo. Cape buffalo can have herds of over 1,000 members; however, African forest buffalo stay in much smaller groups—as small as three and rarely over 30. If African forest buffalo are in a large group, they spend more time grazing, since there is less need to devote time to alert behavior.Melletti et al. 1315 A herd of African forest buffalo typically consists of one or occasionally two bulls and a harem of adult females, juveniles and young calves. Unlike Cape buffalo bulls, African forest buffalo bulls remain with the herd continually, year round. On the other hand, Cape buffalo bulls stay in bachelor herds until the wet season, when young bulls join the females, mate, help protect the young calves and then leave. Animals usually remain in the same herd for their entire lives. Herd-switching in cows has been observed; however, this is not a common occurrence.Korte 125 Herds can split into two groups for a short period of time before merging back together.Melletti et al. 1316 African forest buffalo are relatively unaffected by seasonal cycles. However, in the wet season, herds are more spread out in the forestMelletti et al. 1317 and these animals tend to use resting places based on sand during the wet season, but use dirt and leaves during the dry season. Moreover, in open habitats such as clearings, herds are more aggregated when resting and are more rounded in shape than herds in forest habitats during the wet season.Melletti et al. 1318>Melletti M. and Burton J.
