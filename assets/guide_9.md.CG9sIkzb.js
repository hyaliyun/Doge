It was written for and premiered by Wanda Landowska, to whom the score is dedicated. History Falla had met Wanda Landowska on several occasions in the early 1920s, and by the time she participated in the Paris premiere of Falla's El retablo de maese Pedro in June 1923, he had already decided to write a concerto for her. Although there was never a formal commission, composition began in October 1923 but work proceeded slowly. Landowska first planned to perform the work in the 1923‚Äì24 season. When Falla found it impossible to meet that deadline, Landowska discussed with Leopold Stokowski a performance as part of the Philadelphia Orchestra's 1924‚Äì25 season, but again Falla could not finish the work in time. The premiere finally took place in Barcelona on 5 November 1926, with further performances in New York and Boston . The Concerto was the last lengthy work Falla completed. Although there are several subsequent pieces in his catalogue that are important for their content, none of them lasts more than ten minutes, and his final, monumental project, the opera-oratorio Atl√°ntida, on which he worked for twenty years, remained unfinished at his death . It is commonly regarded as a model example of both mysticism (of a sort originating in Spanish religious tradition) and a severe and ascetic form of neoclassicism (as opposed to the \\"frivolous\\" neoclassicism of Igor Stravinsky) . Analysis The work is in three movements: * I: Allegro * II: Lento (giubiloso ed energico) * III: Vivace (flessibile, scherzando) An abundance of surviving documents facilitates an understanding of both the slow, meticulous creative evolution and also the structure of the work. On the one hand, there is the extensive correspondence between Wanda Landowska and Falla from the period 1922‚Äì30, and on the other hand numerous sketches, drafts, and intermediate stages of the score that are preserved in the Manuel de Falla Archive and the Archive Valent√≠n Ruiz-Aznar, both located in Granada . The second movement is inscribed at the end \\"A. Do. MCMXXVI‚ÄîIn festo Corporis Christi\\", though the composer said the date was \\"a matter of pure chance\\" .

Description It grows to between high and had phyllodes up to long and wide. The yellow globular flowerheads arise from the leaf axils in groups of two or singly. The shrub has a dense and spreading habit with glabrous branches that appear somewhat willowy. The strongly acutely angled branchlets are ribbed below the phyllodes. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The straight and dark green phyllodes are erect and crowded and have a narrowly oblong or linear to oblanceolate shape with an obscure midrib and no lateral nerves. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1858 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. His description was based on plant material collected from Tumby Bay. Distribution The species has a limited distribution and is located in the south east of the Eyre Peninsula from around the Yeelanna‚ÄìUngarra road in the north down to around Koppio and Warunda in the south where it is usually a part of open woodland or forest or scrubland communities growing in sandy soils.

The cellular architecture of C. merolae is extremely simple, containing only a single chloroplast and a single mitochondrion and lacking a vacuole and cell wall. In addition, the cellular and organelle divisions can be synchronized. For these reasons, C. merolae is considered an excellent model system for study of cellular and organelle division processes, as well as biochemistry and structural biology. The organism's genome was the first full algal genome to be sequenced in 2004; its plastid was sequenced in 2000 and 2003, and its mitochondrion in 1998. The organism has been considered the simplest of eukaryotic cells for its minimalist cellular organization. Growing the red alga C. merolae in flasks and a 10-liter carboy. Although classified as a red alga, C. merolae is blue-green: it makes little if any of the red pigment phycoerythrin, and hence only displays the second red-algal pigment, phycocyanin, and the green pigment chlorophyll.  Isolation and growth in culture  Originally isolated by De Luca in 1978 from the solfatane fumaroles of Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy), C. merolae can be grown in culture in the laboratory in Modified Allen‚Äôs medium (MA) or a modified form with twice the concentration of some elements called MA2. Using MA medium, growth rates are not particularly fast, with a doubling time (the time it takes a culture of microbes to double in cells per unit volume) of approximately 32 hours. By using the more optimal medium MA2, this can be reduced to 24 hours. Culturing is done at 42 ¬∞C under white fluorescent light with an approximate intensity of 50 ¬µmol photons m‚àí2 s‚àí1 (¬µE). However, under a higher light intensity of 90 ¬µE with 5% CO2 applied through bubbling, the growth rate of C. merolae can be further increased, with a doubling time of approximately 9.2 hours. Higher light is not necessarily beneficial, as above 90 ¬µE the growth rate begins to decrease. This may be due to photodamage occurring to the photosynthetic apparatus. C. merolae can also be grown on gellan gum plates for purposes of colony selection or strain maintenance in the laboratory. C. merolae is an obligate oxygenic phototroph, meaning it is not capable of taking up fixed carbon from its environment and must rely on oxygenic photosynthesis to fix carbon from CO2.  Genome  The 16.5 megabase pair genome of C. merolae was sequenced in 2004. The reduced, extremely simple, compact genome is made up of 20 chromosomes and was found to contain 5,331 genes, of which 86.3% were found to be expressed and only 26 contain introns, which contained strict consensus sequences. Strikingly, the genome of C. merolae contains only 30 tRNA genes and an extremely minimal number of ribosomal RNA gene copies, as shown in the genome comparison table. The reduced nature of the genome has led to several other unusual features. While most eukaryotes contain 10 or so copies of the dynamins required for pinching membranes to separate dividing compartments, C. merolae only contains two, a fact that researchers have taken advantage of when studying organelle division. Although possessing a small genome, the chloroplast genome of C. merolae contains many genes not present in the chloroplast genomes of other algae and plants. Most of its genes are intronless.  Molecular biology  As is the case with most model organisms, genetic tools have been developed in C. merolae. These include methods for the isolation of DNA and RNA from C. merolae, the introduction of DNA into C. merolae for transient or stable transformation, and methods for selection including a uracil auxotroph that can be used as a selection marker. =DNA isolation = Several methods, derived from cyanobacterial protocols, are used for the isolation of DNA from C. merolae. The first is a hot phenol extraction, which is a quick extraction that can be used to isolate DNA suitable for amplification by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), wherein phenol is added to whole cells and incubated at 65 ¬∞C to extract DNA. If purer DNA is required, the CTAB (Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) method may be employed. In this method, a high-salt extraction buffer is first applied and cells are disrupted, after which a chloroform-phenol mixture is used to extract the DNA at room temperature. =RNA isolation= Total RNA may be extracted from C. merolae cells using a variant of the hot phenol method described above for DNA. =Protein extraction= As is the case for DNA and RNA, the protocol for protein extraction is also an adaptation of the protocol used in cyanobacteria. Cells are disrupted using glass beads and vortexing in a 10% glycerol buffer containing the reducing agent DTT to break disulfide bonds within proteins. This extraction will result in denatured proteins, which can be used in SDS-PAGE gels for Western blotting and Coomassie staining. =Transformant selection and uracil auxotrophic line= C. merolae is sensitive to many antibiotics commonly used for selection of successfully transformed individuals in the laboratory, but it resistant to some, notably ampicillin and kanamycin. A commonly used selection marker for transformation in C. merolae involves a uracil auxotroph (requiring exogenous uracil). The mutant was developed by growing C. merolae in the presence of a compound, 5-FOA, which in and of itself is non-toxic but is converted to the toxic compound 5-fluorouracil by an enzyme in the uracil biosynthetic pathway, orotidine 5‚Ä≤-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase, encoded by the Ura5.3 gene. Random mutation led to several loss-of-function mutants in Ura5.3, which allowed cells to survive in the presence of 5-FOA as long as uracil was provided. By transforming this mutant with a PCR fragment carrying both a gene of interest and a functional copy of Ura5.3, researchers can confirm that the gene of interest has been incorporated into the C. merolae genome if it can grow without exogenous uracil. =Polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated transient expression= While chromosomal integration of genes creates a stable transformant, transient expression allows short-term experiments to be done using labeled or modified genes in C. merolae. Transient expression can be achieved using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) based method in protoplasts (plant cells with the rigid cell wall enzymatically eliminated), and because C. merolae lacks a cell wall, it behaves much as a protoplast would for transformation purposes. To transform, cells are briefly exposed to 30% PEG with the DNA of interest, resulting in transient transformation. In this method, the DNA is taken up as a circular element and is not integrated into the genome of the organism because no homologous regions exist for integration. =Gene targeting= To create a stable mutant line, gene targeting can be used to insert a gene of interest into a particular location of the C. merolae genome via homologous recombination. By including regions of DNA several hundred base pairs long on the ends of the gene of interest that are complementary to a sequence within the C. merolae genome, the organism‚Äôs own DNA repair machinery can be used to insert the gene at these regions. The same transformation procedure as is used for transient expression can be used here, except with the homologous DNA segments to allow for genome integration.

Studying cell and organelle divisions The extremely simple divisome, simple cell architecture, and ability to synchronize divisions in C. merolae makes it the perfect organism for studying mechanisms of eukaryotic cell and organelle division. Synchronization of the division of organelles in cultured cells can be very simple and usually involves the use of light and dark cycles. The chemical agent aphidicolin can be added to easily and effectively synchronize chloroplast division. The peroxisome division mechanism was first ascertained using C. merolae as a system, where peroxisome division can be synchronized using the microtubule-disrupting drug oryzalin in addition to light-dark cycles. Photosynthesis research C. merolae is also used in researching photosynthesis. Notably, the subunit composition of the photosystems in C. merolae has some significant differences from that of other related organisms. Photosystem II (PSII) of C. merolae, as might be expected, has a particularly unusual pH range in which it can function. Despite the fact that the mechanism of PSII requires protons to be quickly released, and lower pH solutions should alter the ability to do this, C. merolae PSII is capable of exchanging and splitting water at the same rate as other related species.

The UAE has an embassy in Damascus while Syria maintains an embassy in Abu Dhabi and a consulate-general in Dubai. Both countries are part of the Middle East region and share close cultural ties. Diplomatic relations In 2011, the Syrian civil war began. On 25 September 2013, Foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said that UAE would continue to support the Syrian people and their legitimate aspirations for restoring security and stability to the country. The UAE is not actively supporting the government of Bashar Al-Assad. On 13 January 2014, Vice President, Prime Minister and Emir of Dubai Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said that there could be no long-term solution to ending the war with Assad in power, and predicted that the Syrian president would eventually lose power. The UAE stance on the Syrian conflict has been described as \\"less aggressive\\" than Saudi Arabia or Qatar - but, unlike Egypt, not \\"favourable to Assad\\". However, it has exhibited openness to Assad remaining in power as part of a peace settlement. It has been critical of Saudi, Qatari and Turkish support for Islamist rebel groups in Syria. The UAE took part in the 2014 American-led intervention in Syria against ISIL. It later broke with Saudi Arabia by supporting the 2015 Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, maintaining it was against a \\"common enemy\\". It also reportedly provided funding for the moderate Southern Front, through an Amman-based Military Operations Center, although this Center has been inactive since 2017. Alongside the United States, it has been involved in supporting and training the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) from 2017 onwards. Along with Egypt and Russia, it also supports the Syria's Tomorrow Movement, which has a military wing, the Elite Forces, that is part of the SDF. The UAE initially floated normalising relations with Syria in 2016 in order to reduce Syrian dependence on Iran, but the suggestion was rejected by the United States. In April 2018, Emirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash stated, \\"Our position on the Syrian crisis is very clear: a few years ago we had a choice ‚Äî to support Bashar Assad or the opposition, which was joined by jihadists and even many terrorist elements, and we chose to be somewhere between. We confirm the need for a political solution in Syria. It is impossible to achieve stability in this country through a military solution.\\" In June 2018, Gargash criticised the decision to suspend Syrian membership of the Arab League, noting, \\"it meant we had no political leverage at all, no open channel, we could not present an Arab prism to how the Syrian issue should be resolved.\\" In November 2018, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates was negotiating with Syria over the reopening of its embassy in Damascus, already had a diplomat permanently stationed there, and was acting as an intermediary between Syria and Saudi Arabia in reconciliation talks involving those two countries. On 27 December 2018, the United Arab Emirates announced it had reopened its embassy in Damascus, after over 6 years of closure. The UAE issued a statement that said the country was \\"keen to put relations back on their normal track\\", while Gargash tweeted that \\"An Arab role in Syria has become even more necessary to face the regional expansionism of Iran and Turkey.\\" In early January 2019, following the embassy opening, Emirates, FlyDubai and Etihad announced plans to fly to Syria again, but no announcement has been made regarding when flights will restart. In an attempt to restore ties with the Syrian government, the UAE hosted a Syrian trade delegation in January 2019. The meeting was led by a businessman and lawmaker who has been on US Treasury sanctions list since 2011. On 29 January 2019, the UAE Minister of State of Foreign Affairs said regarding the Israeli strikes on Syria that the UAE supported Syria and a united capable Arab Syria. However, he also said that the UAE was against the Iranians' presence in Syria and that the dispute is caused by the freedom of movement Iran has in Syria. In December 2019, the UAE's charges d'affairs in Damascus, Abdul Hakim Ibrahim al-Nuaimi, praised the \\"wise leadership of President Bashar al-Assad\\" and described relations between the countries as \\"solid, distinct and strong\\". Syrian deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad responded by stating, \\"We cannot forget that the United Arab Emirates stood by Syria in its war against terrorism\\".

He was born Xiong Zhen () and King Zhao was his posthumous title. Documents unearthed in the former state also show his title as King Shao ().Dong Shan (Ëë£Áèä) Excavated document: Posthumous names of the Chu kings ‚Äìappendix to the Zuo Zhuan, Archaeological Records Research Journal, Volume 2, Shanghai Fudan University Publishing, August 2008. King Zhao was the son of King Ping of Chu. Life In 506 BCE, King Hel√º of the State of Wu led an army to invade Chu. His army was commanded by the military strategist Sun Tzu, author of The Art of War, as well as Wu Zixu, a Chu exile whose father and brother were killed by King Ping of Chu. The Wu army routed the Chu army at the historic Battle of Boju, and the Chu commander Nang Wa fled to the state of Zheng. The Wu army pursued the remaining Chu troops, won several more battles, and captured Ying, the capital of Chu. Chu general Shen Yin Shu defeated the Wu army but was severely wounded, and was killed by a Chu officer at his own request. King Zhao was forced to flee. During the escape he was wounded by a Chu arrow at Yunmeng from where he made his way through Yun to the State of Sui in northern Hubei. Chu Minister of State Shen Baoxu () meanwhile headed for the State of Qin to plead for assistance from their army. At first, the Qin ruler Duke Ai was non- committal in his response but after Shen spent seven days kneeling and wailing in the Qin palace courtyard, Duke Ai was moved by his devotion and agreed to send troops to assist Chu. Thereafter the Wu army retreated and King Zhao returned to the Chu capital at Ying. In Zhuangzi, a story is recorded regarding a sheep-butcher named Yue (), a subject of King Zhao that fled from Chu when Wu attacked. Yue followed King Zhao, and returned with him when King Zhao returned to his capital. King Zhao wanted to give Yue gifts for what King Zhao saw as Yue's loyalty, but due to Yue's moral beliefs, Yue refused to accept any gifts despite repeated offers.https://ctext.org/zhuangzi/kings-who- have-wished-to-resign?searchu=Ê•öÊò≠ÁéãÂ§±Âúã In 489 BCE, King Zhao witnessed the inauspicious meteorological phenomenon known as ‚ÄúClouds like numerous red birds pressing the day to fly‚Äù (). Not long afterwards, King Fuchai of Wu attacked the State of Chen and Chen requested assistance from King Zhao. The king led his troops personally and was killed during a subsequent battle. Family King Zhao was married to Zhen Jiang (), daughter of the Marquess of Qi () whilst his mother was Bo Ying (). He also had one sister and at least three elder brothers born by concubines, namely Shen (), Jie () and Qi (), sometimes known by their courtesy names as Zixi (), Ziqi () and Zil√º ().

Description The shrub typically grows to a height of and has a decumbent or spreading shrub. The branchlets have tiny hairs between resinous ridges and tend to be angled at the extremities. Like most Acacias it has phyllodes instead of true leaves. They have a narrowly oblanceolate to linear shape and can be straight or slightly curved. The glabrous phyllodes are in length and and have a prominent midvein. It generally blooms between June and September producing simple inflorescences that occur in pairs in the axils and have spherical flower- heads with a diameter of and contain four to eight loosely packed bright yellow flowers. The firmly papery to thinly leathery seed pods that form after flowering are straight to strongly curved with a length of and a width of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1842 as part of William Jackson Hooker's work Notes on Mimoseae, with a synopsis of species as published in the London Journal of Botany. It was reclassified in 1987 as Racosperma flexifolium by Leslie Pedley, then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2001.

These clouds which are opaque to visible light, are a mixture of gas and dust and are the regions where stars are formed. Coreshine offers a new tool for observing the earliest phases of star formation, a process effectively hidden up to now. The scattered mid-infrared light, found throughout our galaxy, could reveal the origins of the cloud material, the size and density of the dust particles, the age of the core region, the distribution of the dust and gas, and the chemical processes taking place deep inside the cloud. The phenomenon was first studied seriously with NASA‚Äôs Spitzer Space Telescope. Researchers Laurent Pagani (CNRS, Paris Observatory), J√ºrgen Steinacker (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy) and colleagues from the California Institute of Technology and Laboratoire d‚ÄôAstrophysique de l‚ÄôObservatoire de Grenoble, discovered surprisingly bright mid-infrared radiation from the core of the molecular cloud L183 in the constellation Serpens Cauda 360 light-years away. Using computer simulations, it became clear that they were observing light scattered by particles of around 1 micrometer in diameter. In a follow-up they studied 110 molecular clouds, at distances between 300 and 1300 light-years, and which had been part of previous Spitzer surveys. The results showed that coreshine is a widespread phenomenon and was present in about half the clouds studied. Clouds in the southern constellation Vela show no coreshine and it is thought that this has been brought about by recorded supernova explosions in the region, blowing away or destroying larger dust particles. Coreshine will lead to new projects for both the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescope, the latter of which is due to be launched in 2021.Universe TodayDirect evidence of dust growth in L183 from mid-infrared light scattering - Astronomy & Astrophysics See also *Infrared Space Observatory External links *Depletion and low gas temperature in the L183 (= L134N) prestellar core: the N2H+ - N2D+ tool *L183 (L134N) Revisited * References Observational astronomy Pre-stellar cores ","title":"Coreshine"},{"id":"28935037","text":"Karl Ludvig Reichelt (1 September 1877 ‚Äì 13 March, 1952) was a Norwegian Lutheran missionary and religious scholar who worked in China.

In 1906, he had an experience that would be crucial to his later work when he undertook his first visit to the famous Buddhist Weishan monastery close to town. He later wrote that he just gave a glimpse of a unique and exclusive world of deep religious mysticism, of heartbreaking tragedy, but also immensely rich. He felt that God called him to a special way to work among Buddhists, and cultivate a friendly dialogue with the monks and the enlightened Buddhist laity. This he used some force to his years in Hunan and Hubei, first as a pioneer missionary (to 1911, when he returned to Norway for a time), then as a teacher in the NT at the priest school in (1913‚Äì1920). He was particularly suited to the study of Buddhism and the Buddhist religious writings. In 1919 he had the opportunity to be involved in renaming a Buddhist monk. During a stay in Norway from 1920 to 1922 he got the green light from the NMS to build a Christian center of the Buddhist monks to come and stay for shorter or longer time, and there have personal contact with Christianity. He travelled in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany and the United States to generate interest for his project, and also received some pledges of support, including from the Church of Sweden and the Danish Mission Association. A coordination committee for the mission companies in the three Scandinavian countries, was established to guarantee a minimum amount of support in case the gift supply would not reach the expected size. NMS also promised to pay him wages, even though he would work on his own. Reichelt and missionary Notto Normann Thelle then went back and got their planned center, called the Ching Fong Shan (\\"the shining wind rock\\"), just outside Nanjing. It was not long before the first itinerant Buddhist monks found their way to the Christian \\"monastery\\", and eventually, the number of such visitors in approximately 1,000 per year, and most were there for a longer or shorter period. Some were Christian and were baptized. In his meeting with China's Buddhist monks,Karl Ludvig Reichelt developed a new view on mission work that made him controversial. Particularly controversial was his view of God's revelation and the religions (especially Buddhism) as a preparation for the gospel (praeparatio evangelica), his dialogical method, and his positive evaluation of other religions. NMS became concerned that Reichelt openness to Buddhism went too far, especially when Reichelt meant to find \\"points of light and connection points brought forth by God's Holy Spirit ... in their sacred writings (and) in their rituals and thinking systems \\". It ended with NMS calling Reichelt home for consultations due to this and some financial problems, and it ended with the split from Reichelt in 1925. In 1926, Reichelt founded The Nordic Christian Buddhist Mission (or the Nordic-East Asia Mission, later the Areopagus). Work continued in Nanjing, and in 1927, 22 Chinese people were baptized. But the same year the mission station was destroyed during a riot, and Reichelt and Thelle had to flee the city. For two years they worked in Shanghai. In 1929 Reichelt built the institution Tao Fong Shan (\\"the mountain where the wind blows Logo\\") in Sha Tin in the Sha Tin District of the New Territories in Hong Kong. This institute has since been the seat of the Buddhist Mission's work in China. He left China in 1947, and settled down in Hong Kong in 1951. He died at the Tao Fong Shan in Hong Kong on 13 March 1952.  Writings  Karl Ludvig Reichelt wrote both scholarly and popular literature. He wrote several books in Chinese and several works on East Asia religions, including Religions of China (1st ed. 1913) and From Convenience Types and shrines in East Asia (Three volumes, 1947‚Äì1949).  Awards and legacy  Reichelt was awarded the St. Olav's Medal in 1939 and was appointed honorary doctor at Uppsala University for his extensive research on Eastern religious life in 1941.

Measuring velocity is sometimes called velocity tracking. The velocity metric is used for planning sprints and measuring team performance. There is no scientific evidence that measuring velocity improves planning effectiveness or team performance. Furthermore, the metric can be misleading. Terminology The following terminology is used in velocity tracking. ; Unit of work: The unit chosen by the team to measure velocity. This can either be a real unit like engineer-hours, engineer-days or Product Backlog Items (PBI), or story points. Each task in the software development process should then be valued in terms of the chosen unit. ; Interval: The interval is the duration of each iteration in the software development process for which the velocity is measured. The length of an interval is determined by the team. Most often, the interval is a week, but it can be as long as a month. Principle The main idea behind velocity is to help teams estimate how much work they can complete in a given time period based on how quickly similar work was previously completed. Velocity is relative measure. In other words, the raw numbers mean little; it is the trend that matters. Criticism One problem with velocity is that it conflates work done with planning accuracy. In other words, a team can inflate velocity by estimating tasks more conservatively. If a team says that a task will take four hours or is worth 4 points instead of taking two hours or being worth two points, their velocity will look better (sometimes called point inflation). Velocity should not be used as a performance metric. A second problem with velocity is that it does not take quality, alignment with user goals or priority into account. Velocity can be increased by neglecting good design, refactoring, coding standards and technical debt. Simply completing features as quickly as possible increases velocity regardless of quality. Similarly, velocity includes work done regardless of the benefits of that work. For example, building a feature no one wants or needs still counts as \\"work done‚Äù and completing a work unit which moves away from a user goal such as ease of use is movement in the opposite of the direction desired. This makes ‚Äúvelocity‚Äù in Agile more like the concept of directionless ‚Äúspeed‚Äù from physics. A third problem with velocity is that it is often misused as a measure of efficiency or team performance. Velocity is a metric of work done, not efficiency. Velocity can be increased by working overtime or adding team members, neither of which necessarily increase efficiency or performance. In summary, velocity is a problematic metric because it is easy to manipulate and often misused as an indicator of efficiency.

He authored numerous academic articles and assisted in the development of clinical guidelines on the standard of care in treating patients with suspected myocardial infarction by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. He performed numerous research investigations in chest pain patients, reporting the usefulness of continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring, two- hour delta cardiac marker testing, and nuclear cardiac stress testing in the emergency department. The culmination of his studies was The Erlanger Chest Pain Evaluation Protocol published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2002. In 2011 he published a novel Nashville Skyline that received a 5 star review by ForeWord Reviews. His most recent research involved the risk stratification of chest pain patients in the emergency department. Background Born in 1959 in Atlanta, Georgia, Fesmire grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee and graduated high school Valedictorian from the Baylor School in 1978. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard College in 1981. Fesmire graduated from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1985 and completed a residency in Emergency Medicine at University Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida in 1988 where he received the Outstanding Resident Award. In 1992 Fesmire was elected as a Fellow of American College of Emergency Physicians. He practiced as an emergency physician at Chattanooga Memorial Hospital from 1988 until 1991 and had been practicing at Erlanger Baroness Hospital from 1991 until his death in 2014. Awards Fesmire received the Emergency Medicine Foundation's Young Investigator Award in 1996 for his work in developing a rapid protocol for the evaluation of chest pain patients. In 2006, he received the Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine for a 1988 case report detailing the use of digital rectal massage as a cure for persistent hiccups. In 2008, Dr Fesmire was named a Hero of Emergency Medicine by the American College of Emergency Physicians. He later on told New Scientist in an interview that he found a \\"treatment sure to be more popular with hiccup patients. ‚ÄúAn orgasm results in incredible stimulation of the vagus nerve. From now on, I will be recommending sex ‚Äì culminating with orgasm ‚Äì as the cure-all for intractable hiccups.‚Äù\\" Later work At the time of his death, Fesmire lived in Chattanooga with his wife and two sons.

Social security in Africa  Countries across Africa are at different stages of creating comprehensive and inclusive social security systems. Although some are further along this journey than others, most have introduced some form of arrangement for pension provision or have social security as a strategic goal. Similar to global trends, the vast majority of retirement income in Africa is funded by governments, derived from taxes or other forms of government revenue (essentially a pay-as-you-go system or PAYG). With a large proportion of formal sector workers concentrated in the civil service, pension funds for public sector workers are well established and benefits are often more substantial compared to the private sector. Defined Benefit (DB) schemes dominate across the continent although regional differences are notable. While DB schemes are common in many Francophone West African countries, the Maghreb region as well as Egypt & Sudan, Defined Contribution (DC) schemes (often provident schemes) are prevalent in English-speaking parts of Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa.Stewart and Yermo, OECD paper Coverage on the continent however, is much lower compared to the rest of the world. Data from the International Labour Office‚Äôs 2014/15 World Social Protection Report estimates that currently only 16.9% of older people in sub-Saharan Africa receive an old age pension. Although this number is higher in North Africa at 36.7%, it is still considerably lower than much of the developed world (90% in North America and Europe). A recent report on the pension sector in the East African Community estimates that between 80-90% of the population is not reached via public or private pension fund schemes. In part, this is due to the unique circumstances in Africa including demographics (young population), a large informal employment sector, migration with limited pension portability, and dependency on government finances. The pace of regulatory reform has also led to divergent coverage trends between countries and regions. To meet this challenge, Africa has been on a journey to design, finance and deliver social security to the continent. Many countries have transitioned in line with the multi-pillar model proposed by the World Bank in their 2005 report[1] and subsequent refinements. While each country has forged its own distinctive path, two main areas of focus have emerged. The first is the introduction of a basic safety net or non-contributory pension for those who have no other income. Pension systems provide a way of securing long-term savings but also an indirect way to alleviate poverty, which affects many on the continent. A number of African countries including South Africa, Namibia, Mauritius and LesothoFor example, research shows that 60 per cent of the monthly pension received by persons aged 70 or older in Lesotho is redirected consistently to children. Evidence also suggests that this mechanism has halved Lesotho‚Äôs hunger rate (Croome and Mapetla, 2007) have used non- contributory universal pensions as a foundation for broad social security coverage. Many pensioners spend their pension income on books, school fees and health care for grandchildren. Research suggests transmission via a basic retirement income has the ability to significantly alleviate poverty and directly impact socioeconomic factors. The second trend has been a move from unfunded to funded solutions, and DB to DC schemes, albeit at a slower pace than in developed countries. This is a broad reflection of the increased pressure on government budgets, and the unsustainable fiscal burden that PAYG pension systems create. African economies have made great strides to shape their social security systems. Importantly, the continent has been building institutions that account for African priorities and their unique challenges. Regulators have looked beyond the developed world experience to regions such as Latin America and Eastern Europe for their learnings. Nigeria for example was the first on the continent to explore the Chilean-style individual-funded accounts and also cites Mexico as a country they examined as part of their reform journey. Extending and ensuring an adequate level of social security remains a continually evolving process as governments and regulators across the world adapt to changes in the environment and financial markets, no less so in Africa.  Equatorial Guinea Equatorial Guinea has enjoyed some of the highest growth rates in the world (37% a year on average in the past 10 years), based largely on its oil sector. With an economy 20 times bigger than it was in the mid-90s, the government can now afford to start expanding its social programs, especially as tremendous inequality means that despite a $14,941 average GDP per capita ($30,000 according to UN population estimates), over 75% of the population live below the poverty line and over 40% in extreme poverty.Rebecca Holmes (2009) Social protection to tackle child poverty in Equatorial Guinea London: Overseas Development Institute One particularly vulnerable group in Equatorial Guinea are the under-18s, who make up 50% of the population and whose poor levels of nutrition and education risk the country's future stability and economic growth. The country's under-five child mortality rate is the fourth highest in the world, and maternal mortality is also very high. Costs remain a key barrier to access to key public services and, despite few waivers for the particularly vulnerable, confusion prevents many from taking advantage. Low demand, as well as poor supply, of public services is also important in understanding the limits to social protection and poverty relief in Equatorial Guinea. Despite the free provision of primary education and enrollment being relatively high, net primary school attendance rates are low, at 61% for boys and 60% for girls in 2000‚Äì2007, according to UNICEF data. Drop-out rates are high and only 33% reach the last grade of primary school, while at secondary school net attendance rates are even lower, at 23% for boys and 22% for girls. A key cause is that children are involved in child labor, in 2001, a UNICEF study showed that 51% of boys and 58% of girls worked during school hours. Youth migration (over 50% of have moved to urban areas and do not live with their parents) and sexual exploitation risk their development and Equatorial Guinea's. A small formal social security system does exist but reaches only a small proportion of the employed (or formerly employed) in the urban formal sector and social protection coverage for the poor is very limited. One promising recent initiative is the establishment of the Social Needs Fund, financed by the Government and administered by USAID, and is designed to bring in international technical expertise to support institutional capacity building in the social sectors and to support social sector service delivery. Mali Mali has made significant economic progress (on average 5% a year between 1994 and 2006) considering a series of adverse economic shocks (such as drought) and has made some progress on reducing poverty and poverty related indicators, yet poverty remains high at 59.2% in 2006 and as in many sub-Saharan African countries, children make up a high proportion of the population - 54% in the case of MaliPaola Pereznieto (2009) Social protection to tackle child poverty in Mali London: Overseas Development Institute. Mali‚Äôs National Social Protection Policy recognises the multiple dimensions of social protection that correspond to a range of social, economic, health and environmental risks. Its main focus is health-related risks and interventions, with areas of the strategy that relate to the social and economic risks of the poor classified as ‚Äòsocial development‚Äô, including ‚Äòsocial action and social assistance‚Äô, e.g. ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô children (defined as those living without parental care or in households where the head has disabilities or is ill) qualify for some forms of social assistance. There are also movements towards expanding social security. Two new health-related social protection programmes, the Compulsory Medical Insurance (AMO) and the Medical Assistance Regime (RAMED) are to start operating in 2010. AMO‚Äôs beneficiaries will be active or retired functionaries, formal sector employees, and members of parliament. RAMED aims to provide free health care to the destitute (those proven to have no sources of income). Mali's social protection programmes are addressed in one of the three pillars of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP), which refers to strengthening the social sector through risk mitigation and social protection for the poorest and most marginalised groups, extending better social protection coverage for the whole population. However, criticisms remain that the main focus of the GPRSP 2007‚Äì2011 is the other two pillars: ‚Äòdevelopment of infrastructure in the productive sector‚Äô and ‚Äòconsolidation of structural reforms‚Äô. Financial limits remain a major barrier to the extension of social protection. Other criticisms relate to the need to address to the demand for public services, as well as the supply side.

Arriving in Grenada, he made business while drawing plans and views for the governor. From 1776 to 1782, Dumoulin was a witness to the American War of Independence, drawing several naval battles between the French Navy and the British Royal Navy. Returned to Vevey in 1783, he turned his sketches of the battles into oil paintings and watercolours, earning his life diving drawing lessons. Between 1795 and 1797, Dumoulin was in Paris, where he took lessons in anatomy, copied ancient paintings in the Louvre, attended the Academy and the School of naval constructions. Two of his paintings of naval battles were exposed at the 1796 Salon. Back to Vevey in 1797, he opened a class in technical drawing.

The film features performances by Herman's Hermits and stars the band as fictionalized versions of themselves. The soundtrack was released as an album, also called Hold On!. Plot When the children of American astronauts choose \\"Herman's Hermits\\" as the \\"good luck name\\" of the next Gemini space capsule, NASA scientist Edward Lindquist is sent by U.S. State Department official Colby Grant to shadow the band on tour. His orders are to find out all he can about them to stave off a \\"P.R. nightmare\\". (Grant fears that putting the band's name on the rocket will make the world think the U.S. is \\"still a colony of Great Britain\\".) Aspiring starlet Cecilie Bannister hires a publicity agent and photographer to take photos of her with Herman and the band, sure that this publicity boost will get her a new contract with a movie studio. They take an unflattering picture during a riot of teenage girls at Los Angeles International Airport but the misleading story in the newspapers leads Lindquist to believe that Bannister is an \\"old friend\\" of Herman's. Likewise, Bannister believes that Lindquist is a writer and part of the band's entourage as they pump each other for information about the band that neither of them really has. Herman and his bandmates, mobbed wherever they appear, are sequestered in their rooms at the Miramar Hotel by their manager, Dudley, in advance of a charity benefit performance. Herman sees teens playing on the beach and wishes he could be one of them, meet the girl of his dreams, and fall in love. Mrs. Page, the benefit organizer, introduces Herman to her daughter, Louisa, who offers to show him the sights of Los Angeles. Denied by Dudley, Herman and the Hermits sneak off to Pacific Ocean Park where they split up, reasoning correctly that if they don't stick together, nobody will recognize them. Herman finds Louisa and falls in love while the other band members explore the park. Believing that the boys have been kidnapped, Dudley calls in the police. Lindquist and Herman meet up again on the roller coaster and the scientist realizes than Bannister has been feeding him false information. Cleared of the kidnapping charges, Lindquist comes clean to the band about his mission and they arrange to have Grant see the band perform at the charity benefit. When teens overrun the country club, the mayhem convinces Grant to cancel the rocket naming but nationwide teen protests force NASA to name the capsule \\"Herman's Hermits\\". During a climactic concert for 50,000 fans at the Rose Bowl, the band is whisked by hypersonic jet to Cape Kennedy for the rocket launch and back in time to finish the concert and play one more song before the credits roll. Cast *Peter Noone (credited onscreen as \\"Peter Blair Noone\\") is Herman, the leader of Herman's Hermits, a real-life English rock band comparable in popularity at the time to The Beatles. While forced to take elaborate security procedures to avoid being \\"torn apart\\" by mobs of teenaged fans, Herman laments that he has nobody to talk to and dreams of meeting a woman who will love him for himself. *Karl Green (as Karl), Keith Hopwood (as Keith), Derek Leckenby (as Derek), and Barry Whitwam (as Barry) are the other four real-life members of Herman's Hermits. Playing supporting roles to Herman, they too wish to see America up close instead of just through a window. All five band members play fictionalized versions of themselves. *Herbert Anderson plays Ed Lindquist, a NASA scientist with a nervous nature who is assigned to follow the band across the country by State Department official Colby Grant (Harry Hickox) to determine whether the U.S. can name a Gemini space capsule after the band. Lindquist is initially opposed to the assignment and even faints during his first encounter with the band. He grows to like and accept the young rockers as being \\"like boys anywhere\\" and supports the effort to name the capsule for them. *Sue Ane Langdon plays Cecilie Bannister, an actress whose studio contract has expired. She believes that associating herself with Herman's Hermits will give her enough publicity to get a new contract and more acting jobs. To this end, she hires a publicity man (Mickey Deems) and his photographer (Phil Arnold) while devising ever more elaborate schemes to get close to the band. *Shelley Fabares plays Louisa Page, daughter of Mrs. Page (Hortense Petra), a young woman for whom Herman falls in love at first sight. Louisa convinces her mother to have Herman's Hermits play at a charity benefit. *Bernard Fox plays Dudley, a fictionalized version of the band's real-life manager, Mickie Most. He seeks to protect these young men both from the public and from themselves but the band chafes under his strict control. Louisa inspires Herman to lead the band's escape from their hotel which begins to tie the movie's three main plotlines together. Production info Hold On!, largely an excuse to string together performances by Herman's Hermits, stars the band as themselves on tour across the United States. The band had already appeared in a film for MGM produced by Sam Katzman When the Boys Meet the Girls. Katzman decided to put the band in their own film.Herman's Hermits---Anything but a Secluded Existence Scott, John L. Los Angeles Times 15 Oct 1965: D13. The Beatles and The Dave Clark Five had already appeared in films. Peter Noone later joked, \\"where we jumped out of the loop was‚Ä¶the Beatles ran away from girls and the Dave Clark Five ran away from girls, but we slowed down for the really sexy ones. So we set a new standard for British rock bands!\\" The film began production as There's No Place Like Space. James B Gordon was signed to write the script in August 1965.MOVIE CALL SHEET: Train Wreck Derails Film Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 11 Aug 1965: d12. Filming started in October 1965. The film's name was changed to A Must to Avoid and songwriter P. F. Sloan was commissioned to write a theme song in less than two days. He completed the song and it appears in the film but the studio, realizing the negative connotation of calling a movie A Must to Avoid, then changed the movie's name to Hold On!. Sloan wrote that title song as well. Noone said \\"so they wrote a scene, basically, where I was on a rollercoaster and where I would hold on. D‚Äôyou see what I mean? It sounds like wild, wacky stuff, but it was all real!\\" Noone later said Lubin \\"was the real thing... He was amazing. And he was a real gentleman. He gave us all kinds of good advice. I was already an actor ‚Äì I‚Äôd already gone through acting school and stuff like that ‚Äì but none of the others had. They were just thrown into the deep end. And he gave them time to be‚Ä¶themselves, basically.\\" A total of eleven songs, ten sung by Herman's Hermits and one by Shelley Fabares, appear in the film. Noone: > We had total control over the songs, and we just did mad stuff. They said, > ‚ÄúWhat song do you want to sing in the spaceship?‚Äù And we said, ‚ÄúLeaning on a > Lamppost.‚Äù It‚Äôs just odd, really, that we would go there. But Arthur Lubin > went with it.

But they let us do just about whatever we wanted. A ten-song soundtrack album was released by MGM Records in the U.S. and Canada and a six-song EP in the United Kingdom by Columbia/EMI. The film was shot in Metrocolor with the Panavision photographic process at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The film's theatrical soundtrack is monaural. Songs *\\"Hold On\\" - Written by P.F.

The New York Times called the film \\"an occasionally amusing but nonsensical pastiche\\" that served \\"as the cement to hold together the song sequences of Herman's Hermits\\". Other contemporary reviewers were more forgiving, with The Film Daily calling Hold On! a \\"fun and frolic in a formula vein\\" with the presence of Herman's Hermits making of \\"a foregone boxoffice win\\" with \\"youngsters\\". Boys' Life described the film as only for \\"swingers who are really with it\\". In December 2000, the Denver Post described the band as \\"a Backstreet Boys for their time\\" in an article titled \\"Not quite like Hard Day's Night\\". An April 2010 review in the Boston Globe noted that The Beatles in A Hard Day's Night and Help! made getting a \\"British Invasion band to play themselves in a movie with a made-up story\\" look \\"so easy\\" that MGM believed that Herman's Hermits could share similar success but that with Hold On! the \\"only similarity to Help! is the exclamation mark\\". Diabolique magazine said \\"Shelley Fabares is wasted and the film‚Äôs quality is a long way from A Hard Day‚Äôs Night... but it is full of high spirits and features eleven Herman‚Äôs Hermits tunes.\\" =Home video= The film was broadcast nationally on August 21, 1970, as part of the CBS Friday Night Movie series. For many years, the film was not available on home video in the United States. Turner Classic Movies (TCM) ranked the demand for Hold On! as #380 on the TCM Not-On-Home Video list. While TCM does broadcast the film once or twice a year, in September 2010 USA Today described the film as \\"rarely seen\\". The film was finally made available on DVD in 2011 through the Warner Archive Collection.http://www.wbshop.com/Hold-On/1000203444,default,pd.html See also *List of American films of 1966 References External links *Hold On! at the Herman's Hermits official website  * 1966 films American musical comedy films American films American rock music films Films directed by Arthur Lubin Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films 1966 musical comedy films English-language films Films set in Los Angeles 1966 comedy films ","title":"Hold On!

He is a member of the Progress Party and an expert on international relations. Early life and education Norheim was born in Porsgrunn. He is the son of Helge Kristian Norheim. He received a Cand. Polit. degree in Political Science from the University of Oslo and an M.A. in Southeast European Studies from the National & Karpostrain University of Athens. He was leader of the Youth of the Progress Party in Telemark from 1993 to 1994, but left the party in 1994 following the 1994 Progress Party national convention and joined the Free Democrats. Career From 1995 to 1999, he sat in the municipal council in Siljan for the Conservative Party. He was the leader of the Free Democrats from 1999 to 2000. He returned to the Progress Party, where he served as an advisor for its parliamentary group. Before the 2013 election Norheim was responsible for international issues as group secretary, and covered this field as advisor to party leader Siv Jensen. In February 2012 Norheim was unanimously chosen leader of the Progress Party in Telemark. In the 2013 general election he was elected as first deputy to the Parliament of Norway from Telemark. Since regular representative B√•rd Hoksrud was named to Erna Solberg's cabinet, Norheim took his seat as a regular representative. He is a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He serves as second deputy on that committee, as well as on the Storting's delegation for relations with the European Parliament and on its delegation to the Nordic Council. He is a member of the Nordic Council's Citizens' and Consumer Rights Committee. In addition, he is a member of the European Commission. He took part in the 2010 Balkans seminar in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, arranged by the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. In a 2010 article about the Progress Party, Jay Nordlinger of National Review wrote that Norheim‚Äôs office ‚Äúmust be the most politically incorrect room in Scandinavia. There are three posters of Churchill. There‚Äôs Reagan, of course: 'Viva the Reagan Revolution!' There‚Äôs Barry Goldwater: 'In your heart you know he‚Äôs right.' There‚Äôs a George Washington doll, and a George W. Bush doll. There‚Äôs a picture of the Stealth bomber. There‚Äôs a hat from the New York Fire Department. There‚Äôs an Israeli flag, a GOP flag (with elephant), a Gadsden flag ('Don‚Äôt Tread on Me'). And that‚Äôs only a fraction of the inventory.‚Äù Before and after the 2013 elections, Norheim has frequently been identified in the media as the Progress Party's foreign-policy spokesman. He has also been described in English-language media as the party's head of international affairs and as its international secretary. Norheim has expressed concern over the Progress Party's image abroad, where it is often described as far-right and compared to the French Popular Front and other more radical parties. In September 2013, when the Progress Party held a major press conference for international journalists to dispel any myths about its political orientation. Norheim told a reporter that the purpose of the event is to explain ‚Äúwho we are, and definitely who we are not,‚Äù adding that it ‚Äúwas very important we did this because of the distorted picture many foreign media have painted of Progress.‚Äù He described the party as ‚Äúa pragmatic and classical Liberal Party‚Äù that is ‚Äúgenerally more akin to those such as Denmark‚Äôs Liberal Party, Britain‚Äôs Conservative Party, the Czech Republic‚Äôs Civic Democratic Party (ODF), Iceland‚Äôs Independence Party, and the United States‚Äô Republicans.‚Äù Issues Norheim has referred to the Progress Party as Norway's ‚Äúnew Labor Party.‚Äù He argues that the Labor Party has become less a party of workers and more a party of public employees. =Alcohol policy= Norheim argues for a liberal alcohol policy and has criticized Norway's highly restrictive alcohol policy, writing that ‚Äúunfortunately there are many who fail to use alcohol with moderation, but there are many more who do, and the system should not be designed for the exceptions... adults should be treated as adults.... Drunkenness is not a result of a liberal alcohol policy, but of an illiberal alcohol policy.‚Äù =Social democracy= At the 2012 national Progress Party convention, Norheim gave a speech in which he criticized the social-democratic welfare state: ‚ÄúWelfare has become one of the leading businesses in this country.‚Äù He also complained about the size of the public sector: ‚ÄúNorway is the country in the world with the most public employees.‚Äù Norheim's stance is to move away from the welfare state and instead towards a more classically liberal society. =Ukultur= Norheim has defended the Progress Party's criticism of female genital mutilation, forced marriage, and other examples of ‚Äúukultur,‚Äù or culturally negative practices. =Islam= Norheim has expressed concern about antisemitism in Norway and, in particular, about antisemitic statements made by leaders of Norway's largest mosque, and about the inability of the Islamic Council of Norway to respond at once when asked if they support the death penalty for gays. =Norway's Christian heritage= Norheim has written that ‚ÄúNorway will and should be a secular state‚Äù but added that ‚Äúthis does not mean we are also obliged to clear away everything that reminds us of the more than thousand-year-old Christian heritage.‚Äù =Communism= Norheim has condemned the now-defunct Workers' Communist Party (Marxist- Leninist), of which many leading Norwegians were once members, saying that the world that party fought for ‚Äúwas no more fair than the world Quisling and his foreign beacons fought for.‚Äù =European Union= During the 2013 election campaign, Norheim said that ‚Äúin [his] heart‚Äù he supported Norwegian membership in the European Union, but has describes himself as a ‚Äúnon-practicing EU supporter,‚Äù owing to his concern about ‚Äúthe growing bureaucracy in Brussels\\". =United States= Norheim told Morgenbladet in October 2013 that the Progress Party has a good relationship with the Republican Party in the U.S. and is rhetorically close to its Reaganite wing. He admitted that the then U.S. Ambassador to Norway, Barry White, was correct when he quipped that ‚Äúall Norwegian parties are Democrats.‚Äù In response to the question of whether the Progress Party views the U.S. as a model, Norheim stated that the U.S. is worth examining closely. He expressed admiration for American economist Milton Friedman, for the American free- market ideology, and for the fact that private capital is not viewed negatively in America. =Tsunis nomination= After businessman George James Tsunis, U.S. President Barack Obama's nominee for Ambassador to Norway, made international headlines with uninformed and incendiary comments about the Progress Party during a Senate committee hearing in January 2014, Norheim said he has \\"been in dialogue\\" with the U.S. Embassy about Tsunis's remarks, which he described as problematic.

It accounts for approximately 1% of world production, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Coffee is the highest foreign exchange earner for Papua New Guinea, the majority of which is grown in the Eastern Highland Province, the Western Highland Province, and Simbu. With the industry not derived on a colonial plantation-based system, production is largely by small farmers with land holdings that grow as little as 20 trees per plot in \\"coffee gardens\\" alongside subsistence crops. Predominantly in isolated places, the product is mostly certified as \\"organic coffee\\". History Coffee production in PNG dates back to 1926/1927 when the first Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee seeds were planted. The Coffee Research Institute claims that coffee was introduced to British Papua in 1890, although it is widely accepted that commercial production only took off in the country in the late 1920s. In Sangara, Papua New Guinea in the foothills in the southeast of the country, 18 commercial coffee plantations were established in 1926, paving the way for commercial production from 1928. In the 1960s, the infrastructure developed significantly in Papua New Guinea which facilitated a marked growth in the industry, easing the transportation of coffee beans from plantations to the mills to be processed and exported. The coffee industry in Papua New Guinea thrived in the 1970s, benefiting from a slump in production in Brazil on the international market because of problems with frosts. In the 1980s, coffee plantation production declined in Papua New Guinea and decentralized towards localised small coffee farmers who are now accountable for over 85% of total national production. The coffee boom in the 1980s profoundly affected many coffee plantation owners who incurred debts they could not pay off, with the result that many were made redundant. From 1986, a number of cases of coffee rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix, also affected some parts of Papua New Guinea which had previously been free of the disease. The coffee industry in Papua New Guinea reached a peak in 1998 when it accounted for about 38% of PNG's non-mineral exports and 13% of total exports. Between 1995 and 1998, coffee production contributed to 42% of the revenue of PNG's total agricultural exports. Since then the industry has rapidly declined, affected by a world depression in coffee prices with prices falling up to 60%. As a result, production slumped by 23% in 2000 and remained stagnant in 2001. A contemporary problem facing the industry is poor infrastructure and frequent hijacking by bandits which is major issue in Papua New Guinea, with some of the larger coffee producers losing some 50% of their total produce through theft annually. This is an issue of law and order that is creating loss of revenue to the producers through unchecked theft, which is attributed to the inadequate opportunities for the youth of the country to get suitable avenues for education and, more importantly, getting jobs after schooling. Increased annual production by other competing countries in the world market is also affecting the contemporary industry in Papua New Guinea. In 2009, coffee was reported to be responsible for 18.5% of PNG's agricultural exports and 4.7% of total export revenue, a dramatic fall since the 1990s. In recent years, coordination between the private and public sectors have increased as has a movement towards a greater sustainability, with improved soil nutrition management and retention and education of farmers in prolonging the agricultural productivity of their land. Production An estimated is under coffee cultivation in Papua New Guinea. The majority of the coffee is grown in the highlands, where 70% of the population are dependent upon subsistence agriculture. In Papua New Guinea there are approximately 2.5 million people employed in the industry, with 280,000 smallholder coffee growers, 660 larger farmers cultivating areas of , 65 large plantations, 18 registered exporters, 51 registered processors and over 6,000 roadside buyers. However, although 12 provinces are active in the coffee industry, the bulk of coffee (approximately 90%) is produced in the five highlands provinces, Western Highlands (45%), Eastern Highlands (37%), Simbu (6%), Morobe (5%) and East Sepik (5%). In the late 1990s, PNG produced an average of 1.18 million bags annually, of which all were exported. Washed mild arabica highland coffee dominates the industry in Papua New Guinea (PNG), accounting for 95% of production, the other 5% being lowland washed robusta. The robusta coffee is of poorer quality, being darker, more bitter, with less flavour that the Arabic variety is generally used for cheaper instant coffee. The higher quality arabica coffee is generally sold for making espresso, cappuccino and latte in the European markets of Switzerland, Germany, France and Italy and for American coffee companies such as Starbucks. The vast majority of the coffee sold to North America is grown in the West and East Highlands on estates; mainly Sigri and Arona coffee respectively. The highest quality widely distributed PNG coffee is from the Colbran estate on the Eastern Highlands. =Types of coffee= 'PNG' the marketing label given to the popular brand of New Guinea Coffee is produced in the eastern half of the island state. There are two varieties, though, of this coffee, the one produced by large estates by the wet process (mostly sold in markets in USA) and the other produced by small farmers in their backyards, also by the wet process. The large estate coffees are also of many brands namely the Sigri and Arona, apart from Papua New Guinea, which are all high-grown coffee (wet-processed coffee) with fragrance and \\"low-key luxuriousness\\" akin to the type grown in Maritime Southeast Asia. The coffee grown by the small farmers, which is organically grown, on occasions, do not match with the quality of the estate grown coffee. One of the well established varieties of this type of coffee is the \\"Village Premium Morobe\\" produced in the Morobe Province of east-central part of the country. Problems One of the main problems faced by coffee farmers in Papua New Guinea is the poor quality of basic infrastructure such as rural roads. This often leads to coffee remaining unsold on farms, which cannot be consumed and results in consequent loss of revenue or in distress sale of produce to even maintain subsistence level of living. Other problem areas highlighted are the changing of the cropping pattern from coffee to more economical crops or food crops, limited family land holdings restraining further growth, labour shortages creating difficulties during the main crop picking season and the unavoidable movement of the youth from villages to the urban areas in search of better job opportunities. Another significant problem faced by producers is the decline of coffee prices in the world market. Such a situation, when persists for long period, would call for subsidies to be provided by the government to small land holders so they can survive till prices improve. =Threats to the industry= The threat perspectives to coffee industry in PNG, including the aging trees (said to be in the age range of 27‚Äì47 years) without signs of timely replacements, large debts in the industry to the Rural Development Bank, and pests and diseases causing diseases such as Coffee Berry Disease (CBD), the spread of Berry Borer and Pink Disease necessitating prevention of its spread from Java to PNG. =Quality control= The quality of coffee grown in PNG is exceedingly high, often cupping in the specialty coffee range but due to several factors the quality is often compromised. Poor management and poor processes affect the quality of the produce. Locals are ill-equipped to process large volumes of coffee, adequately deal with disease and provide the proper care needed for delicate arabica coffee. Product right A \\"doppio ristretto\\" in Chiang Mai, Thailand, that, amongst others, contains coffee beans from Sigri, New Guinea The coffee is naturally produced given that synthetic fertilisers and pesticides are too expensive and unobtainable which results in coffee with naturally low levels of caffeine and acidity. Papua New Guinean coffee is said to have medium body, low to medium acidity, a syrupy mouthfeel and often fruity notes. The Coffee Industry Corporation Ltd., as an umbrella organisation, has regulated, facilitated, and also provided research and extension services to the coffee farming community. This has been enabled in the form of incentives to farmers to sustain production with due care for quality and marketing facilities. =Incentive schemes= Several incentive schemes have been introduced to help farmers, such as, providing subsidized plants from central nurseries, 'Coffee Credit Scheme' (from which 11,285 farming communities have benefited till March 2001), 'Freight Subsidy Scheme' in the form of subsidising 40% of airfreight, modifying minimum standards of parchment and green bean, establishing standards for cherry, parchment and green coffee and also facilitating establishment of a green bean standard known as the 'Premium Smallholder Coffee' (or PSC), an adaptation for the Gourmet coffee Market (Speciality Coffee Markets) in coffee consuming nations. Speciality Coffee or Gourmet coffee produced in Papua New Guinea has attracted clients from Japan following a publicity seminar. The speciality of this type of coffee produced in Papua New Guinea is that they are produced in their natural habitat without use of fertilizers, pesticides or weedicides or any other artificially manufactured supplements. Research The coffee industry in PNG is supported by research conducted by the Coffee Research Institute (CRI), established in 1986 at Aiyura in Eastern Highlands Province. It is a division of the PNG Coffee Industry Corporation. In 2003, CRI and Extension Services Division of CIC were merged to create Research & Growers Services Division. The emphasis in research and extension support in coffee production in PNG is to ensure sustained production of coffee by smallholders, blocks and plantations to meet international standards of not only quality but also achieve economy of production. In this effort, the role of the corporation has been proactive to the farming community by way of establishing nurseries, generous issue of licenses, allotting land on tenure system, providing funding through international funding agencies from ACIAR and European Union (EU) and also providing selective subsidies. Quality Quality of coffee produced in PNG has received a boost in recent times with emphasis on setting up wet factories supported by adequate checks and assurances of excellence through a testing process in well equipped laboratories. Consequently, the tasting panel instituted through appropriate training being imparted in Lae and Australia would assure better exposure to PNG coffee in the international market.

A Companion to Museum Studies (London: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2011) An encyclopedic museum, the Fridericianum originally housed the state library of Hesse, the art collections of the Hessian landgraves, including the ‚ÄúModern Statue Gallery‚Äù, as well as a medal, machinery and watch room, a print room, a manuscripts room and map gallery, scientific instruments, cork models of Roman architecture, and wax figures of historic Hessian landgraves. The Fridericianum also contained a library built to house 100,000 volumes, and was connected to the medieval Zwehrenturm tower, which had been made into an observatory.About, Museum Fridericianum = Parliamentary = When, in the early 19th century, Napoleon‚Äôs youngest brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte became King of Westphalia and Kassel was named the capital of the kingdom, the Fridericianum was repurposed as the first parliamentary building in Germany. With J√©r√¥me‚Äôs expulsion in 1813, Fridericianum was returned to its original purpose as a museum. During that time the Brothers Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm, were employed at the library. = Library = With the beginning of Prussian rule in 1866, the museum‚Äôs collections were gradually transferred to the Prussian center of power in Berlin, and in 1913 Fridericianum ceased to function as a museum, retaining only its status as a state library. The Fridericianum was heavily damaged in World War II, during the bombing raids on Kassel in 1941 and 1943. After the war, all that remained of the Fridericianum and library were the enclosing walls and the Zwehrenturm library. The surviving books were moved into the Kassel University Library. = documenta = In 1955, the first documenta exhibition, founded by Arnold Bode, took place in the provisionally restored Fridericianum building. Since then documenta has been held every five years in the Fridericianum, which was fully renovated by 1982.  Exhibition hall  The Fridericianum began hosting its own temporary exhibitions as well in 1988, opening with Veit Loers‚Äô exhibition \\"Schlaf der Vernunft\\" (1988), which made reference to Fridericianum‚Äôs original purpose, juxtaposing museum objects from the Enlightenment period with those of contemporary art. In 1998 Ren√© Block took over from Loers as Artistic Director of the Fridericianum, focusing on the supposed peripheries of the global art world. Following Block, the Fridericianum was directed from 2008-2011 by Rein Wolfs, who organized the first exhibition of Danh Vo's ‚ÄùWe the People‚Äù, for which the artist recast a life-size Statue of Liberty from 30 tons of copper sheets.Hilarie M. Sheets (September 20, 2012), Lady Liberty, Inspiring Even in Pieces New York Times. Since June 2013 Susanne Pfeffer has been director of the Fridericianum. Pfeffer presented an exhibition trilogy ‚ÄúSpeculations on Anonymous Materials‚Äù (2013), ‚Äùnature after nature‚Äù (2014) und ‚ÄùInhuman‚Äù (2015). In 2015 she dedicated a large scale retrospective to the American experimental filmmaker Paul Sharits. On occasion of the 60th anniversary of documenta Pfeffer organized a retrospective of the Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers, featuring works from all of the artist's creative periods.

The company was founded by Sean Murray, Grant Duncan, Ryan Doyle and David Ream in February 2008 and has developed the Joe Danger series, No Man's Sky, and The Last Campfire.  History  Co-founders Sean Murray (left) and Grant Duncan Hello Games was founded in February 2008 by Sean Murray and Grant Duncan, together with friends Ryan Doyle and David Ream. Murray had been a developer at Electronic Arts prior and had grown tired of developing repeated sequels, and decided to leave to form his own studio to make a game he always wanted to make, Joe Danger, which was the studio's first release in 2010. At the 2010 Develop Awards, they won two awards: Best New Studio and Best Micro Studio. In September 2010, they were listed by The Guardian as one of the 100 most innovative and creative companies of the previous 12 months. The popularity and success of Joe Danger led them to develop a sequel, Joe Danger 2: The Movie. Murray said that coming back to do a sequel after having left Electronic Arts from doing sequels led to a mid-life crisis for himself, and gave rise for the idea of No Man's Sky, inspired by science fiction of the 1980s, with an entire universe of over 18 quintillion planets created through procedural generation. Developed by only a small four-person team led by Murray, No Man's Sky, was revealed at the VGX 2013 award show and generated a large amount of hype for the game. On 24 December 2013, the studio's offices were flooded after a nearby river broke its bank, with much of the hardware used in the development of the game being destroyed, but they were able to recover most of their projects' code and were able to relocate. The media continued to build excitement for No Man's Sky, furthered by Sony Interactive Entertainment obtaining publishing rights for it on the PlayStation 4. However, the game was launched a few months late, and players found soon after launch many of the features in the game that had been seemingly promised in early media were absent such as multiplayer functions. Hello Games had also gone silent save for technical support. Hello Games was accused of dishonesty surrounding their promotion of the game, and the subsequent lack of promised features, but which Murray explained in later interviews that they failed to control the hype being generated by the media nor setting expectations for players of what the game would be like at launch and how they would develop it over time. Since launch, many of these missing features were added via numerous free post-release updates as well as new features include support for virtual reality and cross-platform play across multiple console, leading to the studio being praised for staying to their vision to the game. In 2017, the studio announced an initiative to fund multiple experimental and procedural generation projects based on their work in No Man's Sky called Hello Labs. At The Game Awards 2018, Hello Games announced The Last Campfire, a game developed by three employees, which released in August 2020. Murray said, as of the time of The Last Campfires release, that while some of the other staff were still working on continued updates for No Man's Sky, the remaining staff were working on a new game, but as to avoid the issues around No Man's Sky launch hype, he plans to keep specifics of this game quiet until they are nearly ready to present the game to the world.

Background and education The Hon. Edmund John Monson was born at Seal, Kent, the third son of William Monson, 6th Baron Monson and Eliza Larken Monson. He was educated at Eton College and then Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1855, and was elected as a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1858. Diplomatic career Monson entered the British diplomatic service in 1856 and was posted as an unpaid attach√© to the embassy in Paris, where Lord Cowley, the ambassador, called him \\"one of the best and most intelligent attach√©s he ever had\\". This secured him an appointment as private secretary to Lord Lyons, the newly appointed British Ambassador to the United States late in 1858. Monson was trained in the diplomatic service by Lord Lyons, and was a member of the Tory-sympathetic 'Lyons School' of British diplomacy. Monson then transferred to Hanover and later to Brussels as Third Secretary, but left the diplomatic service in 1865 to stand for Parliament, failing to get elected as Member of Parliament for Reigate. Monson returned to the diplomatic service in 1869, being appointed Consul in the Azores in 1869, Consul-General in Budapest in 1871 and Second Secretary in Vienna; and to other posts, including as a special envoy in Dalmatia and Montenegro in 1876-77. In 1879, he was sent as minister-resident and consul-general in Uruguay, where he served until 1884. In 1881, during his time there, he married Eleanor Catherine Mary Munro, the daughter of a previous consul-general. In 1884 he became minister to Argentina and Paraguay, but returned to Europe within a year as envoy to Denmark (1884‚Äì88) and then to Greece (1888‚Äì92). Shortly after Monson moved to Athens, the United States and Danish governments asked him to resolve a dispute known as the Butterfield Claims that had been running since 1854 and 1855, when two ships belonging to Carlos Butterfield & Co., thought to be carrying war materials to Venezuela, were detained at St Thomas, then a Danish colony. The two governments agreed, \\"whereas each of the parties hereto has entire confidence in the learning ability and impartiality of Sir Edmund Monson Her British Majesty's Envoy extraordinary and Minister plenipotentiary in Athens\\", to submit the dispute to his binding arbitration.Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776‚Äì1949, page 28 (Google Books) Monson decided against the United States, but \\"so satisfied was this [U.S.] government with the judgement of Sir Edmund that it joined Denmark in presenting to him a service of silver plate\\".Sir E. Monson Dead, New York Daily Tribune, 30 October 1909, page 7 (Library of Congress) In the passage quoted, \\"Sir Edward\\" has been corrected to \\"Sir Edmund\\", as he is correctly called elsewhere in the obituary. Monson was appointed minister to Belgium in February 1892, but before he had left Athens a political crisis blew up in which King George I used his constitutional authority to dismiss the prime minister, Theodoros Deligiannis, resulting in an election in which Deligiannis lost power. The Times correspondent in Athens commented \\"It is to be hoped that Sir Edmund Monson, though already appointed to Brussels, may be allowed to remain here for some little time longer. On all sides regrets are expressed that an English diplomatic representative who is so thoroughly acquainted with Greek affairs, and who has gained the sympathy and confidence of all parties, should leave the country at this critical time.\\"The Political Crisis In Greece, The Times, London, 28 March 1892, page 4 However, Monson arrived in Brussels on 25 June.Court Circular, The Times, London, 27 June 1892, page 11 In 1893 Monson was promoted to ambassador, first to AustriaCourt Circular, The Times, London, 23 June 1893, page 10 and then in 1896 to France. > Monson took over the Paris embassy at a very difficult period in Anglo- > French relations. France's colonial expansion had brought it into conflict > with Britain in several parts of the world, and the rivalry between the two > countries had been embittered by the Egyptian question, as no French > government could reconcile itself to the fact that Britain would not leave > the Nile. Complaining that French interests in Egypt were being unfairly > treated, the French demanded the end of British occupation there. Conflict > arose also in Asia (over Siam) and in Africa (over the upper Nile and the > middle Niger). > -- Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In July 1898 a French expeditionary forces arrived at Fashoda, in the White Nile state of south Sudan. Two months later a powerful British force arrived to confront them. Both sides were polite but insisted on their right to Fashoda. The crisis might have led to war between Britain and France but was resolved by diplomacy, and the French government ordered its troops to withdraw on 3 November. On 6 December Sir Edmund Monson delivered a speech to the British Chamber of Commerce in Paris including this passage: > I would earnestly ask those who directly or indirectly, either as officials > in power, or as unofficial exponents of public opinion, are responsible for > the direction of the national policy, to discountenance and to abstain from > the continuance of that policy of pin-pricks which, while it can only > procure ephemeral gratification to a short-lived ministry, must inevitably > perpetuate across the Channel an irritation which a high-spirited nation > must eventually feel to be intolerable. I would entreat them to resist the > temptation to try to thwart British enterprise by petty manoeuvres ... Such > ill-considered provocation, to which I confidently trust no official > countenance will be given, might well have the effect of converting that > policy of forbearance from taking the full advantage of our recent victories > and our present position, which has been enunciated by our highest > authority, into the adoption of measures which, though they evidently find > favour with no inconsiderable party in England, are not, I presume, the > object at which French sentiment is aiming.\\"Sir E. Monson On Anglo-French > Relations, The Times, London, 7 December 1898, page 5 The vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce wrote \\"This passage was obviously inserted under instructions from London. It was a discordant note in the harmony of the speech, and in the French rendering it was toned down with a compliment to M. Delcass√© [the foreign minister], whose conciliatory attitude the Ambassador commended with gratitude. It was the only passage which could be called intempestif, the term applied to it in France.\\"Thomas Barclay, Thirty years, Anglo-French reminiscences (1876-1906), Houghton Mifflin, New York, 1914, page 157 However, although Monson's remarks caused a storm in the French press, it blew over and \\"was the last incident to disturb relations which were destined to assume, before his retirement from the Paris Embassy, a character of exceptional cordiality and confidence. ... Sir Edmund Monson contributed his own not inconsiderable share to the rapprochement between Great Britain and France which finally took shape in the agreements of April 4, 1904, and when he resigned, at the beginning of the following year, the entente cordiale ... was already firmly established.\\"Obituary - Sir Edmund Monson, The Times, London, 30 October 1909, page 13 Honours Edmund Monson was appointed CB in 1878, knighted KCMG in 1886 and promoted to GCMG in 1892. He received the additional honours of GCB in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1896 and GCVO in 1903 when King Edward VII visited Paris. He was sworn to the Privy Council in 1893 and made a baronet in 1905. The French government awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. Family Monson's three sons succeeded to the baronetcy in turn. None of them had children and the title became extinct on the death of the third.

The hospital replaced one of the same name in Chiapinni Street, which had been founded by Dr Samuel Bailey in 1818 as the first civilian hospital in Cape Town. It was named after Lord Charles Somerset the governor of the Cape Colony who gave land for the construction. The Chavonnes Battery was used as an isolation and convalescent wing. The cornerstone for the new hospital was laid on 18 August 1859 by the Cape Governor Sir George Grey. In addition to the appointment of medical staff, nurses were recruited from the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, St Thomas' Hospital in London including Sister Helen Bowden, who in 1877 became the first fully qualified nurse to be appointed as Matron of Somerset Hospital. Subsequently the hospital established its own nurse training school, becoming the first hospital to train non-white nurses. From 1918 until 1937, when the Groote Schuur Hospital opened it was the main academic hospital of the University of Cape Town. A new West Wing opened in 1973 for white patients. The old building was renamed the north wing, not because of their position but the N meant for non-white patients and the W of West Wing signified that it was for Whites. The high incidence of HIV infections amongst the patients led to the establishment of the hospital as a prime referral centre for the treatment of AIDS and the first antiretroviral distribution centre was established there in 2005. Since then various plans have been announced for the development of the grounds including hotels, offices and residential accommodation. The hospital is also home to the Cape Medical Museum. In 2008 the hospital appealed for funds from local businesses to establish a new trauma unit and a ward for women suffering from a spontaneous miscarriage. In 2010 it opened a new measles ward following a rise in measles cases in Cape Town. In 2010 a studio was built, along with its own lift, on the top of the hospital for use by BBC presenters during 2010 FIFA World Cup matches at the nearby stadium. Additionally in 2010 plans were announced to move the hospital to a new site in the northern sector of the city, to serve the densely populated West Coast region. Coat of arms The hospital assumed a coat of arms in the late 1950s and registered it at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1970 : Per pale, dexter Gules, three annulets Or and sinister barry of six Azure and Argent.

His work is fundamental for the history of the Fatimid Caliphate and the Isma'ili communities in Yemen. Life Born in 1392 at Shibam in northern Yemen, Idris was descended from the Banu al-Walid al-Anf family, of the Quraysh tribe. The family had provided the Tayyibi Isma'ili head missionaries (dƒÅ øƒ´s) in Yemen reaching back to the early 13th century. The full title of these missionaries, DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq (\\"absolute/unrestricted missionary\\") signified their position as virtual rulers of the Tayyibi community in their capacity as vicegerents of the absent Imam, the eponymous at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim, who remained in occultation. This authority extended over not only Yemen, but the Tayyibi community in India as well. Idris' grandfather Abdallah Fakhr al-Din was the sixteenth DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq, followed by his father al-Hasan Badr al-Din I, and after his death in 1418 by his uncle Ali Shams al-Din II, who died in 1428. As a youth, Idris received a thorough education, and was active in the governance of the Tayyibi community. When his uncle died in 1428, he succeeded him as the nineteenth DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq, a position he would hold throughout the remainder of his life. His first residence was the citadel of Haraz. Like his predecessors, he was allied with the Rasulids of Zabid against the Zaydi imams of Sana'a. With the Rasulid al- Malik al-Zahir () he repeatedly fought against the Zaydi imam al-Mansur Ali (), and recaptured numerous fortresses from Zaydi control. When the Rasulids were replaced by the Tahirids in 1454, Idris maintained friendly relations with the new rulers of Zabid, the Tahirid brothers Amir () and Ali (). After a disastrous plague in 1436/7, which cost him several relatives, he returned to his native Shibam. The Sunni Bohra break off from the Dawoodi Bohra during the leadership of Idris. Idris paid particular attention to the missionary efforts in western India, and contributed to the success of Tayyibi missionaries in Gujarat. According to the later Indian Tayyibi scholars Khawj ibn Malak and Shaykh Qutb, it was Idris who first planned to move the seat of the Tayyibi missionary movement from Yemen to India, although in the event this did not take place until a century after his death on 10 June 1468. His sons, al-Hasan Badr al-Din II, and al-Husayn Husam al-Din, and then his grandsons, Ali Shams al-Din III and Muhammad Izz al-Din I, succeeded him as DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq. Muhammad Izz al-Din I, the 23rd DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq, was the last of his line, and on his death the first Indian, Yusuf ibn Sulayman, was nominated as his successor. The mausoleum of Idris in Shibam was reconstructed in 2010 by the 52nd DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq of the Dawoodi Bohra branch of Tayyibi Isma'ilism, and is a frequent pilgrimage destination for Bohra faithful from both Yemen and India. File:Syedna Idris Court.jpg|Citadel of Idris, Shibam File:Syedna Idris Rauda 2.jpg|Idris' reconstructed mausoleum in 2013 File:Grave syedna Idris.JPG|Tomb of Idris in 2011 Works Alongside his religious and political duties, Idris was also a dedicated scholar and prolific writer. His books \\"would become foundational works of the ·π¨ayyibi da øwa\\". His favourite writing spot, next to the lake Birkat Jawjab near Shibam, is still pointed out to visitors today. The 16th-century Tayyibi scholar Hasan ibn Nuh ascribes eleven works to Idris. The modern historian Ayman Fu æad Sayyid enumerates eleven whose authorship is certain, and three more where it is attributed to Idris, but doubtful. During the epidemic, Syedna Idris initated namaaz and dua of Daf'il Aafaat. The text of this dua implores Allah to grant protection from calamities, disasters, the malevolence of evil-doers and to allay fears, to safeguard against famine, mishaps, disease and epidemics. This namaaz is currently offered daily by Dawoodi Bohras after Maghrib prayer. =Historical works= His main work is the seven-volume  øUy≈´n al-akhbƒÅr (\\"Flowing springs of historical reports\\"), a history of Islam from Muhammad, through the 21 Isma'ili Imams up to the end of the Fatimid Caliphate, as well as the start of the Tayyibi da øwa in Yemen under the Sulayhid dynasty. In it, Idris made use of a large number of Isma'ili and non-Isma'ili sources, some of which do no longer survive. The only general history of Isma'ilism actually written by an Isma'ili author during the Middle Ages, this work has established him as the \\"most famous Isma'ili historian\\", according to Farhad Daftary, and provides a unique Isma'ili perspective on the history of the Fatimid Caliphate and its proxies in Yemen. Along with the work of his Egyptian contemporary, al- Maqrizi, the  øUy≈´n al-akhbƒÅr is \\"arguably the most detailed source of Fatimid history\\". The  øUy≈´n al-akhbƒÅr has been published in a number of critical editions: * Volumes 4‚Äì6, edited by Mustafa Ghalib, Dar al-Andalus, Beirut 1975‚Äì1984 * Volume 5, focusing on the Fatimids, edited by Farhat Dashrawi, Tunis 1979 and again by Muhammad al-Ya'llawi, Dar al-Gharb al-Islami, Beirut 1985 * All seven volumes by Ahmad Chleilat, Mahmoud Fakhoury, Yousef S. Fattoum, Ma'moun Sagherji, and Ayman Fu'ad Sayyid, London and Damascus 2007‚Äì2010 * Excerpts from volumes 5 and 6 were translated into English by Shainool Jiwa in The Founder of Cairo. The Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mu øizz and his Era, I.B. Tauris, London and New York 2013 * Volume 7, with a summarized English translation, by Ayman Fu'ad Sayyid with Paul Walker and Maurice Pomerantz, as The Fatimids and their successors in Yaman: The History of an Islamic Community, I.B. Tauris (in association with the Institute of Ismaili Studies), London and New York 2002 The  øUy≈´n al-akhbƒÅr is complemented by two smaller works, the two-volume Nuzhat al-afkƒÅr (\\"A promenade for minds\\" or \\"The pleasure of the thoughts\\"), and its continuation, the Raw·∏çat al-akhbƒÅr (\\"A garden of historical reports/information\\"), which specifically focus on the Tayyibi community in Yemen from the collapse of the Sulayhid dynasty to Idris' own day. =Theological works= Among his theological works, the Zahr al- ma øƒÅnƒ´ (\\"Flowers of the meanings\\"), a treatise on Tayyibi esoteric doctrine (·∏•aqƒÅ æiq), stands out as the \\"high mark of Tayyibi writings\\" (Daftary). The metaphysical ideas of the 11th-century dƒÅ øƒ´ Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani provided particular inspiration to Idris. He also composed six shorter theological diatribes: one in question-and-answer format on theological questions; a theological exegesis of aspects connected to the Islamic calendar; a treatise on strictly keeping the full fast of Ramadan; a refutation of a Zaydi theological treatise; a polemic treatise against an atheist referred to only as \\"The Camel\\"; and a refutation of the practice of some Indians of watching the moon to determine the start and end of Ramadan. Finally, he was the author of a diwan, in which he emulated the Fatimid-era poet al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi. The subjects of his poems were mostly religious, offering praise to Muhammad, Ali and his family, the Isma'ili imams. Some deal with issues of doctrine, but others express his own spiritual beliefs.

The Common starting position Kaisa or karoliina is a cue sport mainly played in Finland. The game originated in Russia, where it is still played to some extent. Kaisa equipment is similar to Russian pyramid from the 68 mm ( in) balls, small pockets barely large enough for a ball to enter, and the long and heavy cue sticks. Kaisa tables are usually 10 feet long and thus 2 feet shorter than official tournament Russian pyramid tables which are 12 feet long. It is a two-player or two-team game. As with many carom billiards games, both players have their own used to shoot at the other balls, and usually differentiated by one cue ball having a dot or other marking on it. In all, five balls are used: the yellow (called the kaisa in Finnish), two red object balls, and the two white cue balls (each of which serves as an object ball for the opponent). The game is played to 60 , in a rather elaborate scoring system, reminiscent of those used in snooker and English billiards, with points being awarded for various types of shots. Like both Russian and English billiards, which are also played on large pocket billiards tables, kaisa is a hybrid of carom and pocket billiards game styles. Kaisa is principally a recreational game, without professional players. However, the first kaisa world championship tournament was held in April 2010. Participants came from 33 countries, and the main tournament was held in Kotka. A Finnish player, Marko Rautiainen, won the championship title. Origins Kaisa can be traced back to an 18th century game called Russian carambole played with two white cue balls and one red object ball. By the beginning of the 19th century, a new variant added two more object balls: a blue ball and a black, brown, or yellow ball called the karolin, caroline, or carline which gave the game its name. Rules The players to decide who will be the first shooter; the player who wins the lag begins the game. The object balls are positioned at their , and the cue ball of the winner of the lag is placed behind the , while the lag-loser's cue ball is placed somewhere between the and , but cannot obstruct the first player being able to shoot the yellow kaisa toward the corner pocket diagonally opposite the corner pocket closest to the first player's cue ball. At the start of the game (or with after an opponent's foul), the player cannot shoot an object ball directly to a ., though this shot is legal at any other time. All shots must be in detail. In most games, nominating the object ball and the intended pocket is sufficient, but in kaisa the shooter must also call any on other balls or contacts on the path of the object ball to the pocket. After pocketing of the called object ball, any carom on or pocketing of another object ball for additional points (see below) need not be called. The same player continues shooting after each successful shot, but yields the table to the next player after failing to earn points on a shot attempt. All pocketed balls are before the next shot is taken, except the opponent's cue ball, which remains pocketed until the end of the current shooter's . Balls moved but not pocketed remain where they lie. The incoming player shoots from where that player's cue ball lies if it remains on the table, or has ball-in-hand behind the head string if that cue ball was pocketed by the previous player. =Scoring= Points are acquired by () the object balls with the cue ball, with additional points being available for additional feats. The game ends when one player earns 60 or more points. Basic shots: * Pocketing the opponent's white ball = 2 points * Pocketing a red ball = 3 points * Pocketing the yellow ball (kaisa) = 6 points Additional points are awarded for the cue ball to object balls (in any order) on the same shot, providing that the initial object ball was pocketed. This kind of carom is called nakki in Finnish (which translates to \\"vienna sausage\\" or \\"hot dog\\" in English). A - causing an object ball to hit another object ball - does not award points. In scoring nakki shots, the caromed balls are scored as in a basic shot (white is 2 points, each red is 3 points, yellow is 6 points), but the effective point value of the pocketed ball changes (white is effectively 1 point, each red is still 3 points, yellow is effectively 9 points). The result is the following nakki shot values: * Pocketing opponent's white plus a carom (nakki) with a red = 4 points * Pocketing opponent's white plus caroms with both reds = 7 points * Pocketing opponent's white plus a carom with the yellow = 7 points * Pocketing opponent's white plus caroms with the yellow and a red = 10 points * Pocketing opponent's white plus caroms with the yellow and both reds = 13 points * Pocketing a red plus a carom with opponent's white = 5 points * Pocketing a red plus a carom with the other red = 6 points * Pocketing a red plus a caroms with the other red and opponent's white = 8 points * Pocketing a red plus a carom with the yellow = 9 points * Pocketing a red plus a carom with the yellow and opponent's white = 11 points * Pocketing a red plus caroms with the yellow and the other red = 12 points * Pocketing a red plus caroms with the yellow, the other red and opponent's white = 14 points * Pocketing the yellow plus a carom with opponent's white = 11 points * Pocketing the yellow plus a carom with a red = 12 points * Pocketing the yellow plus caroms with opponent's white and a red = 14 * Pocketing the yellow plus caroms with both reds = 15 points * Pocketing the yellow plus caroms with the opponent's white and both reds = 17 points A special 12-point shot is pocketing the yellow kaisa (yli keskelle in Finnish) as the first-struck object ball. It does not matter which ball hit the first, the cue ball (a ) or the kaisa (a ). This adds an additional 6 points to the shot's value, which otherwise accumulates like a regular object-ball pocketing shot: * Pocketing the yellow cross-side plus a carom with opponent's white = 17 points * Pocketing the yellow cross-side plus a carom with a red = 18 points * Pocketing the yellow cross-side plus caroms with opponent's white and a red = 20 points * Pocketing the yellow cross-side plus caroms with both reds = 21 points * Pocketing the yellow cross-side plus caroms with opponent's white and both reds = 23 points Additionally, the player gets still more points if a ball with which the cue ball caromed for additional points (i.e. a nakki ball) is also pocketed on the same shot. The number of points is awarded by the pocketed ball's value: white = 2, red = 3, yellow = 6. For example, if a player pockets the yellow kaisa, and caroms a red nakki ball into a pocket, the score is 15 points (kaisa pocketed for 6, nakki carom off pocketed kaisa for 3, red hit on nakki carom for 3, plus red ball in a pocket for 3, equals 15). =Fouls= If a player his/her cue ball into a pocket or off the table, the player's points are reduced according to which ball the cue ball hit first (e.g. a scratch off the yellow kaisa deducts 6 points). If no ball is hit before the scratch, the penalty is simply 2 points. Fouls result in for the incoming player.

The building, completed in 1937, has had this function only since 1996; it was constructed by cinema architect Robert Cromie as a private house for Ian Stuart Millar, an eccentric iron industry tycoon, who occupied it for only nine years. The large building later accommodated the Brighton and Hove School of Nursing, which for the first time brought together training provision for all local hospitals' staff on one site. When the school moved away in 1989, the house spent several years on the market awaiting a buyer‚Äîand in steadily deteriorating structural condition‚Äîbefore being refurbished, extended, renamed and converted to its present use. The building is distinctive and idiosyncratic in its layout, positioning, materials and architectural style. Many interior touches are reminiscent of interwar Art Deco cinema architecture, contrasting with the \\"austere\\" Neo-Georgian exterior. Handmade, specially commissioned bricks in an unusual purplish grey colour were used to build the house, which is surrounded by a high wall of the same material. The layout was designed to accommodate the motor-car at a time when they were uncommon, with garaging space integrated into the design of the ground floor. Several design motifs recur throughout, and high-quality internal fittings such as built-in furniture and an unusual staircase have been preserved. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. The surrounding wall is also listed separately at Grade II. History Hove originated as an agricultural hamlet on the English Channel coast west of the more important settlement of Brighton. It was surrounded by farmland used for grazing sheep. In response to Brighton's rapid 18th- and 19th-century growth into one of England's largest and most popular seaside resorts, Hove (whose population in 1825 was only 300, compared to more than 25,000 in Brighton) developed into a genteel, characterful residential town with spacious streets of large houses. The streets around Pembroke Crescent and Prince's Crescent, just north of the seafront, were typical examples: developed in the 1890s by prolific local architects Lainson & Sons and Clayton & Black in the Domestic Revival/Queen Anne style. A site at the south end of Princes Crescent, facing the seafront road (Kingsway) and the sea, remained vacant until the 1930s. Ian Stuart Millar, an eccentric business magnate and occasional film director whose investments in the Tyneside steel and iron industries made him a millionaire in the early 20th century, moved to Hove and lived at Pembroke Crescent from 1923. In 1934, seeking a larger, custom-built house, he commissioned architect Robert Cromie to design one to his specifications. Cromie was in the middle of a prolific spell of cinema designing: he was responsible for nearly 40 in England during the 1920s and 1930s, including one at Denmark Villas in Hove. Hove Council, the local governing body at the time, approved Cromie's plans on 8 March 1934, and building work started that year. The bricks used to build the walls were specially commissioned and handmade to order in Italy; their colour has been described as silver-grey or purple-grey, giving a \\"drab\\" effect. Too many were ordered: the excess bricks were apparently buried near Hove railway station rather than reused, although the site has never been confirmed. The house was completed in 1937. wheat-ear motifs characterise the exterior. Cromie designed the house for the convenience of visitors arriving by car. The entrance faced north on to a courtyard; visitors would drive straight into it through a wide covered driveway from Princes Crescent (on the east side), and could park in multiple-occupancy garages separated by small brick columns. The roof of this approach was decorated with geometric patterns. Moreover, lights would come on automatically at night when a car arrived, and a fountain in the grounds would be activated. Such attention to motorists' needs was uncommon so early in the history of motoring. Millar himself had his own chauffeur, who lived in a flat in the grounds. In 1946, Millar sold the house to Hove Hospital for ¬£40,000 (¬£ in ). This institution was established in 1859 and moved to a larger site on Sackville Road in 1885. Its nurses had previously lived onsite, but Millar's former home was converted into living quarters (under the name Hove General Hospital Annexe) and the newly vacant rooms at Sackville Road were converted into extra wards, nearly doubling the hospital's capacity. Another change of use came in 1963, when the area's three main hospitals‚ÄîBrighton General, the Royal Sussex County and the Royal Alexandra‚Äîestablished a joint training school in the building. Until then, nurses had been trained in separate facilities at each hospital. The conversion cost ¬£27,000 (¬£ in ). The Brighton and Hove School of Nursing, as it was known, stayed at the Kingsway site until 1989, when a larger facility was opened at the University of Sussex campus. Brighton Health Authority, the owners at the time, tried to sell the building, but it stood empty and in a deteriorating state for more than four years. Proposals included moving Hove Museum into the building from its site at Brooker Hall, but only when the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution submitted a planning application (jointly with the Department of Health) for a care home was there any progress. Their plans were approved in December 1993, restoration work started almost immediately, and a well-supported public open day in 1994 preceded the building's reopening as a 40-bed care home in 1996. The Duke of Kent conducted the opening ceremony on behalf of the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution on 3 December 1996. Under its street address of 157 Kingsway, Barford Court was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 14 October 1986. The perimeter wall and its wooden gates were listed separately on the same date, also at Grade II. In February 2001, they were two of the 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Architecture Barford Court and its surrounding walls are built of greyish-purple brick. Robert Cromie was Britain's foremost cinema and theatre architect, and his design for Ian Stuart Millar's house (variously described as \\"interesting\\", \\"sophisticated\\" and \\"curious\\") was influenced by his work on such buildings. In particular, the interior‚Äîwhose elaborate flourishes and modern features contrast with the \\"austere\\" Neo-Georgian exterior‚Äîhas much in common with the Art Deco style in which he usually worked. The outside walls are built of thin handmade bricks imported from Italy, supported on a base of granite. They are laid in the Flemish bond pattern and are greyish-purple in colour. The hipped roof is laid with handmade tiles. The building was originally U-shaped with an open north side, although design firm Peter Currie Architects' renovation work in 1994‚Äì96 added a single-storey range to form an enclosed courtyard. Other additions have hidden some of the original features, especially in the east (entrance) wing. Decorative elements and motifs on the exterior include geometric patterning on the driveway roof, two-tone brick courses in the courtyard walls, wooden doors with vertical ear-of-wheat carvings, gable ends and arched chimney-stacks. The two-storey house is set slightly below road level, which together with the high perimeter wall means that sea views are only possible from the top floor. The south (garden) front has four bays with ranges of four, three, four and two windows respectively. These are the original sash windows with wooden frames, installed in the 1930s. There are also three dormer windows above. The second and fourth bays project slightly, forming first-floor balconies. On the north side, the front door (with a wheat-ear design, and again with a balcony above) faces the courtyard and some brick-bordered flowerbeds with automatic electric lights. Short columns (five on the west side and more, now hidden, on the east wing) separate the parking garages. Cromie gave the interior up-to- date features such as inlaid lighting and underfloor heating, and themes such as two-tone colour schemes and wooden fixtures are found throughout. The ground floor has extensive areas of tiling in contrasting colours; most light fittings are partly of wood, and some have multiple branches; the doors are panelled with two-tone wood; some walls have hardwood panels; and pargeting, fluting and decorative mouldings are also visible. The staircase has an ornate chandelier, but its main point of interest is the unusual design of the balusters: a series of right-angled stepped blocks linked by four concentric quarter-circles of bronze. There are other bronze fixtures as well, and some marblework on the ground floor. A variety of built-in furniture also survives, despite the reordering of the interior to cater for the building's present use.

Its name is a calque of orbis alius (Latin for \\"other Earth/world\\"), a term used by Lucan in his description of the Celtic Otherworld. Comparable religious, mythological or metaphysical concepts, such as a realm of supernatural beings and a realm of the dead, are found in cultures throughout the world.Gods, goddesses, and mythology, Volume 11, C. Scott Littleton, Marshall Cavendish, 2005, , . Pp. 1286-1287 Spirits are thought to travel between worlds, or layers of existence in such traditions, usually along an axis such as a giant tree, a tent pole, a river, a rope or mountains. Indo-European reconstruction Many Indo-European mythologies show evidence for a belief in some form of \\"Otherworld\\" and in many cases such as in Persian, Greek, Germanic, Celtic, Slavic and Indic mythologies a river had to be crossed to allow entrance to it and it is usually an old man that would transport the soul across the waters. In Greek and Indic mythology the waters of this river were thought to wash away sins or memories whereas Celtic and Germanic myths feature wisdom-imparting waters, suggesting that while the memories of the deceased are washed away a drinker of the waters would gain inspiration. The wayfarer will commonly encounter a dog either in the capacity of a guardian of the Otherworld or as the wanderer's guide. Examples of this are the Greek Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades, and the Indic ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡§æ SarvarƒÅ, one of the hounds of Yama, whose names may derive from an Indo-European *·∏±erberos meaning \\"spotted\\". In Indo- European mythologies the Otherworld is depicted in many ways, including peaceful meadows, islands and buildings making it hard to determine how the original Proto-Indo-European Otherworld was viewed. The ruler of the dead was possibly Yemo, the divine twin of Manu, the first man. =Persian= The Chinvat Bridge (Avestan Cinvat√¥ Peret√ªm, \\"bridge of judgement\\" or \\"beam-shaped bridge\\") or the Bridge of the Requiter in Zoroastrianism is the sifting bridge which separates the world of the living from the world of the dead. All souls must cross the bridge upon death. The bridge is guarded by two four-eyed dogs. A related myth is that of Yama, the Hindu ruler of Hell who watches the gates of Hell with his two four-eyed dogs. =Celtic= The Irish Otherworld is more usually described as a paradisal fairyland than a scary place. Many Celtic Immrams or \\"voyage stories\\" and other medieval texts provide evidence of a Celtic belief in an otherworld. One example which helps the reader understand the Celtic concept of the otherworld is The Voyage of Saint Brendan. Another Classic example of a Celtic \\"otherworld\\" is the Voyage of Bran. The Otherworld is often portrayed as an island to the west in the Ocean in Celtic oral tradition, and even shown on some maps of Ireland during the medieval era.In J. J. C. Smart, Philip Pettit, Richard Sylvan & Jean Norman (eds.), Metaphysics and Morality: Essays in Honour of J.J.C. Smart. B. Blackwell (1987) The otherworld in the idea of Celtic people became hard to distinguish and sometimes overlapped with the Christian idea of hell or heaven as this was often an analogy made to the Celtic idea of an otherworld or Scandinavian idea of a world tree. This is likely because of Roman and Scandinavian influences on Celtic cultures. Dreams and Visions in the Anglo-Saxon Conversion to Christianity. Davis, Patricia M. Dreaming, Vol 15(2), Jun 2005, 75-88. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1053-0797.15.2.75 An example of Scandinavian influence is apparent in the Voyage of Saint Brendan from the likeness of Lasconius the serpent to the Scandinavian Midgard Serpent. Red and white are the colors of animals in the Celtic Otherworld,The Mabinogi and other Medieval Welsh Tales Patrick K. Ford, University of California Press, 1977, . Page 35. and these colors still animate transcendent religious and political symbols today. =Germanic= As was the case in the Celtic mythologies, in Germanic myths apples were particularly associated with the Otherworld. In the Scandinavian tradition mythological localities are featured, as in Irish mythology; however, unlike Irish mythology, an attempt was made to map the localities of the Otherworld rather than list locales associated with it.The Lost Beliefs of Northern Europe Hilda Ellis Davidson, Routledge, 2002 , . pp.67-76 In the Edda many locations are named including the dwellings of the gods such as Odin's hall of Valhalla or Ullr's dwelling of Ydalar (\\"Yewdale\\"). The Gylfaginning and the later Norwegian poem the Draumkvaede feature travels into the Otherworld. =Slavic= The Early Slavs believed in a mythical place where birds flew for the winter and souls went after death; this realm was often identified with paradise and it is called Vyraj. It was also said that spring arrived on Earth from Vyraj. The gates of Vyraj stopped mortals from entering. They were guarded by Veles, who sometimes took the animal form of a rar√≥g, grasping in its claws the keys to the otherworlds. Vyraj was sometimes also connected to the deity known as Rod - it was apparently located far beyond the sea, at the end of the Milky Way. It was usually imagined as a garden, located in the crown of the cosmic tree. Whereas the branches were said to be nested by the birds, who were usually identified as human souls. When the Slavic populations were gradually turning to Christianity (e.g. during the Christianization of Kievan Rus' and the Baptism of Poland), a new version of this belief became widespread in which there were two of these realms - one analogous to the original myth, a heavenly place where birds departed, and the other an underworld for snakes and zmeys, often associated with the Christian idea of hell. This second variant bears many similarities to Nav, another representation of the Slavonic underworld. =Greek= In Greco-Roman mythology the Gods were said to dwell on Mount Olympus whereas the dead usually went to the Underworld or Fortunate Isles after death.

She was educated at by home by governesses, and also attended Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School. Ruth Dowling and John Hubert Fraser Fairfax were married on 2 February 1899, an occasion \\"for great rejoicing, because it was the wedding day of the popular and universally- beloved daughter of the Squire of Lue, Miss Dowling, whose hand was claimed by Mr. Hubert Fairfax, son of Sir James Fairfax, of The Sydney Morning Herald.\\" The Mudgee Guardian and North-Western Representative reported that the bride was \\"beautiful in a dress of white duchesse satin, trimmed with cream lace and chiffon and flowers on bodice.

In 1909 their only child, Vincent was born. They travelled to England in 1912, but returned to Australia at the outbreak of the First World War.  Leadership of women's organisations  Ruth Fairfax became President of the Toowoomba branch of the Australian Comfort Fund, providing support for soldiers fighting in the war and she became recognised as a practical woman with organisational and leadership skills. There were, in the early years of the 20th century, a number of women's groups established, including the National Council of Women, Brisbane Women's Club, and the Queensland Women's Electoral League. There was however, a need identified for an organisation dedicated to the needs of country women. On 10 August 1922, in a meeting at the Albert Hall, Brisbane, Fairfax was elected President of the newly established Queensland Country Women's Association. This meeting was timed to coincide with the Brisbane Exhibition, when there were likely to be large numbers of rural women in Brisbane. The first meeting of the newly formed Association was held in Toowoomba on 12 September 1922, chaired by Fairfax. Fairfax then went on a tour of six months around outback Queensland, establishing branches of the Country Women's Association and recruiting women to their local branches. In 1929, Fairfax travelled to the UK where she studied at Women's Institutes in England and Scotland. She also represented the Country Women's Association at the First International Conference of Rural Women's Organisations in London, and at the International Council of Women in Vienna. Her passion for women in country areas was long-standing, and she thought of country women as a sisterhood, promoting the idea of mutual help and support. She and her family moved to New South Wales in 1931, as her son took up a post with The Sydney Morning Herald, a family business concern since 1841. Her home in Sydney was the , Elaine, on the waterfront at Seven Shillings Beach, . This property was built by the Fairfax family in 1891 and, in 2019, was sold for in excess of 70 million to Scott Farquhar. After the move to New South Wales, Ruth Fairfax continued to be involved in the Country Women's Association.

Christoph M√§ckler, an architect from Frankfurt, was instructed with the planning. The duration of the reconstruction was originally planned to be 5 to 8 years. Until 2010, during first construction phase, the church building was reconstructed. First, archeological excavations as well as measures to stabilize the church building took place. The roof truss, which was heavily infested with wood preservatives, fungi and other pests, was disinfested, decontaminated and taken off in 2007. The damaged parts were restored. In the summer of 2009 the roof truss was straightened up again and put onto the rest of the building. During this time, the church building was a large construction site. By installing an elevator, the building is now barrier free. This also facilitates the transport of the exhibits. Circular galleries were installed. Additional exhibition space was created in the basement floor to provide for special shows for all of Freiburg‚Äôs museums. In the attic there is now room for a painting gallery. A caf√© was opened in the former treasury as well as the cloister, which both are on the main floor. In June 2010, the exhibition hall was opened. In cooperation with the Museum of Modern Arts in Freiburg, the opening was celebrated with a double exhibition of the works by Katharina Grosse and her mother Barbara. Many of the exhibits can‚Äôt be shown for spatial and preserving reasons even after the end of the first stage of redevelopment in March 2010. This is why e.g. the section of everyday culture and folklore can‚Äôt be exhibited yet and the craftwork section is still very fragmentary. This state of repair will remain until the third stage of redevelopment is completed. The second stage of construction was due to begin in 2010 with the redevelopment and construction of the functional sectors at Salzstra√üe, where among other sections the collection of graphic arts which consists of more than 70.000 prints and drawings and an appropriate space for deliveries are now located. The gatehouse, which was constructed incorporating historical elements in 1920, was replaced by a new building. According to the Freiburg city council this phase of construction was initially supposed to cost 8.5 million Euros. However this project, which was supposed to be planned in early 2011, was put under scrutiny, since there were cuts in the culture budget of the city. After the second phase of construction had been approved in mid February the gatehouse was taken down in 2012 and archaeological examinations of the site began. Construction started in the summer of 2013. The new building in Salzstra√üe was finished by the end of 2015 and cost 15,3 million euros. During the third phase of construction the cloister building is currently (2019) being renovated as well as 3 old cellars.  History  The Augustiner Museum displays a municipal collection of art which was founded in the 1880s by Lord Mayor Otto Winterer. In 1909, the architect Rudolf Schmidt drafted a conversion of this former cloister into a museum. Until then, the cloister had been used by the Theater Freiburg Theater Freiburg. In 1915, the conversion had to be ceased due to the First World War First World War. Work on the building resumed in 1919 under the direction of architectural historian Karl Gruber. The museum opened its doors in November 1923. Originally, the conversion should have resulted in a central museum site in Freiburg, but due to restricted municipal funds after the war, the conversion had to be carried out in a severely limited and provisional way. The building remained in this provisional state up until 2010. Due to contamination caused by wood preservation agents, some of the museum‚Äôs wings had been closed for a number of years since they were mostly unusable. The administrative directors have been: * 1922‚Äì1953 Werner Noack * 1974‚Äì1992 Hans H. Hofst√§tter * 1993-2002 Saskia Durian-Ress * 2002‚Äì2008 Detlef Zinke * from 2008 Tilmann von Stockhausen In 2010, the Association of British Guild of Travel Writers British Guild of Travel Writers awarded the lately refurbished Augustiner Museum as one of the best new tourist attractions worldwide. In their category ‚Äúbest foreign project‚Äù, the Augustiner Museum was presented as one of only six attractions and was allowed for reviewing.  Exhibition  The western facade of the church building got a new entrance and opens out to the Augustinerplatz with a foyer. A sculpture hall whose central space remains reserved for original figures and sculptures from the Freiburg Minster is located in the church building reconstructed by Christoph M√§ckler. Panel paintings and wood sculptures surround the hall in cabinets on the ground floor as well as the gallery upstairs. Here, works by Matthias Gr√ºnewald, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Martin Schaffner and Hans Baldung can be found, along with \\"Christ on a Donkey\\" (1350/60), and a number of paintings from the Speyer Altarpiece by the Master of the Housebook (circa 1480). Medieval stained glass from the Freiburg Minster is presented on two levels. The Kaiser windows can also be seen in the dark from the porch entrance outside. Sculptures, altars, paintings, and statuettes of the Baroque era can be found in the chancel of the former abbey. Large figures overlook the room from within niches of eight-metre high typecases. A narrow, fourteen-metre long display case runs like a ribbon along the side wall. It is home to many statuettes and paintings. The organ case from the abbey church of Gengenbach, which was built in the 1720s, is the showpiece of the museum. The organ itself was attached by the local company M. Welte & S√∂hne in the year 1935. In the attic one can find paintings from the 19th century by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, Hans Thoma, Anselm Feuerbach and many more. The paintings show the countryside, portraits, genre scenes, allegorical and religious themes. The space which is used to show those pieces of art is around 1.400 square kilometres big, air-conditioned and barrier- free. The basement of the former Augustinian‚Äôs church?( Augustinerkirche) contains a modern exhibition hall which is almost 450 square kilometres in area. This hall makes it possible for the city of Freiburg to host special exhibitions according to the international conservational standards. The exhibits of the treasure chamber are again available to the public since the January 22, 2011. The chamber contains gold- and silversmithery manufactured from the 9th to 18th century. The items are part of the treasure of the Freiburger M√ºnster. Additionally, there are works from the collections of the archiepiscopal diocesan museum and the Adelhausen foundation. = The pipe organ = The pipe organ, consisting of the historical casing (built 1732/33) from the former church of Gengenbach Abbey and a church organ from M. Welte & Sons (built in 1935) is listed under monumental protection as a total work of art and had to be dismantled in the course of the static reconstruction. In the course of 2009, the casing as well as the organ were completely refurbished. After the removal of the brown paintwork from the 19. century, the casing was modeled back to its original state as well as possible. After a Europe-wide, open competitive bidding, the company Waldkircher Orgelbau J√§ger & Brommer was chosen to remove later additions to the organ and restore its original tonal condition from 1944. The organ is open for visitors in the scope of groups up to 18 people. = Other exhibits = * 'Grablegung der heiligen Ursula', painting around 1440/50 * 'Der Maltererteppich as part of a collection of late medieval textiles (new exhibition 2012) * Works by Dionys Ganter (1798-1862)  Library  The library of the Augustinermuseum is a public reference library, situated in the administration building in the Gerberau 16.

The centrepiece of the record is a 28-minute recitation by Kerouac from his book On the Road that was recorded on an acetate disc in the 1950s but thought lost for decades, and had only recently been rediscovered at the time of release. Other tracks feature Kerouac singing renditions of Jazz hits from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s alongside songs and poems of his own composition. The album closes with a cover of Kerouac's track \\"On the Road\\" (itself included earlier on the disc) performed by Tom Waits with Primus. Video footage of the recording of this track can be seen on the Primus release Videoplasty, and the track itself was later included on the Tom Waits collection Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards, along with a version of the same song titled \\"Home I'll Never Be\\". Track listing Critical reception Richie Unterberger, in his review for Allmusic, describes the album as \\"a worthy collection of Jack Kerouac's narratives and poetry\\", noting that it is particularly enjoyable to hear Kerouac recite his work \\"since his prose had much of a jazz rhythm, and since he was an engaging reader/performer himself.\\" Unterberger goes on to say that Kerouac's singing is \\"unexpected, and amusing if not brilliant\\".

It developed a reputation for both documentaries and feature films, notably the Lieutenant Daring series, featuring Percy Morgan, and the Dick Turpin and Don Q films. Barnet LBC: Red Lion, Finchley Nicholas Hiley, Encyclopedia Of Early Cinema: British and Colonial Kinematograph Company By 1912 it had begun making longer films, such as Robin Hood Outlawed, and using location footage, some shot by Fred Burlingham. Film & TV Database It also covered important news stories such as the funeral of Edward VII and the Coronation of George V, as well as major sporting fixtures. Biography of J. B. McDowell In 1910 the company made a film of the Canadian Pacific Railway and, in 1912, filmed the F.A. Cup Final and the Derby, as well as in Jamaica. Colonial Film: review of Favourite For The Jamaica Cup In 1913, after Bloomfield had left the company, the studio made what has been cited as \\"the first British epic film\\", The Battle of Waterloo. This was filmed by director Charles Weston at Irthlingborough in Northamptonshire. It was made \\"less as a drama and rather more as a recreation of historic actuality\\" and contained \\"elaborately recreated scenes... from the point of view of an ordinary soldier in the thick of the battle\\".Luke McKernan, The Battle of Waterloo: or, Why Can't We Film Such a Thing If We Won the War in the First Place?, 1996 It was nearly an hour and a half long ‚Äì much longer than most others of the period ‚Äì and was filmed using hundreds of extras, in five days, at a cost of ¬£1,800, most of which McDowell raised by remortgaging the company.

The company filmed The Life of Shakespeare (1914), and two versions of The Taming of the Shrew, in 1915 and 1923. The first version is of historical interest for its use of a primitive sound process called Voxograph, which required offstage actors to dub the voices at the same time that the performers were filmed. The second version in 1923 is the earliest surviving British film, visualising the play in about 22 minutes, and retaining many of Shakespeare's lines as intertitles.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant in 1982, and its functions have been replaced by a new Christ Church at the junction of Crosby Road South and Alexandra Road, Waterloo. Early history Christ Church was built between 1891 and 1899 to replace a former church built in 1840 whose structure had become unsound. The foundation stone was laid on 17 October 1891, the nave and baptistry were built between 1891 and 1893, and the chancel was added the following year. In 1899 the tower was built. A competition was held to select the architect, but this failed to find an acceptable design, and the commission was given to the Lancaster firm of Paley, Austin and Paley. The contractors were George Woods and Sons of Bootle, and the church cost ¬£21,956 (). The church was dedicated in April 1893, and on 2 December 1899 it was consecrated by Bishop Royston, an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Liverpool. (this is taken from a document prepared for the Council for the Care of Churches on 12 August 1981) Architecture The architectural historians Pollard and Pevsner in the Buildings of England series express the opinion that this is one of the \\"very finest\\" churches designed by the firm of Paley, Austin and Paley. The church is constructed in Old Red Sandstone from Bootle quarry, and is roofed with green Westmorland slates. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory, a chancel with a south chapel and a north transept, and a northeast tower with vestries to its east. At the west end is a polygonal baptistry, and porches have been incorporated into the west ends of the aisles. The nave measures by , the aisles are wide, the chancel is by , and the south chapel measures by . The architectural style is mainly Perpendicular, and there are elements of Decorated style (in the tracery of the west window), and Art Nouveau style (above doorways and in the aisle windows). The west front is symmetrical with angle buttresses, and contains a tall six-light window. Above the window is a gable containing two ogee-headed niches and a small lancet window. The gable is decorated with chequerwork and on its apex is a stone cross. The baptistry protrudes outwards below the west window. It has two-light square-headed windows, angle buttresses and a moulded parapet. Flanking the baptistry are gabled porches over which are two-light windows at the ends of the aisles. Along the walls of the aisles are two two- light windows in each bay, except for the east bay on the south side which has one window and a small door leading into the chapel. The north transept has a transomed north window and a square-headed window on its west side. On the walls of the clerestory are three-light windows in each bay. The chancel roof is at a slightly lower level than that of the nave, and it has a cross on its gable apex. Between the chancel and the nave on the south side is a turret containing the stairs leading to the walkways behind the parapets. The east window in the chancel is large, with seven lights, and the chapel has a five- light east window. The south wall of the chancel has two bays, each containing a pair of two-light square-headed windows. The tower is in three stages with string courses separating the stages. At its corners are angle buttresses. The middle stage is divided internally into two floors. At the northeast corner of the tower is an octagonal stair turret containing a spiral staircase. The turret rises to a higher level than the tower, and is surmounted by a crocketted stone spirelet. The bottom stage of the tower has a three-light window in the north wall. The middle stage contains an arched two-light window in the west wall and a similar window at a higher level in the north wall. Each wall of the top stage contains a three-light transomed square-headed bell opening. The parapet is double-stepped and is carved with the Latin phrases Laus Deo (praise be to God) and Laudate Dominum (praise the Lord) in Gothic script. On top of the tower is a pyramidal roof. Internally, all the fittings were removed after the church became redundant. The striated stonework is exposed. The arcades between the nave and the aisles are carried on cylindrical pillars. In the south wall of the chancel are three sedilia and a credence shelf. Most of the church is floored with stone flags, but in the chancel are red, green, black and yellow decorated tiles. Some of the stained glass was moved into this church from the older church, but most of it is by Shrigley and Hunt. The glass in the east window depicts the Te Deum and the west window contains the Twelve Apostles. External features The sandstone boundary wall and the gates to the churchyard are listed at Grade II. They are contemporary with the church and were probably designed by the same architects. The gates are in wrought iron. Recent history and present day During the second half of the 20th century, the size of the congregation had fallen to a low level and in 1982 the church was declared redundant. The condition of its fabric deteriorated due to neglect and vandalism, and in 1993 it was planned to demolish it. However, following a public enquiry, it was decided that it should be conserved. In 1998 it was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. A group known as The Friends of Old Christ Church has been formed to raise money for the improvement of the facilities provided by the church building and to encourage its use by the community. It is possible to arrange visits to the church, and it is available for hiring. Events and activities are organised in the church.

The Kentish Hotel has stood the test of time as being one of the most famous established watering holes in the Franklin area since it was first granted its licence to sell liquor in 1853.  Historical significance  Built in 1851 by Edward Constable who emigrated from Maidstone, Kent in England. Constable then went on to apply to the Colonial Secretary for a Publican's Special Licence and Licence No.47 was granted on January 10, 1853. That same licence still continues today and the hotel lays claim to the longest continuous liquor licence in New Zealand. Throughout its long history the Kentish has been at the heart of Waiuku life since it was built. It occupies a central location in Waiuku town, is near the entrance to the Waiuku harbor, and opposite the popular Tamakae reserve which serves as a base for the Waiuku Museum and other attractions.  Challenges and triumph  The Kentish Hotel as it appears today. The Constables established the Hotel as an icon in early Auckland by advertising on the front page of the New Zealander, the most popular newspaper of the period. Travellers began recommending the establishment and it grew to be immensely popular, even hosting such dignitaries as the MƒÅori King Te Whero Whero, Sir George Grey, Richard Seddon, Sir Joseph Ward and William Massey. With its position along a major trading route between the fledgling colonial Auckland and rich, fertile lands of the Waikato, the Kentish thrived. Through the tense times during the land wars of the Waikato beginning 1862-1863, the Kentish managed to survive. In 1926, the hotel nearly burned down when a fire destroyed a block of wooden buildings opposite. As the wind fanned the flames a host of volunteers poured water and hung wet sheets over the facade saving most of the building from significant damage. Recently the Kentish has expanded adding a popular outdoors area overlooking the harbor and Tamakae Reserve. The Kentish went into receivership on 14 August 2012, and with it the longest held liquor licence in New Zealand.

This program provides Inuit from Nunavut with the opportunity to work toward a degree (Bachelor of Education) while remaining in the Arctic. With this degree in education, graduates can contribute and shape the education system in Nunavut by becoming bilingual (Inuktitut and English) teachers or work for the Department of Education. If the Inuit language and culture is to survive during this time of cultural transition, it will be greatly assisted by programs such as NTEP which recognize the importance of infusing Inuit language and culture into the western schooling system that is currently being used across North America (including the Arctic). This program is more than an educational program; NTEP is of political and epistemological importance as it recognizes and legitimizes Inuit knowledge, values and perspectives and provides Inuit with an opportunity to play an active role in education. Description NTEP, in partnership with the University of Regina, offers a campus and community-based program which prepares Inuit to become classroom teachers in Nunavut schools. The emphasis is on training primary and elementary teachers, though students may choose to practice at the junior high and high school levels. The program has a strong focus on practice, and the theory learned in courses is applied in classroom situations through observation and teaching. Based on a strong foundation of Inuit culture and language, NTEP is committed to developing critical, confident, thoughtful Inuit teachers with the personal, academic, and professional skills to provide the children of Nunavut with knowledge, skills and attributes needed to equip them to be contributing community members. Upon successful completion of all program requirements, NTEP graduates are awarded the following: University of Regina of Education Degree, 120 credits (B.Ed.). History The Eastern Arctic Teacher Education Program (EATEP) began in 1979, and an affiliation with McGill University was established in 1981. Initially, NTEP offered a two- year teacher education program culminating in a Certificate in Native & Northern Education from McGill University and certification to teach in the NWT. Graduates of EATEP‚Äôs two-year program accumulated sixty university level credits in elementary education. In 1994, NTEP added another academic year to the program. Graduates who obtained the Certificate in Native & Northern Education could, as well, complete a McGill University B.Ed. It then became a four-year university program with a total of 120 credits. In 2004 NTEP added a foundation year to make it a five-year program. The Foundation year was created to ensure that all applicants met the entrance requirements. In 2007, NTEP gained a new 5-year partnership with University of Regina. The program consists of U of R courses and transfer courses from NAC (Nunavut Arctic College). Under the fee-for-service arrangement, the U of R provides a range of services, including visiting instructors, professional development opportunities for students and learning experiences through exchanges. Community-based programs The Community Teacher Education Program (CTEP) provides teacher training, following the NTEP curriculum, at the community level outside the program center of Iqaluit. This enables students to stay in their home communities with the support of their family; it also gives the students the opportunity to do their practica in the school where they will be teaching. This has been very beneficial as it allows them to get to know the teaching staff who will become their colleagues. Alumni To date (Sept, 2010) there are approximately 460 NTEP graduates: 260 who have obtained certificates and 200 who have earned the Bachelor of Education degree. The majority of graduates are employed, mostly within the school systems in Nunavut. There are also graduates working for the Government of Nunavut, Assistant Deputy Ministers, Deputy Ministers, with Inuit organizations across Canada, the Nunavut Sivuniksavut Training Program (in Ottawa), and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).

It is managed by the Performance Management and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU), an agency under the Prime Minister Department of Malaysia. Overview Launched on 21 September 2010, it is a comprehensive economic transformation plan to propel Malaysia's economy into high income economy. The program will lift Malaysia's gross national income (GNI) to US$523 billion by 2020, and raise per capita income from US$6,700 to at least US$15,000, meeting the World Bank's threshold for high income nation. It is projected that Malaysia will be able to achieve the targets set if GNI grows by 6% per annum. Set to revitalise Malaysia's private sector, the 60% of the blueprint's investment would derived from private sector, 32% from government linked companies and the remaining 8% from the government. Various sectors for development have been identified and are called National Key Economic Areas (NKEA). Labs The Performance Management and Delivery Unit (Pemandu) has conducted laboratories to study on how to implement Malaysia's goal of becoming a high- income country by 2020. As of 2010 131 entry point projects (EPPs) and 60 business opportunities have been identified by the laboratories. It is estimated that these initiatives will generate RM500 billion of national income annually and create up to 2.2 million jobs by 2020. 92 percent of the necessary funding is slated to come from the private sector.Pemandu eyes RM500b, 2.2m jobs in NKEA projects by 2020, By Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, The Malaysian Insider, 30 June 2010 The labs took place over a period of two months in the summer of 2010. 425 people from the government and private sector took part. 211 companies have taken part, including Shell, Exxon-Mobil, MYDIN, Sime Darby, Genting Plantations, Petronas, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Celcom, Ericsson, Maybank, Tesco, Sunway Medical Centre, Masterskill University College, The Body Shop, AirAsia, Malaysia Airlines, RapidKL and Digi Telecommunications. National Key Economic Areas Since 92% of the total investments will originate from private sector, the sector is much involved in the planning of this transformation blueprint. A workshop had been organised by Performance and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU) to identify the 12 National Key Economic Areas (NKEA). The NKEA is the key driver to the success of this program as such activities have the potential to contribute significantly to the growth of the economy of Malaysia. There are 131 entry point projects (EPP) identified under the NKEA, which includes a high speed railway connecting Penang to Singapore and MRT in Kuala Lumpur which YTL Corporation first proposed and are currently looking to undertake. Economic activities that are categorised as NKRA will be prioritised in government planning and funds allocation. Policies will be amended to facilitate fast track implementation of such activities, including liberalising the market and removal of bottlenecks. Under this policy, private companies are invited to get involved, with PEMANDU pushing for the implementation to speed up the implementation. Among the companies that are involved in the transformation programme are YTL Corporation, Shell Malaysia, AirAsia, Hovid Inc, Select-TV, Exxon-Mobil, Dialog Group, Tenaga Nasional, Cisco. =Oil, gas and energy= As of 2010, the energy sector has been an important part of Malaysia‚Äôs economic growth and constitutes about 20 percent of GDP. The Malaysian government plans to increase diversification of the energy industry, increase exploration for new oil and gas resources, enhance production from known reserves, and encourage the use of alternative energy source such as nuclear, solar, and hydro-electric. The government is working to meet these goals 12 of what it calls \\"entry point projects\\" or EPPs. The government wants the energy sectors contribution to gross national income to rise from RM110 billion in 2009 to RM241 billion in 2020. Achieving this goal will create more than 50,000 new jobs with large proportion of these being for skilled professionals such as engineers and geologists. Achieving these goals will require RM218 billion in funding. The government claims only 1 percent of this funding will come from the public sector. An extra RM64 billion will be needed to make up for the expected decline in oil production. Tax rebates for improved energy efficiency are expected to cost RM12 billion.Oil, Gas, and Energy Pemandu Another tool introduced was the Risk Service Contract. The employment of optimising techniques and technologies that are cost-efficient to safeguard profitability is crucial in the oil and gas sector, in particular with regard to the risk service contract (RSC) applied to enhance production of marginal fields. According to think thank Arc Media Global, \\"With some 106 marginal oil fields containing 580 million barrels of oil, Malaysia is Southeast Asia‚Äôs second largest oil and gas producing nation.\\" Bernama, \\"Optimisation important for oil and gas\\", web, \\"The Borneo Post\\", 19 March 2011. On 26 July 2011, at the Production Optimisation Week Asia in Kuala Lumpur, it was discussed that the RSC is essentially a contract that significantly increases an operator‚Äôs risks of exposure. In this case, the awardees or the consortium bears almost all the operating risks and is not paid in the event that the project or system fails. =Palm oil= As of 2010, Malaysia‚Äôs palm oil industry is the fourth largest component of the national economy and accounts for RM53 billion of gross national income. The industry covers the value chain from plantations to processing. The development of this industry is mainly private and remains heavily oriented towards plantations. With limited land available to continue the expansion of plantations, the government desires to increase efficiency in production and focus on providing great value through downstream activities. The Palm Oil NKEA is designed to increase total contributions to national income from the palm oil industry by RM125 billion to reach RM178 billion by 2020. The government hopes that 41,000 new jobs will be created in this sector.Palm Oil, Pemandu Palm oil related EPPs will focus on upstream productivity and downstream expansion. These EPPs will focus on replanting of ageing oil palms, mechanising plantations, stringently enforcing best practices to enhance yields, implementing strict quality control to enhance oil extraction, and developing biogas facilities at palm mills to capture the methane released during milling. Downstream expansion and sustainability will be achieved by capturing the lucrative market segments that focus more on refined products such as oleo-derivatives, food, health products, and bio- fuels. The government says these projects will require funding of RM124 billion over the next 10 years with 98 percent of the funding coming from the private sector. =Financial services= From 2006 to 2009 financial services constituted 10.9 percent of Malaysia's gross domestic product. The government believes that lack of economies of scale, poor liquidity, lack of diversity, low levels of financial knowledge, and competition from other regional financial centres such as Hong Kong and Singapore are significant problems for this sector. The government aims to increase the financial industry's contribution to gross national income from RM121 billion as of 2010 to RM180 billion in 2020. The Financial Services NKEA calls for creating 275,000 jobs in this sector with 56% of those jobs offering an average compensation of RM4,000 per month. These goals will be achieved by strengthening core financial services, creating new services and institutions oriented towards serving those with high incomes, developing avenues for growth such as expanding the asset management business, and pursuing business overseas, especially attracting foreign capital and becoming a centre for Islamic banking.Financial Services, Pemandu Pemandu predicts that RM211 billion will be required to reach these goals by 2020. The public sector is slated to provide 4 percent of this investment. The government is working to facilitate these goals by making Malaysia's business environment more attractive for international capital, attracting and retaining talented professionals, reducing regulation, and lowering taxes. =Private healthcare= On 11 January 2011, Pemandu announced in Pemandu Official Website that RM3 billion will be invested into Country Heights Holdings Berhad. The Country Heights Group of Companies is developing the Mines Wellness City as an integrated health and wellness resort, which will serve as a one-stop destination for both modern and complementary medicine, with a Private Health Screening Centre and a Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre. * Wholesale & Retail * Tourisms * Information and Communication Technology * Education * Business Services * Electrical & Electronics * Agriculture * Greater Kuala Lumpur References External links * PEMANDU Economic Transformation Program * Wellness City under Economic Transformation Program Politics of Malaysia Economy of Malaysia ","title":"Economic Transformation Programme"},{"id":"28936273","text":"James \\"Jim\\"/\\"Jimmy\\" Cowan (born ) is a former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s.

None of his works have yet been translated into English. In 2010, the French actor Fabrice Luchini read some of Muray's works at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Atelier in Paris, which contributed to a renewed discussion of his writings in the French press.Michel Houellebecq, \\"Philippe Muray en 2002\\", in Interventions 2 (Flammarion, 2009).Bruno de Cessole, \\"Philippe Muray, l'insolence de d√©plaire\\" (biographical sketch), in Le D√©fil√© des R√©fractaires (L'Editeur, 2011). Muray's literary styles and the wealth of works he published make him one of the most important writers of the 20th and 21st century. Biography Very little is known about Muray's personal life. His father was a writer and translator of English-language authors (Jack London, Melville, Kipling, etc.) and his mother a devout reader. According to Muray himself, his parents contributed significantly to his literary education and taste of literature. As soon as he could, he started to study humanities in Paris. During some months in 1983, he taught French literature at Stanford University in California. There he developed the concept of L'empire du bien (the Empire of the Good), and he collected materials to write his book Le XIXe si√®cle √† travers les √¢ges (The 19th Century through the Ages), published in 1984. In that book he underlines the importance of occultism in the formation of socialism. He also published a controversial essay about C√©line, in which he tried to explain the fierce antisemitism of the physician and critically acclaimed author of Journey to the End of the Night. Muray went on to argue that C√©line's antisemitism was partly a consequence of his hygienist beliefs ‚Äì as did the Nazis, C√©line believed that the Jews where both an obstacle to progress and a social illness. Philippe Muray died on 2 March 2006 of lung cancer and is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. Writing An exceptional literary stylist and novelist, Philippe Muray published many an article and essay in various French magazines such as L'Atelier du roman, criticizing what he saw as the absurdities and anomalies of the modern world. A philosopher and an artist, he described the major upheavals that have led to the modern-day way of life, trying to show how some aspects of modernity such as jihadhists and neofascists wholly embraced the views of those they opposed. A satirist, he often wrote in a polemical tone, and his perspective is sometimes classified as that of a cultural antimodernist or even reactionary, though Muray did not qualify himself as such. He also wrote various works of fiction, mostly under pseudonyms, of which most are not yet known. Some of his best-known works, Post√©rit√©, Rubens's Glory, On ferme, Square Wheels, Spiritual Exorcisims, L'empire du bien, Dear Jihadi, Minimum Respect, and Festivus Festivus, have yet to be published in English. Muray's writing style is often detailed, insistent, and comical. A productive intellectual who described himself as a student of Louis Ferdinand C√©line, Balzac, Bloy, Bernanos, and P√©guy, he coined numerous neologisms, mostly pejorative, such as \\"Mutin de Panurge\\" (any credulous person who believes himself a rebel and freethinker while following and enforcing the latest trends of the day), \\"Artistocrate\\" (an artist who is completely aligned with the political power structure of the day and whose artistic activity becomes that of a charge, as under the Ancien R√©gime), and \\"Rebellocrate\\" (a person who pretends to be radical but is in fact allied with the power structure). The last is in some way akin to the concept of \\"recuperation\\". Notably, he referred ‚Äì tongue in cheek ‚Äì to the new form of Homo Sapiens, devoted to pleasure and personal fulfillment, as \\"Homo Festivus.\\" Thought first and foremost a novelist whose intent was to describe the mores of his day and their consequences, Muray was also an intellectual interested in major political and cultural changes. In his non-fiction work The 21st Century throughout the Ages, Muray went on to explain how the gradual fall of the Church in Europe after the French Revolution gave rise, in its place, to a wave of occultism, protosocialist, and parapsychology ideologies. These ideologies are for Muray the root and stem of the major political movements that flourished in the 20th century and still dominate modern-day life ‚Äì i.e. feminism, marxisim, fascism, environmentalism, etc. For Muray, intellectuals such as Auguste Compte, Jules Michelet, Victor Hugo, Allan Kardec, Freud, Helena Blavatsky, Emile Zola, Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Foucault, and far-right thinkers such as Edouard Drumont were all proponents of some kind of occultism that manifested itself through different \\"brands\\" of \\"socialist\\" beliefs (though Muray nuanced his proposal: according to him some of these public figures also held views that also went against occultism, as in the case of Sigmund Freud). Muray went on to comment that the movement inspired French thinkers to hope for a regeneration of the human being in a form adapted to life in a Utopian society. This \\"New Man\\", stripped of his primordial defects, it was hoped, would be able to put the theories of socialists such as Karl Marx and Benito Mussolini into practice. Criticism In 2002, Daniel Lindenberg included Muray in his list of \\"new reactionaries\\",Daniel Lindenberg, Le rappel √† l'ordre: Enqu√™te sur les nouveaux r√©actionnaires along with Michel Houellebecq, Maurice Dantec, Alain Badiou, Alain Finkielkraut, and others. It has been demonstrated by Muray that Daniel Lindenberg had not read his works Muray was criticised by the American historian Eugen Weber in his book France, Fin de Si√®cle. While agreeing with the insight that there was a significant nexus between occultism and socialism in 19th-century France, his overall assessment was that it was a ‚Ä≥wordy, pretentious, excruciatingly bad book [...] serious students would do better [...] to turn to Auguste Viatte's Sources occultes de Romantisme.‚Ä≥Eugen Weber, France, Fin de Si√®cle (1991), pp. 104‚Äì105.

He has worked with leading worldwide brands, including Ikea, Pfizer, Pepsi, Procter & Gamble, Mitsubishi, Smart, and Microsoft. In his book Uprising, he argues that ‚Äúmovement marketing‚Äù is the best‚Äîand perhaps only‚Äîway for companies to connect with consumers in the age of social media, and when done effectively the interaction between companies and consumers can lead to positive social change. Goodson started his advertising career in Stockholm, Sweden, launching Bjorn Borg‚Äôs fashion line and is of a group of marketers who emerged from the Swedish advertising industry in the late 1980s and 1990s. His peers include other Swedish creative thinkers who have broken out on the world stage. The inventiveness and visual style of this marketing did much to shape the evolution of contemporary advertising. Goodson and his cofounder Karin Drakenberg moved to Amsterdam in the late 1990s to start StrawberryFrog with the launch of the small two-seat smart car as their founding client along with IKEA and Ericsson Smart Phones, the world leader at the time. ‚ÄúWe built the agency around an open-room principle. From this platform emerged speed, friendship, respect and all the important things that are needed to make it happen. Our office is housed in a large open space in the penthouse of a building on Madison Avenue and it allows us to work with a lot of motivation, inspiration and knowledge because it‚Äôs all-open and everyone is mixed together. Everyone knows and appreciates each other‚Äôs work and if anyone is called away of feeling ill someone can come in and keep the process going,‚Äù says Scott Goodson, co-founder of StrawberryFrog. Early life Goodson was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and was educated at Bishop's College School in Lennoxville, Quebec. He earned a H.B.A. from Western University in London before moving to Stockholm, Sweden where he was co-owner of Welinder Advertising. In 1999, he moved to Amsterdam to found StrawberryFrog with Karin Drakenberg, and later in 2004 the New York office. Work He wrote the global movement strategy and motto for Emirates entitled 'Hello Tomorrow' and with those words came an idea, not just for an ad campaign, but for what Goodson has coined a ‚Äúcultural movement,‚Äù in which, through powerful storytelling, words, images, music and film, Emirates Airline would be shown as the catalyst for connecting a new global culture‚Äînot a culture of flatbeds, stellar service and in-flight meals but one of shared aspirations, values, enthusiasm and dreams. The power of a movement can change habits and rally millions. Goodson did the same with 'Make History' motto for Jim Beam; and he also wrote the movement strategy and motto 'RISE' for the Mahindra Group. For SunTrust Bank, Goodson penned the 'onUp' cultural movement about confidence and determination for millions of Americans who feel stuck in financial stress. It launched on Super Bowl 50. By January 2017, over 1 Million people had joined the onUP movement. Goodson launched a new city for the Government of Dubai, the new 145 km2. master-planned city developed in partnership with the emirate of Dubai. The city is designed to be a \\"smart\\" and sustainable city and a pivotal hub in the global economy. Goodson penned both the name Dubai South and the tagline of the \\"City of You\\", with his agency chosen on the back of Goodson's previous work for Emirates Airline‚Äôs ‚ÄòHello Tomorrow‚Äô creative idea and EMAAR's Downtown Dubai ‚ÄòCentre of Now‚Äô. His campaign features the work of illustrator Mats Gustafson, who created original watercolour sketches that capture Dubai South‚Äôs people-centric approach city living.

The current lighthouse was built in 1955, replacing a previous lighthouse built in 1880. It serves as the rear range light for two different ranges. History =Old lighthouse= Plans for the lighthouse, as drawn in 1878 by James Barnet keeper's cottage to the left. The first light on Pilot Hill was most probably a platform with a kerosene lamp, located on the eastern part of the hill. The first actual structure was a small wooden hut built in 1866 with a large kerosene lamp placed on a bench. It was located where the 1880 lighthouse was later built, at . The mast from this lighthouse is on display at the Story House Museum in Yamba. In 1878 tenders were called for a permanent lighthouse, one of five lighthouses of similar design designed by James Barnet in 1878-80, the other four being Fingal Head Light, Crowdy Head Light, Tacking Point Lighthouse and Richmond River Light. It was built by W. Kinnear at a cost of ¬£1,097, and construction was completed in 1880. Like the other four lighthouses, it was a rather short tower, about high, with a roofed porch connecting it to a rectangular annexe. It was visible for . A keeper's cottage was also constructed near-by. In 1920 the lighthouse was automated and demanned. In 1934 the Pacific Hotel was built in Yamba, and the light was somewhat obscured. In addition, a water reservoir was to be built at the location. A new lighthouse was built in 1955, and the old lighthouse was demolished in 1956. =Restoration= After the reservoir was demolished in 1980, an attempt has been made to raise government funds to erect a replica of the lighthouse at the original location. However, as funds could not be raised, local volunteers self-funded and built the replica, but without the lantern. The building houses the Yamba Community Radio Station 2TLC. In 2009, a project began to fully restore the lighthouse again, with support from local individuals and businesses. In November 2011 the project was almost completed, with the installation of a lantern and an original 19th century Fresnel lens donated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) for the project. =Current lighthouse= Plans for the new tower, 1951 The new lighthouse was built in 1955 from concrete in a modern style. The apparatus from the old lighthouse was transferred. The current light source is a FA-251 beacon with a 12 Volt 75 Watt quartz halogen lamp, supplying a light intensity of 22,000 cd and visible for . The power source is a battery charged from the mains electricity. The current characteristic is three white flashes every 15 seconds (Fl.(3)W. 15s).

Its population is mostly composed of Maronites numbering around 12,000 persons according to the civil state registers. It is usually full with people during summer but a few stay during the winter. The village's challenging terrain and snowy winters supported the creation of an active Off Road driving community and an ATV group. Etymology The origin of the name \\"Al Qoubaiyat\\" is Aramaic. The word \\"Qbayya\\" means the big pool of water, and \\"Qbayyat\\" is the plural of it. That region was called \\"Qbayyat\\" for being rich in water sources. Geography Al Qoubaiyat is located at the northeast of the Lebanese republic. to the North of the Lebanese capital Beirut. It is limited at the west by the village \\"Akkar al-Atika\\", at the East by the line which separates the two districts of Akkar (North) and the Hermel Bekaa. It spreads along 70 km2 almost. Its limits are: At the west: Al Qoubaiyat - Akkar Attika - Halba. At the East: Al Qoubaiyat - Andaket - Chadra - the Syrian borders. At the north-West: Al Qoubaiyat - Halba - Tripoli. At the south: Al Qoubaiyat - Hermel - Baalbeck. History During the 17th century the name of Al Qoubaiyat began to appear in the documents of the legislative court in Tripoli as being the biggest village in Akkar paying the taxes of engagement. Its History is that of the \\"fertile valley\\" at very time and place; in other words, it has been a center of attraction for the people who desired a stability based upon agriculture, and according to this principle was born the civilization. One of the French consuls in Lebanon \\"Ducousso\\" described it in 1912 by the following words: \\"These valleys are fascinating by their surprising fertility\\". This is how Kobayat has been for a long time the residence of several peoples. Its ruins are the witness of its ancient people: cemeteries from the age of iron and copper (3000 years BC). It is located on the silk road, between East and West Asia through the Mediterranean, towards Rome, the capital of the ancient world. A Phoenician and pagan altar in front of \\"St.Chahlo\\" church, Phoenician, Greek and Roman pieces of currency at \\"Ghassalet\\" church and \\"Chahlo\\", Roman tombs in every parts, as well as two luxurious Roman ruins are all witnesses of the great prosperity in the Roman age during the first centuries of Christianity: The first is the temple of the God \\"Ban\\", in Helsban Saint Valley, transformed in a church baptized under the name of st. Artimos-Challita. The second is one majestic castles to chouita, witness of the events of the omeyade-Byzantine duel in Orient.

It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and written by series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on September 23, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include Mario Brassard, Matt Damon, Jan Owen, Paula Pell, and Jeffrey Schara. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) interferes in Liz Lemon's (Fey) relationship with Carol (Damon) as he is determined to help Liz have a relationship that lasts for once. At the same time, Jack struggles to compromise with his girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) as she redecorates his apartment. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has trouble coming to terms with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) getting fired as an NBC page and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) becomes a producer of the fictional sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). This episode also continued a story arc involving Carol as a love interest for Liz, which began in the previous episode, the season finale of the show's fourth season \\"I Do Do\\". Before the airing, NBC moved the program to a new timeslot at 8:30 p.m., moving it from its 9:30 p.m. slot. This episode of 30 Rock received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 5.85 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.6 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), the head writer of the sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan, goes back to work following the summer break and prepares for the show's fifth season. At the 30 Rock building, where she works, Liz and TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) meet their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to discuss cutting the show's expenses. During the meeting, Pete reveals that star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) now has a producer credit because of changes in her contract that were not set to start until the fifth season of TGS (nobody thought that the show would last that long). Jenna takes this role seriously and takes on the job of firing people. Eventually, on reviewing the budget, she realizes that her producer credit is costly‚Äîand unnecessary‚Äîand asks Pete to fire her. Later, Jack asks Liz about her relationship with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack does not believe that the relationship is serious since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all the rooms of the hotel that Liz and Carol stay in when he is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol bursts into tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14. During the summer break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) moved in with him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy‚Äînamed after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who employed a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to knock down a wall instead. At the end of the episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a perfect match, far beyond the level of mere soul-mates. Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is missing Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), a former NBC page who was fired in the previous episode, \\"I Do Do\\". When Tracy returns to work for the new season of TGS, he begins to hallucinate Kenneth everywhere he goes, mistaking the new page (Jeffrey Schara) and Liz for him. Later, Tracy roams the city and sees Kenneth, who is now working as a page at CBS. Tracy believes Kenneth is a hallucination. Later, the two run into each other again and Kenneth tries to talk to Tracy, but Tracy refuses to acknowledge him as he believes his mind is playing tricks on him. To prove he is real, Kenneth throws himself in front of a car, thus making Tracy believe him. He pleads with Kenneth to come back to NBC, but Kenneth says he is happy working at CBS. At the end of the credits, Kenneth admits to himself that he lied to Tracy and that he misses everyone at TGS. Kenneth then starts hallucinating Tracy. Production \\"The Fabian Strategy\\" was written by series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey, and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, a long-time television director who worked with Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. This was Fey's twenty-second writing credit, and McCarthy-Miller's thirteenth helmed episode. \\"The Fabian Strategy\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 23, 2010, as the season premiere episode of the show's fifth season and the 81st overall episode of the series. This episode of 30 Rock was filmed on August 30, 2010. Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken In March 2010, it was announced that actor Matt Damon would guest star on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the fourth season finale episode \\"I Do Do\\" as Carol, an airline pilot and love interest for Fey's character, Liz Lemon, and reprised the role in \\"The Fabian Strategy\\". In December 2009, prior to the confirmation of his first guest appearance, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he was at the top of Fey's guest star wish list for the show. A fan of the series, Damon replied \\"I would do [30 Rock] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people‚Äîor even better me. Or I could call her. Let's make this happen.\\" A day after the airing of \\"I Do Do\\" he was asked if he would reprise his role as Carol in the upcoming season and responded \\"If they'll have me, I would love to pop in and see the gang again. I had a great time doing it.\\" In August 2010, Fey confirmed Damon's return saying that he would play her boyfriend once the new season began. Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney, revealed to Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello her character's plot in which Jenna becomes a television producer as part of her contract as TGS begins its fifth season. \\"[Jenna] has all these wacky things built into her contract [that kick in at this point], because nobody thought we'd still be on the air. So I get to be a producer.\\" Series producer Paula Pell reprised her role as Paula Hornberger, the wife of Scott Adsit's character Pete Hornberger. The episode references the ongoing storyline of Liz's desire to become a mother when she tells Carol that she is on a waiting list to adopt a child. This story first began in the show's first season, and continued in the third season. Two months after the airing of the fourth season finale episode, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock was asked if Jack McBrayer's character Kenneth Parcell would return in the upcoming season after he was fired as an NBC page in \\"I Do Do\\". Carlock said \\"We haven't cracked [how] he is getting [his job] back, but of course he will get back somehow. We wanted a fun thing to shuffle the deck a little bit and send him off into the world. Of course, he will miss it and he will be missed. Events will bring him back.\\" In \\"The Fabian Strategy\\", Kenneth is now working at CBS as a page for the Late Show with David Letterman. The scene in which Kenneth throws himself in front of a car to prove to Tracy Jordan that he is real and not Tracy's imagination was filmed on August 27, 2010, in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater. Cultural references Jack employs the Fabian strategy named after Roman general Fabius Maximus (pictured), who delayed direct battle with Hannibal to take advantage of the Carthaginian's supply weaknesses At the start of the episode, Liz says while sleeping, \\"No, Tom Jones, no!\\" before waking up. This is a reference to a future plot in the episode \\"Reaganing\\" in which Liz is having intimacy issues because of a traumatic incident from her childhood that involved a poster of singer Tom Jones. Throughout the episode, Jack refers to the Fabian strategy, a strategy named after Roman general Fabius Maximus, which avoids direct battle in favor of attrition warfare. Jack uses the strategy as he does not want to say no to Avery or give in to her demands. In addition, Jack hails Fabius Maximus as his role model. When Carol surprises Liz at the TGS writers' room, staff writer J.D. Lutz (John Lutz) asks Carol if he is on Facebook, the latter being a social networking website. Later, Liz tells Jack not to interfere in her relationship with Carol, as she believes she has the perfect relationship with him. She reveals that she is modeling her life on that of chef Ina Garten of the Food Network show Barefoot Contessa. Jack responds by saying that Liz will never be like Garten, including the \\"barefoot\\" part, referring to the fact that Liz has never let anyone see her feet, which is a real life trait of Fey's. Liz and Carol discover that one of the things they have in common is that they both love to watch The Muppets presenting award shows. Later, Liz reveals that she has a Life Alert Emergency Response necklace; this necklace helps the elderly contact emergency services in case of an accident. Carol wonders why Geico‚Äîan auto insurance company‚Äîhas multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz \\"Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear.\\" Before parting ways, Liz says to Carol \\"See you October 14\\", a reference to the live episode of 30 Rock entitled \\"Live Show\\" that aired on October 14, 2010. 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip‚Äîboth of which debuted on 2006‚Äì07 NBC lineup‚Äîrevolved around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live and executive producer of 30 Rock, denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both programs, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey succeeded where Sorkin did not when Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, the latter was more expensive to produce. In the ending sequence of \\"The Fabian Strategy\\", Kenneth watches the credits for TGS, which include Ricky Tahoe and Ronnie Oswald as writers, the two former head writers on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Reception Before the airing of this episode, NBC unveiled its 2010‚Äì11 primetime schedule in May 2010 with the network moving the program from the 9:30 p.m. time to the 8:30 p.m. timeslot. According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 5.85 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.6 rating/8 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. A contributor from Variety reported that Community, an NBC show that airs at 8:00 p.m., and 30 Rock \\"held up nicely\\" in their respective timeslots and that the two programs \\"were up over last year's opening Thursday hour for NBC in premiere week.\\" The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin reported that past season premieres of 30 Rock had a solid track record as being the worst episodes of the season, nonetheless Rabin found \\"The Fabian Strategy\\" hilarious and breaking that barrier. He wrote that Matt Damon has been great on the show as Carol; however, his only complaint was Carol's character flaw as being too sensitive. Rabin, who has complained \\"extensively\\" about Jenna's character in the past, said the character was in \\"fine form\\" in her role as a TGS producer. Rabin gave the episode an A- grade rating. Bob Sassone of TV Squad deemed this episode a \\"solid season-opener\\" that featured \\"lots of great lines and plot development\\". Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, was thrilled that the Jack and Avery relationship \\"not only lasted the summer, but is thriving\\", and wrote that she was looking forward to the pregnancy storyline involving Avery. Blake noted that Damon's character was \\"darn-near perfect, by which I mean 'a male version of Liz.'\\" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix said that \\"The Fabian Strategy\\" did not \\"live up to the good old days\\" of past episodes, nonetheless reported that he \\"laughed enough\\" and was pleased with the direction the show took Liz and Carol's relationship. Sepinwall did not like Tracy and Kenneth's story, calling it a complete miss, but was appreciative of the other storylines, choosing Pete and Jenna's as his favorite. Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times was positive about Damon's role on the show, noting that he has been a \\"hoot\\". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the episode was a \\"nice start to the [fifth] season\\" of 30 Rock as it was \\"perhaps more plot-driven than packed with the emotional and uproariously funny episodes that concluded last season.\\" Eidler commented that \\"The Fabian Strategy\\" never did \\"[reach] the utter hilariousness of last season, but I hope that wasn't the climax ... and it can eventually return to its previous heights of hilarity\\". TV Guides Bruce Fretts was complimentary towards Damon's role as Tina Fey's love interest, writing that Damon \\"showed a refreshingly silly side in keeping with 30 Rocks anything-goes spirit.\\" Matt Wilstein of The Huffington Post called the premiere \\"a very solid first episode\\", enjoying Damon's part on the show and the Kenneth story of him still being fired by NBC. Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that the Pete/Jenna and Tracy/Kenneth plots were a \\"hit-and-miss\\", however noted it was good to see the show giving the Jack and Liz characters \\"ongoing direction, not just in their personal lives\\". The Atlantics Caitlan Smith was skeptical about Liz and Carol's relationship lasting, saying that Damon \\"who commands more than $20 million per movie, won't stick around for long, leaving Liz Lemon Carol-less and in for another round of the entertaining self-loathing that we've all been coming back for four seasons.\\" References External links  30 Rock (season 5) episodes 2010 American television episodes Television episodes written by Tina Fey Television programs directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller ","title":"The Fabian Strategy"},{"id":"28936567","text":"Ken Reid is an American standup comedian based in Boston.

He is also a published poet. Biography =Early life and education, UK and Australia= Michael Stone was born in Leeds, England in 1938. In 1941 his family moved to Sydney, Australia, where he was raised. He attended North Sydney Boys High School where he studied Latin, Hebrew and Greek (First Class Honours).NSBHS Leaving Certificate 1955 He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Melbourne in Semitic Studies and the Classics during the years 1956‚Äì1960. His father, Julius Stone, was a professor of International Law at the University of Sydney and the first chairman of the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University. =Professional life in Israel, the US, etc.= He immigrated to Israel in 1960. After a year-long acclimation program at the Hebrew University (1960‚Äì61), Stone transferred to Harvard University in the United States and there completed a doctorate under Professor Frank M. Cross in the Department of Near Eastern Languages during the years 1961‚Äì65. His doctorate addressed the conception of eschatology in 4 Ezra. Afterwards he became a lecturer in Comparative Religion at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1966 he returned to Israel, became a lecturer in Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in the following year became an associate professor. In 1980 he became a full professor of Armenian Studies and was named as the Gail Levin de Nur Professor of Religious Studies. In 2007 he retired from the Hebrew University, where he continues his research and lecturing as a professor emeritus. Stone held many visiting research and professorial positions at academic institutions worldwide. He was (according to chronology) assistant professor of religious studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara (1965‚Äì66), lecturer in Jewish studies and Armenian studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1966‚Äì69), senior lecturer in the same (1969‚Äì76), visiting research fellow at Harvard University (1971‚Äì72), George Scott Fellow at Ormond College of the University of Melbourne (summer of 1974), visiting member of the Theological Faculty at Leiden University (summer of 1975), associate professor at the Hebrew University (1976‚Äì80), the Berg Professor of Judaic Studies (1977‚Äì78) and the Tarzian Adjunct Professor of Armenian History and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania (1977‚Äì83), fellow-in-residence (1980‚Äì81) and visiting scholar (autumn of 1984) at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies, distinguished visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania (summer 1985), visiting scholar at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (summer of 1986), distinguished visiting fellow at Ormond College of the University of Melbourne (spring of 1988), visiting professor of Jewish studies at Harvard Divinity School (fall of 1989), visiting professor at Yale University (autumn of 1991), Distinguished NEH Visiting professor at the University of Richmond (spring 1993), visiting professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia (1993), fellow-in-residence and the director of a research group on translation techniques at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (1997‚Äì98), visiting professor of New Testament and Judaic studies at Harvard University (autumn of 2001), distinguished senior visiting fellow in the Kluge Center of the Library of Congress (autumn 2003), the Sugden Distinguished Visiting fellow at Queen's College of the University of Melbourne (summer of 2004), and distinguished visiting professor of Judaic studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (2006‚Äì07).

He is a founder of the Society of Biblical Literature Pseudepigrapha Group (USA) and was a member of the steering committee. =Private life= He married Nira Weintraub in 1961. She was a scholar in the history of Byzantine and Armenian art, a field in which she taught for many years at the Hebrew University. They have two children and six grandchildren. Nira died in the summer of 2013. =Literary activity= Stone has written and published many poems in English, and he is a member of the Israel Association of Writers in English. Research Stone is first and foremost a historian of religious thought. His research focuses on two fields: Jewish thought and literature of the Second Temple period including its transmission into the Middle Ages; and Armenian Studies. His work emphasizes texts and their interpretations but extends beyond a narrow textual focus to ideological analysis within religious and intellectual history. Armenian studies Credited with \\"single-handedly pioneer[ing] the study of the Armenian language, literature and history\\", Stone's research has focused on several topics within this subject: =Jewish literature translated into Armenian= Stone has published several books dealing with Jewish literature translated to Armenian. In his book, The Armenian Version of 4 Ezra, Stone published the first full critical edition of any text connected with the Armenian biblical canon. Following its publication, Stone produced several volumes of texts and exegesis addressing biblical or Jewish traditions. These volumes contain manuscript texts edited anew including the first editions of documents that were beforehand unknown. In this vein, many of Stone's articles are dedicated to the publication of texts, and in so doing he established a wide body of texts that were important both for Armenian and Pseudepigrapha Studies. He published the first edition of the Armenian version of the Armenian Adam book, The Penitence of Adam in 1981. In so doing, he initiated long-term research on the deuterocanonical books dealing with Adam and Eve, which he collected over the past decade. He published concordances of Armenian deuterocanonical literature about Adam (1996, 2001) and additional literature related to Armenians and other Adam traditions (mentioned below). =Armenian deuterocanonical literature= With these publications Stone initiated a new field of study and research: deuterocanonical literature in Armenian, which is the transmission of biblical and Jewish traditions in Armenian. In so doing he had lasting influence on Armenian Studies as well as the study of deuterocanonical literature. In recent years he has focused on the way in which these traditions function within the Armenian culture and how their transformation reflects changes in the religious and intellectual history of the Armenian nation. He presents diachronic questions that were never before posed and traces shifts of religious, intellectual, and cultural history that were hardly addressed. These questions touch on understanding the human condition and existential purpose. Furthermore, the diachronic research of entire traditions highlights changes that occurred in Armenian thought throughout generations and ties them to Armenian history, politics, religion, and thought. Here he attends to ancient Jewish elements in Armenian culture. =Armenian paleography and history in Israel= Stone's interest in Armenian manuscripts led him to study the Armenian script. He published a number of technical descriptions of manuscripts and co-published with Dr. Nira Stone the Catalogue of the New Armenian Manuscripts in the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin. He edited and published Armenian graffiti from Sinai in a significant work of historical, epigraphic, and linguistic consequences. The inscriptions shed light on ancient Armenian pilgrimage, on the character of the pilgrims, and on their linguistic usages. His research tied into Armenian graffiti in Nazareth. He proved that a portion of the inscriptions in Sinai and Nazareth are the oldest Armenian script in the world and were inscribed within decades of the creation of the Armenian alphabet (early fifth century CE). Stone published numerous Armenian inscriptions from the Land of Israel and made several significant discoveries regarding Armenian pilgrimage and monasticism in the Holy Land. He was the editor in chief of The Album of Armenian Paleography, a large project that exhibits and analyzes the development of the Armenian script beginning with the most ancient dated manuscripts and up until the nineteenth century. In the course of preparing this work he devised techniques for producing script tables directly from digital images of the manuscripts themselves. On one side of each opening there is a picture of the manuscript; on the other there is a copy of a segment of the text, paleographic discussion, and bibliography. At the end of the book appear development tables. =Jews in Armenia= With Israeli archeologist Dr. David Amit, Stone researched and published on a medieval Jewish cemetery of southern Armenia. This thirteenth- century cemetery is akin to no other ‚Äì not only in terms of Armenia but of the oriental-Jewish communities. On the tombstones there are inscriptions in both Hebrew and Aramaic that teach about the life of the Jewish community in southern Armenia, about which there was no information previously. His research on the Jews of Armenia continues today. =Use of computer applications= Stone recognized very early on the potential of computer applications for Armenian studies. In 1971 he completed his first computer- aided research in Armenian. Since then he has used a computer application to compare manuscripts to produce scientific editions of texts as well as concordances. He wrote books in other fields of Armenian Studies; for example, the publication of his research with M.E. Shirinian dealing with the edition, translation, and exegesis of an ancient philosophical work preserved only in Armenian and with R.R. Ervine on patristics. Jewish thought and literature of the Second Temple Period On this subject Stone dealt with a range of topics. Among the specific documents that he researched are 4 Ezra, the Aramaic Levi Document, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Enoch and Noah literature, and literature relating to Adam and Eve. In the field of history of religious thought he has worked especially on apocalyptic literature and also on issues dealing with the central characteristics of Judaism of that period. He has also written monographs and articles on many other subjects in the field. =The Apocalypse of Ezra (4 Ezra)= This text was the subject of Stone's research for twenty-five years, the culmination of which was his exegesis of 4 Ezra, published in 1990. This work was written originally in Hebrew approximately thirty years after the destruction of the Second Temple and translated into Greek. From this Greek version it was translated into other languages: Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian. None of the Hebrew versions have been preserved and only fragments of the Greek, and for the vast majority of the text there remains to the present day only the translations from Greek, on which Stone worked. His book features detailed interpretation of the verses together with a wider analysis of the literary dynamic and religious worldview of the author as revealed in the text's content and presentation of topics. Over the years he wrote a series of articles on 4 Ezra, including the significance of structure, its notion of divine justice, as well as mystical and exegetical elements. These studies have been called \\"groundbreaking\\" by other researchers in the field. Stone published two collections of articles on 4 Ezra and other dimensions of Second Temple Judaism. A prominent factor of his exegetical approach to ancient texts is the idea that descriptions of religious phenomena may represent actual experiences of the author or of the circle from which he/she came. This approach considers the religious experience of the author as a factor for researching ancient religious literature. He also published the Armenian version separately (mentioned above) as well as his doctoral thesis on the text's eschatology (1989). In the course of his research he led the study of apocalyptic literature on topics relating to ancient religious thought. =The Testament of Levi and the Dead Sea Scrolls= Along with his research on 4 Ezra, Stone published the Armenian text of The Testament of Levi (1969). After many years of work, he published a critical Armenian edition of all twelve testaments of the sons of Jacob with the help of his former student, Dr. Vered Hillel (2012). Towards the end of the 1960s he commenced cooperation with Professor Jonas Greenfield regarding the Aramaic apocrypha, which continued until Greenfield's death in 1995. Together and separately, they published a series of articles that arose from their research, including some addressing the Enoch literature. Since then, Stone published their joint edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments of The Testament of Levi in the DJD series. With Dr. Esther Eshel, Stone completed his and Greenfield's translation, exegesis, and research on this third- or second-century BCE work. The work survives in fragments transmitted in Jewish and Christian channels, including the Cairo Geniza, a Greek manuscript, and Dead Sea fragments. They arranged scattered segments and wrote exegeses. The research on the Book of Enoch led Stone to become interested in the Dead Sea Scrolls. He wrote on the relationship between the Pseudepigrapha and Qumran literature, classification of the Jewish literature in the days of the Second Temple, and related topics. With Esther Eshel he edited the 4Q464 manuscript, and with Esther Chazon a fragmentary work on the end times. Likewise, in his edition of fragments from the Testament of Naphtali, Stone showed that the fragment found at Qumran was included in altered form in the Greek Testament of Naphtali. pages = 73-82 Rabbi Moshe ha-Darshan, author of the Midrash Genesis Rabbati (France, eleventh century) knew of a similar or identical document to the Qumran one in a semitic language. From this the question of literary transmission from the days of the Second Temple to the Middle Ages arose acutely. Stone founded the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Hebrew University in 1995 and directed it during its early years. =The Books of Adam and Eve= Toward the end of the 1990s, Stone returned to a subject he discussed in his earliest articles: the Armenian apocryphal \\"Death of Adam\\". After publication of his commentary on 4 Ezra he turned to the apocryphal literature of Adam and Eve. In 1992 he wrote, A History of the Literature of Adam and Eve, and in 1999 he published a book on the subject with Professor Gary Anderson. With Anderson, he also published a collection of studies on the Adam literature (2000) and books on other aspects of the Adam and Eve literature. The book, Adam's Contract with Satan, deals with a tradition of Adam and Eve preserved in Slavic, Armenian, Georgian, modern Greek, and others. He followed the spread of this legend, which has it that after Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden, they sinned a second time due to Satan deceiving them. That being the case, the post-lapsarian state of human beings in the world may be explained on two levels: 1‚Äîwhy we are not in the Garden of Eden based on the book of Genesis; 2‚Äîthe fate of humans in the world is the outcome not of sin, but of deception (i.e., Satan deceived them). Subscribers to this perspective on the world see it differently than those that attribute it to the sin of Adam and Eve alone or to original sin, as in Western Christianity. =The history of Ancient Judaism= In this field Stone has delved into the character and phenomenology of Jewish apocryphal literature, a subject that occupied scholarship especially in the 1970s and 1980s. The conceptual innovations and insight contained in Stone's writing on Second Temple Judaism (such as the transition from oral to written literature, the sociological approach to understanding the wisdom teacher, and questions pertaining to the pseudepigrapha) left a lasting impression on modern perceptions of the primary sources. His work in this field is published mainly in articles. Stone's abilities and interests as a historian of religion are most prominent in this area of his research. His chief articles addressing these topics were gathered in two collections. =Current research= Today Stone pursues several research endeavors in the field: he has just completed a comprehensive investigation of Adam and Eve in the Armenian tradition (2013); he is preparing to publish many Armenian inscriptions from Jerusalem; and he is working on a book that will include previously unknown documents in Armenian about biblical figures. Research projects =Rock Inscriptions and Graffiti= Stone collected photographs of graffiti inscriptions in many languages in the Sinai, the Negev, and the Christian holy places. He himself published much of the Armenian material documented during the project. This material has been mounted online at rockinscriptions.huji.ac.il. =The Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature= In 1995, Stone founded the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Hebrew University for the purpose of integrating new information from the scrolls with previous knowledge about Second Temple Judaism. Today, the center is one of the important research institutes on the Dead Sea Scrolls. =The International Association of Armenian Studies (Association Internationale des Etudes Arm√©niennes)= Stone founded the International Association of Armenian Studies (Association Internationale des Etudes Arm√©sniennes) in 1980, held the office of president until 2000, and since then is the honorary president. Membership in the organization, limited to researchers in the field, numbers today more than 200. It is the leading organization for Armenian Studies. =The Jewish Cemetery in Armenia= With the Israeli archeologist Dr. David Amit, Stone oversaw the excavation of the Jewish cemetery in Armenia and the publishing of the inscriptions.

Location The national park is surrounded by mountains and many small rivers. Giant silver rocks and waterfalls surrounds the park. It is located approximately 200 kilometers from the coastal city of Dalian. and 25 km from Zhuanghe(South of Dalian). A recently constructed rail service called \\"Yellow Sea Express\\" shortens the traveling time to two hours from Dalian. History The national park was established in October 2005, () was formally named Dalian Yinshitan Forest National Park. The park was the first to allow individuals to contribute to the ecological protection and exploration of the area. This is done by donations from tourist to a specific area in the park to fund conservation objectives. The highest mountain in the park is called the Xiema Peak (literally \\"Tying Horse Mountain\\"), dates back to the era of the Tang dynasty. There was a war between the Chinese army and the Korean empire near Xiema Peak. The Chinese General Xue Rengui () observed the landforms in advance of the war, he climbed the highest mountain and tied his horse to a big rock. The Koreans were defeated in the battle. The general Xue Rengui became famous for this victory and eventually became the name of the mountain ever since Name origin Dalian Yinshitan Forest National Park or abbreviation () got its name from the giant rocks with vivid shapes. According to textual research from the Geologic Department of Beijing University, the mountains were formed by violent debris that happened 500 million years ago then followed by a landform of ancient debris flow. The mountains‚Äô shapes supposedly reminded of different animals such as a lying horse, a turtle climbing a mountain. Geography There are nine valleys among the mountains; the longest valley (Dawan Valley) stretches 13 kilometers. Along the valleys there are several streams that form different lakes. Dalian Yinshitan Forest National Park is known for its big rocks and many plants, but is also famous for its waterfalls. Since Silver Stone Beach lies in drainage of Yingna River, the annual amount of precipitation is 855 millimeters. Numerous rivers and streams flow through the mountains, which creates seven large scaled waterfalls. In the summer season (June to August), the quantity of water increases tremendously due to heavy rainfall. This results in more water flowing in the waterfall thus making the sound of water more vibrant. The park is 77.2 percent covered by plants and the primary forest covers an area of 91.9 hectares. The botanic diversity consists of thousands of plant species, originated from the ancient ages. The Tiannu Mulan flower () and the Sanya Diaozhang Tree () are nationally protected on a level one basis (the highest type of national protection of scarce plants in China). On a nationally protected level two basis, there are the Huaqu Liu Tree (), Shuiqu Liu Tree (), Hetao Qiu Tree (), Huang Boluo Tree (), Ciqiu Tree (), Yanfu Mu Tree () and Dengtai Tree (). Not only are these trees protected because of their scarcity, they also have ornamental value. In the primary forests there are plenty of Azalea flora. They take up 266 800 square metres of the total area. The altitudes where the Azaleas grow are different which causes the Azaleas to blossom in different seasons. In addition to the trees and the Azaleas, fruits and nuts are in abundance, such as grapes, kiwifruit, hawthorn, cherries, walnut, and chestnut. There is also a large number of types of mushrooms. It is possible to find Ginseng. Eco-tourism  A specific area of the park is designed for self-service fruit picking. In addition, there is another area of the park that provides adoption of fruit trees. Each visitor is allowed to adopt five trees maximum, paying an annual fee. In the harvest season, the adopter may obtain the fruits. There are also resources of protected saplings of cherry trees, pear trees, blueberry trees, apricot trees, peach trees and kiwifruit trees. Hot spring and spa  The hot spring contains metallic minerals of high temperature chloride. The water contains medicinal elements such as lithium, bromine, iron, copper, zinc, and iodine. These elements may have therapeutic effects for rheumatism and digestive diseases.

Mana- Zucca (25 December 18858 March 1981) was an American actress, singer, pianist and composer. Biography Mana-Zucca was born Gussie Zuckermann in New York City on December 25, 1885. The daughter of Polish √©migr√©s, she was a child prodigy who began composing at an early age. Mana-Zucca was interested in music when she was very young. She was frustrated at the age of three when she found that her toy piano doesn't have the half tones. Her first piano teacher was her neighbor called Patotnikoff. Not long after that, her piano teacher was changed to Platon Brounoff, who was a Russian immigrant. Shortly after giving her first recital at the age of three and a half, she got scholarship at the age of four when she had the audition for the National Conservatory of Music (New York City). In the conservatory, she experienced with different teachers, including Misses Margulies and Okell. At the age of seven she began to study piano with the eminent Polish pianist and pedagogue Alexander Lambert, who taught at the New York College of Music. Lambert was not only her teacher but also her concert manager and mentor. Her practice regime, dictated by Lambert, was rigorous. So that he could make sure she kept to her schedule, Mana-Zucca lived with Lambert all the while that her career as a child prodigy flourished. The two remained very close friends throughout his lifetime. Lambert suggested that she take the stage name of Augusta, which she used for a while but did not like and later dropped in favor of Mana-Zucca, a rearrangement of her surname. At the same time that Mana-Zucca studied piano with Lambert, she also studied harmony and composition with Herman Spielter. Her first published work, Moment Musicale, for violin and piano, was composed when she was only seven years old. Her Etude de Concert was written when she was eight. Her first art song, Frage, was published by Rudolph Schirmer, as were Moment Triste and Moment Orientale, both composed when she was nine, followed by a large number of other works composed in her lifetime. At the age of eight, she performed as piano soloist in the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 1 with the New York Symphony Orchestra. In 1914 she made her stage debut with a soprano role in Franz Leh√°r's The Count of Luxembourg. She studied piano under Ferruccio Busoni, Leopold Godowsky and Alexander Lambert, and composition under Hermann Spielter. As Mana-Zucca approached her early teens, she sailed to Europe with her elder sister Beatrice, better known as Bess. They settled in Berlin, Germany, and she soon became part of that city's busy and exciting cultural milieu. Mana-Zucca's debut in Berlin, at the Bechstein Saal, was highly acclaimed and opened doors for other engagements throughout Europe. Given the opportunity to play with famous Spanish violinist Juan Man√©n, she performed with him in several successful concerts before signing a contract to play sixty concerts with him over a three-year period; they appeared together throughout Germany and Russia. While in Berlin, Mana-Zucca studied the works of Brahms with the eminent pedagogue Josef Weiss, and later she was accepted for study in the master classes of the great Ferruccio Busoni, which she attended for eight months. She received private instruction from Leopold Godowsky and also attended master classes that he conducted for selected students. In addition, while in Berlin she studied voice with a Fra√ºlein van Gelder, and later, in London, she studied with Raimond von zur M√ºhlen, a famous singer of lieder and a much-sought-after voice teacher. Mana-Zucca and her sister stayed in London for several years after leaving Berlin. In England and later in the United States, she was accepted as a singer in several musical comedies, including 'The Count of Luxembourg, The Rose Maid' and 'The Geisha.' A new phase in Mana-Zucca's life began when she accepted the marriage proposal of Irwin M. Cassel, a gentleman she had known since her youth. The couple eloped on 21 September 1921. Cassel promised his new wife that they would spend seven months of each year in New York City and the remaining five months in Miami, Florida, where he made his home. Cassel supported Mana- Zucca's musical career and even wrote the lyrics to the then-famous song \\"I Love Life\\" (1923), which was performed by celebrated singers such as John Charles Thomas and Lawrence Tibbett. Ultimately, and especially after the birth of her only child, a son, in 1926, Miami became her permanent residence. She spent many happy hours there composing and presenting musicales in her home, \\"Mazica Hall.\\" She was the teacher of pianist and pioneer Ruth W. Greenfield. She died in Miami. Mana-Zucca had three distinct but interconnected careers: as a concert pianist of great renown, as a singer who performed leading roles in musical comedy, and as a prolific composer. Her brochure of published music totals more than four hundred works. These include music for piano, orchestra, and voice. In addition, she also composed music for young students. The University of Miami awarded Mana-Zucca an honorary Doctor of Music on May 19, 1974.UM Historical Photographs, merrick.library.miami.edu Mana-Zucca died in Miami on March 8, 1981. Her papers including copies of her compositions are housed at Florida International University. Works Mana-Zucca composed over 1,000 works, including two operas (Hypatia and Queue of Ki-Lu), orchestral works, a ballet, three choral works, more than 20 chamber works and solo works, including the piano concerto Op. 49, a collection of 366 piano pieces called ‚ÄúMy Musical Calendar‚Äù and the violin concerto Op. 224 for the American violinist Joan Field. Her compositions are best known through popular songs, including \\"There's Joy in My Heart\\", \\"Big Brown Bear\\", \\"Honey Lamb\\", \\"I Love Life\\"Published The John Church Company, copyright 1923 and \\"Time and Time Again\\", with the lyrics by her husband Irwin M.

His photography has been compared with Harry Callahan, Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, and the French photographer Eug√®ne Atget. He traveled extensively during his long life and had important friendships with artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe, Ansel Adams and Harry Callahan. He photographed famous people including Dorothea Lange. His life was like his photos in the sense of being seemingly simple, straightforward, but revealing complexity and depth upon a closer examination. Capturing history, his pictures often transcend the boundary between photography and artistic expression. Early life Webb was born in Detroit in 1905 and grew up there and in a Quaker community in Ontario. From 1924-1929 he worked as a bank teller and clerk at a brokerage firm in Detroit; in another account, he was a successful stockbroker during the 1920s but lost his earnings during the Crash before the Depression. During the Depression beginning in 1929, he moved to California and worked as a prospector and earned a meager living. During these years he also worked as a fire ranger for the United States Forestry Service. Webb reportedly wrote short stories which were unpublished. After 1934, Webb returned to Detroit and worked for the automobile manufacturer Chrysler in their export division. In 1937, he visited a friend in Panama in search of gold, but had little success. But in Panama, he brought along a camera donated by his former employer, Chrysler. Career =Early career= Webb returned to Detroit and studied at the Detroit Camera Club. He met photographer Harry Callahan. In 1940, he completed a ten‚Äëday workshop with Ansel Adams as his teacher. In 1941, he visited Rocky Mountain State Park with Harry Callahan, and realized during this trip that he was drawn more to the urban cityscape, and although he found Adams to be an inspiration, he would not make photographs like his teacher. During World War II, Webb was a photographer for the United States Navy and was deployed to the South Pacific theater of operations. =New York City years= After World War II, in 1945, Webb moved to New York City and began his career as a professional photographer. He made key friendships with Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe as well as Beaumont Newhall, Berenice Abbott, Helen Levitt, and Minor White. Webb began a remarkable project of walking the streets of New York City with his heavy camera and tripod and photographing people and buildings he encountered. What set these photos apart was their \\"straightforward, descriptive clarity\\" even though they were often of familiar views. One large 10-foot-long panorama photograph which was critically acclaimed showed a section of Sixth Avenue from 43rd-44th streets which, in 1991, was seen as a \\"visual time capsule of the city\\" and was described as a \\"stunner.\\" Webb's photos reflected the photographer's sense of discovery and captured the times, such as photos of hand-painted banners over apartment house doors saying \\"Welcome Home, G.I.s\\". In one photograph, Webb went to the top of the RCA Building and shot south using a backlit technique, which captured the Empire State Building at night. The best photographs, according to New York Times art critic Charles Hagen, contained the \\"simple geometries of urban architecture\\" in a \\"simple elegance\\"; Hagen thought Webb's New York City photographs were his best. In 1946, he had his first solo exhibition of his photographs at the Museum of the City of New York. In 1947, Webb was hired by Fortune magazine and he worked with professional photographers funded by the Standard Oil Company led by Roy Stryker and the group included notable photographers such as Sol Libsohn. According to the New York Times, the team of professional photographers was \\"given amazingly free rein by its corporate sponsor\\" to produce a documentary about oil. One of these photographs, Webb's Pittsburgh Panorama (ca. 1950) shows a grim industrial view towards Pittsburgh from a hill near Westinghouse Bridge that takes in a bare river valley across which snake highways and railways and a row of tall smokestacks in the distance. Curator Edward Steichen selected it for the 1955 Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man, seen by 9 million visitors on its world tour. However, in his memoir, Webb records his disappointment with the way images were \\"over-enlarged to billboard size\\" losing \\"all the qualities that make photographs unique.\\" Webb traveled to Paris in 1949 and married fellow American Lucille Minqueau. In Paris, Webb produced a \\"vivid record\\" of the city which earned him recognition. Then, Webbs moved back to New York City to live in Greenwich Village in 1952. In 1955, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to photographically record pioneer trails of early settlers of the western United States. He was hired in 1957 by the United Nations to photograph its General Assembly. He won a contract to photograph Sub-Saharan Africa in 1958. =O'Keeffe years= The Webbs moved to Santa Fe in New Mexico around 1961. Webb's photos of his friend Georgia O'Keeffe suggested not only a \\"loner, severe figure and self-made person\\" but that there was an \\"intense connection\\" between Webb and O'Keeffe. While O'Keeffe was known to have a \\"prickly personality\\", Webb's photographs portray her with a kind of \\"quietness and calm\\" suggesting a relaxed friendship, and revealing new contours of O'Keeffe's character. Webb's landscape photographs as well as photos of the artist walking among the sagebrush bring O'Keeffe to life \\"even in pictures where she doesn't appear\\", according to Chicago Tribune art critic Abigail Foerstner. His photos suggest an \\"ageless spirit\\" which was \\"weathered and indomitable\\" like desert rock formations. These photos were done using matte finish paper and appear in a book entitled Georgia O'Keeffe: The Artist's Landscape. =Later years= The Webbs lived in the Provence region of France, around 1970, and he continued to photograph regularly, and later lived, for a period, in Bath, England. The Webbs finally settled in the state of Maine, living in the city of Portland, based on the suggestion of a friend. In 1978, Webb won a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and continued to live and work in Maine. Webb died in 2000 in Lewiston, Maine. =Legacy= Todd Webb's photographs have been displayed in 25 major museum collections including the MOMA in New York, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Webb's photographic archive is located in Portland, Maine, where reproduction rights and sales of his prints are managed. In 2006, the Hallmark Greeting Cards Corporation acquired at least 161 of Webb's photographs, and in 2006 decided to give them away in a generous donation to the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City. In 2017, the Todd Webb Archive refurbished its website with biographical data, collection information, and a column regarding news events. In April 2017, an exhibition titled \\"A City Seen\\" opened at the Museum of the City of New York. Curated by Sean Corcoran, the exhibit was a comprehensive survey of Webb's work in New York during the 1940s. In conjunction with the show, the book I See a City: Todd Webb's New York, Thames & Hudson, 2017 His estate is managed by Betsy Evans Hunt who serves as the Executive Director of the Todd Webb Archive.

The Admiralty renamed her HMS Falcon after purchasing her in 1801 to avoid confusion with the pre-existing third rate . Falcon served in the north Atlantic and the Channel, and then in Danish waters during the Gunboat War. She was sold in 1816. Her new owner renamed her Duke of Wellington and sailed her to the Indies under a license from the British East India Company. She was wrecked in 1820 at Batavia. HMS =1801 to 1806= Commander James Nash commissioned Falcon in February 1801. His replacement, in 1802, was Commander Henry M. Ommaney, who sailed her to Newfoundland. Near Newfoundland, Falcon captured two prizes ‚Äì Caroline on 17 July 1803, and on 28 July the apparently British-built Mercure. Commander George Sanders took over command in Newfoundland February 1804. Early in 1804 Falcon was refitting in Plymouth, before going on to serve in the Channel, where she engaged shore batteries at Le Havre. Falcon was also awarded prize money for the recapture, on 3 November, of the sloop John and Thomas. Falcon then operated in the North Sea. On 10 June 1805, Falcon, with Chiffone, Clinker, and Frances chased a French convoy for nine hours until the convoy took shelter under the guns of F√©camp. The convoy consisted of two corvettes (Foudre under capitaine de vaisseau Jacques-Felix-Emmanuel Hemelin, and Audacieuse, under Lieutenant Dominique Roquebert), four large gunvessels and eight others, and 14 transports. The British suffered some casualties from gunfire from shore batteries, with Falcon suffering four men wounded and some damage to her rigging.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.307-8. In company with Chiffone, , and the hired armed cutter Frances, Falcon was involved in the capture of Zeeluft on 20 June 1805, and also shared in prize money from the cargoes of another two vessels captured that year. =1807: Danzig and Copenhagen= At the ultimately unsuccessful British defence of Danzig in April 1807, Falcon was involved in bringing reinforcements and the Russian General Nikolay Kamensky to the area. Volunteers from Falcon went on board the hired armed ship Sally, which then entered the relatively shallow waters at the mouth of the Vistula to take the battle to the French. On 28 August 1807, in company with the sloop , Falcon captured the Danish ship Martha for which prize money was awarded nearly four years later. On 7 September, Falcon was one of the 126 ships officially listed as being at the surrender at Copenhagen. She later shared in the prize money allotted for the capture of the Danish fleet.Falcons captain, George Sanders, went on to command the following year. =1808: Zealand Point, Endelave and Tun√∏= Commander George A. Creyke took command in 1808. On 22 March 1808 Falcon was among the smaller British warships at the battle of Zealand Point. She watched from a safe distance and recorded the course of the battle in her logbook.Logbook of HMS Falcon held at National Archives, Kew, London ‚Äì reference ADM51/4446 In late April, under orders from Captain Donald Campbell of the third rate , Lieutenant John Price, acting captain of Falcon, took her northward to the west of Sams√∏ to search for enemy boats capable of carrying troops from mainland Jutland to Zealand or Sk√•ne. Falcon destroyed eight \\"pretty large boats .. with troops nearby\\" on the island of Endelave, six boats on Tun√∏ on 29 April, and 13 others in the waters between Sams√∏ and Aarhus, all before 15 May.Danish sources describe in considerable detail Falcons general activities during May and June. On Tun√∏ Lieutenant Price required the islanders to allow the sloop to replenish her water supplies and to sell her livestock as provisions. On Endelave in June, no payments were made for any of the livestock taken because of a token resistance put up by the islanders. The Danes were fortifying the harbour complex to the east of Sams√∏, with its outlying islands of Kyholm and Lindholm. During the night of 7 May, Falcon sent in a cutting-out party in her boats. The British captured two boats each loaded with thirteen-inch mortars and associated equipment, including 400 mortar shells. Lieutenant Price recorded that one of these boats ran aground and had to be burned; he destroyed the other boat after removing the mortar. On 3 June Falcon sent in her boats to make a further raid on Endelave.Logbook of HMS Falcon held at National Archives, Kew, London ‚Äì reference ADM51/4446Hahnemann =Disposal= In 1810 Falcon was at Sheerness, where she was fitted as a military depot and hospital ship. From 1812 on Falcon was in ordinary. On 14 May 1816 the Navy Office invited tenders for the purchase of numerous ships, including \\"lying at Sheerness,... Falcon sloop, of 368 tons\\". She was sold there, for ¬£800, on 31 July. Duke of Wellington Short & Co. purchased Diadem in 1816 and renamed her Duke of Wellington. She appears in Lloyd's Register (LR)) at London with Woodcock, master, and Short, owner. Her place of launch is \\"River\\", i.e., the Thames, and her year of launch is 1798.LR (1816), Seq.‚ÑñD469. She appears in Lloyd's Register of 1818 among the vessels that the British East India Company had licensed to trade with the Indies. The list shows her with Howard, master, and having sailed for Bombay on 17 November 1817.Lloyd's Register (1818). Both Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping (RS) show her master as J. Howard, but LR shows her trade as London‚ÄîRio de Janeiro, while the Register shows it as London‚ÄîBotany Bay.LR (1818), Seq. ‚ÑñD447.RS (1818), Seq. ‚ÑñD470. This discrepancy continues in the 1819, 1820, and 1821 volumes of both publications. Duke of Wellington is no longer listed in the 1822 volume of Lloyd's; she does not leave the Register until the 1824 volume. Fate Lloyd's List reported on 11 August 1820 that Duke of Wellington, formerly Stout, master, had been driven ashore at Batavia by a gale in early February 1820, and that accounts from 31 March were that she was to be sold there.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5516. On 2 June 1820 Duke of Wellington was sold at a public auction for 8,000 rupees for breaking up. The proceeds of the auction were for the account of the European Orphan Chamber.

Based on Shakespeare's influence, in English- speaking cultures she is often named Titania or Mab. Folklore In Irish folklore, the last High Queen of the Daoine Sidhe - and wife of the High King Finvarra - was named Una (or Oonagh, or Oona, or Uonaidh etc.). In the ballad tradition of Northern England and Lowland Scotland, she was called the Queen of Elphame. The character is also associated with the name Morgan (as with the Arthurian character of Morgan le Fey, or Morgan of the Fairies), or a variant of Mab (such as Maeve or Mabd). In the Child Ballads Tam Lin (Child 39) and Thomas the Rhymer (Child 37), she is represented as both beautiful and seductive, and also as terrible and deadly. The Fairy Queen is said to pay a tithe to Hell every seven years, and her mortal lovers often provide this sacrifice. In Tam Lin, the title character tells his mortal lover: :At the end of seven years She pays a tithe to Hell I so fair and full of flesh I fear it be myself Literature and media Both Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare used folklore concerning the Fairy Queen to create characters and poetry, Spenser in The Faerie Queene and Shakespeare most notably in A Midsummer Night's Dream. In The Faerie Queene, Spenser's fairy queen is named Gloriana, and is also referred to as Tanaquill, which \\"appears to be an epithet for Gloriana, Queen of Faeries\\" derived from the name of the wife of Tarquinius Priscus.Andrew Zurcher, Edmund Spenser's the Faerie Queene: A Reading Guide, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 2011, p.18. She is the daughter of Oberon, who in Shakespeare's later play is married to Titania, a name derived from Ovid as an epithet of the Roman goddess Diana. Diana was regularly portrayed as the ruler of the fairy kingdom in demonological literature, such as King James VI of Scotland's Daemonologie, which says that she belongs to \\"the fourth kind of spirits, which by the Gentiles [non-Jews] was called Diana and her wandering court, and amongst us is called Fairy (as I told you) or our good neighbours\\".Purkis, Diane, \\"losing Babies, Losing Stories\\" in Culture and Change: Attending to Early Modern Women, University of Delaware Press, 2003, p.147. In one of the earliest of the Peter Pan novels, The Little White Bird, author J. M. Barrie also identifies Queen Mab as the name of the fairy queen, although the character is entirely benign and helpful. In Disney's series of films based on Tinker Bell, a fairy character originating in Barrie's novels, the fairies are shown to be ruled by a Queen Clarion. In Brandon Mull's Fablehaven series, the Fairy Queen is an essential part of the plot making key characters extremely powerful. The character Erza Scarlet from Hiro Mashima's Fairy Tail rightfully earned the alias \\"Titania\\" due to her overwhelming power being well known throughout the series' fictional land of Fiore. In Foxglove Summer, part of the Rivers of London series, the protagonist Peter Grant is captured by the Fairy Queen and taken off to her Kingdom (an alternative reality or Otherworld where Britain is still covered with a massive unbroken primeval forest, with no sign of the familiar towns and villages), and is saved with difficulty by his girlfriend who is a River Goddess. Neopaganism The concept of a Dianic queen of spirits influenced the neopagan cultures developed from Charles Godfrey Leland's concept of Aradia \\"Queen of the Witches\\". The Faerie faith developed from the same source as the McFarland Dianic tradition.

This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks. Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish‚Äîusually via a Kanban board. Work is pulled as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested. In knowledge work and in software development, the aim is to provide a visual process management system which aids decision-making about what, when, and how much to produce. The underlying Kanban method originated in lean manufacturing, which was inspired by the Toyota Production System. Kanban is commonly used in software development in combination with other methods and frameworks such as Scrum.  Evolution and documentation of method  David Anderson's 2010 book, Kanban, describes an evolution of the approach from a 2004 project at Microsoft using a theory-of- constraints approach and incorporating a drum-buffer-rope (comparable to the kanban pull system), to a 2006‚Äì2007 project at Corbis in which the kanban method was identified. In 2009, Don Reinertsen published a book on second- generation lean product-development which describes the adoption of the kanban system and the use of data collection and an economic model for management decision-making. Another early contribution came from Corey Ladas, whose 2008 book Scrumban suggested that kanban could improve Scrum for software development. Ladas saw Scrumban as the transition from Scrum to Kanban. Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry published Personal Kanban, applying Kanban to individuals and small teams, in 2011. In Kanban from the Inside (2014), Mike Burrows explained kanban's principles, practices and underlying values and related them to earlier theories and models. In Agile Project Management with Kanban (2015), Eric Brechner provides an overview of Kanban in practice at Microsoft and Xbox. Kanban Change Leadership (2015), by Klaus Leopold and Siegfried Kaltenecker, explained the method from the perspective of change management and provided guidance to change-initiatives. In 2016 Lean Kanban University Press published a condensed guide to the method, incorporating improvements and extensions from the early kanban projects.  Kanban boards  upright=2.2 The diagram here shows a software development workflow on a Kanban board. Kanban boards, designed for the context in which they are used, vary considerably and may show work item types (\\"features\\" and \\"user stories\\" here), columns delineating workflow activities, explicit policies, and swimlanes (rows crossing several columns, used for grouping user stories by feature here). The aim is to make the general workflow and the progress of individual items clear to participants and stakeholders. As described in books on Kanban for software development, the two primary practices of Kanban are to visualize your work and limit work in progress (WIP). Four additional general practices of Kanban listed in Essential Kanban Condensed, are to make policies explicit, manage flow, implement feedback loops, and improve collaboratively. The Kanban board in the diagram above highlights the first three general practices of Kanban. * It visualizes the work of the development team (the features and user stories). * It captures WIP limits for development steps: the circled values below the column headings that limit the number of work items under that step. * It documents policies, also known as done rules, inside blue rectangles under some of the development steps. * It also shows some Kanban flow management for the \\"User Story Preparation,\\" \\"User Story Development,\\" and \\"Feature Acceptance\\" steps, which have \\"In Progress\\" and \\"Ready\\" sub-columns. Each step's WIP limit applies to both sub-columns, preventing work items from overwhelming the flow into or out of those steps.  Managing workflow  Kanban manages workflow directly on the Kanban board. The WIP limits for development steps provide development teams immediate feedback on common workflow issues. For example, on the Kanban board shown above, the \\"Deployment\\" step has a WIP limit of five (5) and there are currently five epics shown in that step. No more work items can move into deployment until one or more epics complete that step (moving to \\"Delivered\\"). This prevents the \\"Deployment\\" step from being overwhelmed. Team members working on \\"Feature Acceptance\\" (the previous step) might get stuck because they can't deploy new epics. They can see why immediately on the board and help with the current epic deployments. Once the five epics in the \\"Deployment\\" step are delivered, the two epics from the \\"Ready\\" sub-column of \\"Feature Acceptance\\" (the previous step) can be moved to the \\"Deployment\\" column. When those two epics are delivered, no other epics can be deployed (assuming no new epics are ready). Now, team members working on deployment are stuck. They can see why immediately and help with feature acceptance. This workflow control works similarly for every step. Problems are visual and evident immediately, and re-planning can be done continuously. The work management is made possible by limiting work in progress in a way team members can see and track at all times.

The 1791 version, produced at the year's end, was the novel's earliest print edition. A revised edition, differing in minor details, was published less than eighty days after the first print edition in early 1792. Both editions were edited by Cheng Weiyuan (Á®ã‰ºüÂÖÉ) and Gao E and were published by Suzhou's Cuiwen Book House (ËêÉÊñá‰π¶Â±ã). The Cheng-Gao versions mark a departure from earlier scribal copies of Dream of the Red Chamber. Cheng and Gao removed commentaries made by Zhiyanzhai, added illustrations, and changed the title (previously known as The Story of the Stone Áü≥Â§¥ËÆ∞). They made extensive edits as well as added a 40-chapter continuation to the novel, now known as the Cheng-Gao continuation, which they claimed to be authorial. This 40-chapter ending is now the continuation read by most readers. Hu Shih in the 1920s referred to the 1791 version as the Chengjia edition (Á®ãÁî≤Êú¨, \\"Cheng-A book\\") and the 1792 version as the Chengyi edition (Á®ã‰πôÊú¨, \\"Cheng-B book\\"). These remain the names they are known in the field of Redology. From the mid-20th century until the 1980s the Chengyi edition was the most read, studied and reprinted Dream version in Taiwan owing to Hu Shih's influence. In China, the People's Literature Publishing House (‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊñáÂ≠¶Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ) published an annotated 1982 edition based on the Rouge versions, effectively ending the era where the Cheng-Gao versions were used extensively. The 1982 People's Literature Publishing House edition was edited by a team of scholars from the \\"Red Chamber Dream Academy\\" (Á∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ), which included influential Redologist Feng Qiyong (ÂÜØÂÖ∂Â∫∏). This 1982 edition was subsequently revised in 2008 and 2015. Original Cheng-Gao editions are now very rare and are highly prized collector's items ‚Äì less than twenty copies are believed to be extant. The 1791 prefaces Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E wrote prefaces for the 1791 Chengjia edition (Á®ãÁî≤Êú¨) in Classical Chinese. Both prefaces were short and owing to the brevity of Classical Chinese, are reproduced here in full: =Cheng's preface= Cheng Weiyuan's 1791 preface was as follows: :„ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶„ÄãÂ∞èËØ¥Êú¨Âêç„ÄäÁü≥Â§¥ËÆ∞„ÄãÔºå‰ΩúËÄÖÁõ∏‰º†‰∏ç‰∏ÄÔºåÁ©∂Êú™Áü•Âá∫Ëá™‰Ωï‰∫∫ÔºåÊÉü‰π¶ÂÜÖËÆ∞Èõ™ËäπÊõπÂÖàÁîüÂà†ÊîπÊï∞Ëøá„ÄÇÂ•Ω‰∫ãËÄÖÊØè‰º†ÊäÑ‰∏ÄÈÉ®ÔºåÁΩÆÂ∫ôÂ∏Ç‰∏≠ÔºåÊòÇÂÖ∂ÂÄºÂæóÊï∞ÂçÅÈáëÔºåÂèØË∞ì‰∏çËÉ´ËÄåËµ∞ËÄÖÁü£„ÄÇÁÑ∂ÂéüÁõÆ‰∏ÄÁôæÂªøÂç∑Ôºå‰ªäÊâÄ‰º†Âè™ÂÖ´ÂçÅÂç∑ÔºåÊÆäÈùûÂÖ®Êú¨„ÄÇÂç≥Èó¥Áß∞ÊúâÂÖ®ÈÉ®ËÄÖÔºåÂèäÊ£ÄÈòÖ‰ªçÂè™ÂÖ´ÂçÅÂç∑ÔºåËØªËÄÖÈ¢á‰ª•‰∏∫ÊÜæ„ÄÇ‰∏ç‰Ωû‰ª•ÊòØ‰π¶Êó¢ÊúâÁôæÂªøÂç∑‰πãÁõÆÔºåÂ≤ÇÊó†ÂÖ®ÁíßÔºüÁà∞‰∏∫Á´≠ÂäõÊî∂ÁΩóÔºåËá™Ëóè‰π¶ÂÆ∂ÁîöËá≥ÊïÖÁ∫∏Â†Ü‰∏≠Êó†‰∏çÁïôÂøÉÔºåÊï∞Âπ¥‰ª•Êù•Ôºå‰ªÖÁßØÊúâÂªø‰ΩôÂç∑„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÊó•ÂÅ∂‰∫éÈºìÊãÖ‰∏äÂæóÂçÅ‰ΩôÂç∑ÔºåÈÅÇÈáç‰ª∑Ë¥≠‰πãÔºåÊ¨£ÁÑ∂ÁøªÈòÖÔºåËßÅÂÖ∂ÂâçÂêéËµ∑‰ºèÔºåÂ∞öÂ±ûÊé•Á¨ãÔºåÁÑ∂Êº∂Êº´‰∏çÂèØÊî∂Êãæ„ÄÇ‰πÉÂêåÂèã‰∫∫ÁªÜÂä†ÂéòÂâîÔºåÊà™ÈïøË°•Áü≠ÔºåÊäÑÊàêÂÖ®ÈÉ®ÔºåÂ§ç‰∏∫ÈïåÊùøÔºå‰ª•ÂÖ¨ÂêåÂ•ΩÔºå„ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶„ÄãÂÖ®‰π¶Á§∫Ëá™ÊòØÂëäÊàêÁü£„ÄÇ‰π¶ÊàêÔºåÂõ†Âπ∂ÂøóÂÖ∂ÁºòËµ∑Ôºå‰ª•ÂëäÊµ∑ÂÜÖÂêõÂ≠ê„ÄÇÂá°ÊàëÂêå‰∫∫ÔºåÊàñ‰∫¶ÂÖàÁùπ‰∏∫Âø´ËÄÖÊ¨§Ôºü ‚ÄîÂ∞èÊ≥âÁ®ã‰ºüÂÖÉËØÜ„ÄÇ (Simplified Chinese) :„ÄäÁ¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢„ÄãÂ∞èË™™Êú¨Âêç„ÄäÁü≥È†≠Ë®ò„ÄãÔºå‰ΩúËÄÖÁõ∏ÂÇ≥‰∏ç‰∏ÄÔºåÁ©∂Êú™Áü•Âá∫Ëá™‰Ωï‰∫∫ÔºåÊÉüÊõ∏ÂÖßË®òÈõ™ËäπÊõπÂÖàÁîüÂà™ÊîπÊï∏ÈÅé„ÄÇÂ•Ω‰∫ãËÄÖÊØèÂÇ≥ÊäÑ‰∏ÄÈÉ®ÔºåÁΩÆÂªüÂ∏Ç‰∏≠ÔºåÊòÇÂÖ∂ÂÄºÔºåÂæóÊï∏ÂçÅÈáëÔºåÂèØË¨Ç‰∏çËÑõËÄåËµ∞ËÄÖÁü£„ÄÇÁÑ∂ÂéüÁõÆ‰∏ÄÁôæÂªøÂç∑Ôºå‰ªäÊâÄÂÇ≥Âè™ÂÖ´ÂçÅÂç∑ÔºåÊÆäÈùûÂÖ®Êú¨„ÄÇÂç≥ÈñìÁ®±ÊúâÂÖ®ÈÉ®ËÄÖÔºåÂèäÊ™¢Èñ±Ôºå‰ªçÂè™ÂÖ´ÂçÅÂç∑ÔºåËÆÄËÄÖÈ†ó‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÊÜæ„ÄÇ‰∏ç‰Ωû‰ª•ÊòØÊõ∏Êó¢ÊúâÁôæÂªøÂç∑‰πãÁõÆÔºåË±àÁÑ°ÂÖ®ÁíßÔºüÁà∞ÁÇ∫Á´≠ÂäõÊî∂ÁæÖÔºåËá™ËóèÊõ∏ÂÆ∂ÁîöËá≥ÊïÖÁ¥ôÂ†Ü‰∏≠ÁÑ°‰∏çÁïôÂøÉÔºåÊï∏Âπ¥‰ª•‰æÜÔºåÂÉÖÁ©çÊúâÂªø‰ΩôÂç∑„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÊó•ÂÅ∂ÊñºÈºìÊìî‰∏äÂæóÂçÅÈ§òÂç∑ÔºåÈÅÇÈáçÂÉπË≥º‰πãÔºåÊ¨£ÁÑ∂ÁπôÈñ±ÔºåË¶ãÂÖ∂ÂâçÂæåËµ∑‰ºèÔºåÂ∞öÂ±¨Êé•Á≠çÔºåÁÑ∂Êº∂Êº´‰∏çÂèØÊî∂Êãæ„ÄÇ‰πÉÂêåÂèã‰∫∫Á¥∞Âä†ÂéòÂâîÔºåÊà™Èï∑Ë£úÁü≠ÔºåÊäÑÊàêÂÖ®ÈÉ®ÔºåÂæ©ÁÇ∫Èê´ÊùøÔºå‰ª•ÂÖ¨ÂêåÂ•ΩÔºå„ÄäÁ¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢„ÄãÂÖ®Êõ∏ÂßãËá™ÊòØÂëäÊàêÁü£„ÄÇÊõ∏ÊàêÔºåÂõ†‰∏¶ÂøóÂÖ∂Á∑£Ëµ∑Ôºå‰ª•ÂëäÊµ∑ÂÖßÂêõÂ≠ê„ÄÇÂá°ÊàëÂêå‰∫∫ÔºåÊàñ‰∫¶ÂÖàÁùπÁÇ∫Âø´ËÄÖÊ≠üÔºü‚ÄîÂ∞èÊ≥âÁ®ãÂÅâÂÖÉË≠ò„ÄÇ (Traditional Chinese) In his 1791 preface Cheng Weiyuan stated that the novel, which he renamed Dream of the Red Chamber, was originally entitled The Story of the Stone. It had been ascribed to \\"different people\\", the author being unknown, but a certain \\"Mr\\" Cao Xueqin (now believed to be the book's true author) edited and revised it several times as was stated in the novel proper. Such was the popularity of the book that contemporaneous temple market scribes could make copies and sell them for several taels of gold. But the book's incomplete, 80-chapter nature disappointed readers. Cheng searched extensively for the remaining chapters, from renowned book collector's libraries to spare paper piles, and in the process collected over \\"twenty more (i.e. new) chapters\\". Cheng then claimed, after several years, to have chanced on \\"ten more chapters\\" of the final version from a book vendor (ÈºìÊìî), and paid a hefty price for them. Being the working manuscript, however, it was unedited and in disarray. Cheng Weiyuan edited this version with a friend (Gao E), consulting existing versions, then printed the \\"complete\\" edition to satiate the appetites of fellow fans. Later Qing Dynasty editions reprinting the Cheng-Gao versions removed Cheng's preface and used Gao's preface solely.Zhou Ruchang Âë®Ê±ùÊòå in„ÄäÊ≠£ÂÆ∂ÂêçËß£Á∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶„ÄãÔºåÂåó‰∫¨Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2007, p. 307Ôºö‚ÄúËÄåÁ®çÂêéÁöÑÁâàÊú¨Á´üÂ∞ÜÁ®ãÂ∫èÂà†Âéª‚Äù =Gao E's preface= Gao E's 1791 preface was shorter: :‰∫àÈóª„ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶„ÄãËÑçÁÇô‰∫∫Âè£ËÄÖÔºåÂá†Âªø‰ΩôÂπ¥ÔºåÁÑ∂Êó†ÂÖ®ÁíßÔºåÊó†ÂÆöÊú¨„ÄÇÂêëÊõæ‰ªéÂèã‰∫∫ÂÄüËßÇÔºåÁ™É‰ª•ÊüìÊåáÂ∞ùÈºé‰∏∫ÊÜæ„ÄÇ‰ªäÂπ¥Êò•ÔºåÂèã‰∫∫Á®ãÂ≠êÂ∞èÊ≥âËøá‰∫àÔºå‰ª•ÂÖ∂ÊâÄË¥≠ÂÖ®‰π¶ËßÅÁ§∫Ôºå‰∏îÊõ∞Ôºö‚ÄúÊ≠§‰ªÜÊï∞Âπ¥ÈäñÁßØÂØ∏Á¥Ø‰πãËã¶ÂøÉÔºåÂ∞Ü‰ªòÂâûÂäÇÔºåÂÖ¨ÂêåÂ•Ω„ÄÇÂ≠êÈñíÊó¶ÊÜäÁü£ÔºåÁõçÂàÜ‰ªª‰πã?‚Äù‰∫à‰ª•ÊòØ‰π¶ËôΩÁ®óÂÆòÈáéÂè≤‰πãÊµÅÔºåÁÑ∂Â∞ö‰∏çË∞¨‰∫éÂêçÊïôÔºåÊ¨£ÁÑ∂ÊãúËØ∫ÔºåÊ≠£‰ª•Ê≥¢ÊñØÂ•¥ËßÅÂÆù‰∏∫Âπ∏ÔºåÈ¢òË•ÑÂÖ∂ÂΩπ„ÄÇÂ∑•Êó¢Á´£ÔºåÂπ∂ËØÜÁ´ØÊú´Ôºå‰ª•ÂëäÈòÖËÄÖ„ÄÇ‚ÄîÊó∂‰πæÈöÜËæõ‰∫•ÂÜ¨Ëá≥Âêé‰∫îÊó•ÈìÅÂ≤≠È´òÈπóÂèôÂπ∂‰π¶„ÄÇ(Simplified Chinese) :‰∫àËÅû„ÄäÁ¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢„ÄãËÜæÁÇô‰∫∫Âè£ËÄÖÔºåÂπæÂªøÈ§òÂπ¥ÔºåÁÑ∂ÁÑ°ÂÖ®ÁíßÔºåÁÑ°ÂÆöÊú¨„ÄÇÂêëÊõæÂæûÂèã‰∫∫ÂÄüËßÄÔºåÁ´ä‰ª•ÊüìÊåáÂòóÈºéÁÇ∫ÊÜæ„ÄÇ‰ªäÂπ¥Êò•ÔºåÂèã‰∫∫Á®ãÂ≠êÂ∞èÊ≥âÈÅé‰∫àÔºå‰ª•ÂÖ∂ÊâÄË≥ºÂÖ®Êõ∏Ë¶ãÁ§∫Ôºå‰∏îÊõ∞Ôºö‚ÄúÊ≠§ÂÉïÊï∏Âπ¥ÈäñÁ©çÂØ∏Á¥Ø‰πãËã¶ÂøÉÔºåÂ∞á‰ªòÂâûÂäÇÔºåÂÖ¨ÂêåÂ•Ω„ÄÇÂ≠êÈñíÊó¶ÊÜäÁü£ÔºåÁõçÂàÜ‰ªª‰πã?‚Äù‰∫à‰ª•ÊòØÊõ∏ÈõñÁ®óÂÆòÈáéÂè≤‰πãÊµÅÔºåÁÑ∂Â∞ö‰∏çË¨¨ÊñºÂêçÊïôÔºåÊ¨£ÁÑ∂ÊãúË´æÔºåÊ≠£‰ª•Ê≥¢ÊñØÂ•¥Ë¶ãÂØ∂ÁÇ∫Âπ∏ÔºåÈ°åË•ÑÂÖ∂ÂΩπ„ÄÇÂ∑•Êó¢Á´£Ôºå‰∏¶Ë≠òÁ´ØÊú´Ôºå‰ª•ÂëäÈñ±ËÄÖ„ÄÇ‚ÄîÊôÇ‰πæÈöÜËæõ‰∫•ÂÜ¨Ëá≥Âæå‰∫îÊó•ÈêµÂ∂∫È´òÈ∂öÊïò‰∏¶Êõ∏„ÄÇ(Traditional Chinese) Gao's preface was penned in 1791 winter, five days after the winter solstice, in Tieling. He revealed the overwhelming popularity of the novel, although there was no final version after \\"over twenty years\\". He first read the book at a friend's place since he could not have a share of it (i.e. could not afford its purchase). In spring 1791 Cheng Weiyuan approached Gao to co- edit a \\"complete\\" version; Cheng mentioned that he himself was then quite idle but the editing task seemed to him arduous. Gao said that although the novel concerned \\"unofficial stray anecdotes\\" (Á®óÂÆòÈáéÂè≤) of the past, it did not slander the \\"orthodox\\" Confucian classics, and hence he gladly assisted in its editing.

The gist of this lengthy foreword is that both editors, Cheng and Gao, felt the 1791 edition was marred by misprints and sloppy edits. They took more time this time round to collate and compare further versions in order to refine the present 1792 edition. The two friends discovered another manuscript of the last 40 chapters (ÂñÑÊú¨) and based this 1792 edition on this superior manuscript. They apologized for not providing annotations, owing to the massive work involved, and also stated that Cheng-Gao editions had to be somewhat expensive in order to offset printing costs. They also apologized that their 1791 prefaces were written not to steal the author's thunder, but because they were so elated upon discovering the original manuscript that they indiscreetly disclosed their full names (the 1792 edition was signed using their style names Ëôü, which were pseudonyms). Authorship In 1921, Hu Shih published one of the most influential Redology essays in the modern era, Proofs on A Dream of the Red Chamber (Á∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶ËÄÉËØÅ). In it Hu Shih proposed the hypothesis that the last forty chapters were not written by Cao Xueqin but were completed by Gao E. Hu Shih based his hypothesis on four pieces of evidence ‚Äì though three of them were circumstantial and Hu Shih was himself uncertain of his second proof. He went on to accuse Cheng and Gao of being dishonest in their 1791 prefaces, stating direct evidence from a contemporary, Zhang Wentao (Âº†ÈóÆÈô∂), that Gao was the author of the continuation. The conclusion, in Hu Shih's own words, was irrefutable (Ëá™Êó†ÂèØÁñë)ËÉ°ÈÄÇÔºå„ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶ËÄÉËØÅ„Äã, 1921:‚ÄúÂêéÂõõÂçÅÂõûÊòØÈ´òÈπóË°•ÁöÑÔºåËøôËØùËá™Êó†ÂèØÁñë„ÄÇÊàë‰ª¨ÂèØÁ∫¶‰∏æÂá†Â±ÇËØÅÊçÆÂ¶Ç‰∏ãÔºöÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÔºåÂº†ÈóÆÈô∂ÁöÑËØóÂèäÊ≥®ÔºåÊ≠§‰∏∫ÊúÄÊòéÁôΩÁöÑËØÅÊçÆ„ÄÇÁ¨¨‰∫åÔºå‰øûÊ®æ‰∏æÁöÑ‚Äú‰π°‰ºöËØïÂ¢û‰∫îË®ÄÂÖ´ÈüµËØóÂßã‰πæÈöÜÊúùÔºåËÄå‰π¶‰∏≠ÂèôÁßëÂú∫‰∫ãÂ∑≤ÊúâËØó‚Äù‰∏ÄÈ°πÔºõËøô‰∏ÄÈ°π‰∏çÂçÅÂàÜÂèØÈù†ÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫‰π°‰ºöËØïÁî®‰∫îË®ÄÂæãËØóÔºåËµ∑‰∫é‰πæÈöÜ‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏Ä‰∫åÂπ¥Ôºå‰πüËÆ∏ÈÇ£Êó∂„ÄàÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶„ÄâÂâçÂÖ´ÂçÅÂõûËøòÊ≤°ÊúâÂÅöÊàêÂë¢„ÄÇÁ¨¨‰∏âÔºåÁ®ãÂ∫èËØ¥ÂÖàÂæó‰∫åÂçÅ‰ΩôÂç∑ÔºåÂêéÂèàÂú®ÈºìÊãÖ‰∏äÂæóÂçÅ‰ΩôÂç∑„ÄÇÊ≠§ËØù‰æøÊòØ‰Ωú‰º™ÁöÑÈìÅËØÅÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫‰∏ñÈó¥Ê≤°ÊúâËøôÊ†∑Â•áÂ∑ßÁöÑ‰∫ãÔºÅÁ¨¨ÂõõÔºåÈ´òÈπóËá™Â∑±ÁöÑÂ∫èÔºåËØ¥ÂæóÂæàÂê´Á≥äÔºåÂ≠óÈáåË°åÈó¥ÈÉΩ‰Ωø‰∫∫ÁîüÁñë„ÄÇÂ§ßÊ¶Ç‰ªñ‰∏çÊÑøÂÆåÂÖ®ÂüãÊ≤°‰ªñË°•‰ΩúÁöÑËã¶ÂøÉÔºåÊïÖÂºïË®ÄÁ¨¨ÂÖ≠Êù°ËØ¥Ôºö‚ÄúÊòØ‰π¶ÂºÄÂç∑Áï•ÂøóÊï∞ËØ≠ÔºåÈùû‰∫ëÂºÅÈ¶ñÔºåÂÆûÂõ†ÊÆãÁº∫ÊúâÂπ¥Ôºå‰∏ÄÊó¶È¢†Êú´ÊØï‰ø±ÔºåÂ§ßÂø´‰∫∫ÂøÉÔºõÊ¨£ÁÑ∂ÂëΩÈ¢òÔºåËÅä‰ª•ËÆ∞Êàê‰π¶‰πãÂπ∏„ÄÇ‚ÄùÂõ†‰∏∫È´òÈπó‰∏çËÆ≥‰ªñË°•‰ΩúÁöÑ‰π¶ÔºåÊïÖÂº†ËàπÂ±±Ëµ†ËØóÁõ¥ËØ¥‰ªñË°•‰ΩúÂêéÂõõÂçÅÂõûÁöÑ‰∫ã„ÄÇ‚Äù His stand was supported by Zhou Ruchang and Liu Xinwu. Another Redologist, Yu Pingbo, originally supported this proposition, but later retracted it. Modern Redologists continue to be skeptical about the authenticity of the Cheng-Gao ending, partly owing to stylistic differences, and also because the many foreshadowings in the earlier 80 chapters are not precisely fulfilled in the subsequent chapters.

Located in Jacksonville's Ortega neighborhood, it was founded in 1923. Its golf course was originally designed by legend Donald Ross, and members have included PGA Tour professionals Steve Melnyk and David Duval. It has hosted various golf tournaments since its opening, including the 2002 United States Senior Men's Amateur Golf Championship. History =Beginnings= On May 25, 1921, a group of 50 prominent gentlemen met at the Seminole Social Club in downtown Jacksonville to consider the organization of a new club to provide a superior golf facility. They adopted the name \\"Timuquana,\\" a variation of the name of the Timucua, a Native American people who once lived along the St. Johns River. Their charter was approved on February 12, 1923 and within three months, membership had grown to 185. Timuquana Country Club's first president was John L. Roe. Donald Ross, the most noted golf course architect in the United States, was engaged to design and build the course in 1923. After playing the new course, two club members suggested that additional sand traps on the fairways would enliven play, and donated them. Vic Foreman was the club's golf pro for 43 years, from 1925-1968. Several professional tournaments were played at Timuquana soon after the course was built, attracting the best golfers of the era, and exhibition matches featured Johnny Farrell, Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen and Horton Smith. The course hosted the Southern Amateur championship several times, and the 1928 Florida State Amateur Tournament was won by club president Al Ulmer at Timuquana. The years during the Great Depression in the United States were difficult for the club. Membership fell to 51, and the club could not afford a manager. The club reorganized their financial affairs in 1936, cutting costs to a bare minimum, and survived. Bobby Jones was stationed at Naval Air Station Jacksonville during World War II and often played golf at neighboring Timuquana.\\"Private Course: Timuquana Country Club\\" Links magazine Robert Trent Jones, another well-known golf course designer, worked with club members in 1948 to develop a ten-year blueprint for improving the course. Many of the suggestions were implemented during the 1950s, including adding a lake on the 5th, which the tee shot must traverse. This became the course's signature hole.\\"Timuquana Country Club\\" Golf magazine, Course profiles Sectional qualifying rounds were held at Timuquana for several USGA Senior Amateur Championships, and the US Amateur Championships in 1955, 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1976. George Cobb tweaked the course design in 1957 and 1963, as did David W. Gordon in 1968, who added a lake to the 6th hole. In the seventy years since Donald Ross built the course, the changes introduced by other architects to \\"freshen\\" the course had erased the characteristics that made the original design playable and enjoyable. Bobby Weed was tasked in 1995 with restoring the Ross design, but there were no blueprints or design notes. His only reference was a 1943 aerial photograph from the nearby Navy base. On three holes, Workers found groups of bushes planted as 150-yard markers in 1923 that were now 20 yards in the rough.Weed, Bobby:\\"Course Hole by Hole Overview\\" 2002 USGA Senior Amateur, June 27, 2002 Between April and October 1996, Weed cleared brush and cut down 800 trees that had encroached on the fairways, restoring the angles that Ross intended. At the end of the 1990s, new federal rules required more efficient use of water for irrigating non- agricultural land. The southern property line of Timuquana Country Club abuts the Naval Air Station Jacksonville, and they partnered with the Navy to use the base's treated wastewater effluent for golf course irrigation, which began in the fall of 1997. =1952 aircraft accident= At approximately 10.00 am on the 19th of March, a pilot on a routine training flight from the adjacent US Navy base had engine trouble due to low oil pressure. He attempted to land back at the base, but instead tried to make an emergency landing on the 7th hole. The plane landed on the fairway, instantly killing Bertha Johnson and Mary Dempsey, who had just played their tee shots and were walking to their balls. The plane continued down the fairway, crashing into a clump of trees before exploding into flames. The pilot scrambled out of the wreckage, before being informed of the tragedy that had occurred. Other amenities =Tennis= Two clay tennis courts were created in 1933 but were little used and eventually removed. In 1963, the club built four tennis courts and later added four clay courts. A large number of members participate in the club's tennis league, which is active year-round.\\"About the club\\" Tinuquana Country Club =Swimming pool= Although a swimming pool had been proposed from the earliest days of the Club, it was not until after World War II that one was built for and enjoyment of the members and their families. In 1963, the Club added a new swimming pool with family and lap areas. In 2000, the poolside grille was given a facelift and new restroom facilities were added.\\"Renovatoin Timuquana Country Club\\" KBJ Architects, 2001 =Boating= Many members enjoy boating on the St. Johns River, although the club does not provide marina services.

It was approved by the membership and construction began in June 1958.

History Development of the IADB began in the late 1980s at the Scottish Urban Archaeological Trust (SUAT) in Perth, Scotland (archaeological services in Perth are now provided by Alder Archaeology http://www.alderarchaeology.co.uk, Alder Archaeology). The aim was to develop a computerised integrated database to record and help with the analysis of several large excavation projects on which SUAT was working at the time. Initial components included a simple stratigraphic analysis program, a basic Context and Find cataloging application and an early attempt at a single context plan digitising solution. The original concept of the IADB was to make available digital versions of the various excavation records as an easily accessible integrated resource for use in post-excavation analysis and to provide a framework within which that analysis would be undertaken. Initially, the IADB only dealt with simple artefact records and stratigraphic unit or context records. Over time, the scope of the IADB has widened to include other digital resources including single context plans, photographs, stratigraphy diagrams, etc. Initially the IADB was described as a \\"digital workbench\\" or a \\"computerised desktop\\", today we would probably call it a virtual research environment. Early versions of the IADB ran under MS-DOS and were written in Clipper and C using the dBase database format. Vector graphics used the GEM graphics library, a precursor to Windows. With the launch of Visual Basic, the IADB was moved to Windows using an MS Access database. In 1997 development of the IADB moved from SUAT to York Archaeological Trust http://www.yorkarchaeology.co.uk, York Archaeological Trust and shortly afterwards the IADB programs were re-written in Delphi, still using an Access database. In 1999 work was begun on converting the IADB to a web application using MySQL and PHP. In recent years, development has continued in collaboration with the Silchester Town Life Projecthttp://www.silchester.rdg.ac.uk, Silchester Town Life Project at the University of Reading. Grants from the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) have funded the development of the IADB as a web publication tool, and grants from the UK JISC have funded the OGHAM and VERAhttp://vera.rdg.ac.uk , Virtual Environment for Research in Archaeology (VERA) projects for the development of the IADB as a Virtual Research Environment for archaeology using the Silchester project as a test-bed. In September 2005, an edition of the BBC Radio 4 programme The Material World featured a discussion on the role of the IADB in the Silchester project with particular reference to the development of the IADB as a virtual research environment. As of September 2010, this programme remains available online at http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/thematerialworld_20050922.shtml. The IADB was Highly Commended in the Best Archaeological Innovation category at the 2010 British Archaeological Awardshttp://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards, British Archaeological Awards ceremony held at the British Museum on 19 July 2010. Structure An IADB project database consists of data resources and the links, or connections between them. * Finds are sub-divided into Small Finds, Bulk Finds, Samples, Skeletons, Architectural Fragments and Structural Timbers. Find References take the form FSF12345. * Contexts are the standard stratigraphic excavation unit. A basic Context record consists of keywords and other metadata, an optional image (or facsimile) of the original context recording sheet, stratigraphic links to other contexts and a \\"single context plan\\" of the context. * Sets consist of one or more Contexts, for example, the cut of a pit and its several fills, and can belong to a single Group * Groups consist of one or more Sets, for example, several associated pit Sets, and can belong to a single Phase * Phases consist of one or more Groups * Objects consist of any combination of Finds, Contexts, Sets, Groups, Phases and other Objects. They are defined either as a list of members (static) or as the result of a database query (dynamic). * Images include photographs and other digital raster images such as scanned X-rays. Each image can be linked to any number of Finds, Contexts, etc. and can be inserted into internal IADB documents. * Illustrations include any type of digital vector illustration which can be converted into SVG or DXF format * Structure Diagrams can be a simple stratigraphic matrix diagrams showing stratigraphic units (Contexts, Sets, etc.) and the relationships between them, or other database resources (images, plans, documents, other Structure Diagrams, etc.) can be added to create more general purpose visualisations. A Structure Diagram can be thought of as a visual representation of, and an index into, a particularly aspect of the project database. * Documents can be internal HTML documents created and edited within the IADB, externally created documents (such as PDF files) uploaded and stored within the IADB, links to external (non-IADB) web resources, or references to paper documents. * Bibliography References. Each IADB server maintains a global Bibliography, from which selected items are tagged for inclusion within individual Projects. The IADB includes built-in editors for creating and manipulating Structure Diagrams, creating and editing internal documents, and for digitizing single Context plans (from scanned images or using a graphics tablet). No third party software is required. Any number of user-defined tags (analogous to Labels in Google Mail, for example) may be applied to any resources within a project database. Each IADB project, each Tagged list, each individual resource record (Find, Context, Image, Structure Diagram, etc.), and each SQL Query in an IADB project database has a unique URI which allows links to individual IADB resources to be included in web publications, external databases, etc. Recent Developments An innovative approach to Context recording has been developed which uses a scanned image of the original Context Recording Sheet (CRS) and some associated metadata as an alternative to the traditional IADB context record which was essentially a full transcription of the CRS. An example of a facsimile Context record may be seen here. A discussion of the background to the Facsimile Context Record may be downloaded from here (PDF 290kb). Work is continuing on the development of a Section record within the IADB. The aim is to produce a fully interactive system of digitised section drawings linked to the Contexts, Finds and Samples represented on them. In many ways, this will be similar to the existing system for digitising and storing single context plans within the IADB. Work has begun on the development of a web service to provide IADB project data in XML format, possibly with an associated RSS feed. The XML web service will be in addition to the unique URIs mentioned above which provide IADB project data as formatted HTML.

Children of Glory commemorates Hungary's Revolution of 1956 and the \\"Blood in the Water\\" match. Taking place in Budapest and at the Melbourne Olympic Games in October and November of that year, the film takes viewers into the passion and sadness of one of the most dramatic popular revolts of the twentieth century. In the same year Soviet tanks were violently suppressing the Revolution within Hungary, the Hungarian water polo team was winning over Russia in the Olympic pool in Melbourne, in what is sometimes described as the bloodiest water polo match in history. While telling the story of 1956 in part through fictional lead characters, the film-makers simultaneously recreated many of the key public events of the Revolution, including the huge demonstrations and the fighting in the streets of Budapest. Plot summary In 1956, Karcsi Szab√≥ (Iv√°n Feny≈ë) was a star athlete at the University of Budapest and had been named captain of the national water polo team that would represent Hungary in the Olympics held that summer in Australia. However, many of Szab√≥'s countrymen had more on their minds; Hungary had fallen under the oppressive rule of the Soviet Union, and a growing number of Hungarians were demanding independence. One day, Szab√≥ and his friend Tibi (S√°ndor Cs√°nyi) witness a demonstration led by Viki Falk (Kata Dob√≥) demanding an end to Soviet rule in Hungary. While initially Szab√≥ is more attracted to Falk's beauty than her message, through his attempts to woo her he is awakened to the need for revolution; however, an uprising by the people is crushed by the Soviet war machine, and matters become worse for the Hungarian people. When Szab√≥ and his teammates discover that Hungary will be competing against the Soviet Union in the men's Water Polo tournament at the upcoming Olympics, they see an opportunity for a symbolic victory over their oppressors . . . if they will be allowed to leave to country to compete.http://www.allmovie.com/movie/children- of-glory-v351070 Cast * Kata Dob√≥ as Falk Viki * Iv√°n Feny≈ë as Szab√≥ Karcsi * S√°ndor Cs√°nyi as V√°mos Tibi * K√°roly Gesztesi as Telki coach * Ildik√≥ B√°ns√°gi as Karcsi's mother * Tam√°s Jord√°n as Karcsi's granddad * Vikt√≥ria Sz√°vai as Han√°k Eszter * Zsolt Husz√°r as G√°l Jancsi * Tam√°s Keresztes as √Åcs Imi * P√©ter Haumann as Feri b√°csi * D√°niel G√°bori as J√≥zsika (as G√°bori D√°niel) * R√≥bert Marton as Kardos M√°rton (Comp√≥) * Korn√©l Simon as Abonyi Gyula (B√°r√≥) * Kriszti√°n Kolovratnik as Fazekas S√°ndor (Frank) * Antal Czapk√≥ as Prokop References External links * Official site   * The Times Review * American DVD version 2006 films 2000s sports films C2 Pictures films Films about the 1956 Summer Olympics Films produced by Andrew G.

The reigns of Emperor Jimmu and the subsequent Emperors are considered the .  Origin  220px According to early mythology, the Japanese islands were created by Izanagi and Izanami, meaning \\"he who invites\\" and \\"she who invites\\". They find themselves on a heavenly golden bridge staring down at earth and its oceans. With their jeweled spear, called Amenonuhoko, given by the gods or kami before them, they dip the spear into the ocean, creating the islands of Japan, Onogoro Island (‚Äúspontaneous- congealed island‚Äù).( F. Hadland, Davis, 2007) Descending down from the skies, Izanagi and Izanami create their home and create a central Heavenly August pillar. Deciding to populate the land, Izanagi circles the left side of the pillar while Izanami circles the right. Meeting each other on the other side of it, Izanami greets her love \\"oh, what a comely young man.\\" Izanagi replies with \\"How delightfully, I have met a lovely maiden.\\" Izanami being a woman speaking first to a man, the gods looked at this as inappropriate and cursed the couple by the children they bore. Their first child Hiruko was born hideous and cast out for its atrocity. Trying and trying again, they fail to conceive a proper child. The gods explain to them both about their curse and decide to give them another chance. Once again Izanagi and Izanami circle the pillar just as before, only Izanagi speaks first. Their mating now was fruitful. Izanami gave birth to the islands of Awaji, Iyo (later Shikoku), Oki, Tsukushi (later Ky≈´sh≈´), Iki, Tsushima, Sado, and finally Yamato (later Honsh≈´), the largest. They named the land Oyashimakuni, the Land of Eight Great Islands. After that, Izanami gave birth in quick succession to the other minor islands that surround the main ones, and to the main kami of sea and harbor, of wind, trees, mountains, and so on. Many other kami were born from Izanami‚Äôs womb such as Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess. She was known as \\"Heaven- Illumine-of-Great-Deity‚Äù, and the Moon God, Tsukuyomi. His silver radiance was not so fair as the golden effulgence of his sister, the Sun Goddess.Frederick Hadland Davis, 2007 While both sit atop the heavens, they begin their sibling rivalry, quarreling and fighting, they decide they can no longer see each other face to face, thus creating day and night, separating the two. The last kami conceived was the fire god, Kagutsuchi. During birth, Kagutsuchi severely burned Izanami and eventually slipped away into the Land of Yomi, the underworld. \\"The tears Izanagi shed at the death of his wife brought forth further deities. Angered by the sight of the newly born fire kami who had been the cause of Izanami‚Äôs death, Izanagi drew his sword and decapitated the infant. The blood coalescing on the sword brought forth eight martial kami, including the important Takemikazuchi-no-kami and his peer, Futsunushi-no- kami. Eight more fierce kami of mountains and iron emerged from the infant‚Äôs body and limbs.\\"Frederick Hadland Davis, 2007 In his anguish, Izanagi followed her to the underworld to rescue her and soon discovered the awful truth. Nothing remained of his beloved Izanami but a rotting living-dead corpse.

It connects Kovzha River to Sheksna River, and is part of the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway. The length of the canal is . The canal passes the town of Belozersk. The first plans to dig a canal connecting the basins of the Neva and the Volga were developed in 1710 during the reign of Tsar Peter the Great. In the beginning of the 19th century, the system was actually constructed. It was open in 1810 and got the name of the Mariinsky Canal System. In particular, the waterway followed the Sheksna River, Lake Beloye, the Kovzha River, and the canal connected to the Vytegra River. However, Lake Beloye was an inconvenient piece due to frequent dangerous storms, and also because it was too shallow in the area close to the source of the Sheksna. These conditions often caused shipwrecks. A number of proposals were submitted which aimed at resolving the problems. In particular, construction of artificial islands was suggested. Mercant Stolbikov from Belozersk obtained a concession to tow the boats over the lake in bad weather. These means, however, proved to be inefficient, and Belozersk merchants asked Tsar Alexander I for a permission to build a bypass canal. The permission was obtained and the works started but were never completed. In 1830s, merchants asked for permission again, and the construction started in 1843. The level of the canal was higher than the level of the Sheksna entrance and higher than the level of the Kovzha entrance. The construction was completed in 1846. The eastern entrance to the canal was several kilometers downstream of the village of Krokhino, and thus Krokhino, which was previously one of the main navigation hubs, suddenly was left off the waterway. The population of Belozersk also suffered losses from the opening of the canal, since the boatsman skills and knowledge of the bottom of Lake Beloye were not needed anymore. Generally, however, the construction of the canal was a great economic success, and by 1870 70% of the total amount of water goods transportation was along the Mariinsky Canal System. The canal was reconstructed in the 20th century.

In 2015 he faced up to 43 years in prison for criticising the Malaysian government in a number of posts on Twitter and was charged under the Sedition Act 1948. The charges were dropped after the change of government in 2018.http://www.cartooningforpeace.org/en/dessinateurs/zunar/ In May 2016 he was the recipient of the Cartooning for Peace award in Geneva.https://www.cartooningforpeace.org/en/evenements/cartoonists-gado- kenya-and-zunar-malaysia-recipients-of-the-2016-cartooning-for-peace-prize/  Background  Zunar was born on 15 May 1962, at Bukit Junun, Gurun, Kedah. He previously worked as a laboratory technician and during his pastime delved in drawing cartoons. He was also a secretary to the Association of Selangor and Federal Territory cartoonists. Quite often he held workshops for individuals wanting to venture into cartoon business. Zunar often likes to bring along a pen and notebook inside his travel bag during his drawing excursions, from which he will record ideas from all walks of life and would translate them into caricatures or cartoons.  Career as a cartoonist  Zunar produced his first works as early as 1973 which were published in the magazine Bambino. Upon the encouragement of family and friends, his drawings were also published weekly in newspapers and magazines such as the Kisah Cinta magazine and issues of Gila-Gila, a publication by Creative Enterprise Sdn Bhd. In Gila-Gila, from time to time his cartoons began attracting the attention of readers and publishers as well as due to their cynical and political nature. This gave him an advantage for his work to be published in issues of the Chili Padi magazine (part of the Gila-Gila magazine) under the title Gebang-Gebang. Zunar then began producing work in a daily-news comic strip called Papa. Zunar's name became well known when he got himself involved in the Reformasi movement following the sacking of then-Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in 1998. His involvement in the movement led to his detention along with several other activists. After his release, he concentrated on drawing political cartoons. He produced several books of cartoons touching on many reform movements that he had previously participated in. To date he continues to draw political cartoons, namely for politically owned newspapers, including Harakah.  Description of his work  Zunar is a cartoonist who always employs sharp satirical humor in his drawings. * One of his work entitled Ofis Korner is a biting satire on office staffs slacking at work. * Liza deals with a character called Kadok, a dumb person who tries to win over a girl by the name of Liza. * Papa, which appeared in the newspaper Berita Harian, featured the life and fate of two siblings in the middle of the rat race and fast-paced city.

Her name means \\"The Short One.\\" She succeeded upon the death of Vazimba Queen Rangita, who by different accounts was either her mother or her adoptive sister. This confusion in the oral tradition extends to the two women's very identities - according to different accounts, Rafohy may have been the mother of Rangita, and Rangita may have been the mother of the famed king Andriamanelo. The mother of Andriamanelo (Rafohy or Rangita) married twice: while her first marriage eventually produced one son, the second marriage with a Merina named Manelobe produced a daughter and her eldest son whom she designated to succeed her upon her death. This designated heir, King Andriamanelo (1540‚Äì1575) became the first King of Imerina by ultimately turning against the Vazimba and leading a military conquest that would drive them from the Highlands. In accordance with vazimba custom wherein the bodies of the dead were submerged in sacred bodies of water - occasionally after being placed within coffins made from hollowed- out logs - it is said that upon Rafohy's death, her body (like that of Rangita) was submerged in a bog within a silver coffin shaped like an outrigger canoe.Kent, R.K.

The company operates community-based health screening services for adults aged 50 and up across the United States. Life Line Screening is partnered with numerous insurance companies, hospitals and organizations including Women in Technology International, Heritage Valley Health System, Carolina Vascular, Mission Hospital,\\"Affiliations\\", St. Joseph Health Mission Hospital and Lake Norman Regional Medical Center. History The company was founded in Florida in 1993 by Colin Scully and Timothy Phillips. By 1998, the company had expanded across the United States, offering screenings to more than 500,000 people. The company added finger-stick blood testing to its screening services to screen for complete cholesterol count (lipid panel), diabetes (glucose) and inflammation (C-reactive protein) in 2007. That same year, Life Line Screening launched its operations in the U.K. In 2008, services expanded to include atrial fibrillation screenings. In 2009, BBC News published a warning over private health scans, saying that private companies who provide screenings were often \\"expensive unnecessary and misleading.\\" The article also criticized the company for not warning people of any restrictions (such as false positives and false negatives) and other disadvantages due to screening. In 2010, a clinical research study was conducted using data from 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. The study found a positive association between increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessation. Results also showed that excess weight was linked with increased AAA risk, whereas exercise and consumption of nuts, vegetables and fruits were linked with reduced risk. Based on the results of this study, researchers were able to develop a simple scoring system that detects large abdominal aortic aneurysms in a broader at- risk population to include women and those younger than 65. According to principal investigator Giampaolo Greco, the current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines would capture one-third of these large aneurysms, whereas two-thirds would be identified using the new system. In April 2013, the Journal of the American College of Cardiology published a study that relied on Life Line Screening data from a population-based screening study of more than 3.6 million Americans. Results showed the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) increased from 1 in 50 in the 40-to-50-year-old age group, to nearly 1 in 3 in the 90-to-100-year-old age group. Another finding displayed the prevalence of PAD, carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and AAA was higher not only with overall increased age, but for both men and women. Researchers noted that this association between age and PAD existed for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In partnership with Life Line Screening, Oxford University published a 2013 clinical research study with data drawn from over 290,000 vascular screenings performed by Life Line Screening between 2008 and 2012 across the UK and Ireland. Results from the study revealed that chronic cardiovascular diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, narrowing of a main artery in the neck, irregular heartbeat and circulatory problems in the legs ‚Äì occur approximately 10 years earlier in men than women. That same year, Life Line Screening commissioned a study that collected information from more than 2.7 million health screenings and was analyzed by outside researchers and revealed two findings. The first finding points to the rising rate of (PAD) in women, a reflection on the increase in the number of women who smoke and the second finding revealed that people with cardiovascular disease present in one part of the body are more likely to have it in other parts of the body, as well. These study findings were published in the July 2013 edition of Postgraduate Medicine. Operations The company has conducted more than 8 million health screenings worldwide since its foundation and averages over 1 million screenings per year, which include ultrasound scans, blood screenings, and electrocardiographs. Common diseases that may be detected by such screenings include Carotid artery stenosis, osteoporosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

It was a popular theatre in its day which met its demise after sitting abandoned for many years. History The Capitol Theatre, formerly known as the Woodstock Opera House, was built in 1893 at 391‚Äì395 Dundas Street, Woodstock. Owned and operated by John Griffin's Griffin Amusement Company of Toronto, it opened in 1908 as a 1,480-seat theatre that included a balcony and balcony boxes, and could mount stage as well as silent movie shows. In the early 1900s, it had the largest stage (23 √ó 60 feet)[CONVERSION NEEDED] between Windsor and Hamilton. Although silent films were shown regularly, with a six-piece orchestra in a pit before the stage to provide accompaniment, touring stage shows also made routine and popular visits. Every summer a stock company would visit for several weeks, putting on a different play each night. The local YMCA also had a singing group, Y Beaver Minstrels, that performed there to packed houses. During the intervals, 11- and 12-year-old YMCA members would be drafted to walk up and down the aisles selling Cracker Jack as a fundraiser. The same building had earlier housed the 1,075-seat Opera House, owned by a local businessman, Thomas Carter, and built in 1893. Former Canadian prime minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and opposition leader Sir Robert Borden each presented their views in the early 1900s at the theatre. =Renaming= In 1927, Famous Players Ltd. bought the Woodstock Opera House, renamed it the Capitol Theatre and soon began showing the first talkies. In 1940, The Capitol was sold to another local businessman, Tom Naylor, who made extensive upgrades, including adding an up-to-date sound system and fireproofing the projection booth: the nitrate-based film then used was very flammable, unlike the safety film in use today. However, live stage performances were still popular and vaudeville was a part of every Saturday evening show until 1956. =Modern Movie Era= The balcony was converted into a second and separate theatre, called the Capitol 2, in 1975. Closing and demolition The Capitol Theatre meeting its ultimate demise. The former Capitol Theatre site in 2011. The Capitol closed in 1999, after which it sat abandoned and in disrepair. The concern for maintaining the historic theatre came to the attention of the Woodstock city council. Resident Bert Taylor spoke to council about the concern, saying the building had seen historical events and famous people within its walls but faced an absentee landowner with little interest for celebrating that history. Taylor wanted council to designate the building as a heritage property. Taylor also mentioned the former opera house and movie theatre was the site of an election debate in 1911 between Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Sir Robert Borden‚Äîa precursor to the election Borden subsequently won. The Sentinel-Review published an article in 2004 where Terry DeCosta said he intended to convert the property to a dinner theatre. However, the property was only stripped of its internal elements of value and was left idle. The City of Woodstock issued a demolition order to the owners of the Capitol Theatre in June 2010. According to the city the building had experienced a \\"major roof collapse in the middle of the building\\" and \\"the last exterior walls remain standing and unstable.\\" The theatre was demolished later that year.

In his third start for Hofstra, he completed 21 of 33 passes and threw for a school record 315 yards in a 35-13 win over Kings Point Academy. A month later, he broke his own record and threw for 345 yards after completing 17 of 25 passes in a 42-28 win over Temple. For the season he completed 158 passes for 20 touchdowns and 2,134 yards. Gault's junior year was considered to have been a disappointment due to ineffectiveness and a 2-8 overall record, but his career passing yards through two full seasons set a school record. Gault's senior season performances included a 325-yard, four touchdown performance, after which he was named to the weekly All-East All-Star football team. In his last collegiate game against C. W. Post College, he completed 11 of 20 passes for 220 yards in a 19-0 win, giving Hofstra an 8-2 record his senior year with seven of the eight wins being shutouts. Over the course of his career, Gault broke school records for passing yards and completions in a season and career, but also had 22 interceptions in 30 career games. After his graduation, coach Howdy Myers said of him, \\"he has a quick release and can throw accurately both long and short.\\" Professional career Gault went undrafted in the 1968 NFL Draft, and was signed by the Cleveland Browns as a free agent. Heading into training camp, he was one of five quarterbacks looking for a roster spot, the others being Frank Ryan, Gary Lane, Dick Shiner, and fellow undrafted rookie Jim Alcorn. By the end of the preseason, Gault was cut from the active roster, and spent the 1968 season on the practice squad, but was noted as someone who could be the Browns' future starting quarterback. Before the 1969 season began, Gault joined the military reserves. While training at Fort Dix from June to November, he played in the Continental Football League with the Jersey Jays. After his training ended, he returned to the team's practice squad. He was placed on the active roster as a third-string emergency quarterback in case the Browns needed him during the postseason. During the offseason, Gault worked as an insurance broker while remaining on the Browns roster. The Browns had three quarterbacks on their roster entering the 1970 season in Gault, Bill Nelsen, and Mike Phipps. As training camp began, Browns coach Blanton Collier planned to use Gault in exhibition games, as he was throwing the ball well in practice during the summer. By the end of preseason, Gault was named to the active roster as the Browns retained all three quarterbacks, an uncommon move at the time. During the Browns' second game against the San Francisco 49ers, starting quarterback Nelsen was injured, leading Gault to enter the game in the fourth quarter. He completed a pass to Gary Collins for 23 yards, threw an incompletion, and threw an interception to Dave Wilcox, allowing the 49ers to go on a game-winning drive in a 34-31 Browns loss. Due to Nelsen's injury, Gault was given the start in next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing off against fellow rookie and first overall draft pick, Terry Bradshaw. In his only career start, he completed one pass for 44 yards in 16 attempts, threw two interceptions, and finished the game with a 0.0 passer rating. He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the first half, and as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns went on to win the game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back over for the Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and was throwing better in training camp as a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed on the practice squad, where he remained throughout the season. In 1972, the Browns drafted Brian Sipe, giving Gault competition for the third quarterback spot, which was noted as a main position battle in training camp for the Browns that season. At the end of training camp, Sipe won the job, and Gault was cut. He was picked up by the San Diego Chargers in late August. He competed with Wayne Clark for the backup quarterback job for a short time, and did not see any playing time for the Chargers before his release. He also spent time with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, but did not see any playing time with them. He later noted that he was unable to adjust to the game of Canadian football, as he was unable to throw a spiral due to the football being shorter and fatter. The New York Jets signed Gault as a free agent in 1973, and he was slated to compete with Al Woodall for the backup quarterback spot behind Joe Namath. At the end of preseason, he lost the backup spot to Woodall, and was released. The following year, Gault signed with the New York Stars of the new World Football League in April. After practicing with the team throughout the offseason, he was released in August, ending his professional career.

This wire is charged to generate a cylindrical magnetic field that snags the electrons that make up half the solar wind. These electrons get funnelled into a metal spherical receiver to produce a current, which generates the wire's magnetic field ‚Äì making the system self-sustaining. Any current not needed for the magnetic field powers an infrared laser trained on satellite dishes back on Earth, designed to collect the energy. Earth's air does not absorb infra- red light, so the system would be highly efficient.

He was the founding member of the creative multimedia studio Elite Gudz. As the inventor and creator, Phetus along with the Elite Gudz staff released the \\"Graffiti Spraycan\\" application on iTunes. History Growing up on Long Island in the 1980s, during the golden era of the hip-hop scene. He gained the attention of artists like Public Enemy (group). When Flavor Flav opened a barber shop in Freeport, Long IslandWice, Nathaniel, \\"Welcome To the Barberdome\\") New York Magazine, October 26, 1992) he recruited Phetus to do airbrushing on shirts, jackets and other apparel. Flavor Flav wore an airbrushed piece by Phetus on The Arsenio Hall Show in an episode about the controversy of Public Enemy Phetus went on to paint the backdrop for Public Enemy's performance with U2 at the \\"Stop Sellafield\\" concert. His work can also be seen in the official video for \\"Tap the Bottle (Twist the Cap)\\" by Young Black Teenagers. Phetus did all the graffiti on the set of the video; a large-scale phat phace can be seen behind the group.Video, \\"Tap the Bottle (Twist the Cap)\\", Young Black Teenagers, Geffen Records, 1993 A mutual friend of rapper Erick Sermon introduced Phetus to the producer, and that meeting led to Phetus illustrating the \\"Def Squad\\" logo for the trio. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Phetus continued to create custom clothing pieces for hip-hop artists such as LL Cool J, Ludacris and Game. In 2002 Phetus opened up Concrete Vibes in Long Island. Following the path of stores in New York like The Scrapyard, the store was the first on Long Island to sell graffiti supplies like aerosol paint and markers, independent designer clothing, designer toys and other lifestyle products. Monthly art shows were also held at the store, and the store held a book signing for Cope2. Concrete Vibes was the host to graffiti artist Iz the Wiz. In 2003 Iz held his first solo artist showcase on Long Island at Concrete Vibes. In 2005 Phetus relocated his studio and worked with graffiti artist Richie SEEN. He set up shop in the back of \\"Tattoo SEEN\\" in the Throgs Neck section in the Bronx. While working alongside SEEN, Phnetus designed the packaging for Planet6, SEEN's designer toy brand, along with the character development for the Phony Baloney designer toy line. This project led to work with Terminal Press, where Phetus helped create the Phony-Baloney comic book. Phetus formed the Elite Gudz multi-media design studio in 2008. In 2012 Phetus moved his art studio to the Flatiron District of Manhattan and shared a creative space with the artists Anton Kadinsky, sculptor Carlos Mare139 Rodriguez, Allan Ket and Alice Mizrachi. For the next 2 years this was his creative work space. Creative works Concrete Immortalz is a comic series created by graffiti artist Phetus. The series is built on the idea that art progresses with and chronicles human history, and \\"the graffiti movement is the artistic embodiment of current times.\\" The series' main protagonist is The Wall Lord, a graffiti artist who writes messages of hope and defiance against a repressive government. On January 7, 2010, Phetus and street artist Such painted a mural image of The Wall Lord on a subway car installation outside of Tuff City Tattoos in Bronx.

Life Paul Heinrich Friedrich Carl Isenberg was born April 15, 1837 in Dransfeld, Kingdom of Hanover, Germany. His father was Lutheran minister Daniel Isenberg (1807‚Äì1875), and mother was Dorothea (Strauch) Isenberg (1808‚Äì1871). He came to the Hawaiian Islands in 1858, and became known as Paul Isenberg. Isenberg moved to the island of Kauai and first worked in Wailua. In October 1861 he married Hannah \\"Maria\\" Rice, daughter of William Harrison Rice, who was born February 17, 1842, and died April 7, 1867. They had two children, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg (1862‚Äì1949) and Daniel Paul Rice Isenberg (1866‚Äì1919) known as \\"Paul Jr.\\" He traveled back to Germany in 1869 where he married Beta Margarete Glade (born 1846) before returning to Hawaii. They had six more children: Johannes \\"John\\" Carl Isenberg (born September 12, 1870), Heinrich Alexander Isenberg (born January 17, 1872), Julie Maria Pauline (Isenberg) Barckhausen (born November 1876), Clara Margarete (Isenberg) Wendroth (born 1878), Richard Menno Isenberg (born 1880) and Paula Bertha Johanna Isenberg (born 1883). Isenberg took over managing the sugarcane plantation at Lƒ´hu ªe in 1862, after the death of his father-in-law who was previous manager. The plantation was founded by diplomat Henry A. Peirce, but struggled to make a profit until Rice built an irrigation system. Isenberg made improvements to the cane sugar mill such as using an evaporating pan and steam pipes to concentrate the cane juice. In 1872 the Lihue Plantation company was officially incorporated, and the expanded by at HanamƒÅ ªulu. On January 24, 1874 he was appointed to the upper House of Nobles in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom by King Lunalilo. Note name not accurate He officially became a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii at that time. In 1877 he bought equipment for a new mill from George Norton Wilcox and installed it at HanamƒÅ ªulu to be managed by Albert Spencer Wilcox. In 1878 Isenberg retired as plantation manager, but kept an ownership interest while moving his family back to Bremen in Germany. He visited the islands at least every two years for legislative sessions. His brother Carl Isenberg then managed the plantation. In 1881 Isenberg became a business partner with earlier German merchant Heinrich Hackfeld in his Hackfeld & Company. Although most other plantation laborers were Chinese or Japanese, Isenberg arranged for groups of workers from Bremen to settle on his company's plantations. In the 1887 session of the legislature, he was one of the few who objected to the threat of military force that caused the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii to be called the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\". He died in Bremen on January 16, 1903. Legacy Hackfeld & Company grew to be one of the \\"Big Five\\" corporations that dominated the economy of the Territory of Hawaii. During World War I, Hackfeld & Company was seized by the U.S. government Alien Property Custodian along with other assets owned by Germans. It was sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to \\"American Factors\\" and the company's store Liberty House. A 1920 lawsuit argued the price was below market value, and some former stockholders including John Carl Isenberg recovered some damages. In 1966, the name was further shortened to Amfac, Inc. His son Paul Jr. married Annie Beatrice McBryde, daughter of neighboring sugar planter Duncan McBryde on October 19, 1891. On August 31, 1891 Queen Liliuokalani appointed him to the Privy Council. From 1898 to 1915 he was elected as representative to the house of representatives of the Territory of Hawaii, and from 1902 to 1905 the senate. He married Bertha Koepke on August 9, 1916, and they had one child, Dorothea \\"Dora\\" Jane Isenberg (1917‚Äì1988), who married Joseph Cole. Cole was first manager of the Kauai Museum in 1960. In 1887 his younger brother Johannes Friedrich Wilhelm \\"Hans\\" Isenberg (1855‚Äì1918) was brought in to be pastor of the first Lutheran church on the island for the immigrants who starting arriving in 1881. Hans had married his own niece, Paul's first child, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg, known as Dora, in 1883.

Initially, there were about 170 tapestries in the royal collection, among them 84 black-and-white tapestries with the royal crest and the letters SA, 8 tapestries which Sigismund I the Old had been received from the Emperor Maximilian I, and others, gifts from foreign delegations. The gifts include one tapestry with the Polish eagle bearing the date 1560, the royal initials and the letters CKCH (Christophorus Krupski Capitaneus Horodlo) next to the Korczak coat of arms and the inscription SCABELLVM PEDVM TVORVM (the footstool under your feet, from Psalm 110 (A Psalm of David)), a gift from Krzysztof Krupski, starost of Horod≈Ço for Sigismund Augustus. The tapestries had been displayed publicly for the first time during the wedding of king Sigismund Augustus with Catherine of Austria. To this day, preserved about 138 of which exposed are about 30. They were matched in size to the walls and some of them reach the size of 5 √ó 9 m (5.47 √ó 9.84 yd). The tapestries were made of wool strands, silk and gold and woven on looms with a density of about 8 - 10 warp threads per centimeter. This series consists of the following subjects: Verdure Dragon fighting with a panther (detail), design by the circle of Pieter Coecke van Aelst. * Biblical scenes - scenes from the Story of the First Parents, the Story of Noah and the Story of Tower of Babel (inventory number of the Wawel Museum 1 - 18), the Story of Moses, the Story of Absalom the Story of Nebuchadnezzar and the Story of Saul (scattered), created according to design by Michiel Coxie - biblical scenes, fillets by an unknown artist from the circle of painters Cornelis Floris and Cornelis Bos, * Mythological scenes - scenes from the Trojan War, the Military expeditions of the Persian king Cyrus, the Story of Romulus and Remus, the Story of Scipio, the Story of Hannibal, the Story of Julius Caesar and the Story of Octavian Augustus (scattered), * landscape and animal scenes (verdure) (inventory number of the Wawel Museum 19 - 78) created around 1560, according to design by an unknown artist from the circle of Pieter Coecke van Aelst (sometimes associated with Willem Tons), * grotesque scenes with the coats of arms of Poland and Lithuania and the royal initials (inventory number of the Wawel Museum 79 - 134/2) created around 1560, according to design by an unknown artist from the circle of painters Cornelis Floris and Cornelis Bos, three grotesque (inventory number 92, 93, 94) were based on drawings by Cornelis Bos. Biblical tapestries are exhibited in rotation in the chambers on the second floor of the castle, and the tapestries with animals, as well as grotesques with monograms and coats of arms on both floors. This is the largest collection of tapestries ever commissioned by one ruler. According to the will of the last Jagiellonian king the Flemish Arrases in gold or figured, together with those of simpler kind were given to the king's three sisters and after their death, they had become the property of the State Treasury, under the custody of the Commonwealth's parliament to serve the public good of the Commonwealth and not for private benefit of future kings (fragment of the Diet's resolution). Verdure An otter with a fish in its mouth, Jan van Tieghem's workshop, ca. 1555. Unfortunately, the not quite precise will became a cause of many conflicts over ownership of the tapestries between the kings and nobles. The whole collection was only together for a short time at the Castle in Tykocin until 1572. Then the king's sisters scattered it between their residences in Krak√≥w, Niepo≈Çomice, Warsaw, Vilnius and Hrodna, and even sent some to Sweden. The king Sigismund III Vasa brought back 30 pieces that Anna Jagiellon sent to Stockholm to her sister Catherine (Sigismund's mother). In 1633, three of the tapestries with scenes from the Story of Moses, were presented by Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, on behalf of king W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, to Pope Urban VIII. During the Deluge the collection was hidden by Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski in his estates in Spi≈°. In the following years the king John II Casimir Vasa mortgaged 157 tapestries to a merchant from Gda≈Ñsk, Jan Gratta, without the consent of parliament. In order to force the lifetime wages after his abdication the king also took some of the tapestries to France. This caused protests from the nobility and the king's debt was not repaid until 1724. The parliament submitted the tapestries for safekeeping in the Warsaw's Carmelite convent and for the last time they were displayed during the coronation of king Stanis≈Çaw Augustus in 1764. After the major reconstruction of the Warsaw Royal Castle's interiors in the neoclassical style the king ordered new tapestries in France and the Jagiellonian collection was rolled up and stored in the building of the Treasury Committee - Palace of the Republic. According to an inventory performed during the reign of Stanis≈Çaw Augustus there were about 156 arrasses. In 1795, after the Third Partition of Poland, the tapestries along with other goods plundered from the royal residencies, were taken by Alexander Suvorov to Russia. Paradise Bliss, Jan de Kempeneer's workshop, ca. 1550. After regaining independence and victorious war with the Soviet Union the Polish government managed to recover 137 fabrics, in various states of preservation, between 1922-1924. The tapesties were cut to fit the walls of the Winter Palace and Gatchina Palace, or they were used as furniture upholstery. Some of them are still in Russia, displayed in different museums, without specifying their origin, the Soviets claimed that the tapestries are equivalent for the Polish debts. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, the tapestries stored at Wawel Castle were transported through Romania, France and England to Canada to be finally returned, after 15 years of negotiations, to the People's Republic of Poland in the 1960s.Gordon Swoger, \\"The Strange Odyssey of Poland's National Treasures, 1939‚Äì1961\\", , 2004, Dundurn In 1961, when the royal collection was coming back from a long journey it was greeted by the Sigismund Bell and the Krak√≥w inhabitants. Today 137 fabrics are owned by the Wawel Royal Castle (2 of them, Forest landscape with a deer and a duck catching fish and the Forest landscape with a deer and giraffes by Nicolas Leyniers, are displayed in the Warsaw Royal Castle), the Moral fall of the humanity before the deluge, returned to Poland in 1977 as a gift from the Soviet Union, it is in the Royal Castle in Warsaw and one of the missing, which appeared on the antique market in the 1950s and was purchased by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

The 14th-century church was built to a single plan in Decorated Gothic style by a local knight and has remained largely unaltered to the present day. The church contains a brass monument of national importance, a tall medieval font cover and rood screen paintings. The chancel retains some stained glass contemporary with the construction of the building. History Elsing is recorded as having a church, endowed with of land, in the Domesday Survey of 1087. The church was rebuilt by Sir Hugh de Hastings,Andrew Ayton, ‚ÄòHastings, Sir Hugh (c.1310‚Äì1347)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2008 accessed 7 Dec 2010 and his wife Margaret in around 1330 to a single uniform plan. Sir Hugh, whose maternal grandfather was the powerful earl Hugh le Despenser, was summoned to parliament by King Edward III with whom he was on good terms and who seems to have been a mourner at Hugh's funeral, as shown on his memorial brass. Some masonry from an earlier church survives in the west wall of the nave. Wall paintings discovered around 1860 and subsequently plastered over showed four scenes in the story of John the Baptist in 14th-century style. The first scene, which seems to have been hastily plastered over, was said by the rector to have shown Herodias dancing before Herod with her attitude \\"rolicking and bent to the ground, so that her auburn hair touched the very ground.\\" Of the other scenes which were traced and recorded at the time scene two showed John the Baptist preaching before Herod and Herodias and scene three John coming from the prison watched by Herodias wearing 14th-century style shoes. Scene four was described as the best preserved, showing John about to be decapitated. Lying on a medieval pilgrimage route to Walsingham the church also venerated St Anne, who is shown teaching the Virgin in a painted rood screen panel. Another panel shows the Visitation, with Elizabeth shown in nun's habit. In the 20th century a small organ built by Norman and Beard in 1901 was installed in the north-east corner of the nave. Architecture The east window The church is built of flint with stone dressings and stands at the centre of a rectangular churchyard. The tower at the western end has battlements with an early example of flushwork panelling. The bell openings have reticulated tracery, with two minor reticulation units within the major one. The nave, without pillars or aisles, is nearly wide, the widest among Norfolk‚Äôs parish churches, giving a large preaching space as pioneered by the mendicants. The nave and chancel have battlemented parapets and a pantiled roof built in 1781, supported by kingposts on arched ties, which solved earlier problems caused by the width of the nave. The nave has three large three-light windows on each side with Curvilinear tracery based on the petal motif. The west door is of Perpendicular style opening into the nave through a tall narrow tower arch. There are both north and south doors with porches, all having boldly cusped ogee arches. The floor is of buff pamment stone. The chancel has a five-light east window with intricate Curvilinear tracery and three other two-light windows. Now with mostly plain glass the east window was recorded in the 1860s as having figures of Sir Hugh and Lady de Hastings holding a model of the church. The south-east window contains a small stained glass figure of the Virgin from a Coronation dating from the building of the church and a slightly later apostle in red and brown of about 1375. The south-west window has two complete apostles, one in green and yellow and the other in brown and lilac. The plain sedilia and piscina niche have ogee arches. In the southeast corner is a vestry with a Y-tracery window. Against the south wall is the tomb-chest of Dame Anne Browne (died 1623) with a black marble lid and an inscription in black lettering on the wall. The brass of Sir Hugh Hastings has been lifted from the church floor and mounted on a plinth at the centre of the chancel. Hastings brass The replica brass memorial of Sir Hugh Hastings The brass memorial to Sir Hugh Hastings (died 1347), the largest of all English church brasses, has been described by Nikolaus Pevsner as ‚Äúthe most sumptuous of all English church brasses‚Äù. With some parts missing it shows a long figure in armour with hands together in prayer while two angels hold his pillows. In the cusped arch above tiny angels receive his soul. In a gable above this is a mounted St George spearing a devil in an octofoiled circle. Above this are two plaques with the Coronation of the Virgin between two angels in the corners. To the left and right four tiers of mourning figures represent Edward III, Thomas Beauchamp Earl of Warwick, Lord Grey of Ruthyn, Henry Plantagenet Earl of Lancaster, the Earl of Pembroke, Edward Despenser, Ralph de Stafford, and Almeric, Lord St Amand. Pembroke and Despenser are now missing. Originally decorated with coloured glass and coloured pastes the brass is now mounted on a low plinth at the centre of the chancel and kept covered for protection. A replica which can be used for brass rubbings is displayed in the north-west corner of the nave. Font and font cover The font and cover The single stemmed Decorated style octagonal font has each wave of a frieze filled with an ogee trefoil and with battlements above. Suspended by a rope from the roof above is a tall and highly ornate font cover in Perpendicular Gothic style with carved figures, some original, in niches between diagonal pierced vanes with rich crocheting topped by a spire and winged angel. Bells The tower contains a ring of five bells, hung for change ringing, however the bells are not ringable. The second, third and fifth bells were cast in 1622 by William and Alice Brend, the fourth in 1660 by Elias Brend and the treble in 1705 by Thomas Newman. The second, third and fourth are listed by the Church of England as being of historical significance as good examples of their respective founders' work, and the frame in which the bells hang is also regarded as being historically important. The church today The church is part of a group of parishes which also includes All Saints, Bawdeswell; St Mary, Bylaugh; St Thomas, Foxley and St Mary, Sparham.

Therapont is venerated as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church. Therapont was born as Fyodor Poskochin in a noble family in Volokolamsk in the 1330s. Being already an adult, he decided to become a monk and arrived to the Simonov Monastery in Moscow. There he get acquainted with Cyril, who was to become later Cyril of White Lake. Apparently, Therapont was once commissioned by the monastery to travel to the North of Russia, to the Lake Beloye area. At a certain point, Cyril decided to leave the monastery and seek for a remote area where he could become a hermit. Ferapont agreed to accompany him and suggested that the Lake Beloye area would be most appropriate for that. Between 1390 and 1397 Cyril and Therapont left the Simonov monastery and travelled north to Lake Siverskoye, where they stayed in the place which eventually became Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. For a year they lived together, and then Therapont left and moved to a location in about a dozen kilometers to the northeast now known as Ferapontovo. 1398 is considered as the year when the Ferapontov Monastery was founded. At the beginning, there were not more than 15 monks living in the monastery. Ferapont refused to become a hegumen, but lived for ten years at the monastery. The monastery was located in the Principality of Beloozero, which at the time was administered jointly with the Principality of Mozhaysk. The prince, Andrey of Mozhaysk, resided in Mozhaysk, and was a brother of Vasily, the Grand Prince of Moscow. He was also one of the main sponsors of the monastery. In 1408, he sent a letter to Therapont urging him to come to Mozhaysk, and Therapont was obliged to obey. Even though Therapont, after arriving to Mozhaysk, expressed very clearly his wish to return to White Lake, the prince never let him go. They made a deal, and Therapont founded Luzhetsky Monastery in Mozhaysk. He died in the monastery in 1426. Therapont has been venerated as a saint since 1549.

Dictionary of Arabic and allied loanwords: Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan. Brill Academic Publishers, p. 344. . (, also the variety Xulepe and Gilen.),Arias, Garcia (2006). p. 224. is a gambling card game of Spanish origin, similar to the English five-card Loo, and best for six players. It spread rapidly across the Spanish-American countries during the 19th century. Julepe is a variant of Tute and one of the many games of the tute family, and the game is played according to the same rules of tute. It is noted that the original Julepe, in which game three cards are dealt to each player, is the card game presently known as Tomate. Five cards are dealt to each player from a 40-card pack lacking 8s, 9s, and 10s. The next card is turned up for trumps. Players may pass or play. Those who play must win at least two tricks,Parlett, David (1996). Oxford Dictionary of card Games, Oxford University Press, pg. 138. but may first discard and draw any number of replacements.  Objective  To win a game, a player should have the highest value trump card at play, non- trump card, or the highest card of the suit played by the first player. At least two tricks should be gained in game in order to gain chips toward your pot . If the opponent makes less than one, the chips wagered by this player will be subtracted from his pot. Most importantly, the name of the game is to hacer julepe or \\"Make the whist,\\" i.e. winning at least two tricks during the game, as is the bare minimum.  Playing the game  In each game, each player should play a card, and the one who plays the highest one wins the round and the wagers from that first round, keeping in mind: a) if the first player to play a card has the Ace of the trump suit, it is recommended that it be played. Otherwise, you should divide the pot, since with this action you force the other players to play a trump card for this round. b) if the first player leads with a card different from the trump suit, the other players are forced to continue playing that suit. If the player is found to have played incorrectly, that player is forced to split the pot, which is also punishable by falling, or, in the instance that the player does not have that suit, a trump card must be played. If the player has neither of the former cards, any card can be played. c) if all the cards are of the same suit, the player with the highest value card wins. d) if the round has begun with a suit different from the trump and a trump card is played subsequently, and the other players after the one who played the trump card are NOT required to play the trump, thus allowing them to play any card. = Dealing = Prior to beginning the game, cards are dealt to each player face-up, one-by-one around the table, until the first Coin suit (palo de Oro) card appears. The player whom receives this card is deemed the first dealer. The order of play is determined by the person to the dealer's RIGHT in the next round. The dealer deals 5 cards and selects the type of game that shall be played, being either a normal wager or a blind wager game. Depending on the type of game selected, the wager should be defined before beginning to deal and the players should place the same bet before receiving his/her cards. Following this, three cards are dealt to each player. = Trump (triumph) = After having dealt, the deck is placed in the middle of the table and the top card is flipped. The suit of this first card is thus considered the Trump suit, or triunfo, and any card of this suit automatically beats any card from another suit, despite its value. If the flipped trump card is an Ace or a Three, the player that deals can take this card, without seeing your cards. This player is called the postre (lit. dessert) of the game. The postre takes the trump with the condition that the dealer win three tricks tres bazos, as opposed to merely hacer julepe. Otherwise, the dealer will fall for not having met this condition at the end of the round. = Normal wager = Now is where the real game begins. The player to the RIGHT of the dealer decides if he passes or plays, and every player afterward follows suit, until the round is over. If the decision to pass or play falls on the dealer, and if no player has selected to play, the dealer deals again and the dealer repeats the round. If only one player decides to play, the Widow is offered, first to the fallen. If the fallen player does not agree, the Widow is offered to the rest of the players, starting with the player RIGHT of the dealer. If no one wants the Widow, the player should play against the dealer. Within those players that decided to play, the first one to the RIGHT of the dealer plays a card first. The next player to his RIGHT plays a card, attempting to beat the previously played card, playing a card of the same suit or, if you have no cards from that suit, a trump card. The player that wins the first hand has thus won a trick, and three hands are to be played this way. (One card=One hand) If a player that chose to play did not win, did not meet the his bid, or the Widow, or chooses to divide the pot, this player falls. = Blind wager = The dealer deals three cards face-down to each player and each player is forced to play this round. The player RIGHT of the dealer starts the round, placing his card on the table. According to who wins this hand, that player begins the next round. The game is played like this until the whole game is played through. All the players whom did not win are considered fallen. = Widow = When only one player elects to play (while all other players have elected to pass), the Widow is offered to the other players, which are required to meet the amount of Widows they bid. (A Widow=Three Cards=Three Hands) = Fall = It is when a player did not meet the bid made previously, with a Widow, or did not win any hands. This player must place an amount equal to the total amount of wagers made in that round into the collective wager pot. (Example: If three players played and bid 3 chips, the fallen places 9 chips into the pot) All the fallen must place this quantity of chips into the pot, absolving the other players from betting. = Dividing the pot = You divide the pot when you do not play according to the rules and hence distribute the collected wager pot between the winners. = Force = Condition that forces you to play a card, as long as it is the same as the card thrown initially or not having to play a same-suit card if a trump suit is played before you. The dealer is always allowed to force, forcing other players to play a face card (jack, horse, or king). The face card is taken and another card is discarded. The one who has forced, is forced himself to win at least 2 tricks.

In his capacity, Haddad is a qualified religious cleric, Imam and jurist who is entitled as the country's most senior Islamic scholar. He serves as the head of Dubai's fatwa department and is primarily responsible for the regulation, edicts, and issuing all decisions concerning Islamic law and order in the emirate. In 2009, Haddad declared that women reserved the authority under Islamic law to hand out and pass fatwas. According to him, \\"Women who have sufficient knowledge of Islamic teachings can become mufti and issue fatwas.\\" He further went on to say that becoming a mufti always depended on knowledge, not gender and cited in support a Quranic verse which urged those with knowledge of the law to share it. The ruling was generally in agreement with most Sunni sources and came as a response to questions raised about the validity of women as clerics. Haddad was under attention later in 2010 when he gave out a controversial statement regarding mixed marriages in the country. According to statistical figures, the number of Emiratis (UAE nationals) marrying foreigners has risen by 10 percent in just four years. Officials blame the rising cost of dowries and wedding ceremonies as the prime reason that persuades local men to seek foreign wives, who cost much less to marry; the price of marrying native brides has risen to more than $500,000. The concept of mixed marriages is viewed by some as a risk for the demographics of the country's small and undersized local population which numbers below 1 million. Foreigners outnumber locals in Dubai by about nine to one and inter- ethnic marriages have grown accordingly; according to the Dubai Statistics Centre, almost one in three marriages in 2010 were conducted with foreign partners. In response to the changing patterns, Haddad called for a curb on marriages between locals and foreigners saying that while choosing a partner in Islam was a personal freedom, those freedoms could be \\"restricted for the benefit of the public interest.\\" The proposals were not welcomed by some and highly criticised, especially given that a number of the country's royals had foreign wives.

It was written by Chip Johannessen, the show's former executive producer and showrunner, and directed by Steve Shill. It originally aired on September 26, 2010. It brings the final resolution to the Trinity Killer plot that was present in season four and also features the last performance by Julie Benz as Rita. Plot Immediately after discovering his wife Rita murdered in their bathtub, a victim of the Trinity Killer, Dexter Morgan sits on his front lawn in a state of shock, while holding his infant son Harrison in his arms. The police along with Debra arrives at the house, but Dexter barely registers it, and only responds by whispering \\"It was me\\", as he blames himself for not killing Arthur Mitchell when he first had the chance, but this comment attracts the suspicion of the FBI, who have also arrived at the scene. Seeing as the murder is the work of the Trinity Killer, LaGuerta announces that Miami Metro must hand over the case to the FBI, much to the resentment of most of the department, who feel that Rita's death has hit them close to home. Meanwhile, Dexter manages to regain his senses enough to notice that the spirit of Harry has failed to appear and give him advice. At the same time Quinn catches a glimpse of the neighbor, Elliot, in tears over the murder, and finds it puzzling compared to Dexter's relative lack of response. Faced with the arrangements for Rita's funeral, and having to talk with the FBI and telling the bad news to Rita's children, Dexter walks around in an absent-minded state, while he reminisces about the first time he met Rita, leaving it to Debra to make all the arrangements. While she cleans the site of the murder together with Quinn, the emotional pressure gets to her, and breaking down in front of him, the two end up having sex. Meanwhile, Dexter breaks it to Astor and Cody, who have arrived home from a trip to Disney World with their grandparents, that Rita has been killed. Astor takes it the hardest of the two, and angrily accuses Dexter of failing to protect Rita and tells him \\"We are better off without you!\\" Meanwhile, Quinn, about to leave Dexter's house with Debra, talks to Elliot, and finds out about Dexter punching him for kissing Rita. He tries to tell this to LaGuerta, but she reprimands him, both for interfering with a FBI investigation and for suspecting Dexter. Dexter, taking Astor's words to heart, decides to abandon the city, leaving Harrison in the care of Debra, and skipping out on his FBI interview and Rita's funeral. But as he sails out from the bay, he runs out of gas, and stops at a refuelling station. Being alone at the station with Rankin, an unpleasant, loud-mouthed customer who insults him, Dexter follows him to the bathroom, and kills him in a fit of rage. Harry's spirit appears before Dexter again, surprised by his sudden outburst of raw human emotion and tells him that it is okay to let his feelings out, which leads Dexter to break down in a primal scream. He realizes that he genuinely loved Rita, and returns to Miami to appear at her funeral, giving her a heartfelt eulogy before she is put to rest. Reception On its original broadcast, \\"My Bad\\" attracted 1.77 million American viewers, up 16% from the season four premiere. A second broadcast at 11:00 p.m. garnered an additional 575,000 viewers, bringing the night's total to 2.34 million, making the episode the highest rated Showtime series premiere in 15 years and the most watched premiere in the show's history. The fifth-season premiere ranks as the top telecast for the network in 2010. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- grade, stating \\"There's no real sense of where Dexter goes from here - unlike in the other seasons, the show doesn't introduce a major new arc or villain (outside of the FBI's obvious interest in the statement, \\"It was me\\") - but as a season premiere, this works fantastically. Dealing with a character's death, particularly when that character had worn out his or her welcome, can be a tricky proposition for a long-running show, but Dexter finds a way to do it that suggests the darkness just over the horizon and that there will be no redemption for this man. For as goofy as the show can play him, it hasn't forgotten that he's a force of pure destruction, and that's a relief\\".

The second part is a pas de deux originated by Soto and Wendy Whelan, which Wheeldon said it was a \\"love letter, this poem to both of them as artists.\\" The music, P√§rt's Spiegel im Spiegel, was sent to Wheeldon by a friend after he said he was \\"stressed out.\\" According to Wheeldon, the pas de deux was created within three rehearsals. The female dancer wears flat shoes instead of pointe shoes, which Whelan was initially \\"miffed and confused\\" about as she had never been off pointe in any New York City Ballet performance, and she later recalled thinking Wheeldon was making her \\"walk like an old lady\\", but later realized \\"exactly the opposite of that. It has so many images that are meaningful to me. It's so simple, and yet there's so much love in it.\\" Wheeldon encourages dancers to interpret the pas de deux in their own ways, and said the worst thing dancers could do is to \\"act\\" it. The pas de deux has since been danced by companies such as Joffrey Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, The Australian Ballet and The Royal Ballet. In 2014, Whelan danced the pas de deux at her final performance with the New York City Ballet. The Royal Ballet performed the entirety of After the Rain for the first time in 2016.

Coat of Arms of Ventimiglia di Geraci. Two centuries of successions The 6th Marquis, Giovanni II Ventimiglia y Moncada, was the son of Simone I Ventimiglia, 5th Marquis of Geraci, (1485‚Äì1544), who had married Isabella Moncada, from the Counts of Aderno He was, since 1527, the husband of powerful Spanish- Sicilian noble woman Isabel de Moncada y La Grua, niece of Hugo of Moncada, (Viceroy of Sicily and Viceroy of Naples), and daughter of Hugo's brother, Juan de Moncada y de Tol√ßa, 3rd Count of Marmilia and 1st Count of Aitona. The Aragonese Crown Marquisate of Geraci The title of Marquis of Geraci was awarded in 1436 to the 7th Count of Geraci, Giovanni I Ventimiglia, 1st Marquis of Geraci, by the Aragonese Crown, ruling in Sicily since the Sicilian Vespers, 1282. Date in which they were called to push out the French Angevin rulers, imposed after 1266 by the Roman Catholic Pope capricious favors, on the Sicilian people, a former Norman descendants kingdom since about 1130. Giovanni I Ventimiglia (1383‚Äì1475), eighth count of Geraci (from 1405); Marquess of Geraci from 1436; also Lord of Castelbuono, Tusa, Gangi, San Mauro (San Mauro Castelverde), Pollina, Caronia (from 1412), Cefal√π, Sciacca, Termini Imerese, Count of Montesarchio, Bitonto, Casamassima, Serracapriola, Castellamare di Stabia, Orta Nova and Magliano, Baron of Ciminna..., Grande Ammiraglio del Regno (Grand Admiral of Sicily Kingdom), Vicer√© di Sicilia, (Viceroy of Sicily), 1430‚Äì1432, Governatore del Regno di Napoli (Governor of Naples Kingdom), 1435, Viceroy of Duchy Athens and Neopatria, 1444, Regent of Naples Kingdom, 1460, Captain General of the Church, 1445 and 1455. Giovanni had married twice: (1) Agata d'Aragona dei Baroni di Caccamo, (2) Isabella Ventimiglia dei Signori di Ciminna, with issue. The Aragonese Crown title of 3rd Marquis of Geraci This is a short resume, after the year 1480, year of the death of: 1).- Antonio I Ventimiglia, 2nd Marquis of Geraci, a.k.a. Antonio Ventimiglia y de Aragon, 2nd Marquis since 1475, Grand Admiral and General Captain of Sicily, deceased 1480, who had married in 1444 to Margherita Guilhem de Clermont-Lod√®ve, sister in law of Ferdinand I of Naples and one of the daughters of Tristan de Clermont, the powerful and influential Count of Copertino and Matera. 1.1) and 1.2).-: From 1480 to 1490 the 3rd Marquisate of Geraci was held by a \\"Ventimiglia - Chiaromonte\\" male, namely, Enrico IV Ventimiglia, 3rd Marquis of Geraci, deceased in 1493, a.k.a. Enrico IV Ventimiglia y Chiaromonte. In 1480, while being under the age of 36 by then, he got married with a powerful and with long links with the Aragonese Crown, a \\"Luna\\" family woman, an influential Spanish family in Sicily, going back to the 14th century at least, Eleonora de Luna and with deep dynastic connections with the Aragonese Royalty, since no less than the 14th century. From this marriage, there was as an issue to the title on Filippo Ventimiglia, 4th Marquis of Geraci, a.k.a. Filippo Ventimiglia y Luna, born after 1480, successor to the Marquisate in 1490 as a child, but deceased however in 1497, aged 16 or 17 at the most. Then, it was the turn to be 5th Marquis of Geraci, to his brother Simone I Ventimiglia, 5th Marquis of Geraci, (1485 - 5th Marquis after 1497 as a very young teenager - 1544), a.k.a. Simone Ventimiglia y Luna, deceased 1544, aged around 59. Simone Ventimiglia was President of Sicily Kingdom (1516, 1535, 1541) and Deputato del Regno di Sicilia (Treasurer and Comptroller General of Sicily Kingdom, 1522-1534). Simone I Ventimiglia y Luna (1485‚Äì1544), 5th Marchese di Geraci, married Isabella Moncada, from the Counts of Aderno, and the eldest surviving male son was just Giovanni II Ventimiglia, 6th Marquis of Geraci, deceased 1553, a.k.a. Giovanni II Ventimiglia y Moncada. Therefore, Giovanni II who inherited the title at the death of his father Simone, deceased 1544, and who died in 1553, some 8‚Äì9 years later, depending on his acknowledged date on inheritance to the 6th Marquisate, must have had his succession recognized under the leadership of his natural Lord, king Charles I of Spain, a.k.a. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, having issue with another \\"Moncada\\" woman, but this time, from Aitona or Aytona, near Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. Giovanni II Ventimiglia was Deputato del Regno di Sicilia (1544-1547).  The Sicilian town of Geraci  The town of Geraci is located in the province of Palermo, Sicily, Italy. The (Ventimiglia - La Grua - Moncada) families Let us explain first the family relations between the Spanish \\"Moncada\\" political leaders in the kingdoms of Naples and in Sicily at the early 16th century and the important Sicilian- Calabrese family associated to the House of Ventimiglia, interconnecting with the Palermo based \\"La Grua\\" military family: Hugo of Moncada y de Tol√ßa, (1476 - Naval battle at the Gulf of Salerno, Italy, 28 May 1528), Viceroy of Sicily, 1509‚Äì1517, Viceroy of Naples, 1527‚Äì1528, was a young brother of Juan de Moncada y de Tol√ßa, 1st count of Aitona. The family crest of the Aitona Sicilian-Spanish Marquisses, known as \\"Moncada\\"¬¥s with the Marquisate Crown, promoted to Counts in the region of Catalunya, Lleida, in 1532 by King Charles I of Spain, a.k.a. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, later promoted to the Marquisate of Aitona by king Philip II of Spain in October 1581, awarded to the 2nd count of Aitona, Francisco de Moncada y de Cardona, deceased 1594 . Benedictine monk Maurolico, as his father, and also as was later on Genius of Science Isaac Newton in England, was the head of the Messina mint and for a time was in charge of maintaining the fortifications of the city on behalf of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He tutored the two sons of king Charles' bureaucrat, viceroy of Sicily, 1547 - 1557, Juan de Vega, and had the patronage of many rich and powerful men. He also corresponded with scholars such as Clavius and Federico Commandino. Between 1548 and 1550, Maurolico stayed at the castle of Pollina in Sicily as a guest of the marquis Giovanni II Ventimiglia, 6th Marquis of Geraci, and utilized the castle tower in order to carry out astronomical observations. Maurolico's astronomical observations include a sighting of the supernova that appeared in Cassiopeia in 1572. Tycho Brahe published details of his observations in 1574; the supernova is now known as Tycho's Supernova. In 1569, he was appointed professor at the University of Messina The title of Count of Aitona was modified to Marquisate by king Philip II of Spain on 1 October 1581 on behalf of Francisco de Moncada y de Cardona, Count of Ossona, Viscount of Cabrera, Viscount of Bas, Viceroy of Catalonia, 1580‚Äì1581, deceased 1594. Giovanni II Ventimiglia, son in law of Juan de Moncada y de Tol√ßa, 1st count of Aitona, in 1532, deceased after 1536, brother in law of Francisco de Moncada y de Cardona, deceased 1594, was a keen supporter of the mathematical sciences, besides being twice also Viceroy of Sicily, 1595‚Äì1598 and 1606‚Äì1607.

Such raised silt and clay-filled beds are ideal for settlement in the less firm peat of The Fens. Many writers have followed the archaeologist Major Gordon Fowler's preference for the word roddon to define such structures though modern researchers suggest the word rodham is the more correct local word. Oak preserved in peat through which roddons passed has been dated to around 4000 years before present (BP). The origin of the raised nature of a roddon is debated; some writers suggest this is due to a silt build-up during marine incursion. Another explanation (and the one most favoured today) is based on the greater shrinkage of peat, compared to that of silt. This theory suggests that the surrounding peat lands have subsided more than the silt- filled banks of the roddon, leaving the banks raised above the general level of the area. Etymology The term roddon may be a corruption of the now rare rodham, which meant \\"near a river where osiers grow\\", with particular reference to the River Thames; an osier is a willow used in basket-making. Archaeologist Bob Silvester suggests that the term roddon is more popular among local writers such as Fowler (1932), Darby (1940), Phillips (1970), and Harry Godwin (1978), though rodham is acknowledged by Godwin. Silvester notes that Astbury (1958) and e.g. Seale (1975) Soil survey of Cambridgeshire preferred the term rodham. Roddam is used by Egar (1897) and also by Skertchly (1877); in Skertchly's case, as a local term \\"used only in the Isle of Ely\\". The Oxford English Dictionary quotes an even earlier written source of roddam as Wright (1857). Toponymist Richard Coates (2005) agrees that whilst roddon is now the normal geographical term, the older form, -(h)am, rejected by Fowler, was in fact the correct local term, and writers who followed Fowler are wrong. Astbury goes further, quoting Clarke (1852) discussing \\"veins of silt\\" as silted-up creeks, which Astbury claims are rodhams, though Clarke does not use that term. Journalist A K Astbury (1987) also examines the word roddin, which means a rough path or a track trodden by sheep. He says that in north Lincolnshire, a roading is a private and little-used road. Astbury agrees that later writers have adopted Fowler's spelling though he still maintains that fenmen call such silted-up old river beds rodhams. None of the different spelling variations of roddon is found in Robert Forby's The Vocabulary of East Anglia. Formation BP) Carbon dating of bog oak found in the Fen Edge peat of Adventurers Fen near Wicken, almost from the nearest present-day coast at Kings Lynn, suggests the peat in this area was formed by a large marine incursion in about 2400 BC. The Nordelph peat, which covers a large area of fenland, including most of the Ely district, began forming around 4000 BP. Sampling of roddons in the area has confirmed that they were formed from the mid- to late-Holocene age -- 6000-2000 BP. The raised and layered banks of silt in a roddon contain mostly estuarine foraminifera and ostracods, which suggests that the silt was deposited through tidal processes. The raised nature of the roddon is debated. The archaeologist Major Gordon Fowler explained these are due to the extensive drainage of the fens, and \\"differential shrinkage\\" of the silt bed and the surrounding peat. Harry Godwin noted that near the Holme Fen post the peat surface stood above ordnance datum (OD) in 1848 with the clay of the fen floor about below OD. In 1957 Godwin reported the peat surface at the same post below OD -- a shrinkage of in 109 years. The peat is now below OD in the area. The cause of the shrinking is due to a combination of drying out, trench cutting for peat-fuel, biological oxidation and surface burning associated with arable farming. Godwin suggests that roddons were formed in the Romano-British age (AD 43‚Äì500) during a second and less severe marine incursion, which left extensive silt deposits on the seaward parts of the fens and \\"silt deposition up the main rivers\\", forming raised banks or levees. Dinah Smith agrees with Fowler, suggesting that the raised nature of the silt banks are due to the \\"subsidence\\" of the surrounding area, mainly caused by human activity, such as agriculture and drainage. These have permanently changed the environment, and future marine incursions may not have the same effects as historical ones. Settlements In recounting the building practices of the local area, Astbury notes that major structures such as the monasteries at Ely, Thorney and Crowland were built on islands or ridges. These structures rest on Cretaceous Lower Greensand that overlie Jurassic period Kimmeridge on top of Jurassic period Ampthill clays. For example, the village of Little Thetford, south of Ely, lies at about above sea-level, and sits largely on an island of Kimmeridge Clay, a Jurassic shallow-water shelf-sea deposit. Underlying the Kimmeridge Clay are older Jurassic clays, which also contain thin beds of limestone and sandstone. Buildings can and have been erected on peat although it is a poor founding material. Older houses, in the area of Burnt Fen near Littleport, Cambridgeshire, were built on peat whilst more modern buildings in the same area are built on concrete raft foundations floating on the peat. In contrast, Benwick, north-west of Ely, is an example of a settlement built on a roddon of the old West Water. \\"Once described as the 'only village on the peat, Benwick's High Street is built on a roddon. The roddon that was the course of the River Great Ouse forms a base for the very small hamlet of Prickwillow, north-east of Ely. Wisbech St Mary, a small village west of Wisbech is built on a roddon. Spaindelf Farm is built on the dried out bed of the Little Ouse. A roddon noted by Fowler in 1932 at Rodham Farm, north-east of March, Cambridgeshire was exposed in a pit just east of the farm cottage. At that time, this roddon was above the nearby peat and was wide on its curved surface. It was once thought to be an ancient gravel track. Piles need to be used on the sides of dykes that cut through large roddons to prevent the silt of the roddon collapsing into the dyke.

History Henry Montague arrived in Kalamazoo in the 1830s from Massachusetts, and was closely involved with the abolitionist movement. He was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1854, and advocated that the state Insane Asylum be located in Kalamazoo. He was ultimately successful, and when the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital opened in 1859, Montague served as its first steward, a post he held until 1884. In 1861, Montague built this \\"simple but spacious brick home\\" on land he had purchased adjacent to the Asylum. During his time here, Montague entertained friends in the abolitionist movement, including Sojourner Truth. Montague lived in the house until his death In 1909. After that time, the house served as the residence of various state hospital officials. Description The Montague House is a two-story brick structure with a broad, symmetrical facade, including a projecting, veranda-fronted central section. It has square-head windows and a simply detailed transom-and-sidelight entrance, giving the house a Greek Revival look.

Constructed and opened in 1994, the recycling facility and museum was constructed for a cost of $5 million and funded through a group of 19 local municipalities, collectively known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee. The museum was operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority which focused on empowering visitors with knowledge about waste management and allowed visitors to watch the sorting process of recyclables. The most iconic exhibit was Trash-o-saurus, a dinosaur sculpture made of garbage. Funding for the museum dropped in 2009 due to expiring contracts, but remained open until 2011. The closure of the museum followed a failed fundraising campaign. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved a measure to fund the museum by allowing the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority.  Operation  The recycling facility and museum was constructed for a cost of $5 million and opened in 1993. Funding for the museum was provided through a group of 19 local municipalities, known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee, which transported recyclables to the facility for processing. The museum was part of an active recycling operation that allows visitors to follow the recyclable materials through the sorting processes to the crushing and baling process before they are shipped to processors to be recycled into new products. The museum was overseen and operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority.  Exhibits  The museum's goal was to empower its visitors to make good choices and be knowledgeable about waste management in the midst of a \\"waste crisis\\". The center director of the museum, Valerie Knight-Di-Gangi said, \\"We've created exhibits that encourage children to explore serious environmental issues, and do so in a fun way to have lasting impact and empower them to take responsibility for the environment.\\" The museum was operated by the Southwest Connecticut Regional Recycling Operating Committee which staffed the museum with \\"educational specialists who design[ed] and conduct[ed] the educational programs\\". The Garbage Museum was an operating recycling facility and featured a viewing area for the operation which processes around 60,000 tons of recyclables from 20 local towns. Educational exhibits focused on the benefits of recycling drink cans and mining bauxite, the main source of aluminum, and reducing air pollution and water pollution. Another exhibit features a walk-through tunnel depicting a compost pile. Interactive exhibits included a general store and a \\"Trash Bash\\" activity in which \\"imprison[ed] helmet-wearing contestants ... answer questions. If the answer is wrong, others are given the green light to dump trash on them from an overhead opening.\\" There were also art exhibits made from recyclable material including a \\"life-size mannequin made from crushed and colored milk containers strung together with pipe cleaners\\". In 2004, a new exhibit showcasing the trash-to-energy process was created by Mike Blasavage as part of a project funded by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. The exhibit follows trash, represented as marbles, being transferred from bins to toy trucks, the trucks transfers the trash to the energy plant that generates energy to open and close a drawbridge. A popular and unique exhibit was Trash-o-saurus, a tall and long dinosaur made out of junk that was prominently on display in the Garbage Museum. The one-ton sculpture was created by Leo Sewell of Pennsylvania and made of \\"no parking\\" signs, cell phones, license plates, and other materials. The sculpture represents the average amount of garbage and recyclables that a person in Connecticut discards each year. The exhibit was focused on the importance of recycling and had an interactive checklist of items to find the comprise the sculpture. In April 2011, the museum celebrated the 16th birthday of the Trash-o-saurus with a birthday party.  Closure  In 2009, the fate of the Garbage Museum became uncertain due to financial problems when the recycling plant's contracts expired on June 30 and the commodity prices dropped due to the economic recession. The museum began fundraising efforts and started collecting $2 for entrance fees in September 2008. The United States Internal Revenue Service also ruled that museum donations could be tax-deductible increasing opportunities for fundraising. The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority also applied for federal funding as a \\"shovel ready\\" project to upgrade and automate the recycling center's operations. In 2009, Nonnenmacher stated that the museum's operational costs were between $200,000 and $250,000 per year. Interest in the museum also came from a group of East Haven High School students who produced a short documentary video about the Garbage Museum which won a state award and attracted some international interest. Prior to its close in 2011, the operating budget was $341,000, which funded staffing, educational programs, and the museum's heating and lighting. In July 2011, Milford's Board of Aldermen approved allocating $26,000 via a $0.75 tax per ton of municipal solid waste, then representing the latest addition to a $100,000 fundraising drive. On August 25, 2011, the museum was closed after the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority Board of Directors voted to close the Garbage Museum immediately. In 2013, Connecticut State Senator Kevin C. Kelly introduced legislation to reopen the museum, but the amendment failed to garner support. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved a measure to fund the museum by allowing the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority via funding of the Municipal Tipping Fee Fund.

Located at the intersection of W. 5th Street and S. Broadway, the Metropolitan Building replaced a two-story, Romanesque Revival style building with storefronts on S. Broadway and W. 5th Street. This building was called the Mueller Building for its owner, Michail Mueller. The date of the building's construction is not known, nor has any additional information about it been located. Michail Mueller's will was probated in Los Angeles on July 7, 1894. In this document, Mueller left the subject property, with its existing building, to his daughter-in-law, Nettie Mueller, his granddaughter, Clara E. Mueller, and his two grandsons, Charles C. Mueller and Earl Mueller. According to the chain of title for the subject property, the Muellers and their descendants would retain ownership until the mid-1980s. In May 1913, the Metropolitan Fireproof Building Company was granted a City of Los Angeles building permit for the subject property to \\"remove present buildings for the purpose of erecting a new building\\".Building permit 7077, issued to Metropolitan Fireproof Building Company, May 22, 1913. On the permit, the architects for the project are identified as Parkinson and Bergstrom, while the contractor is listed as F.O. Engstrom. The purpose of the new building was for stores and offices. Although the members of the company listed on the permit are not known, it is assumed that they consisted of the four Mueller relatives identified above. In June 1913, the Metropolitan Fireproof Building Co, was granted a permit to \\"erect the foundation of a building to cover the entire lot... building will be 10 stories\\".Building permit 7894, issued to Metropolitan Fireproof Building Company, June 9, 1913. Although the Muellers retained ownership of the property, they appear to have granted lease interest of the building to various persons or businesses over the years. These arrangements may have been entered into to facilitate mortgages or they may simply have reflected the fact that the Muellers preferred to let others manage the property. According to the limited information that has been located, none of the Muellers were actively involved in real estate management or development. The Metropolitan Building contributes to the significance of the historic district under criterion C, possessing high artistic value for its use of the Beaux Arts style in a district that contains some of the ‚Äúbest examples of commercial... architecture in Southern California\\".Sitton, Statement of Significance. The building is also significant for its association with noted, local architects, John Parkinson (1861‚Äì1945) and Edwin Bergstrom (1876‚Äì1955), who were in professional partnership together from 1905 to 1915.  Architects  = John Parkinson = John Parkinson, one of the most important architects practicing in Los Angeles during the early twentieth century, opened his first architectural practice in the city in 1894. By 1896, he had designed the city's first Class \\"A\\" fireproof, steel-frame building, the Homer Laughlin Building. His design for the 14-story Braly Block/Continental Building (1904) was the first skyscraper built in Los Angeles. It was the tallest building in downtown until completion of Los Angeles City Hall (with John C. Austin and A.C. Martin) in 1928. After Edwin Bergstrom left the partnership in 1915, Parkinson practiced on his own for several years. In 1920, Parkinson was joined in practice by his son, Donald B. Parkinson (1895‚Äì1945). The firm of Parkinson & Parkinson, Architects, is credited with having \\"designed many of Los Angeles' finest buildings, which became some of the city's most enduring landmarks\\".Elsie and Henry F. Withy, Biographical Dictionary of American Architects (Deceased) (Los Angeles: New Age Publications, 1956), 457. Among their best-known works: the original campus of the University of Southern California (1919‚Äì39), Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (1923 and 1931), Los Angeles City Hall (1928, with Albert C, Martin and John C. Austin), Bullocks Wilshire (1929) and Union Station (1939). Along with earlier Parkinson projects, these buildings helped to define the distinctive urban landscape of Los Angeles and southern California. In The City That John Built, John Parkinson's design talent is described: \\"...a Parkinson building is substantial, and what elevated him from being a mere copier was his remarkable ability to adapt a style to a new function and in so doing create something that was uniquely American\\".Linda Arntzerius ‚ÄúThe City that John Built‚Äù USC Trojan Family. Autumn 1994, 28. = Edwin Bergstrom = Edwin Bergstrom studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Yale University. He began his architectural practice in New York City in 1899 and then moved to Los Angeles in 1903.USGENWEB project, Biographies - Greater Los Angeles and Southern California Portraits and Personal Memoranda: Bergstrom, George Edwin. http://www.cagenweb,com/re/losangeles/Biographies/biosB.html Bergstrom accessed March 8, 2005; ‚ÄúServices for Architect Bergstrom Conducted,‚Äù .Los Angeles Times, June 21, 1955, A:2 Obituaries, ‚ÄúGeorge Bergstrom, Architect on Coast,‚Äù New York Times, June 21, 1955, 31:2. He partnered with John Parkinson soon after arriving in Los Angeles. After leaving the partnership with Parkinson, Bergstrom oversaw a successful solo practice. In the 1920s and 1930s, Bergstrom was associated with the Pasadena architectural firm of Bennett and Haskell. He won a design competition in 1923 to design the City of Pasadena Civic Auditorium, which anchors the south end of the city's civic center.David Gebhard and Robert Winter, An Architectural Guidebook to Los Angeles (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003, revised edition), 381. In the late 1920s, Bergstrom was one of five prominent Los Angeles architects, organized as the Allied Architects of Los Angeles, involved in designing the Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center General Hospital (1933), an architectural monument in East Los Angeles. Bergstrom was commissioned as the chief consulting architect for the United States War Department in 1941. In this capacity, he served as the chief architect for the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. (1941‚Äì43). Bergstrom was also actively involved in the American Institute of Architects (AIA), serving as the national organization's treasurer for over 40 years and as president in 1939 and 1940. During their partnership, Parkinson & Bergstrom became the dominant architectural firm hired to design major buildings in Los Angeles. This prominent partnership designed over 25 buildings in the 10 years of their collaboration, with the majority located in the city's burgeoning downtown. Besides the Metropolitan Building, there are four other Parkinson & Bergstrom buildings located within the boundaries of the Broadway Commercial and Entertainment Historic District.These buildings include: Trustee Building (1905), 340 S, Broadway, Yorkshire Hotel (1909), 710-14 S. Broadway; Bullock's (1912), 641 S. Broadway; Broadway Mart Center (1914), 401-23 S. Broadway. As is evidenced in the Metropolitan Building, Parkinson & Bergstrom commercial buildings typically reflect influences of the Beaux Arts or Classical Revival styles popular at the turn of the century with exterior use of glazed terra cotta, decorative spandrel panels, low relief sculptural ornamentation, and large projecting cornices. As designed by Parkinson & Bergstrom, the Metropolitan Building was a dignified building with handsomely appointed public spaces and multiple retail storefronts. Despite exterior alterations to the storefronts and main entrance, the building retains sufficient integrity of design, material and workmanship, to maintain significance under criterion C.  Overview  The terrazzo floor bearing the five and dime J.J. Newberry company name marks the site of the store's former location on the ground level of the Metropolitan Building. The Metropolitan Building also contributes to the significance of the historic district under criterion A for its association with commercial and retail development that occurred on Broadway between 1890 and 1930. With this development, Broadway became the \\"commercial center of the Southland\\", a title it retained until well after World War II. Like many of its neighbors, the Metropolitan Building was built to provide street-level retail storefronts for multiple businesses with the upper levels left as simple, open lofts to allow maximum flexibility for prospective tenants as well as space for storage or warehousing. The main entrance and elevator lobby serving the upper floors was elegantly professional with marble floors and walls and decorative elevator doors (these finishes are noted in original building plans). On the upper levels, the elevator lobby and corridors had simpler decorative treatments. The overall design of the building provided prospective tenants with well-appointed, but understated, and flexible, office space in an ideal location within the center of the booming downtown. Historic photographs and Los Angeles City Directories indicate that tenants within the building included (dates of tenancy are in parenthesis); The Owl Drug Co., a San Francisco-based drug store chain (1914‚Äì1934), Los Angeles Public Library (1913‚Äì1926), Foreman & Clark, a budget-oriented men's clothier (c. 1915‚Äì1928), Janss Investment Co., a prominent real estate development company (1916‚Äì1928), J.J. Newberry Co., a Southern California-based variety store chain (1939 to mid-1990s), and Fallas-Paredes, a Los Angeles-based discount clothing chain (1996‚Äìpresent). Additional tenants have included dental and medical offices, jewelers, and a street-level cafe. On the ground level, long, narrow storefronts were constructed with the most prominent, and largest, at the southwest corner of the building. This space appears to have only had three tenants over the course of the building's history. These retail tenants have been The Owl Drug Company, J. J. Newberry Co., C. H. Baker and Fallas Paredes. These retail tenants also appear to have leased office or storage space in the upper floors of the building. In the early years, the most prominent tenant was the Los Angeles Public Library, which occupied the seventh through tenth floors. To entice the Library to relocate to the building, the Metropolitan Building Co., and its architects, Parkinson & Bergstrom, submitted a proposal to the Library Board in 1913. In this initial proposal, the architectural plans showed a \\"complete ninth floor, no skylights in the roof, and no tenth floor\\".Library Books,\\" Monthly Bulletin of the Los Angeles Public Library, May and June, 1914, Vol. 9, Nos. S and 6, 67. After several months of negotiation, changes to the plans were made, which included: Detail from Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, 1906. Floor plans for the eighth and ninth floors, depicting the changes noted, were printed in the Library's monthly bulletin, \\"Library Books\\" in 1914. Shortly after moving into its new quarters, an article praising the new Library was published in the Los Angeles Times. The article notes that in moving to the Metropolitan Building, the Library enjoyed the following benefits: Several photographs depicting the well-appointed spaces of the new library accompanied the article. On the exterior, a bladesign reading, \\"PUBLIC LIBRARY,\\" was erected on the upper stories of the southwest comer of the building. The Library continued to occupy its space within the Metropolitan Building until 1926 when it moved to its permanent building at 630 W. 5th Street. After the Library vacated the building, the seventh floor was subdivided to accommodate new tenants, the stairs between the eighth and ninth floors were removed, and the opening between floors was infilled.Information about these alterations is located in various City of Los Angeles building permits. In 1939, Newberry‚Äôs entered into a lease with the Metropolitan Building Co. for that \\"certain portion of the ground floor of [the] Metropolitan Building (new sales space) being the portion of the ground floor that adjoins the building lobby ... extending the full depth of the ground floor\\" as well as the \\"basement ... being [the] portion of the floor approximately equivalent in space to and lies below the above described ground floor premises\\". With this description it appears that the multiple retail spaces originally installed in the ground level (such as Newberry‚Äôs and the C. H. Baker shoe store) had been combined to form one, large Newberry‚Äôs store in 1939. Although specific building permit records have not been located, it appears that during its approximately 50 year tenancy, Newberry‚Äôs installed various improvements/alterations with significant alterations that appear to be circa 1950 and circa 1990. The circa 1950 alterations include the installation of terrazzo flooring, installation of corner entrance and exterior canopy, and installation of the structural glass spandrel panel. A number of these alterations are visible in photographs from the 1960s and 1970s. These photographs also indicate that the neighboring building at 445 S. Broadway was also part of the Newberry's store. In a 1952 building permit, the owners of 445 S. Broadway were granted permission to \\"construct ramp and steps into Metropolitan building\\".Building permit 19280, issued to Cline Building Co., June 27, 1952 This record may mark the date that the neighboring building were connected although the openings are also depicted in the circa 1950 Sanborn map noted previously. The circa 1990 alterations may include the addition of the food court space and the opening between the first and second floors. While building permit information indicates that Newberry‚Äôs retained its lease until the mid-1990s l; it is not clear whether the upper stories retained their tenancy. The economic downturn in downtown Los Angeles, as retailers and commercial interests shifted their assets to the booming suburbs, caused many vacancies throughout the 1970s through early 1990s. How the Metropolitan Building fared during this period is not known, however, in 1995, a building permit notes that the building is \\"only occupied on the ground floors\\". In 1985, the last remaining ownership interest in the building held by a Mueller family member was sold. In 1996, the building was transferred to the current owner. At around the same time, the ground floor retail space previously occupied by Newberry‚Äôs was taken by Fallas Paredes clothing store, an affiliate of the property owner. The upper levels are currently being used as storage or warehouse space for the clothing store. The Metropolitan Building has had several prominent commercial and retail tenants in its approximately 100 year history. Although the number and type of these tenants have changed over the years, they have reflected the economic and retail forces that have shaped downtown Los Angeles in the twentieth century. Despite these changes, the Metropolitan Building retains its original use and continues to contribute to the commercial and retail needs of the surrounding neighborhood in a manner that documents the development of commercial growth in downtown Los Angeles.

The poorly performing tri-motor led to an updated design which became the popular Ford Tri-Motor. Development As a friend of the Ford family, Richard Evelyn Byrd visited Dearborn in 1925 with the polar exploration aircraft. The wood and steel tube Fokker F.VIIA-3m named the \\"Josephine Ford\\" and owned by Henry Ford's son Edsel (and named for Edsel's daughter). The airplane was received as a gift from his father after being placed first in the 1925 Ford Reliability Tour, and lent to Richard E Byrd for his trip to the North Pole, which was sponsored by Ford. This airplane was the prototype for the Fokker F-VIIA-3m and was based at Ford Airfield (now the Ford Test Track in Dearborn, Michigan) and Stout's factory location. Several measurements and photos were taken during its stay. Shortly afterward, partly using the single- engined, all-metal Stout 2-AT Pullman as a starting point, the model 3-AT trimotor was produced using an all-metal construction technique. Many similarities exist between the designs that caused controversy. Also, enough differences in technologies were made between the aircraft that the 3-AT can be seen as a unique design, as well. Design The 3-AT trimotor had a blunt nose, with its central radial engine mounted close to the nose's bottom, and two wing-mounted outboard, uncowled radial engines, projecting forward of the wings' leading edges at the front of each of a pair of nacelles. The aircraft had a large passenger and cargo compartment with semicircular windows and a large, forward-looking glassed-in window section. The pilot sat in an open cockpit mounted high on the nose of the aircraft. The original design featured three Liberty engines, but they were quickly abandoned due to weight issues. Operational history The Model 3-AT trimotor was heavily promoted by Henry Ford as the airplane of the future. Test flights proved otherwise, with the underpowered aircraft barely able to maintain altitude. Test pilot Rudolph William \\"Shorty\\" Schroeder could barely circle the field and refused to take off in the plane again. He advised Ford, \\"Forget the plane.\\" After witnessing the tests, Henry Ford left outraged. Ford told Mayo, \\"This plane is a mechanical monstrosity and an aerodynamic absurdity. From now on keep Stout out of the design room.\\" Shortly afterward, Ford reassigned Stout away from engineering. On January 16, 1926, a fire destroyed the Stout factory and all aircraft in it, including several 2-ATs and the 3-AT prototype. In a 1951 interview, engineer Harold Hicks said that the fire and a fresh start were the best thing that happened to Ford's aviation venture. The 3-AT was impractical with its uncowled engines mounted in the wing roots, disturbing the airflow over the wing, giving it an 80-mph takeoff and landing speed. Tom Towle was placed in charge of engineering, and hired MIT graduate Otto C. Koppen, John Lee, and James Smith McDonnell (co-founder of McDonnell Douglas). Together, they refined the 3-AT into what is now recognizable as the \\"Tin Goose\\", the Ford Trimotor. Variants For the Ford 4AT, the basic 3AT design was used, with the main engines placed in underwing, strut-mounted nacelles, and the cockpit moved internally.

For a long time she was involved in socialist politics. Education and early works Oya Baydar studied at Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul. She published her first novel, inspired by French writer Fran√ßoise Sagan, while she was a student in high school.http://www.literaturfestival.com/archive/participants/authors/2013/oya- baydar?set_language=en The novel she wrote in the last year of high school, God Has Forgot Children, was published both in the newspaper H√ºrriyet and as a book. She was almost expelled from her school as a result of writing this novel. After these novels written in high school years, she had a break from writing, interesting herself in politics for a long time, before returning to literature in later life. Baydar graduated from Istanbul University's Department of Sociology in 1964 and entered this department as an assistant. The Professors' Council of the University twice rejected her doctoral thesis, about the rise of a labour force in Turkey: students occupied the University in order to protest against that. This was the first occupation of a university in Turkey. Baydar then became an assistant in Hacettepe University. Political life During the military coup in 1972 Baydar was arrested due to her socialist activity as a member of the Workers Party of Turkey and the Teachers' Union of Turkey and she left the University. Between 1972 and 1974 she worked as a columnist in the newspapers Yeni Ortam ([New Platform]) and Politika ([Politics]). She issued her first journal together with her husband Aydƒ±n Engin and Yusuf Ziya Bahadƒ±nlƒ±. She was known as a socialist writer, researcher and activist woman. During the 1980 military coup Baydar went abroad and remained in exile in Germany for 12 years, during which the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist when Germany was reunified. She wrote about this period in 1991 in her story book Farewell Alyosha. Later life Oya Baydar returned to Turkey in 1992. She worked as editor for the Istanbul Encyclopedia, a common project of the History Foundation and the Ministry of Culture, and as the editor-in-chief for The Unionism Encyclopedia of Turkey. She has won many awards for the novels and stories she published after returning to Turkey, and has become a well-liked writer.

After a small naval engagement where the running aground of the leading revolutionary vessel gave the royalists a small victory, but suffering numerous casualties, the United Provinces troops took the island by assault forcing Romarate's squadron to retreat. Brown's victory divided the enemy's forces, and secured the United Provinces' control of access to the interior waterways, and made possible their advance on Montevideo. After the decisive victory at the Buceo engagement, they could also blockade the city to the open sea completing the land blockade by the army, causing the city's surrender.  The conflict  On 25 May 1810 the May Revolution in Buenos Aires deposed viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and established a local government known as the Primera Junta. Montevideo, at the eastern side of the R√≠o de La Plata (the Banda Oriental, modern-day Uruguay), did not acknowledge their authority, and recognized instead the Cortes of C√°diz established in Spain. This was resisted in the countryside around Montevideo, and the \\"Cry of Asencio\\" began the armed conflicts in the area. Montevideo was soon surrounded and sieged, by the militias under Jos√© Gervasio Artigas and Buenos Aires forces under Jos√© Rondeau. 300px Even with the city under siege from land, the royalist naval squadron maintained the naval supremacy over the waterways, the R√≠o de la Plata and the Uruguay and Paran√° rivers. The Montevidean squadron under Jacinto de Romarate destroyed the first flotilla from Buenos Aires, which went up the Paran√° River carrying reinforcements to the Paraguay campaign, at the Battle of San Nicol√°s. After that victory, Montevideo's naval forces could then establish a blockade of the port of Buenos Aires, effect a bombardment and avoid the fall of Montevideo. After the failure of the armistice signed on 20 October 1811 between the First Triumvirate and the Viceroy Francisco Javier de El√≠o, on 20 October 1812, a second siege of Montevideo ensued. The tenacity of the defenders and their control of the surrounding rivers, and the lack of means for the attackers to beark this situation kept the front without major changes until 1814. The dissent between the Buenos Aires troops and the local militias of Artigas, did not help the attacker's situation. Even through this some expeditions were organized by the defenders to break out and obtain supplies, yet they failed, among them by the opposition of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n at the battle of San Lorenzo, and whatever little they obtained was not enough to cover Montevideo's needs, who suffered hunger and diseases, especially scurvy. = The second squadron = On 5 November 1813, after the resignation of Jos√© Juli√°n P√©rez, Juan Larrea joined the Second Triumvirate in Buenos Aires, along with Gervasio Antonio de Posadas and Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a. The war situation was dire. General Manuel Belgrano was retreating to La Quiaca in the north, after the defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, Patria Vieja in Chile was being invaded by the forces of the Lima and due to internal conflicts was approaching the Disaster of Rancagua. Montevideo had an army bigger in numbers than the army that encircled them and there was no prospects of surrender as they controlled the access through the rivers and the sea and Artigas was joining a civil war by promoting the defection of the Argentine provinces of Entre R√≠os and Corrientes. Portrait of Juan Larrea, writing a plan to capture the city of Montevideo. Larrea started to consider the formation of a new squadron to force the situation in the eastern front, but it was quickly learned that this was not possible. There were no naval forces in the provinces. They only had one sloop and the port's landing craft. The arsenal only had 30 cannons and carronades of different calibers and almost useless due to age and lack of maintenance, a few rifles and less than 200 quintals of gunpowder. Their warehouses lacked wood, tar, canvas, rope and marine tools. There was no trained personnel nor protocols for the recruiting and instruction of officers, sailors nor Marines. Finally, the treasury only had a thousand pesos, customs resources were minimal due to the blockade and credit was exhausted. Larrea chose to promote an agreement with Guillermo P√≠o White, a wealthy American merchant native of Boston who was sympathetic to the revolutionary cause, who would front the funds necessary to finance the acquisition of vessels and equipment, with a promise of later compensation, tied to the success of the enterprise. On 28 December 1813 anm agreement was signed between the Triumviarte and White. At the beginning of 1814 the executive power was concentrated on the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata. Gervasio Antonio Posadas was named Supreme Director and Juan Larrea was named Economy Minister, which then maintained the agreement with White alive. In only two months, a small squadron was formed and a crew readied, composed mostly by foreigners in officers and men, while the embarked troops were composed of locals. The question of who would be in command generated a strong debate. The principal candidates were the American lieutenant colonel Benjamin Franklin Seaver, commander of the schooner Juliet, who was supported by his compatriot P√≠o White, the corsair Estanislao Courrande, who since 1803 harassed British commerce with corsair raids, and lastly the Irish Guillermo Brown. Command was finally given to Brown, including P√≠o White's vote, in part for his strength of character, (all candidates had the necessary experience), but also because of his charisma over the commanders and sailors, most of them Irish, British or Scots.  Previous encounters  Jacinto de Romarate On 7 July 1813 a group of thirteen revolutionary soldiers under the command of lieutenant Jos√© Caparr√≥s made a surprise and successful incursion in Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island, at the time in royalists hands, and defended by 70 men. The R√≠o de la Plata was difficult to navigate due to the extensive sand banks which reduced navigation to small draft vessels forcing the use of the few existing open channels, subject to frequent changes due to sediment accumulation and the changing winds. Mart√≠n Garc√≠a island, controls the west channel, which due to its relative depth was the obligatory path for any vessel with a draft of no more than 2 or 3 meters, who wanted to reach the interior rivers flowing into the R√≠o de la Plata, such as the Paran√° or the Uruguay rivers, closed to the west by an extensive sand bank. Facing the risk of losing control of the strategic island, and with the objective of gaining a base from which to attack the town of Colonia del Sacramento, occupied by the rebels, at the beginning of 1814 Romarate fortified the island and parked a flotilla of 9 vessels with 18 and 24 pounder artillery pieces. Alarmed by the news of the formation of this new Buenos Aires fleet, it was proposed in Montevideo to attack Buenos Aires before it would become operational, but the speed of its formation thwarted the plan and had to be abandoned. On the revolutionary side, after receiving his commission as commander, lieutenant colonel Brown started his campaign by sailing his small new fleet to Colonia del Sacramento (in today's Uruguay).  The battle  = The opposing forces = The patriot forces had a merchant frigate named H√©rcules (350 tons), the corvette Zephyr, (220 tons), brigantine Nancy (120 tons), schooner Juliet (150 tons), schooner Fortuna (90 tons), landing boat San Luis (15 tons), and sloop Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen (48 tons).Arguindeguy, Pablo E. CL, and Rodr√≠guez, Horacio CL; \\"Buques de la marina Argentina 1810-1852 sus comandos y operaciones\\" The royalist squadron was composed of the brigantines Bel√©n (220 tons), Nuestra Se√±ora de Ar√°nzazu (181 tons), and G√°lvez (90 tons), sloops Americana (60 tons) and Murciana (115 tons), gunboats Perla, Lima, and San Ram√≥n (30 tons), plus four small support vessels. Even though the number of vessels was in parity, the total of guns favored the rebel navy. With 91 cannons, 430 sailors and 234 troops in front of the 36 cannons (2 in a land battery) and 442 men of the royalists, the advantage was supposedly on the revolutionary side. Nonetheless, as a third of the force was concentrated on the lead ship H√©rcules, so the advantage was tied to its performance and luck. = Battle disposition = On the 8th Brown, in front of the town of Colonia with H√©rcules, Fortuna, San Luis and Carmen, saw three royalist brigantines to the northwest. He followed them until dusk, when having verified they were entering the Mart√≠n Garc√≠a channel and going to the island, he turned to Buenos Aires to look for reinforcements. That same day at 8:00 pm the royalist squadron raised anchor at Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, to the west of the island. Romarate formed his ships in an east‚Äìwest line, covering the channel from the anchorage in a semicircle, supported from land by a battery of two cannons and gunfire from the island's troops under midshipman Jos√© Benito de Azcu√©naga.Romarate's notes, in Angel Justiniano Carranza's, Campa√±as Navales de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, Volume III - Notes to Vol 1 and 2, Secretaria de Estado de Marina, 1962. On the 9th at 2:00 pm Brown joined with Zhepyr, Juliet and Nancy, then turned towards Mart√≠n Garc√≠a to meet the enemy. At 5:00pm the rebel squadron anchored on the channel about four leagues to the southwest of the royalists, with the Santa Ana bank to starboard. The 10th in the morning they raised sail on a light southeast wind converging to Romarate through both channels. Brown's plan was attacking through the front and rear of the Spanish. he detached a division composed of Fortuna, Carmen and San Luis to go around the sandbank to the west to have it at its back and the royalists in his front while the principal force attacked the royalists front. H√©rcules was on the left, then Zephyr, Nancy and Juliet on the right. Sketch of the battle of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a = The encounter = The attack was not simultaneous. At 1:30 pm, when the encirclement was not yet complete, Brown's squadron, with Juliet in front opened fire over the royalists which was immediately returned. The Argentine lead ship attempted to advance under fire, but having lost her pilot, she got stuck on a sand bank on the west of the island, under fire and bows-on to the enemy, suffering sustained fire and not being able to return it, directing their broadsides to the land batteries. Brown questioned the way in which the rest of the squadron \\"conducted themselves during the action, even though having sent all the signals and having gone personally on my boat before midnight the night before and requested their support, all of which was in vain\\". Having secured the front, Romarate sent the sloops Americana and Murciana, to the gunboat Perla and the Salvador's launch to confront the revolutionary division deployed on the north channel, which after a light exchange of fire retreated and joined the rest of the squadron. Combat continued until sundown, with H√©rcules taking the worst part.Romarate's Notes, Carranza, cited work Brown (oil by Felipe Goulu, 1825) In this first and most bloodiest first day of the Combate of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, Romarate successfully repelled the enemy's attack. They had 45 dead and 50 wounded and the attacking force's losses were high. Rebel Commanders Benjamin Seaver and Elias Smith, and also the chief of the embarked troops, the French captain Mart√≠n de Jaume, second lieutenant Robert Stacy, midshipman Edward Price, sailors Richard Brook and William Russell and cook Peter Brown were among the casualties. Bernard Campbell, the chief surgeon, had very difficult moments having to treat the wounded with inadequate means. Among the wounded there were valet Tomas Richard and sailors James Stone, Henry Harris, Elsey Miller and Anthony O‚ÄôDonnell.Combate de Mart√≠n Garc√≠a , lagazeta.com.ar At dawn on the 11th, fire recommenced at 8:45am, when finally H√©rcules with her sails and masts destroyed and with 82 impacts on the vessel finally loosened the grip of the sand bar with the tide and with only one sail left, could leave the channel and retreat by the Las Palmas sand bank. At 5:00 pm on that day Romarate sent a note to the commander of the Montevideo garrison Miguel de la Sierra, informing he had few casualties, four dead and seven wounded, he had disembarked on the island and judged that given the losses suffered, as soon as the patriot fleet was in condition it would retreat to Buenos Aires, so he asked his commander for more powder and ammunition in all calibers, and urgent reinforcements to annihilate them before they could seek refuge in port. Awaiting reinforcements Romarate disembarked two cannons under the command of ensign Francisco Paloma to reinforce the land forces. The commander of the land forces, Jos√© Benito de Azcu√©naga, agreed with Romarate: . Nonetheless Romarate had made a bad judgment. On the one side the Spanish squadron under frigate captain Jos√© Primo de Rivera y Ortiz de Pinedo was negligent and had not positioned his fores in case he would be required as defensive reinforcements, be it in the case of defeat, as support or victory, and the measures to be taken after Romarate's order was known were so lax that Romarate never received reinforcements nor supplies. Also in contrast to what Romarate supposed, and showing in his adversary a completely different way of thinking, after the repairs done to H√©rcules and counting only with few reinforcements, 23 Dragoons and 23 marines from the 6th Regiment, with their officers, respectively Dragoon Ensign Gervasio Espinosa and sub-lieutenant Luis Antonio Frutos sent in the schooner HopeJustiniano Carranza, Campa√±as navales de la Rep√∫blica argentina, volume 2, pages 73 and 224. by the Commander of Colonia del Sacramento, Vicente Lima, under first lieutenant of the Buenos Aires Dragoon Regiment Pedro Oron√°, and 17 militias from the town of Las Conchas, Brown resumed the attack. = The assault = Satellite image of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Incapable of confronting the enemy head-on again, the Argentine commander changed his strategy. With the few reinforcements received he had an infantry force superior to the one defending the island. If he could attack by surprise and with sufficient speed before Romarate could disembark his troops and change the balance of forces, it was feasible to conquer the garrison. With a lack of non-commissioned officers they decided to have the commanders meet to plan and coordinate the attack. Lieutenant Oron√° was selected to command and decided to divide his forces in three divisions if 80 men. The first division was put under command of Regiment #2 Lieutenant Manuel Jos√© Balbastro, with his second in command Dragoon Ensign Gervasio Espinosa. The second was put under Regiment #2 lieutenant Manuel Casta√±er and 6th Regiment sub-lieutenant Luis Antonio Frutos, and the third under army lieutenant Jaime Kainey with Grenadiers sub-lieutenant Mariano Antonio Dur√°n. At 8:00 pm on the 14th they anchored silently a half-mile to the southeast near Puerto Viejo and at 02:30 am on the 15th they disembarked 240 men in 20 minutes, using 8 launches. Upon getting near the coast they received fire from a few enemy soldiers hiding in the bush who when fire was returned they scampered to the interior of the island. With the landing secure, Brown took the squadron towards the royalists ships to simulate an attack as a diversion from the principal effort. The advance over land was detected and when climbing a hill overlooking the port they were fired upon by royalist troops. At the moment this attack was seen Brown's fleet started a cannonade from the west over the royalist squadron. The attack, under enemy fire and in the run on a rough and ascending path, briefly stalled. In that critical moment they ordered the drum and bugle to play the Saint Patrick‚Äôs Day in the Morning march. The troops were composed of different nationalities with the majority being Irish, so this known piece, played a few days before Saint Patrick's Day, raised the attackers' morale. The song became the first naval march of Argentina.Ruiz Moreno, Isidoro J. (1998). La Marina Revolucionaria. Planeta, p. 23. Because of this event this song was made the official march of the island and was officially added to the Argentine Navy's repertoire in 1977. The troop's advance was renewed with great strength attacking the fort with bayonets. The Spaniards were overwhelmed and surrendered after about 20 minutes of combat, where lieutenant Jones of the Zhepyr captured the land battery, turned the cannons against the royalist ships and raised the United Provinces flag on the island. The victory was certified much later at the signing of the Treaty of the R√≠o de la Plata and it Maritime Front.lagazeta.com.ar The royalists had 10 dead, 7 wounded and 50 prisoners. The attackers casualties were three soldiers dead and five wounded. The commander of the force lieutenant Pedro Oron√° and sub-lieutenant Pedro Aguilar were lightly wounded.Report from Pedro Oron√°, 18 March 1814, Carranza. Romarate, lacking powder and ammunition had to remain on the side as witness to the enemy victory. The last skirmish was held on the dawn of the 15th when the sloop Carmen under Commander Spiro who had approached to spy in the night, run a few volleys of musket fire towards the enemy. In a terse note, Brown communicated to Government Minister Larrea Only when in front of Montevideo, on 19 April the same year, he would extend on the details of the action and casualties suffered. In that, his definitive combat report, Brown listed some of the casualties in the H√©rcules on the 10th and 11th. From officers and sailors: Captain Elias Smith, Third Lieutenant Robert Stacy, helmsman Antonio Castro, cabin boy Eduardo Price, first class sailors Ricardo Brook and Guillermo Russell, second class Francisco Guevara, Salom√≥n Lyon, Felipe Rico, L√°zaro Molina and Joaqu√≠n Uraqui, and cook Pedro Brown. Troops: Captain Jaime Mart√≠n de Jaume and soldiers Tom√°s Felisa, Jos√© Antonio Balija, Jos√© Herrera, Silvestre Mur√∫a, Juan Olivera, Marcos √Åvila, Jos√© Antonio Tolosa, Jos√© Gonz√°lez.Carranza, √Ångel Justiniano, Campa√±as Navales de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, Volume III, pg 224  Consequences  Not having received the supplies and reinforcements he requested, and knowing of the help promised by Fernando Otorgu√©s, second of Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, who before the imminence of the end of the siege of Montevideo, which they had abandoned at the beginning of the year and confronted Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Romarate took advantage of the winds which have veered from the southeast incrementing the rising tide, to escape by the sand banks, and was forced to hide by the end of the Uruguay River. On the 25th following Larrea's orders, the prisoners were embarked, the houses on the island burned, and the remaining population evacuated. The squadron raised anchor and sailed, arriving on the 26th in Colonia, were the prisoners debarked. Brown, ignoring the orders from his superiors to chase Romarate, only detached a small division after him, supposing that Romarate was lacking powder and ammunition (which was true until the supplies came from Otorgu√©s) and it was enough to assure his isolation; while the bulk of the naval squadron went to what he considered the big prize, the annihilation of the squadron defending Montevideo and taking the city. The Battle of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a was then the beginning of a campaign of 100 days which led by Brown ended Spain's naval power in the R√≠o de la Plata and forced the surrender of their last bastion in Montevideo.

Inaugurated in 1839, this structure was integrated with other Hittorff buildings for the Exposition Universelle (1855) and destroyed the following year. A new replacement panorama, Le Panorama National, was designed by architect Gabriel Davioud at the corner of the Avenue d'Antin (now Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the Champs-√âlys√©es. In December 1893, the rotunda became the Palais de Glace (Ice Palace), one of the most popular attractions of Belle Epoque Paris. In the post-war years, the Theatre du Rond- Point was one of the principal venues‚Äîalong with the Theatre Marigny and the Theatre de l'Odeon‚Äîwhere the Madeleine Renaud-Jean-Louis Barrault Company introduced the world to many of the plays of Jean Giraudoux, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Jean Anouilh, and Samuel Beckett. The theatre was managed by Jean-Louis Barrault from 1958 to 1968, when he was dismissed from the Gare d'Orsay during the student uprising in the spring of that year. The theatre was renovated in 1981. Further renovations in were done in 2002 under the directorship of Jean- Michel Ribes. The theatre is now devoted to the work of living authors.

It is written by theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind. The book was initially published by Little, Brown and Company on December 12, 2005. Background At the time the book was written, it had been noted that the conditions of the Universe are very fine tuned, allowing life. However, at the same time it is unknown why. The Anthropic principle was one solution, but was rejected by many physicists who preferred a more elegant solution. String theory was then created, but allowed too many solutions. Then, in the book, Susskind hypothesized that there are multiverses where there are occasional universes where life is indeed possible. He calls this multiverse the \\"landscape\\". Contents Susskind writes in the preface that the book is mainly about \\"the scientific explanations of the apparent miracles of physics and cosmology and its philosophical implications\\". The book deals with the Anthropic principle. The earlier chapters deal with topics such as quantum electrodynamics, Feynman diagrams and quantum chromodynamics. Later on, the cosmological constant is introduced and problems with the amount of energy produced from virtual particles. String theory is also introduced and the black hole war. The book emphasizes the theory of a \\"landscape\\" with many universes out there. Instead of the fact that the Universe is somehow just perfect for life, the truth is that \\"it's not that the universe is somehow contorting itself to accommodate us; it's just a diverse place and we find ourselves in a friendly corner\\". Critical reception The book has received favorable critical reception. Choice Review praised the way the \\"nuances\\" are presented and called the book \\"a stimulating, semi-popular book that presents an excellent, descriptive tutorial of modern physics and cosmology\\". Booklist noted that the book was \\"of utmost significance to science readers\\" and how \\"in this extraordinary work, Susskind ushers us to the mind-bending edge of a possible paradigm shift\\". Publishers Weekly believed that Susskind was able to guide readers into the Anthropic Principle. The reviewer then stated that \\"persistent readers will finish this book understanding and caring about contemporary physics in ways both unexpected and gratifying\\". Library Journal said that the book is able to explain String Theory and how it can unite general relativity and quantum mechanics together. The reviewer recommended the book to \\"science collections in academic and larger public libraries\\".

Bird's eye view of a Honeycomb cul-de-sac. Perspective of quadruplex honeycomb house. Perspective of sextuplex honeycomb house. Cul-de-sacs are popular: they are perceived as being safer, more exclusive and neighbourly. According to one study, between the ‚Äògrid‚Äô, ‚Äòloops‚Äô and cul-de-sacs, the latter were the most popular.Eran Ben-Joseph (1995), \\"Livability and Safety of Suburban Street Patterns: a Comparative Study\\", Working Paper 641, Berkeley, CA: University of California However, in developing countries like Malaysia, only the very rich can afford to live in quarter-acre single-family houses located in a cul-de-sac. The Honeycomb concept was a response to two questions: ‚Ä¢ How can the cul-de-sac be made affordable for more people and for the environment? ‚Ä¢ Is it possible to have cul-de-sacs without sprawl? First, the cul-de-sac is made bigger so as to fit in a public green area in the middle in order to meet local planning regulations that require 10% of any residential development to be open space. Then an interlocking arrangement of cul-de-sacs is created such that each building lot would face two or three cul-de-sacs. If the buildings in this layout were detached houses, they would be priced in the top range of the market. But instead, the buildings are divided into 2, 3, 4 or 6, creating duplex, triplex, quadruplex or sextuplex units. As the buildings are divided, the land area and the built-up area become smaller; the number of units in the layout and the density of the development go up to rival that obtained in terrace house developments. In this way, the housing units become less expensive. Yet each house still retains a public access.

At the age of 17 she came back to Europe and went to Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, and later continued her studies in New York, where she was introduced to the art of icon painting. The Russian sacred art, literature and philosophy greatly influenced Maas' life and work. At the age of 18, she was married, and to support her family began to work, as a model, travelling extensively throughout Europe, visiting Japan and Australia. Influences, especially of Japanese wood prints, could be traced in Maas' etchings and paintings. After 1996 she lived in Florence, Italy, where she was accepted into the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze. She graduated from in 2003 with diploma cum laudeTjaarke Maas Thesis ‚ÄúUn‚Äôintroduzione alle tecniche ed ai significati dell‚ÄôICONOGRAFIA RUSSO-BIZANTINA‚Äù and continued to paint intensively and to work on icons. She combined writing about icons with studying the theology of the image ‚Äî these forms the basis of her personal spiritual pursuit.

A few years later, Maas found refuge in the forests surrounding the Hermit Monastery of St. Francis of Assisi (Eremo del Carcere) to continue her work on icons as commissioned by the priest Don Gino.
