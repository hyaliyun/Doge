After the Cipher Bureau's mathematician- cryptologist Marian Rejewski in late December 1932 deduced the wiring in the German military Enigma rotor cipher machine, AVA built Enigma \\"doubles\\" as well as all the electro-mechanical equipment designed at the Cipher Bureau to expedite decryption of Enigma ciphers.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 26‚Äì28 and passim. History AVA's four directors were Edward Fokczy≈Ñski, Antoni Palluth, Ludomir Danilewicz, and his younger brother Leonard Danilewicz. The company took its name from the combined radio callsigns of the Danilewicz brothers (TPAV) and Palluth (TPVA). When the company was being formed in 1929, the Danilewicz brothers were short-wave \\"hams\\" and students at the Warsaw Polytechnic.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 26. In 1927, Fokczy≈Ñski had opened a small radio workshop on Warsaw's New World Street. Sporadically he had received orders from the Cipher Bureau, whose Captain Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki knew Fokczy≈Ñski from his 1919‚Äì22 army service. Beginning in 1929, the modest shop, ten minutes' walk from the General Staff building, which housed the Cipher Bureau, was transformed into AVA. The company subsequently moved to new facilities in southern Warsaw's Mokot√≥w district.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 26. Early on, the fledgling company was severely under-capitalized. All four directors, however, had other jobs; and soon the Cipher Bureau came to the rescue with an order for eight 10-watt short-wave radio stations, which became the embryo of Section II's radio network. AVA also won other clients, including the Polish Navy and Professor Lugeon of the Warsaw Meteoroglogical Institute, for whom AVA built, to his design, an atmoradiograf that registered disturbances in the atmosphere; this, Leonard Danilewicz later recalled, was the unheralded beginning of radioastronomy.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 27. The General Staff's Cipher Bureau was responsible for the radio communications of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence section). The Cipher Bureau entrusted the design and construction of the equipment to AVA. The work was carried out on a cost-plus basis, to the benefit of both AVA and the General Staff.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 27‚Äì28. In December 1932, the Cipher Bureau's mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski reconstructed the wiring of the German Enigma machine. The Poles' subsequent reading of German ciphers laid the foundation for the western Allies' Ultra cipher-breaking operations, beginning seven years later, during World War II. Now, in January 1933, just as Hitler was coming to power in Germany, AVA quickly produced a \\"double\\" of the Enigma machine; by mid-1934, it had made over a dozen.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 28. In 1934 or 1935, AVA built the cyclometer, a device designed by Rejewski to prepare a \\"card catalog\\" that facilitated the decryption of Enigma messages.Marian Rejewski, \\"The Mathematical Solution of the Enigma Cipher,\\" Appendix E to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 284‚Äì87. In 1938 AVA built the \\"cryptologic bomb,\\" invented by Rejewski about October 1938. This was an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas that took the place of some one hundred workers. Six bombs were built before September 1939.Marian Rejewski, \\"The Mathematical Solution of the Enigma Cipher,\\" in W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 290. Actual assembly of the cyclometers, \\"bombs\\" and LCD cipher machines was carried out not at the AVA facilities but in Room 13 (the \\"Clock Room\\") at the Cipher Bureau in the General Staff building‚Äîand, from 1937, at the new Cipher Bureau center in the Kabaty Woods south of Warsaw. No one had access to this room except the head of the Cipher Bureau, Gwido Langer, the head of its German section (B.S. 4), Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, and personnel employed there: Antoni Palluth, Ludomir Danilewicz, his younger brother Leonard, Edward Fokczy≈Ñski, and the specialist in precision mechanics, Czes≈Çaw Betlewski.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 212.

Italian fears that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to threaten the approach to the Suez canal led the Italian military to order the destruction of the Ottoman naval presence in the area. On 24 February 1912 two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters, retired, then returned and sank an Ottoman torpedo boat. As a result of the battle all Ottoman naval forces in the region were annihilated, thus ensuring the approaches to the Suez Canal were open to the Italians. Besides the naval losses, the city of Beirut itself suffered significant damage from the Italian warships. Background During the Italo- Turkish War, the Italian military feared that Ottoman naval forces in the Mediterranean would stage a raid on the Italian supply and troopships headed for Italian East Africa. In order to prevent such a raid, Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel was ordered to clear the harbour of Beirut of what Ottoman naval vessels he might find there. Revel's force consisted of two armoured cruisers: Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio.Earle 1912, p. 1092. Both cruisers were of the Giuseppe Garibaldi class and armed with two 10-inch guns in turrets, ten 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns, ten 6-pounders, ten 1-pounders, 2 Maxim machine guns, and five torpedo tubes.Brassey 1898, p. 36. In contrast the Ottoman forces consisted of the casemate corvette and the torpedo boat Angora.Beehler 1913, p. 54. Angora was a relatively new vessel completed in 1906 and armed with two 37 mm cannon as well as two 14-inch torpedo tubes with a pair of torpedoes per tube.Gardiner 1985, p. 392. In contrast Avnillah was an antiquated ironclad corvette built in 1869. After reconstruction was completed in 1907 she was armed with four 3-inch guns and eight 6-pounders. In addition to her cannon, she was also armed with a single 14-inch torpedo tube.Gardiner 1985, p. 389. Thus the Ottoman force was entirely outgunned by the Italians, giving them a severe disadvantage in the looming battle. Battle alt=An Italian cruiser bombards two Ottoman ships with smoke billowing over the city. The two Italian cruisers approached the harbour and fired a blank shot at the Ottoman vessels lying there. Upon sighting the Italian ships, the Ottoman commander on Avnillah sent out a launch under a flag of truce to communicate with the enemy. While negotiating, the Ottoman commander ordered Angora to position itself near the harbour's mole. At 07:30, Admiral Revel ordered the Ottoman launch to return with an ultimatum addressed to the WƒÅli of Beirut informing him to surrender his two warships by 09:00. The message was received by the Wali at 08:30. The Wali was in the process of issuing an order of surrender but this was not received by the Italians by the deadline. Accordingly, at 09:00, the Italians began their attack on the Ottoman ships in the harbor.Hidden 1912, p. 456. At a distance of , the Italians opened fire upon the Ottoman corvette. The Ottomans returned fire ineffectively until 09:35 when the Italian gunfire set Avnillah afire. Receiving heavy damage and outgunned, the corvette struck her colours and the crew abandoned ship. At this point Garibaldi sailed in close and engaged Angora at with gunfire but failed to damage it. Garibaldi then attempted to finish off Avnillah by firing a torpedo at her. However, the torpedo deviated from its trajectory and hit several lighters moored nearby, sinking six of them.Beehler 1913, p. 97. Undeterred, the Italian cruiser fired a second torpedo that struck the Ottoman corvette amidships. By 11:00 the corvette was sunk in shallow water and the pair of cruisers withdrew to the north.Beehler 1913, p. 55. The action was not over however; at 13:45, the Italian cruisers returned and once more engaged the Ottoman forces. The only warship left in the harbour was the torpedo boat Angora so Ferruccio moved in close and engaged it with gunfire for three minutes before it joined Avni-Illah at the bottom of Beirut's harbour. Once the fighting had ended the two Italian cruisers sailed off in a westward direction.Earle 1912, p. 1094.  Aftermath  The wreck of the Avnillah lying in Beirut harbour, photograph taken during World War I The Ottoman naval presence at Beirut was completely annihilated, removing the only Turkish naval threat to Italian transports in the area and giving the Italians complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean Sea for the rest of the war. Casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. Both Ottoman warships were sunk, with Avnillah alone taking 2 officers and 49 enlisted killed and 19 wounded.B√ºy√ºktuƒürul, p. 84. In contrast, the Italian ships not only took no casualties but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships as well.Beehler 1913, p. 106. The damage was not restricted to the Ottoman naval vessels present at Beirut, as the city took heavy damage as well. Stray shots from the cruisers decimated the city. Fires broke out as a direct result of the stray gunfire, destroying several banks and part of the city's customs house as well as other buildings. Combined from the fires and shelling, 66 civilians were killed in the city along with hundreds of others wounded. As retribution for the Italian actions at Beirut, four days after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the Wilyets of Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus to expel all Italian citizens from their jurisdictions, resulting in the deportation of over 60,000 Italians from the region. Despite the retaliatory expulsion of Italian citizens from the area, the battle gave the Italian forces complete naval superiority in the approaches to the Suez Canal and Italian forces in Eritrea could now be reinforced without hesitation, eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region. Thus the battle was both a strategic and tactical Italian victory.

Tropical geography refers to the study of places and people in the tropics. When it first emerged as a discipline, tropical geography was closely associated with imperialism and colonial expansion of the European empires as contributing scholars tended to portray the tropical places as \\"primitive\\" and people \\"uncivilised\\" and \\"inferior\\".Arnold, David, 2000. \\"Illusory Riches\\": Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950. Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography. 21(1), 2000, 6-18. A wide range of subjects has been discussed within the sub-field during late 18th to early 20th century including zoology, climatology, geomorphology, economics and cultural studies.Jarrett, H.R., 1977. Tropical geography: An introductory study of the humid tropics, Macdonald and Evans,p.2. The discipline is now more commonly known as development geography as colonization had been replaced by economic development as the main ideological driver of international and global interactions since the 1950s. Today, many scholars continue to use the term tropical geography to contest the determinism embedded in the term and de- exoticise the tropical countries and their inhabitants. Origins The origins of tropical geography can be traced back to as early as the fifteenth century when Columbus first discovered the Caribbean islands in tropical America. Subsequent writings of European explorers, merchants, naturalists, colonists and settlers who traveled to and lived in the tropics were the main sources of the study. Alexander von Humboldt, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace are some of the significant contributors. It is argued that it is due to their academic reputation and scientific approaches tropical geography was consolidated into an academic discipline widely studied in Europe in spite of the region's vast differences in vegetation, wild lives, climate, geology and culture.Arnold, David, 2000. pp9-10. Troubled Representations The discourse on the tropics and their inhabitants have evolved over time in response to changing patterns of Europe's engagements in the tropics. A variety of environmental determinism emerged from the sub-field as colonists and naturalists started representing temperate and tropical people with binaries like \\"progressive vs. backward,\\" \\"civilised vs. primitive,\\" \\"hard working vs. lazy\\" and \\"superior vs. inferior.\\"Gilmartin, Mary, 2008. p177. Race, an invented concept, was convenient and readily applied in attempts to \\"[link] climatic variation closely to the supposed division of the human species into different 'races'\\". As activities of the European empires diversified in the 19th century, travelers and settlers who had experienced deadly tropical diseases and conflicts with the local peoples forged another representation of the tropical world as a place full of \\"dangers\\" and \\"horrors\\" to mankind.Arnold, David, 2000. p10. The fertile lands of the tropics were then interpreted as to have obstacles for human morality and physical well-being preventing their inhabitants from technical, philosophical and artistic innovation. This dramatized and pessimistic representation reinforced Europe's superior position and enhanced the depiction of the tropics as an exotic other to the temperate world.Savage, V.R., 2004. Topicality Imagined and Experienced. Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 25(1), 26-31. Whether tropical geographers found the tropical places and people abundant and dynamic or deadly and barbaric. They understood them as inferior to the temperate and great Western civilizations. As criticized by Edward Said in his famous work Orientalism, the literature of tropical geography served the interests of European scholars who were living in the temperate world to create an exotic other which in turn helped define themselves.Said, Edward W., 2007. \\"Latent and Manifest Orientalism.\\" Race and Racialization: Essential Readings. pp45-55. Today's tropical geography Until the mid 20th century, the imperialist, racist and Euro-centric version of tropical geography was still flourishing as influential works were still being published like Les Pays Tropicaux by geomorphologist Pierre Gourou.Gregory, D. et al., 2009. The Dictionary of Human Geography 5th ed., Wiley-Blackwell, p.777. From 1950's onward, development geography replaced tropical geography as the sub-field of geography.Painter, J. & Jeffrey, A. 2009. \\"Imperialism and Postcolonialism\\". Political Geography 2nd ed. Sage, London. pp169-195. Consequently, the studied regions were given new terminologies such as the \\"Third World\\" and the \\"global South.\\" Critical geographers argue the replacement of tropical geography by development geography marks the historical turning point of international intervention strategy from colonisation to economic development.Lawson, Victoria, 2007. \\"Development as Intervention: From Modernisation to Neo- liberalisation.\\" Making Development Geography. Hodder Arnold. p70. Though morphed into a different discipline, the ideological roots of tropical geography‚Äîsuperiority, progress, civilization and technological advancement of the West which originated and matured in the temperate zone‚Äîcarry on and become the building blocks of mainstream economic development theories. Paralleled with the rise of critical approaches to other sub-fields of geography, development geography and tropical geography as academic disciplines have seen a movement away from the mainstream economistic and deterministic view of the tropical world in the 1970s.Lawson, Victoria, 2007. \\"Development as Situated Knowledge.\\" Making Development geography. Hodder Arnold. pp10-12. Geographers now attend to the influences imperialism, racism and Euro-centrism have had on tropical geography while attempting to bring class, gender, race and religion into the broader picture to better understand the tropical world and its inhabitants. Today the academic journal Singapore Journal of Tropical GeographySingapore Journal of Tropical Geography. Available at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9493 [Accessed November 23, 2012]. continues to be a forum for tropical geographers to introduce and present new research and critique existing literature on the tropical world and people. Different from the historic absence of voices from the tropics, now many of the contributors of the Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography are of tropical origins and study tropical countries and their citizens with more holistic and inclusive approaches.

History  The band gained international attention when they played at the Shanghai World Expo August 2010 on their first tour of China. On their second tour (October 2010), they once-again grabbed TV headlines with record-breaking crowds during the closing of the Shanghai World Expo. They also made history as the final guests on EXPO 360, a show highlighting the best of the World Expo. Making headlines in the fashion world, lead singer Teresa Lee wore a dress by Flora Zeta. Chinese press praised the US band for their action-packed live performances including People Daily. With a growing fanbase in China, in October 2011, PaperDoll returned for their 3rd tour aptly titled NY2CN: Can't Stop It!!!, named after their single \\"You Can't Stop It\\". Partnering with Loft Records in Tianjin, PaperDoll released an English/Chinese CD with 14 songs including a remake of Chinese traditional song \\"Moon Represents My Heart\\" in China. Their NY2CN: Can't Stop It!!! tour included stops at the prestigious World Leisure Expo in Hangzhou. This led to TuneCore featuring them in an article about how to break into the illusive Chinese music scene. Along with features in Asiance Magazine, Yellow Magazine, HelloNanjing, and even snagged the cover of Asian Fusion Magazine. Internationally, they are featured in a Nike campaign airing in Greater China, and the film The People I've Slept With. The band gained national attention in the US in early 2010 when their song \\"If Nothing Happened\\" was featured in a national TV commercial for Vick's DayQuil. The same song on the commercial \\"If Nothing Happened\\" was also named in Blender's \\"Five Songs We Love\\" in March 2010. Song \\"If Nothing Happened\\" was featured on the Today Show in the clip \\"Hey Al, Have you Ever Overslept\\", where the famous weatherman was exercising before work. Their single \\"Silent\\" is featured in Quentin Lee's film \\"White Frog\\" starring BD Wong, Harry Shum Jr, Booboo Stewart, Joan Chen, and Kelly Hu.

One of its first acts is the establishment of No. 1 Australian General Hospital in the Heliopolis Palace Hotel just outside Luna Park by 19 January 1915. Demand for bedspace increased to the point that the ANZACS expanded the medical facilities, first to Luna Park's ice skating rink by establishing an auxiliary branch of No. 1 AGH;Casualty Clearance (2) - ANZAC Day Commemoration CommitteeJan Bassett, 'Guns and Brooches'(Cambridge 1989) by 28 April 1915, over 500 beds filled the rink, and further accommodations were provided in makeshift-fashion in the haunted house, the round about, the scenic railroad, and the pavilion; the ticket office was modified to contain an operating theatre.

The early stuff in particular -- April Sun in Cuba, Are You Old Enough?, Still in Love With You, et al is prototypical singalong, but like all of the material here, it's memorable without being simplistic or 'disposable'; you know you're listening to a band that can both write and play with aplomb.\\" Zupp added, \\"The melodies are ear-grabbing, the hooks sharp, and the musicianship tight as a noose.

Released just after the passing of charis-nihilistic frontman Marc Hunter in 1998 -- the third member of the band to die before his time -- Snake Eyes has a haunting poignancy.

It was formed in November 1973 to represent the councils of Western Sydney and to advocate for the people of the region. Its current membership includes 8 of the 13 Greater Western Sydney councils, making it one of the largest NSW Regional Organisations of Councilshttp://www.wsroc.com.au/page.aspx?pid=96&vid;=1  Membership  The following councils make up WSROC:https://www.wsroc.com.au/about-wsroc/wsroc- member-councils * Blacktown City Council * Blue Mountains City Council * Cumberland Council * Fairfield City Council * Hawkesbury City Council * Lithgow City Council * Liverpool City Council * City of Parramatta The WSROC region covers 5,800 square kilometres and had an estimated resident population as at 30 June 2008 of 1,665,673.http://profile.id.com.au/Default.aspx?id=303  History  The Whitlam federal Labor government elected in 1972 had a strong interest in regions and formed the Department of Urban and Regional Development. In 1973 the Department introduced a program to promote regional co-operation between councils, identifying 76 regions across Australia. These regions were also intended to be a vehicle for federal funding for local services and infrastructure to bypass the largely non-Labor state governments of the time. However, by the time the Labor government was sacked in 1975, only 13 of these regional organisations had received substantial funding and of these ROCs only two continue to operate.http://www.anzrsai.org/system/files/f8/f4/f29/f31/o145//Marshalletal.pdf One of the two ROCs to survive is WSROC. At the time of its formation in 1973, councils in Western Sydney had already been meeting in a number of informal groupings to discuss their concerns. These largely centred on the failure of state governments in the postwar era to provide infrastructure and services such as hospitals, public transport and tertiary education to match the region's rapidly growing population. These concerns coincided with the Whitlam government's interest in regional co-operation and provided the basis for WSROC's ongoing support by its member councils even after the demise of the Labor government. WSROC employed its first staff member in 1977 and became a company limited in 1991. Although most of the other Whitlam-era ROCs eventually folded, WSROC itself became a model for the formation in the 1980s and 1990s of a number of other ROCs. WSROC remains distinct from most other ROCs, however, because of its continued strong emphasis on research and advocacy.  WSROC's achievements  WSROC has been cited as one of Australia's most successful ROCs. These assessments refer primarily to the organisation's regional advocacy role and those campaigns which were successful usually also involved a number of other key partners, including community organisations and the councils themselves. Key campaigns and other WSROC regional initiatives include:http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/81258/city- governance-16-gooding.pdf * \\"Beds to the West\\" campaign (1970s and 80s) for more hospital beds and other health services in the region. * Campaign to create the University of Western Sydney (1980s). * Creation of a regional group apprenticeship and training scheme, WSROC Training & Employment (1980s). * Lobbying to establish the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board (1990s) * The Western Sydney Vision Statement (1994) which was the first attempt to create an alternative regionally-based model for metropolitan planning. The Statement also articulated a proposal for a regional system of dedicated bus and light rail corridors which later formed the basis for the region's bus transitways (T-ways). * Lobbying to create a Minister for Western Sydney in the NSW government (1997) * TeamWest (1997‚Äì2002) a \\"virtual organisation\\" comprising key regional stakeholders, which attempted to identify common goals and priorities as a basis for joint advocacy. * Fast- tracking of the Westlink M7 Motorway (2000s). WSROC joined with a number of other organisations including the NSW Chamber of Commerce, the GWS Economic Development Board and the NRMA to lobby the federal and state governments to bring forward construction of the motorway. * FutureWesthttp://www.wsroc.com.au/page.aspx?vid=8 (2001‚Äì2005) a major project involving research into the issues affecting the region and local areas and the development of a regional planning and management framework setting out 10 key strategic directions for spatial planning. * \\"Authoring Contemporary Australia ‚Äì A Regional Cultural Strategy for Greater Western Sydney\\"http://www.wsroc.com.au/page.aspx?pid=133&vid;=1 (2005) focused on the relationship between culture, identity and the built environment and sought to strengthen the \\"soft\\" cultural infrastructure of the region. * Sub-regional employment strategieshttp://www.uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/57658/URC_Western_Sydney_Employment_Study.pdf (2008). Development of the strategies was undertaken for WSROC and its member councils by the University of Western Sydney to support the employment development components of the Sydney Metropolitan Strategy. In addition WSROC prepares State and Federal Election Issues Papers, comprising a set of one- page sheets identifying up to ten key issues for every major policy area. These are distributed to the candidates and leaders of all the major parties in the run-up to each election, with the issues papers and the party responses published on the WSROC website. Not all of WSROC's campaigns have succeeded, but even in these cases the organisation has usually had some impact on the policy debate. The organisation's advocacy has probably been least effective in relation to persuading state governments to make major investments in the region's public transport infrastructure, though WSROC was involved in the successful campaigns for the Westlink M7 Motorway, the South West Rail Link which is currently under construction and the North West Rail Link which is in advanced stages of planning.  Structure  All member councils make an equal annual contribution to the operating costs of WSROC and have equal voting rights on the organisation's board, which is its primary decision-making body. The WSROC board comprises two voting directors from each member council who serve a four-year term concurrent with their councillor terms. The directors in turn elect the organisation's president and other executive positions. The organisation is supported by a small regional secretariat. Several professional committees made up of staff from member Councils also assist in implementing the work program. The Board sets WSROC's strategic plan and work program through a planning forum held every four years and regularly reviewed. The work program centres on WSROC's primary role ‚Äì to lobby for the councils and communities of Western Sydney ‚Äì but the organisation also undertakes a number of other \\"typical\\" ROC roles such as regional project development and management, resource sharing between councils and supporting regional joint purchase initiatives.  WSROC's Mission Statement  \\"Our mission is: to secure ‚Äì through research, lobbying and the fostering of cooperation between councils ‚Äì a sustainable lifestyle for the people of Western Sydney and the provision of infrastructure such that no one should have to leave the region to have access to the sorts of amenities, services and opportunities others in urban Australia take for granted.\\"  WSROC‚Äôs Objectives  WSROC's objectives, as set out in its Constitution, are: * To consider the needs of the local government areas and of the people of the Western Region of Sydney and to make known those needs to the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments and the wider community. * To submit to the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments requests for financial assistance, policy changes and additional resources for the Western Region of Sydney and Members. * To strengthen the role of local government in regional affairs, particularly where the Western Region of Sydney may be affected by Commonwealth or New South Wales Government policy. * To foster co-operation between Members in addressing problems and projects of joint interest. * To advance the interests of the Western Region of Sydney. * To assist Members to carry out their duties, functions and powers under the Local Government Act, and any other statute making provision for duties, functions or powers of the Members.  WSROC alumni  A number of politicians who were subsequently elected to state or federal parliament had key roles on the WSROC board in the early stages of their political careers. Current examples include Chris Bowen who is the Federal Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and who served as a WSROC president, as did Paul Lynch who is the Shadow Minister for Attorney General and Justice in the NSW state opposition and Helen Westwood, a member of the NSW Legislative Council.

History Born in Westland Township, Oliver Barnett made himself one of the area's most important farmers following service in the Union Army during the Civil War. He and his wife arranged for the construction of the house in 1875, relying on contractors from Pittsburgh. Here they lived for fifteen years before selling the property to Elijah and Carrie Criss, another well-known farming couple.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 550. Exterior The Barnett‚ÄìCriss House around the late 1800s The rectangular house sits on top of a sandstone basement with water table separating house from basement. The house facade is lined with wooden siding. The front of the house is accentuated by a front porch containing slender posts on broad bases. The posts are decorated with trusses reaching from each post to make an arch. The large front double-doors are capped by a transom window. The porch is framed to either side by a bay window. The second floor is accentuated by a central tower with a decorative double window with a porthole window above it. The tower is capped by a gabled roof with decorative brackets and entablature. To either side of the tower are a pair of windows. The sloping roof is punctured to either end by a brick chimney. The side of the house contained an open porch with a water pump. The porch was covered over into a sunroom sometime around 1900. Interior The main entrance at the front of the house opens up into the central hall with a staircase leading to the second-floor bedrooms. To the left of the hall is the parlor which contains an original brass gas chandelier with springs and a pulley for easier maintenance. A fireplace with decorative carved wooden panels add a touch of sophistication. The parlor once opened up onto another open porch with a necessary located nearby. The porch was covered over and was split into a study and a bathroom. This room opens up into the large kitchen. A large cooking fireplace graces the center of the outside wall with a food pantry to its right. This pantry is said to be designed by a specialist who could maintain a consistent cool temperature. The kitchen opens up onto the central hall or continues into the dining room or sunporch. The dining room contains a fireplace much like the one in the parlor. The bay window at one end of the room was used as a tea area. The doors throughout the house are framed by oak frames with a frosted levered window. The doors are all hung on decorative iron hinges.

In Shinto, , or when the honorific prefix go- is used, are physical objects worshipped at or near Shinto shrines as repositories in which spirits or kami reside.Shintai, Encyclopedia of Shinto Shintai used in Shrine Shinto (Jinja Shinto) can be also called . In spite of what their name may suggest, shintai are not themselves part of kami, but rather just temporary repositories which make them accessible to human beings for worship.Smyers, page 44 Shintai are also of necessity yorishiro, that is objects by their very nature capable of attracting kami. Description The most common shintai are man-made objects like mirrors, swords, jewels (for example comma-shaped stones called magatama), gohei (wands used during religious rites), and sculptures of kami called ,Kami are as a rule not represented in anthropomorphic or physical terms, however numerous paintings and statues representing them have appeared under Buddhist influence. but they can be also natural objects such as rocks (), mountains (), trees (), and waterfalls () Before the forcible separation of kami and Buddhas of 1868 (shinbutsu bunri) a shintai could even be the statue of a Buddhist deity. Famous shintai include the mirror (part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan), Mount Miwa, Mount Nantai, the Nachi Falls, and the Meoto Iwa rocks. Many mountains like Mount Miwa or the Three Mountains of Kumano (Kumano sanzan) are considered shintai and are therefore called .Ono, Woodard (2004:100) The most widely known and renowned shintai is Mount Fuji.For details on Mount Fuji worship, see Fuji Shink≈ç, Encyclopedia of Shinto. A yokozuna, a wrestler at the top of sumo's power pyramid, is a living shintai. For this reason, his waist is circled by a shimenawa, a sacred rope which protects sacred objects from evil spirits. A kannushi, that is, a Shinto priest, can become a living shintai when a kami enters his body during religious ceremonies. The founding of a new shrine requires the presence of either a pre-existing, naturally occurring shintai (for example a rock or waterfall housing a local kami), or of an artificial one, which must therefore be procured or made to the purpose. An example of the first case are the Nachi Falls, worshiped at Hiry≈´ Shrine near Kumano Nachi Taisha and believed to be inhabited by a kami called Hiry≈´ Gongen. In the second, the mitama (spirit) of a kami is divided in half through a process called kanj≈ç and one of the halves is then stored in a yorishiro. This is the process which has led to the creation of networks of shrines housing the same kami, as for example the Hachiman shrine, Inari shrine or Kumano shrine networks. Because over the years the shintai is wrapped in more and more layers of precious cloth and stored in more and more boxes without being ever inspected, its exact identity may become forgotten. The first role of a shrine is to house and protect its shintai and the kami which inhabits it. If a shrine has more than one building, the one containing the shintai is called honden; because it is meant for the exclusive use of the kami, it is always closed to the public and is not used for prayer or religious ceremonies. The shintai leaves the honden only during festivals (matsuri), when it is put in a \\"divine palanquin\\" (mikoshi, a term usually translated in English as \\"portable shrine\\"Progressive English-Japanese/Japanese English Dictionary, 2008, Shogakukan), and carried around the streets among the faithful. The portable shrine is used to physically protect the shintai and to hide it from sight..

Politician Hutton was a candidate of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) in the 1966 provincial election, and finished third against Progressive Conservative candidate Donald Craik in the central Winnipeg division of St. Vital. He was later the federal New Democratic Party's candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1968 Canadian general election, and placed third against Liberal James Richardson.History of Federal Ridings since 1867: WINNIPEG SOUTH (1968/06/25), Parliament of Canada, accessed 19 September 2009.

Hutton was a vocal opponent of the Manitoba's government decision to establish official English-French bilingualism in the early 1980s. He argued that this would not reflect Manitoba's multicultural status, and would instead create \\"a lopsided bicultural province, where on one side of the coin there exists a small, powerful, monolithic French ethnolinguistic community and on the other side a heterogeneous, multicultural polyglot collection of assorted ethnic and linguistic communities\\".Frances Russell, The Canadian Crucible, (Winnipeg: Heartland Associates), 2003, p. 375. Hutton further argued that entrenching French-language services would encourage cultural and political separatism, and that he opposed it in the same way that he opposed the Parti Qu√©b√©cois's campaign for an independent Quebec.Russell, p. 383. Unlike some other opponents of bilingualism, Hutton was himself fluent in French and supported a strong francophone presence within Canada.This is confirmed in Doern, The Battle Over Bilingualism, p. 112. Hutton was councillor Harvey Smith's campaign manager in the 1998 Winnipeg municipal election, and supported Glen Murray's successful bid to become mayor.

Hutton traveled to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1996, and appealed for overseas sponsors of Serb children whose lives had been disrupted by the country's wars of secession. He was later a vocal opponent of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and argued that Kosovo's Serb population was being \\"ethnically cleansed\\" by Albanians who wanted to make Kosovo an Albanian province.

It was a cross between the Friesian, Thoroughbred, Hackney, Cape Harness horse, and assorted heavy warmblood breeds on smaller Cape horses. In the Afrikaans language, \\"Vlaamperd\\" literally translates as \\"Flemish horse,\\" in reference to its roots in the Friesian breeding of Belgium and the Netherlands. The stallions are always black, though mares may be dark brown. They are used for both riding and work in harness. History In 1820, Lord Charles Somerset imported several Arabian and Thoroughbred stallions to South Africa. These stallions were crossed with local mares. The result was a riding horse originally called the Hantam horse or Cape Horse. In the early 1900s, Friesian stallions were imported to South Africa and crossed on the Hantam mares. In addition, a few East Friesian, Hackney, Oldenburg and Cleveland Bay stallions were also used. In the process, the Hantam horse became extinct as a breed, replaced by a more powerful riding horse which also was capable of harness work. Bloodlines of the Cape Harness horse were also part of the cross \\"South African Country Report on Farm Animal Resources\\" South Africa Department of Agriculture, June 2006. Accessed 20 September 2009 A major foundation sire was a stallion named Kemp, who was of East Friesan and Oldenburg breeding. Later, the stallion Scheepers, foaled in 1930, had a significant influence on the development of the Vlaamperd.\\"Vlaamperd.\\" Equestrian Life Wiki. Accessed 19 September 2009 While the breed was in development, the Dutch banned the export of Friesian horses to try to control the breeding of their horses. To evade the law, South Africans began to import Friesians from Antwerp in Belgium and referred to Friesians as \\"Vlaamse perde\\" or \\"Flemish horses.\\" From this term came the name Vlaamperd. The Vlaamperd Breeders Society was founded in 1983 in Bloemfontein to further preserve and protect the Vlaamperd. Today the breed is small in number but is seen in the tourism and various festivals in South Africa. Some classify it as nearly extinct. It is recognized in South Africa as an independent, established breed. Characteristics and uses The Vlaamperd averages between and with an elegant, long-legged build.\\"Vlaamperd\\" Equine South Africa Web site accessed 24 September 2009 It is known for its fine, high motion, good disposition, and excellent driving ability, making the breed popular as a harness horse, both in tourism and festivals, driven singly or in teams of up to eight horses. They are also popular as riding horses in dressage, particularly classical dressage performances. From Friesian breeding, the Vlaamperd is a very dark color. All stallions are black, while mares are preferably black but also can be dark bay or \\"pale black\\" which is, essentially, dark bay or seal brown. Lighter colors are, however, strictly prohibited and may not be used in breeding, since this is considered a proof of undesired crossbreeding.

He was deprived of his seat after the 1895 general election because of the indiscretion of one of his campaign workers and his having headed a procession which raised suspicion of having supplied beer to supporters. He subsequently raised the question of false electioneering statements in Parliament. He was a member of the Carlton Club and the Royal Thames Yacht Club and a Justice of the Peace for Hampshire, as well as being Lord of the Manors of Hound, North Baddesley, Woolston and Barton Peveril (near Eastleigh) in Hampshire and East Norton in Leicestershire. Early life and education Chamberlayne was born at Pangbourne, Berkshire, the second son of Thomas Chamberlayne (1805‚Äì1876) and Amelia (n√©e Onslow). He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took his BA in 1865. Ancestry His great uncle William Chamberlayne (1760‚Äì1829) was Member of Parliament for Southampton from 1818 until his death. Whilst serving the town, William Chamberlayne was also chairman of the company supplying gas lighting to the town of Southampton and donated the iron columns for the new gas street-lights. In 1822, the townspeople erected a memorial consisting of an iron Doric column; this now stands in Houndwell Park, near the city centre. Tankerville's father, Thomas (1805‚Äì1876) was a keen yachtsman who sailed his yacht, Arrow, in the inaugural America's Cup race in 1851. He also played cricket for Hampshire and was a great hunting and coursing enthusiast, who built both new stables and a cricket pitch at the family home at Cranbury Park near Winchester. Tankerville's mother, Amelia, was the daughter of Denzil Onslow (1770‚Äì1838), a General in the Grenadier Guards and an amateur cricketer. Their first son, Denzil, became a captain in the 13th Light Dragoons, serving with distinction in the Crimean War, where he took part in the charge at Balaclava in 1854. Denzil died in 1873, leaving no heir, so on the death of Thomas in 1876, Tankerville succeeded his father. At this time, the Chamberlayne family estates included the estate at Cranbury Park in the Parish of Hursley and the Weston Grove estate in Southampton which included the abbey at Netley. Chamberlayne resided at Weston Grove until after he retired from politics in 1906. Political career Poster (believed to be for 1895 UK General election) of Tankerville Chamberlayne (left) and Barrington Simeon Chamberlayne was first elected as Member of Parliament for Southampton at the 1892 general election, when he headed the poll with 5,449 votes. He replaced the previous Conservative representative, Alfred Giles who was retiring from politics; his fellow M.P. for the town was Francis Evans, of the Liberal Party. At the 1895 general election he stood for re-election on a joint ticket with Sir John Barrington Simeon of the Liberal Unionist Party. Although he retained his seat, the victory was challenged in an election petition lodged by two local Liberals, Walter Austen and John Rowland. The petitioners claimed that Chamberlayne and Simeon had been responsible for various corrupt and illegal practices, and had engaged in \\"treating\\" (supplying free food and drink to voters). The case came to trial at the Hartley Institute (now part of the University of Southampton) at the end of November 1895, and some of the claims were quickly disposed of: evidence that Chamberlayne had made a speech at Bitterne where he had slapped his pocket and alluded to money was regarded as untrustworthy by the Judges. Other charges were abandoned by the petitioners.\\"Controverted Elections (Judgments)\\", p. 37. The petition case came down to two main items. It was shown that Albert Blackman, chairman of Trinity Ward Conservative Association, had sent a telegram to Alfred Powell, a Southampton wood-carver who was working in Winchester, urging him \\"Every vote wanted. Come down by 6.35. Fare all right\\" and that Blackman had subsequently given Powell 2s. to pay his fare.5 O'M & H 17 at 20. Mr Justice Wright noted that such a payment was \\"made in direct contravention of the law\\", but that the Judges could disregard it if the election was in other respects faultless.\\"Controverted Elections (Judgments)\\", p. 40. The incident which decided the Judges was called \\"the procession\\" and occurred on polling day. The Conservatives were campaigning in opposition to the Liberal government's Local Veto Bill which would have allowed local authorities to prevent the sale of alcohol. Several costermonger's carts, bearing \\"certain symbols of drink\\", headed by a carriage on which Chamberlayne sat, spent two hours moving through the streets of Southampton, stopping at pubs and Conservative supporting clubs. Although Chamberlayne had not known about the procession beforehand, Mr Justice Wright noted that he had chosen to lead it and therefore \\"allowed to follow him ..[a procession] of a nature calculated to excite and provoke to treating .. and to illegal practices to some extent\\".5 O'M & H 17 at 22. Mr Justice Bruce agreed that \\"it was, at least, possible, if not probable, that corrupt treating was going on\\".5 O'M & H 17 at 23. Therefore, both judges concluded that Chamberlayne had not taken all reasonable means to prevent corrupt practices, and his election was void; however, they refused to award the petitioners costs save in respect of the railway fare allegation.5 O'M & H 17 at 24. Subsequent political career A by-election was held on 22 February 1896, some six months after the General Election. Chamberlayne, who was disqualified from election as a result of the successful petition, did not stand and Francis Evans regained his seat. The disqualification had expired by the time of the 1900 general election and Chamberlayne regained his seat. He was defeated at the 1906 general election by William Dudley Ward and Sir Ivor Philipps of the Liberal Party. Although he stood for re-election in the 1910 general election, he was unsuccessful and his political career was over. Sporting interests Chamberlayne was a keen sportsman and took an active interest in many sports, including cricket, rugby, football, fox hunting and yachting. He had a reputation for being very generous to the many sporting organisations who had claims on his patronage, although he did not actively involve himself with day-to-day details. Cricket He is recorded as having played in two cricket matches. The first was in July 1862 at Day's (Antelope) Ground, Southampton (which his father Thomas had helped to finance). In this match, Chamberlayne played for the Gentlemen of Hampshire against a United England Eleven. The Hampshire gentlemen fielded 22 players, including Thomas Chamberlayne, with Tankerville contributing just six runs in two innings. Despite their numerical inferiority (only fielding eleven players), the United England Eleven won the match by 64 runs. He helped to finance a cricket ground at Yatton in Somerset and appeared there in the opening match in July 1879, when he played for the Gentlemen of Somerset against the Gentlemen of Hampshire. The match was curtailed because of inclement weather, but this did not prevent those present from enjoying the supper and fireworks that Chamberlayne laid on following the match. The only other known match played at Yatton was in August 1887, when the Gentlemen of Gloucestershire entertained a touring team from Canada. The Gloucestershire gentlemen included W. G. Grace in their eleven with the match ending in a draw at the end of the second day. Football Although he never played football, he became very interested in the game as it increased in popularity. In 1884, he became President of the Trojans club in Eastleigh, having been Vice-President for some years previously; he remained president of the Trojans until his death in 1924. He was also President of the Freemantle Football Club and helped them financially by paying the rent (¬£24 per annum) on their ground in Freemantle. Following the failure of proposals to merge Freemantle with its neighbour, Southampton F.C. in 1897, Chamberlayne was invited to become a shareholder and director of the Southampton club. Although he accepted the offer, there is no record of him attending a meeting of either the board or of the shareholders. Yachting Amazon in 1889 Chamberlayne regularly sailed his father's yacht, the Arrow, which had taken part in the inaugural America's Cup race in 1851. In 1885, he had his own steam yacht, the Amazon, built at the \\"Arrow Yard\\" in Southampton; this yacht is still sailing (in private hands) and is listed on the National Historic Ships Register. In 1904, the Arrow Yard was sold to the neighbouring yard of Fay & Company, which was later absorbed by Camper and Nicholsons in 1912. Public benefactor Chamberlayne was a generous supporter of various activities and causes. In 1897, to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee he donated the recreation ground at Netley, near Southampton to the village. He and his wife also gave a party for the schoolchildren of Woolston at Weston Grove House. As Lord of the Manor, he funded the restoration of the chapel at the Leicestershire village of East Norton. In 1902, he donated eight acres of land to create the Victoria Recreation Ground in Newport, Isle of Wight. The ground was laid out by the Newport Corporation, and dedicated to the public by Princess Henry of Battenberg, Governor of the Isle of Wight, on 28 August 1902. In 1904, he donated land at Hursley Road, Chandler's Ford for the building of St. Boniface Church, laying the foundation stone on 1 April 1904. In 1922, he transferred the ruins of Netley Abbey into the care of the Ministry of Works. Later life Chamberlayne continued to live at Weston Grove after his political career had ended although he later moved to the family home at Cranbury Park, near Hursley outside Winchester. In 1909, an Act of Parliament required that Chamberlayne sell of land in Weston to the London and South Western Railway for the purpose of building an enormous dry dock some . Although the land was acquired, the project was never undertaken; the site was subsequently sold to the Ministry of Munitions and the Rolling Mills were built instead. Situated directly below Weston Grove House, the Rolling Mills building obstructed the view of Southampton Water from the house, which was demolished in 1940. He was married to Edith; their second son, Thomas Edmund Onslow Chamberlayne, was killed on 18 August 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, aged 23. He is remembered on the war memorial at North Baddesley in Hampshire. Chamberlayne died in 1924 aged 80 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Tankerville Chamberlayne, born 1890; he also had four daughters. Legacy Several streets in Southampton and Eastleigh are named after Chamberlayne and his family. These include Tankerville Road in Woolston and Chamberlayne Road in Eastleigh. There was also the former Tankerville School in Eastleigh and the present-day Chamberlayne College for the Arts in the Weston area. There are Cranbury Roads in both Sholing and Eastleigh, as well as Cranbury Place, Cranbury Avenue, Onslow Road and Denzil Avenue in the Bevois Valley area of Southampton.

Publishers Weekly awarded Dimiter a starred review, calling it \\"a beautifully written, haunting tale of vengeance, spiritual searching, loss, and love\\".Peter Blatty's Back History Dimiter had been in work since 1974,A Chat With William Peter Blatty after Blatty read an article in William Friedkin's office, during the production of The Exorcist, concerning the execution of a priest in the former atheist state of Albania. The novel is dedicated to Blatty's late son, Peter Vincent Galahad Blatty. It is available in both hardcover and audiobook formats.Amazon.com: Dimiter Feature film According to Blatty, in his June 30, 2010 audio interview with \\"Authors on Tour\\", director William Friedkin was set out to make Dimiter a feature film, which would have marked this their first collaboration in almost 40 years. The two attempted to adapt Blatty's previous novel, Legion, into a feature film, but Friedkin later left that production over creative differences. Blatty went on to direct the picture himself. The two nonetheless remained friends, speaking frequently. In lieu of the publication of Dimiter, Friedkin interviewed Blatty for his blog in The Huffington Post, a few days after the author's announcement of a feature film on July 6, and compared the new novel with their previous collaboration: :Q. Do you think Dimiter measures up to The Exorcist, as a piece of writing? :A. Without a doubt, it's the best writing I've produced. I can't surpass it. I know that. Plot The novel begins in Albania, where a spy named Paul Dimiter is tortured by the authorities. Revealed as an \\"agent from Hell\\", they try to get more from him, but before they know it, he escapes. The novel moves to Jerusalem one year later, where a half-Arab European policeman, Peter Meral, finds a murder victim who supposedly was from a mental hospital. Meral tries to find out if there is a connection between Jerusalem and Albania and the enigma of Dimiter.

John B ranked #76 in DJ Magazine 's 2010 Top 100 DJs annual poll, announced on 27 October 2010. Career Williams started producing music around the age of 14, and now is the head of drum and bass record label Beta Recordings, together with its more specialist drum and bass sub-labels Nu Electro, Tangent, and Chihuahua. He also has releases on Formation Records, Metalheadz and Planet Mu. Williams was ranked 92nd drum and bass DJ on the 2009 DJMag's top 100. Style While his trademark sound has evolved through the years, it generally involves female vocals and trance-like synths (a style which has been dubbed \\"trance and bass\\", \\"trancestep\\" and \\"futurestep\\" by listeners). His most recent concentration is a 1980s electroclash influenced fusion of electro and drum and bass, which was dubbed 'electrostep'. At first (around early 2002), this style seemed odd and comical to some in the drum and bass community. However, this move has given John the ability to carry his style of drum and bass forward. He has dabbled in darkstep, jazzstep and various other styles in his time. When he DJs, he is known to spin both drum and bass and electro house, sometimes with other genres such as disco and rock, in the same sets.

From 2012 to 2013, the stadium underwent a major renovation and expansion to accommodate the new Medford Rogues. The city's last minor league team, the Southern Oregon Timberjacks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, arrived in 1979 as the Medford A's.

In 2006, he was awarded the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\", one of Russia's highest state decorations for civilians. Lesin was nicknamed the Bulldozer () because of his ability to get virtually all Russian media outlets under the Kremlin's control, and for being combative in person. Lesin died in a Washington, D.C., hotel room under unusual circumstances. His family initially said the cause of death was a heart attack, but after a year-long investigation Washington's chief medical examiner and federal authorities released a joint statement saying Lesin died of blunt-force trauma to his head, induced by falls amid acute ethanol intoxication. A leaked report by Christopher Steele for the FBI said Lesin was bludgeoned to death by men working for an oligarch close to Putin. Biography Mikhail was born in Moscow to a Jewish family involved in military construction. He spent his childhood years in Mongolia while his father, Yuri, worked on military construction projects. From 1976 to 1978, Lesin served in the Soviet Army and Soviet Naval Infantry (Marines Corps) of the USSR Armed Forces. In 1984, he graduated from the Moscow Engineering and Construction Institute in Yaroslavsky as a civil engineer. From 1982 to 1987, he worked in engineering at Minpromstroy (Industrial construction ministry) in Moscow and in Ulan Bator. From 1988 to 1989, he was Deputy Director for Production of television programs of the Creative Production Association \\"Game Appliances\\". From 1990 to 1993, he was Director of Youth creative production of the TV company RTV, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≤–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ (–†–¢–í). In the late 1980s, he directed the television show Funny Guys (–í–µ—Å—ë–ª—ã–µ —Ä–µ–±—è—Ç–∞). In the early 1990s, Lesin set up Video International, which became a multibillion-dollar advertising agency with exclusive advertising rights on NTV and in 2015 was still one of Russia's largest agencies. In 1994, he left Video International. From 1993 to 1996, he was Head of Commercial Department, Deputy General Director and General Director of RIA Novosti. At this position in Novosti, he was pivotal in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 and especially the re-election campaign of Yeltsin in the 1996 Russian presidential elections. He began the slogan \\"Voice of the Heart\\", authored \\"I believe I do, I hope,\\" and \\"Save and Protect\\", and provided the president's weekly radio address to the country. From September 1996 until February 1997, he was head of Public Relations for the President of Russia under Yeltsin. From 1997 to 1999, he was first deputy chairman of the VGTRK (–í–ì–¢–†–ö), which essentially brought state run television under one roof and follows the designs of Vladislav Surkov. It was counter to the Western approach, which would have ended state owned media by promoting a free press that is not state owned and operated. On 6 June 1999, and largely from Lesin's background among Video International, Novosti, and VGTRK, Prime Minister Stepashin appointed Lesin to head the Ministry of Press, Broadcasting and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation. After Stepashin's brief tenure, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin retained Lesin as minister and allowed him to be a key figure in the 1999 Russian parliamentary elections and the 2000 Russian presidential election. Through Lesin's support, the pro-Kremlin Unity bloc gained power and the incoming Prime Minister Putin succeeded Yeltsin as the Russian president. Continuing under President Putin from 1999 until 9 March 2004 as Ministry of Press, Broadcasting and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation, Lesin essentially merged a private advertising agency, Video International, which controlled 65‚Äì70% of the television advertising market, with the state owned media companies, and thus brought tremendous wealth to Video International. During Putin's first term as Russian president with Lesin as Minister of the Press, Vladimir Gusinsky's private media holdings, \\"Media Most\\", came under intense scrutiny resulting in numerous charges filed against Gusinsky. In an agreement for the charges to be dropped, Gusinsky's immense private media holdings, \\"Media Most\\", were to be transferred to Gazprom-Media, which, at the time, had recently acquired NTV, the only nationwide state-independent television in Russia and a highly critical opponent of the War in Chechnya, the Kremlin's handling of the Kursk incident, Vladimir Putin, and the Unity bloc.Viktor Shenderovich, \\"Tales From Hoffman\\" (48‚Äì57), Index on Censorship, Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, p. 49. Gusinsky subsequently was brought under arrest as a fugitive from Russia and while incarcerated refused to agree to the terms for the transfer. However, in 2001 with Lesin acting as mediator, \\"Media Most\\" assets were transferred to Gazprom-Media under the terms of Protocol No. 6, which allowed oligarchs to escape prosecution and be given the freedom to leave the country if they turned over their assets to the state. In the 2002 Telegrand (), the Expert Council of the National Research Center of Television and Radio named Lesin as \\"the most influential person of Russian television and radio\\". Under Putin from 6 April 2004 until 18 November 2009, he became adviser to the President of the Russian Federation for mass media relations. During his tenure and beginning in 2005, Lesin helped conceive and create the RT (Russia Today) television news network, he said, \\"to establish a news channel that would counter CNN and BBC with a Moscow spin. It's been a long time since I was scared by the word propaganda. We need to promote Russia internationally. Otherwise, we'd just look like roaring bears on the prowl.\\" From 2010 to 2011, Lesin was on the board of directors for National Telecommunications (NTC), which at the time belonged to the National Media Group. In 2011, he moved to Beverly Hills, California, and enjoyed ocean fishing, being with his family, and helping his son Anton in the Hollywood movie business. Lesin's old friend Alexander Shapiro, a former vice president of Warner Bros., is a co-producer with Anton in several films. In 2013, he returned to Russia and, from 1 October 2013 until 12 January 2015, was head of Gazprom-Media, a state- controlled media giant that describes itself as one of the largest media groups in Russia and Europe. In April 2014, he became chairman of the Russian Association of Film and Television Producers. He resigned from Gazprom-Media in December 2014, citing family reasons. After retiring, he spent several months in Switzerland for treatments to a spinal injury that he received while skiing and then returned to his home in California. Corruption allegations Lesin led the Kremlin's efforts to censor Russia's independent television outlets, according to accusations by Senator Roger Wicker (Republican of Mississippi) in 2014. Wicker called on the Justice Department to launch an investigation into Lesin and his immediate family over allegations of corruption and money laundering. In a 29 July 2014 letter to then-Attorney General Eric Holder, Wicker wrote Lesin and his immediate family had \\"acquired multi-million dollar assets\\" in Europe and the United States \\"during his tenure as a civil servant,\\" including multiple residences in Los Angeles worth $28 million. On 3 December 2014, Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik replied to Senator Wicker's letter by stating the Justice Department's Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been referred for appropriate disposition of Lesin and \\"similarly situated Russian individuals and companies with assets in the United States that may be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Anti-Money Laundering Statutes.\\" The properties are: * $13.8 million house of at 10 Beverly Park, Beverly Hills, California * $9 million house of at 321 Bristol Avenue, Brentwood, Los Angeles, California * $5.6 million house of in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, California * $4.3 million house along Mulholland Drive at 13327 Java Drive, Beverly Hills, California * $3.995 million house of in Palisades Highlands, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California It's unclear if the FBI ever initiated a probe. Death Lesin was found dead before noon on Thursday, 5 November 2015, in The Dupont Circle Hotel in Washington, D.C. He was found without any identification in a hotel room that was in his name. The original police report indicated an unknown victim in the room which was booked in his name. On 7 November, a member of the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., confirmed the identity of the individual as Mikhail Yuriyevich Lesin. A law enforcement official said there were no obvious signs of forced entry or foul play in his hotel room and that on the video surveillance, Lesin appeared disheveled when he returned to his hotel room. Russian News Agency TASS reported that an early investigation did not find any signs of violent death, quoting a police spokesman, Sean Hickman, as saying security had not seen anything suspicious. The spokesman said the nature of the investigation could change, depending on what was found at the scene and after an examination of the body. On Friday, 6 November, RIA Novosti reported that Lesin died of a heart attack citing a spokesman for the family as saying: \\"Today, Mikhail Lesin died ... His death came supposedly from a heart attack.\\" Washington's Metropolitan Police Department opened a \\"death investigation\\". Russian officials said they would work with U.S. authorities to determine the circumstances of the death. On 7 November, the Kremlin released official condolences from president Vladimir Putin: \\"The president appreciates the enormous contribution made by Mikhail Lesin to the formation of modern Russian media.\\" On 10 March 2016, Mashable stated that they had been informed by Beverly Fields that Lesin's cause of death was \\"blunt force injuries to the head,\\" and that Lesin's body showed signs of \\"blunt force injuries of the neck, torso, upper extremities and lower extremities.\\" During a 10 March press conference, LaShon Beamon, spokesperson for the department of forensic sciences in the medical examiner's office, and Hugh Carew, a spokesman for the police, released an official joint statement that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head but the manner of death was still classified as \\"undetermined.\\" On 28 October 2016, after a year-long investigation, Washington's chief medical examiner and federal authorities released a joint statement saying Lesin died of blunt-force trauma to his head, sustained in his hotel room induced by falls amid acute ethanol intoxication. The investigation found Lesin had been on a days-long alcohol bender, saying: :Mr. Lesin entered his hotel room on the morning of Nov. 4 ‚Ä¶ after days of excessive consumption of alcohol and sustained the injuries that resulted in his death while alone in his hotel room... [he] died as a result of blunt force injuries to his head, with contributing causes being blunt force injuries of the neck, torso, upper extremities, and lower extremities, which were induced by falls amid acute ethanol intoxication.\\" Lesin is buried in Los Angeles. Murder allegations In July 2017, BuzzFeed reported that multiple intelligence agencies believed Lesin was assassinated. An unnamed FBI agent told BuzzFeed, \\"What I can tell you is that there isn't a single person inside the bureau who believes this guy got drunk, fell down, and died. Everyone thinks he was whacked and that Putin or the Kremlin were behind it.\\" The weapon was said to be a baseball bat. In 2018, BuzzFeed published details of a leaked report written for the FBI by Christopher Steele. The secret report, unconfirmed by the FBI, alleges that Lesin was bludgeoned to death by men working for an oligarch close to Putin. The report says the men were ordered to scare but not kill Lesin, but went too far. It says the hit men were Russian state security agents moonlighting for the oligarch and that the death occurred just prior to a scheduled meeting between Lesin and U.S. Justice Department officials to discuss the inner workings of RT. According to BuzzFeed, three other people told a similar story to the FBI, independent of the Steele report. Lesin's autopsy report was released in 2019 after a protracted 2-year legal battle by RFE/RL which filed a Freedom of Information Act request. Multiple forensic pathologists and medical examiners who saw the released autopsy results raised questions about the official conclusions, and said the evidence suggested possible murder and not a drunken fall. For example, there was a broken neck bone that rarely breaks in falls, but does break commonly during strangulation. Other injuries included soft-tissue hemorrhaging on muscles running along the sides and back of the neck, also similar to what is seen during strangulation.  Family  Lesin was from a Jewish family. He was married to Valentina Ivanova and had a daughter, Catherine, from his first marriage in 1979; and a son, Anton, from his second marriage in 1983. Lesin had five grandchildren at the time of his death. Catherine, aka Yekaterina/Ekaterina Lesina, led the RT bureau in the United States. Anton attended a Swiss university and is a producing graduate of the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles. Since 2012, Anton has been a Hollywood film producer, with credits including Rage (originally Tokarev), Haunt, Sabotage, Fading Gigolo, Fury, Rock the Kasbah, The Family Fang, and Dirty Grandpa. With Bill Block's 2015 departure as CEO from QED International and following Paul Hanson's 2015 departure from Megan Ellison's Annapurna Pictures, Anton and Sasha Shapiro operate QED Holdings as its principal financiers through the global media fund, Media Content Capital (MCC), and formed Covert Media in 2014, adding Paul Hanson as CEO in 2015, to make three to four $10 million to $50 million films a year. He is often credited as \\"Anton Lessine\\". Anton and Swiss wife, Carole, have two children. In 2015, Mikhail had a daughter with Victoria Rakhimbayeva (), a former Maxim model with whom he had been close since mid-2014.

Its most recognizable feature was the bar-and-circle 'roundel' logo. With its origins in the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), the brand was first used by the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) to unify the identity of the previously separately owned and managed London Underground, Metropolitan Railway, bus and tram services. The London Transport brand was extended under the direction of Frank Pick to all aspects of transport operation including poster designs, tickets, train livery, seat upholstery and the station architecture of Charles Holden. When public transport operation was taken over by Transport for London (TFL) from London Regional Transport (LRT) in 2000, the London Transport brand was discontinued and replaced with Transport for London's own branding, which incorporates many features of the London Transport brand including the 'roundel' symbol and the Johnston font. History Origins Many aspects of the London Transport brand had their origins in the UERL. The bar-and-circle 'roundel' logo was first devised in 1908 and was used as part of the name boards at stations. The distinctive design, of a solid red circle and blue bar, enabled the station name to be easily identified. Also in 1908 a consistent logotype was devised, which would later be adopted by LPTB. From the 1910s, the logotype and roundel started to be used together. The roundel was adapted in 1912, influenced by the logo of the London General Omnibus Company. The solid red circle was replaced with a disc and was registered as a trademark. In 1913 Edward Johnston was commissioned to design a new common typeface. The dimensions of the roundel were standardised by the 1920s. Architect Charles Holden incorporated the roundel design into much of the station architecture of the 1920s and early 1930s. The use of modern graphic posters to advertise public transport began in this period is a ratio. Adoption by LPTB The LPTB initially devised its own brand and logo in 1933. This was almost immediately abandoned and the London Underground roundel was adapted for use by the authority under the new trading name London Transport. The London Transport name was added to the logos devised for the trams and buses. In 1935 the bus stop 'flag' was redesigned and simplified by Hans Schleger to include the roundel outline; the design has remained broadly the same since. A standard signs manual was created during this period, codifying the design principles that had developed. Brand development Transport for London branding uses the 'roundel' as a continuation of the London Transport brand style In the post- war period the London Transport brand was passed to the nationalised London Transport Executive (LTE). The austerity of the period caused the authority to seek ways to reduce their manufacturing and maintenance costs; this led to new simplified designs. In 1966 Bryce Beaumont became publicity officer and following his appointment a central marketing department was established. Basil Hooper was appointed as London Transport's group marketing director in 1974. These changes led to an increased use of external agencies for publicity work, including the 1979 \\"Fly the Tube\\" campaign by Foote, Cone and Belding. Legacy Control of public transport in London passed to Transport for London in 2000.

Georgia-Pacific Corp., 28 F.3d 1042 (10th Cir. 1994) was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, which had decided that Rivendell had failed to establish the existence of a trade secret in its customized computer software system, \\"Quote Screen\\", which was used to quote lumber prices to customers.Rivendell Forest Products v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 28 F.3d 1042 (10th Cir. 1994). The Tenth Circuit instead decided that Rivendell had demonstrated that its software was potentially protectable as a trade secret because \\"a trade secret can include a system where the elements are in the public domain, but there has been accomplished an effective, successful and valuable integration of the public domain elements and the trade secret gave the claimant a competitive advantage\\". Background Rivendell was a reload wholesaler actively involved in the lumber industry. Before Rivendell went out of business, it frequently purchased lumber from Canadian mills and transported it to lumberyards it leased. Much like Rivendell, Georgia-Pacific was also a wholesaler and a supplier of lumber. Timothy L. Cornwell was an employee of Rivendell Forest Products that supervised their \\"Quote Screen\\" customer price quoting system (something unique to their industry). The \\"Quote Screen\\" instantaneously quoted customers on lumber and freight prices, thereby giving Rivendell a strong market advantage. Rivendell claimed that the system was responsible for two to three times more sales as a result of its efficiency. Rivendell argued that its software constituted a trade secret. Cornwell left Rivendell in 1990 and was hired by the defendant, Georgia-Pacific. He signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to become a part of Georgia-Pacific Corp., where he was to oversee their marketing department. Speculations of misappropriation of trade secrets arose when a computer system of customer relations‚Äîvery similar to that of Rivendell‚Äîwas developed at Georgia-Pacific. The \\"Quick Quote\\" screen at Georgia-Pacific highly resembled Rivendell's \\"Quote Screen\\". U.S. District Court Case (1993)   Trade secret misappropriation  The plaintiff, Rivendell Forest Products, alleged that the defendant, Georgia- Pacific Corporation, misappropriated its trade secrets. The district court was not persuaded by Rivendell's arguments, writing, \\"Much of the confusion in Rivendell's arguments stems from the fact that when it argues for the existence of a trade secret, it points generally to its software, secure in the knowledge that some part of that software, whether or not appropriated by Georgia-Pacific, contains a trade secret. By contrast, when Rivendell argues that Georgia-Pacific has used its trade secrets, unable to claim the software has been copied or otherwise compromised, Rivendell focuses broadly on the concepts and ideas contained in the software\\".Rivendell Forest Products. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 824 F. Supp. 961 (D. Colo. 1993). Rivendell claimed that its trade secret was its Quote Screen's unique method of concept integration. As a result, databases and functions were developed giving Rivendell its industry superiority. These ideas and concepts included automated board footage conversions, calculation of the dollar value per item per thickness/width, customer delivery prices, calculation of weight per bundle, inventory availability, and discount analysis. It was then determined by Georgia-Pacific, which Rivendell did not dispute, that the two Quote Screen systems only had two common attributes: bundle sizes and board-footage conversions. These two attributes were determined to be standard constraints of the lumber industry and thus public knowledge. The district court acknowledged that a unique combination of public domain elements could constitute a trade secret, but insisted that Rivendell had failed to adequately specify what that unique combination was or how it provided them with a competitive advantage. The court wrote, \\"It would make little sense to allow individuals to throw veils of secrecy around the most common things, all in an attempt to establish their claim to a trade secret and then to prohibit others from appropriating their 'secret.' But \\"simply to assert a trade secret resides in some combination of otherwise known data is not sufficient, as the combination itself must be delineated with some particularity in establishing its trade secret status\\".Jostens, Inc. v. Nat'l Computer Sys., Inc., 318 N.W.2d 691, 699 (Minn. 1982). Appellate Decision (1994)   District Court Decision Reversed On June 30, 1994, the Appellate Court reversed the 1993 decision on the grounds that Rivendell's trade secret could consist of a combination of elements in the public domain. They state that the \\"unified process, design and operation of which, in unique combination\\", can in fact afford, \\"a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret\\".Imperial Chemical Indus., Ltd. v. Nat'l Distillers & Chemical Corp., 342 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1965). The secret combination of public domain elements had in fact given Rivendell a valuable competitive advantage. For these reasons, the Court of Appeals held that Rivendell had demonstrated that its software was protectable as a trade secret, but the court remanded to the district court the question of whether sufficient secrecy was maintained by Rivendell. A rehearing was requested and denied on August 1, 1994. Effect These cases represent the complex issues that may arise in asserting a trade secret in software that merely uniquely combines public domain elements. The Tenth Circuit's opinion is cited for the proposition that a trade secret may include a combination of elements which are generally known to the public.U.S. Attorneys' Bulletin, The Economic Espionage Act of 1996: an Overview.

He was of great historical importance in the commercial, civic, political, and industrial development and growth of the state of Illinois and the American Midwest, during both the nineteenth century and the twentieth century. John Whitfield Bunn was born June 21, 1831, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.James Alfred Ellis, \\"History of the Bunn Family in America\\" (Publisher: Romanzo Norton Bunn) (1928) P. 210 (See: Ancestry.com). Although every one of the business institutions co-founded or built by the Bunn Brothers has ceased to exist, and fallen purely into the realm of history, each of these businesses left an important legacy of honorable industrial, commercial, and civic vision for Illinois, the Midwest, and the United States. Jacob Bunn (March 18, 1814 ‚Äì October 16, 1897),Cemetery Marker for Jacob Bunn, Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Illinois. an older brother of John Whitfield Bunn, was also an important Illinois industrialist, financier, and close friend of Abraham Lincoln.See generally: James Alfred Ellis, \\"History of the Bunn Family in America\\" (Romanzo Norton Bunn, 1928) (See: Ancestry.com).  Early life and early business experiences  John W. Bunn was the third son of Henry Bunn and Mary (Sigler) Bunn, both of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The Bunn family was Presbyterian, and they recorded the baptisms of several children in a Presbyterian Church located at one time in Alexandria, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.James Alfred Ellis, \\"History of the Bunn Family in America\\" (Publisher: Romanzo Norton Bunn) (1928) P. 200 (See: Ancestry.com).

Henry Bunn was the son of Jacob Bunn (born 1736; died 1808) and Maria Elizabetha (surname unknown) (born 1744; died 1817). Henry Bunn married Mary Sigler (born April 7, 1788; died July 31, 1833). Henry Bunn and Mary (Sigler) Bunn owned a prosperous farm in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, and at the time of Henry Bunn's death in 1859 he left an estate valued at a quantity in excess of $34,000. There exists evidence that Henry Bunn, the father of Jacob Bunn, John Whitfield Bunn, and George Whitfield Bunn, engaged in the banking business in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.Last Will and Testament of Henry Bunn, 1859. Bunn Genealogical Records. Jacob Bunn married Elizabeth Jane Ferguson (born May 12, 1832; died 1885), daughter of Benjamin Ferguson and Sarah (Irwin) Ferguson, both natives of Washington County, Pennsylvania. Benjamin Ferguson was a building contractor who contributed to the construction of the old Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. Sarah Irwin was the sister of the bankers and merchants Robert Irwin (born November 7, 1808; died 1865) and John Irwin (born January 20, 1804; died 1857). Robert Irwin acted as the personal debt collector for Abraham Lincoln, and served as a member of the board of directors of the State Bank of Illinois. The Irwins were all natives of Monongahela City, Pennsylvania, were Presbyterian, and were of Scottish origin. A daughter of Robert Irwin married William Marston, a Wall Street speculator and financier who often worked in partnership with Cornelius Vanderbilt, and who was responsible for the nearly $7 million stock price rally of the Michigan & Prairie du Chien Railroad Company in 1865. William Marston gained a personal profit of between $1 and $2 million, in 1865, from the artificial rally, which he manipulated and caused when he rapidly purchased nearly 22,000 shares of stock in the Michigan & Prairie du Chien Railroad Company. The Irwin family also was interconnected with the Holden Family of Cleveland, Ohio, which owned the Island Creek Coal Company, the Pond Creek Coal Company, and the Forest City Publishing Company, publisher of The Plain Dealer newspaper, and the Hollenden Hotel. John Bunn spent his childhood and early adulthood on the family farm located near Milford, New Jersey. In 1847, at the age of 16, John W. Bunn left New Jersey to join his older brother Jacob Bunn in the wholesale grocery trade in Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois, having been induced to make the migration to Illinois by the positive and promising description that Jacob Bunn had furnished during a return visit to the New Jersey farm where both men had been raised. In 1858, John W. Bunn achieved the status of partner in the wholesale grocery firm of \\"J. Bunn Company.\\" The Springfield, Illinois, grocery enterprise altered its corporate name to reflect the new change in partnership, changing its official name to \\"J. & J. W.

The Sangamo Electric Company was organized on 11 January 1899 in Springfield, Illinois, by Jacob Bunn Jr., Henry Bunn, Robert Carr Lanphier, and inventor Ludwig Gutmann.Sangamo: A History of Fifty Years (1949). The corporation grew institutionally as a division of the Illinois Watch Company, and developed global presence in the electric metering industry and defense industries. By the middle of the 1920s, Sangamo Electric had manufactured more than 5,000,000 electric meters.Sangamo Electric Company Advertisement for the Sangamo Electric Clock, dated from the 1920s. Sangamo made many important contributions to national defense during World War II, and developed the mercury watthour meter (1905), the sulphur-impregnated cylindrical paper condenser meter, different types of magnetos, amperehour meters, and the Delco amperehour meter for the first electric starters used in automobiles. The company eventually had a presence in nearly every major country of the world by 1939. Sangamo Electric Company made many major contributions to the aircraft components industries of the United States, and Henry Bunn, the son of Jacob Bunn Sr., was an aviator and entrepreneur whose vision for Sangamo Electric was crucial to the entrance of the company into the aviation industry. Furthermore, Sangamo Electric Company acquired Capitol Aviation, Inc., a general fixed-base operator (FBO) with offices throughout the United States. The name and logo of Sangamo Electric has been reborn with Sangamo BioSciences, founded by Edward Oliver Lanphier II, great-grandson of Sangamo Electric founder Robert Carr Lanphier Sr.  Springfield Marine Bank  Bunn served for many years as President and director of the historically significant Springfield Marine Bank of Springfield, Illinois.Illinois State Historical Society, Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Volume 9 (1917) P. 86 As President of the Springfield Marine Bank, which was the oldest bank in Springfield, Illinois (having been established in 1851), John W. Bunn built the financial resources of the institution successfully.Bankers' Magazine, Vol. 100 (1920) In 1920, the deposit accounts held at the Springfield Marine Bank amounted to approximately $5 million.  Selz, Schwab & Company of Chicago  Eventually, John W. Bunn expanded his activities to include numerous industrial and financial contributions to the economic growth and development of Chicago, Illinois. Bunn acted as a founding member of the shoe and boot manufacturing firm of M. Selz & Company, and held the executive position of Vice President with the shoe manufacturer for several years prior to his death. The Chicago firm, known later as Selz, Schwab & Company, rapidly achieved international scope in its markets, and extraordinary magnitude and profitability in its manufacturing business.James Alfred Ellis, \\"History of the Bunn Family in America\\" (Publisher: Romanzo Norton Bunn) (1928) P. 212 (See: Ancestry.com). The Selz, Schwab Company at one time owned and operated eleven factories, and after the company dissolved and ceased to exist, during the Great Depression, one of the factories was transferred to five employees who had begun their careers with the firm as office boys.The Gettysburg Times (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania), April 11, 1930 (See: Ancestry.com). Prior to 1894, the Selz, Schwab Company had generated annual revenues in excess of $2 million.United States Congress Bulletin: Senate, Committee on Finance (1894), P. 80 The Selz, Schwab Shoe Company once enjoyed the status of being one of the largest shoe and boot manufacturers, if not the largest shoe and boot manufacturer, in the world, and was known to have filled individual foreign country orders to the scale of 1 million pairs of shoes, and 500,000 pairs of shoes.Andover Free Library Online The corporate revenue was a multimillion- dollar figure in the early twentieth century, and the corporation rapidly grew to be one of the largest manufacturing concerns in the United States.

It is a brick Colonial Revival structure built at the end of the 1930s, serving the 12302 ZIP Code, which covers the village and some surrounding areas of the Town of Glenville. It is one of five nearly identical post office buildings across the state, all featuring elaborate detail and decoration. In the lobby a mural depicts a 1690 confrontation between Native Americans and an early settler family. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2009 the Postal Service announced that it was considering closing it down, sparking a community effort to save it. Building The post office occupies a small lot at the western corner of Mohawk and Center Street. The neighborhood, the village's downtown, is a mix of small commercial and residential structures. To the building's west is a house; to its north a parking lot. It is set back slightly from the street, with landscaping and plantings in front. The building itself is a one-story, five-by-five-bay steel frame building on a poured concrete foundation faced in brick laid in English bond with a hipped slate roof pierced by two zinc-coated ventilators. The hipping is lower over the three central bays on the rear; a one-bay loading dock projects from that area. A molded brick watercourse sets off the basement, and the roofline is marked by a corbeled course giving the effect of a denticulated cornice. The western (front) facade is symmetrically composed around a centrally located, recessed segmented arch with a lintel of radiating voussoirs. A carved metal eagle is situated above the door in front of the transom. A row of stars is set in the arch above, and \\"SCOTIA, N.Y. 12302\\" is etched on the glass in the transom. Metal lettering saying \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE\\" is above the door, with \\"SCOTIA\\" on either side. The windows on all facades are similarly shaped and decorated. Small brick corbels between the window openings suggest brick piers with denticulated capitals, and the recessing and arching of the windows combines with this to suggest an arcade. Concrete steps with modern railings rise to the entrance, with a recently added wheelchair ramp coming in from the north. The original lampposts have been mounted on separate pedestals. The modern aluminum and glass door leads into a wooden vestibule with fluted pilasters and a curved ceiling. The lobby itself takes up four of the five bays of the facade, with the postmaster's office occupying the building's southeast corner. A modern plywood wall has been built on the west with a partition and sliding doors further subdividing the space. New teller windows and Formica countertops have been added, but the original wooden customer tables remain. Also original are the finishings, from the terrazzo floor to the marble base and counter height dado that rise to a plaster ceiling with cornice. On the east wall is a mural, The Glen Family Spared by French Indians, above the door to the postmaster's office. History As Scotia grew into a broom-making center during the 19th century, its postal needs were easily handled by a small building at what is now 109 Mohawk Street. In 1935, as a relief measure during the Depression, Congress authorized construction of the current building, replacing an old house and garage at the site. Louis A. Simon, then Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department, handled the design, as he did for many of the other post offices built in New York during the 1930s. His design for Scotia's was almost identical to one used for four other post offices in small communities around the state: Akron, Horseheads, Middleburgh and Oxford. All are modestly scaled brick Colonial Revival buildings, showing no original variations save for minor later alterations. Construction did not get underway until 1939, at a time when Congress was scaling back on new post office construction in anticipation of war. The local firm of Loucks and Clarks was awarded the contract and finished the building the following year, making it one of the last to be completed in the state under a Depression-era relief program. It was originally considered a branch of the post office in Schenectady to the southeast, hence its NRHP listing as \\"Scotia Station\\". The next year, 1941, Buffalo artist Amy Jones painted the 5'6\\" by 12' (1.7 by 3.7 m) mural, depicting the sparing of the Glen family during the 1690 Schenectady massacre, a key turning point in the early history of Scotia. She had also painted a similar confrontation between early settlers and Indians for the Painted Post post office, and did at least one other postal mural, in Winsted, Connecticut. In 2009 the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) announced Scotia was one of 600 local post offices around the country it was considering closing because of the difficult economy. The community rallied to persuade the USPS to keep it open, partly because of its historic status. The Schenectady County legislature passed a resolution to that effect, and its leader, Susan Savage, started an Internet petition along with two other legislators.Savage, Susan; \\"Keep the Scotia Post Office open\\", ipetitions.com, retrieved September 20, 2009. The Postal Service has still not taken Scotia off the list of potential closures, as of September.

It features the Hong Kong celebrity, Jackie Chan, who was also the producer of it, while it also features other actors from some of his films. During the same year, the game was later updated and retitled as . Gameplay The controls of the game are similar to that of SNK's earlier installments in their Fatal Fury series (particularly Fatal Fury 2, Special and 3), as well as The King of Fighters franchise. The special actions are also similar to other fighting games from the same era. The presentation and death moves were most likely influenced by that of the success of Midway's Mortal Kombat franchise, though not the first in the genre. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in a standard one-on-one best two-of-three format like most fighting games, but a match can last up to five rounds if there is no clear-cut winner in previous rounds (the game will end if both fighters lose the fifth round and no bonus points will be awarded if one wins the fifth round). Players have a character roster of six characters to choose from at the start, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. In one-player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. After two opponents are knocked out, one out of three versions of Jackie Chan becomes the next opponent. Unlike the Mortal Kombat series, some powerful finishing moves lack blood and gore, and some do not destroy the opponents. The fast- paced action and zooming view are similar to that of numerous Neo-Geo fighting games. Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu is an updated version of The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan that was also released the same year exclusively for the arcades, and was the very last fighting game Kaneko released before their bankruptcy in 2006. It adds a desperation move system, an improved combo system with a special combo counter above the life bars that records the highest number of combos during a match, and an \\"escaping\\" feature where players can struggle out of combos or stand up as fast as possible by rapidly moving the control stick and tapping the buttons simultaneously. Fists of Fire also makes all three versions of Jackie Chan into playable characters expanding the roster up to nine playable characters, and makes adjustments to the character balance by strengthening and weakening the statistics of certain playable characters from the first game, while adding and removing a few moves to some of them. The palettes of Lau, Yeung and Thorston were heavily modified as well. The opening intro is a modified version of the first game's intro, but the rest of the game's graphics are not that different. Characters There are six playable characters to choose from in The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan, and nine in Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire. * (actor: Vincent Lau Tak) - Known for his appearances in Sammo Hung film How to Meet the Lucky Stars (as Leung). In this game, he uses karate. He was later altered in the Fists of Fire update as Dark Lau. * (actor: Yeung Ching-Ching) - Known for her appearance in many Shaw Brothers movies including Clan of the White Lotus (as herself), The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter (as Yang No. 9) and Treasure Hunters (as Jue Gow). In this game, she uses b≈çjutsu. She was later altered in the Fists of Fire update as Shadow Yeung. * (actor: Sam Wong / Ming-Sing Wong) - Known for being one of the former leaders of the well-known Jackie Chan Stunt Team. In this game, he uses kung-fu. He was later altered in the Fists of Fire update as Black Sam. * (actor: Thorston Nickel) - Known for his appearance in Thunderbolt (as Cougar). In this game, he uses traditional martial arts. He was later altered in the Fists of Fire update as Demon Thorsten. * (actor: Kim-Maree Penn) - Known for her appearance in Police Story 3: Supercop as Blonde Gunwoman (uncredited). In this game, she uses professional wrestling. She was later altered in the Fists of Fire update as Dirty Maree. * (actor: Sam Wong / Ming-Sing Wong) - The only original character in the game. In this game, he uses magic. He was later altered in the Fists of Fire update as Evil Lion. Bosses After two opponents have been knocked out, players face Jackie Chan as he uses three different fighting styles in order of appearance. He is unplayable in the original version, but playable in the Fists of Fire update. Known to be very protective of his image, the three variations of Chan cannot be defeated with a finishing move and give the player a thumbs up if he loses a round. * (Yellow) - This version of him appears as the first boss. The fighting style he uses in the game was used in one of his earliest films, Spiritual Kung Fu. * (Violet) - This version of him appears as the second boss. Based on his appearance in Drunken Master and its sequel, Drunken Master II. * (White) - This version of him appears as the third and final boss. He is dressed in his ceremonial suit from Project A. Development While Jackie Chan started the production of his then-newest film Thunderbolt in late 1994, Golden Harvest decided to film in Japan for its several racing and fight scenes. As the film crew traveled to Japan they began a search for sponsors to fund the film, and as they were searching, the video game developer Kaneko was found. While Kaneko agreed to sponsor the film, they penned a mutual deal to create a Jackie Chan-based fighting game. The deal was negotiated by Chan's longtime friend and accomplice Frankie Chan, who also co-produced the game. Due to the timing and relationship between filming Thunderbolt in Japan and signing the fighting game deal, Kaneko brought Jackie Chan and some of his actors and stuntmen of Thunderbolt such as Sam Wong and Thorsten Nickel to the offices in Tokyo in order to start the motion capture work in order to convert them into playable characters. Most of the capturing work took place in Hong Kong during Thunderbolt's production period there. Kaneko's company logo is prominently displayed throughout Thunderbolt. In an interview with journalist Audun Sorlie, actor Thorsten Nickel shed light on the production and launch of the game, which was given a press conference in Sendai where Nickel and Chan were on-hand to give interviews to speak about the experiences of working with motion capture, and to perform a short fight scene demonstration which they hastily choreographed the day prior. During the conference they also revealed details about the then-upcoming Thunderbolt movie. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan on their July 15, 1995 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful arcade game of the year. Computer and Video Games criticized the graphics in Fists of Fire calling them \\"unclean\\" and \\"grain-laden\\" and that the game seemed like a \\"waste of a good license.\\"\\"Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire.\\" Computer and Video Games. May 1996. p.11 The re-release was widely regarded as bizarre and obsessed with Jackie Chan, noting the fact that three different versions of Jackie Chan were playable and Jackie Chan could not be defeated or killed in a fight, only knocked down for a few seconds.

Though the field is adjacent to U.S. Cellular Community Park, it is not owned by the city, but is its own separate entity. It replaced Miles Field, the home of minor league baseball in the city starting in 1979, when the Bend Timber Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League became the Medford A's. After 21 seasons and two name changes, the Southern Oregon Timberjacks moved to British Columbia in October 1999 and became the Vancouver Canadians. Miles Field was demolished in 2004 and is now the site of a Wal- Mart store. The light towers, scoreboard, and foul poles from Miles Field were transferred to the new park. Charter Field Charter Field is a professional-sized all-weather artificial turf baseball field used for only high school and youth baseball games. It is the main field for Cascade Christian High School Challenger baseball (who won the 2012 OSAA State 3A Championship) and occasion site for St. Mary's School Crusader baseball if their home field is unplayable.

It ran along the River Aller and linked Gifhorn with Verden (Aller) via Celle, Schwarmstedt, Rethem (Aller) and Wahnebergen. The line approached and departed from Celle station in a southerly direction, so that through trains had to reverse their direction there. As a result, the Aller Valley Railway was divided into 2 branches without any through passenger trains, which in turn meant that the eastern section from Gifhorn had route number 1724, and the western section to Wahnebergen had route number 1721. In Celle there were connexions to the East Hanoverian Railways, the Hanover‚ÄìHamburg railway, the Celle‚ÄìBrunswick railway and the Kreuzbahn from Celle to Lehrte.  History  The first railway from Hanover to Bremen was to run through the Aller valley based on a plan by Taylor-Vignoles. In the event, however, the railway was built in 1847 along the present-day route via Nienburg. Later plans to build a line from Magdeburg to Bremen through the Aller Valley existed from as early as 1866. However, no concrete efforts were made to build the line until the 1890s. The western section from Verden via Wahnebergen and Schwarmstedt to Celle was opened between 1903 and 1905, the eastern section from Celle to Gifhorn followed in 1913. At Oldau station an industrial siding branched off eastwards to the Einigkeit II (Prinz Adalbert) potash works in Ovelg√∂nne. The mine operated from 1905 to 1925. At S√ºdwinsen station another siding branched off west to the Steinf√∂rde potash works which operated in Wietze-Steinf√∂rde from 1907 to 1923. In the course of building the I/XI Hamb√ºhren air force munitions depot in 1939, a siding was built to transport the raw materials and finished munitions. It left the line in a south- southeasterly direction and ran in a tight curve towards the west. This siding was removed in 1945. During the Berlin Airlift in 1948 a branch was built at Wietzenbruch to the then Royal Air Force Celle, now the Celle Air Base. At the end of the 1950s there were regular train crossings at Schwarmstedt station. Four steam locomotive-hauled trains passed through the station, enabling connexions to be made. That required numerous points, signals and level crossings to be worked in rapid succession. Luggage, post bags and express goods were transshipped. Passenger services were discontinued on the western section after 25 September 1966, and goods traffic from Wietzenbruch to Schwarmstedt ceased on 31 January 1985. Goods trains continued to run from Verden as far as Rethem until 28 May 1994, and from Schwarmstedt to Gilten until 31 December 1993. Other parts of the railway line were completely lifted when it was fully closed in 1995. Between Ahlden (Aller) and D√∂rverden the railway embankment was turned into a cycle path which now forms part of the Aller Cycle Way. The eastern section was closed in 1981. This line too had been largely dismantled. The section from Celle station to the military airfield in Wietzenbruch was operated by East Hanoverian Railways from 1998 until 2005. The track from Celle station to the Airbridge Memorial in Wietzenbruch and from there with a switchback to the airfield was lifted in 2007. The tracks on the Deutsche Bahn land are still there but there is no link to the public railway network.

The Castle originally served as a bastion of the MacDonald family for several centuries and continues to be visited by MacDonald diaspora from around the world who return to West Scotland. The tower house was built near the site that housed the remains of the ancient hero Somerled, the progenitor of the MacDonald clan. Several MacDonald Lords have resided at Saddell over the centuries, once giving refuge to Robert the Bruce for more than a year during the First War of Scottish Independence. History Built by David Hamilton, Bishop of Argyll, between 1508 and 1512, the castle was built from the stones of the ruined Saddell Abbey. The castle was gifted to James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran by Bishop James Hamilton, as payment of debts and taxes in 1556. Later, The Earl of Arran was forced to exchange it with the Chief of Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, James MacDonald in exchange for James's lands on the Isle of Arran. The Castle then became one of several ancestral homes of the MacDonald family in Scotland until it was captured in 1558 by Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, Lord Deputy of Ireland under orders of Queen Mary I of England in retaliation of James MacDonald's involvement in Ireland against the English Crown. Saddell castle was later rebuilt by successive MacDonald lords and it was enlarged together with a trap door in the main entrance passage, which upon activation, sent unwanted visitors into a dungeon which had no exits. In 1607, the Clan Donald lands in Kintyre, including Saddell, were conveyed by King James VI to Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll. The castle fell into disrepair when Saddell House was built c. 1774. The castle was bought and restored by the Landmark Trust, which now rents it out as a self-catering property. It can also be seen in the video for Paul McCartney's hit Mull of Kintyre, with the Campbeltown Pipe Band marching along the beach - a song which became Christmas number one in 1977. Diaspora from Clan Donald (the MacDonald family) continue to make pilgrimages to Saddel Castle every year, in memory of its place in Scottish history. In popular culture A collection of Celtic Fairy tales compiled by Joseph Jacobs in 1892 contains a story (The Sprightly Tailor) that is set around Saddell Castle. According to the tale, a giant monster that struck the castle wall above the gate left the mark of his five great fingers there.

It is a part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and acts as its rapid response unit. The battalion is currently based at Tapa and is commanded by Lieutenant colonel Eero Aija. History Estonian War of Independence In November 1918, Estonian American entrepreneur and scouting enthusiast Henry Reissar returned to Estonia and turned to the Ministry of Defence (then Ministry of War) with a proposition of forming a voluntary military unit, financed by himself, in order to help defend Estonia. Having received such permission, the unit was formed on 21 December 1918, in Viljandi, where the first volunteers took their oaths in the ruins of Viljandi Castle, and Friedrich-Karl Pinka was appointed commander of the newly formed unit. On 3 January 1919, the company-sized unit was sent to the front against the Red Army. On 23 January 1919, a 43-man unit of Scouts captured the Pikksaare Train Station, defended by 524 Red Army troops. The Scouts fought mostly alongside armoured train units and acquitted themselves well in combat, manifesting greater morale than the regular conscript units. The Scouts took part in several major battles including the attack against the Krasnaya Gorka fort in October 1919 and the Battle of Krivasoo in November ‚Äì December 1919. On 1 December 1919, the Scouts Regiment () was formed as a part of the Armoured Train Division. 1920‚Äì1940 After the signing of the Peace Treaty of Tartu, many servicemen were demobilized and returned to civilian life. From 1921-28, the Scouts unit was reduced in size and continued to serve as a part of the 2nd, 5th, 6th and 10th Infantry Regiment. On 1 October 1928, the unit was renamed Scouts Single Infantry Battalion. The battalion was based at Tallinn, from where it was moved to Uuem√µisa in 1932. After the Soviet occupation in 1940, the battalion was disbanded.√ïun, Mati. 2001. Eesti s√µjav√§gi 1920-40.

They parted ways soon after meeting, but reconnected in high school with a shared love of nature and an enjoyment for teaching children. Music was also a constant; they both took piano lessons from the same teacher as children, and also were in the school choir and an a cappella ensemble. After graduating high school, Pond moved to Vancouver to attend the University of British Columbia (UBC), where she received a Bachelor of Human Kinetics degree, after which she started working at the Vancouver Aquarium. Hardy moved to Victoria to attend the University of Victoria, where she received a Bachelor of Arts, with an honours degree majoring in linguistics. After finishing her degree, Hardy then studied at UBC and received a Bachelor of Education degree. She then started teaching in the local school district. Formation and early success In 2003, Pond was working as an environmental educator at the Vancouver Aquarium, and Hardy working as an elementary school teacher in Vancouver, when they had a conversation about using music to educate and teach. Their conversation inspired them to write their first few songs, among them \\"See a Sea Lion\\" and \\"I Wish I Was a Jellyfish\\". They decided the name for their duo should be \\"Bobs & LoLo\\", from nicknames they had in high school. Soon they started to perform their songs in front of friends, at parties, and almost anywhere someone would let them play. They got positive reception, so Pond approached the Vancouver Aquarium where she worked about doing a musical show for children that would educate them about the marine environment. The aquarium agreed, and gave Bobs & LoLo their first steady show, essentially launching their career. On your feet for Bobs & LoLo: Canada.com Musical career Sea Notes (2004) After receiving great reviews for their early performances at the aquarium, they began performing at schools, and private and community events around Vancouver. With popularity spreading rapidly in the community, they decided to record their first album. In 2004 they recorded their debut album, entitled Sea Notes, based entirely on ocean-related material. The album consisted of completely original compositions, composed to introduce kids to a diversity of marine life. In an attempt to make children's music more popular with other ages (especially parents), Bobs & LoLo composed the songs for Sea Notes in a wide range of genres, such as jazz, rock, blues and pop. This proved to be a success with parents, who were happy to finally have children's music they could enjoy listening to with their kids, later proven with numerous Parents' Choice awards. The album was very popular. In the first three years, Sea Notes sold over 6,000 copies; almost unheard of for an independent music release. Bobs & LoLo do it for the kids: Canada.com In April 2009, Bobs & LoLo announced the re-packaging of Sea Notes in eco-friendly materials, including packaging printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified stock, vegetable-based inks, waterless printing technology, and 100% recyclable CD trays.http://bobsandlolo.com/blog/tag/sea-notes-cd/ The Official Blog of Bobs & LoLo Sea Notes goes GREEN! Musical Adventures (2006) Nearly two years after the release of their debut album, Bobs & LoLo began recording their second album, Musical Adventures, released in 2006. This album had the themes of healthy living, conserving wildlife and going green, marking the duo's first departure from ocean-based lyrics. They did, however, keep with their successful musical style employed in Sea Notes; composing songs in various genres with kid-oriented lyrics. After the release of the album, Bobs & LoLo continued to play shows to promote their music. In the year following the release of Musical Adventures, they played over 250 shows all over Canada, from BC to Prince Edward Island. In December 2007 alone they played over 50 shows.

On Your Feet DVD (2007) After seeing the success of Musical Adventures in 2006, Bobs & LoLo decided to create a DVD of 10 music videos of songs from Musical Adventures and Sea Notes. The DVD, titled On Your Feet (from the title track of Musical Adventures), was released in December 2007.

Directed by Toshio Hirata, the film stars Issei Miyazaki, Masaki K≈çda, Yoshie Shimamura, and Taeko Nakanishi, who reprise their roles from the first film, while Kei Nakamura and Takami Aoyama join the cast. In the film, Gen and Ryuta Nakaoka join a gang of orphan scavengers and attempt to save their mother Kimie from radiation sickness, a consequence of her survival of the Hiroshima atomic bombing. Plot Three years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Gen Nakaoka, his mother Kimie, and his adopted brother Ryuta are scavenging for food and scrap metal to sell in the black market as Hiroshima, like the rest of Japan, struggles to rebuild following World War II. While Kimie starts working at a geta factory, Gen and Ryuta attend school in a ruined building, in which they meet a gang of orphaned children and their leader Masa in a hostile first encounter. Gen and Ryuta start a shoe-shining business that Masa's gang disrupts, drawing the attention of policemen who attempt to place them in an orphanage. The brothers fight off the police and hide with Masa and their gang in their shelter, where Gen learns that the orphans pickpocket in the black market in order to survive. Realizing Masa's desperation for quality life, Gen and Ryuta join his gang in solitude. Gen befriends Katsuko, one of the orphans who sustained serious burns in the bombing, and Masa's gang invites Suekichi, a retired journalist who lost his family in the Hiroshima bombing, to live with them. After Gen rallies the orphans into constructing a new home out of wood and other materials from abandoned buildings around town, they raid a potato field at night, but the field's farmers catch them and kill Katchin, a member of Masa's gang, as the orphans retreat. Meanwhile, Gen notices that he can now give Kimie piggyback rides despite being much smaller than her, which leads him to suspect that her health is failing. He and Ryuta learn from doctors that because of the atomic bombing, she is suffering from radiation sickness that progressively worsens with time. Kimie begins to vomit blood after her children come home for dinner one evening, distressing Gen and prompting him to take her to a surgeon, who informs Gen that Kimie has only four months to live. Gen refuses to accept that his mother will die and tries to convince her to let him and Ryuta work in her place, but Kimie insists that she work out of fondness for Gen's late father and the lessons he taught, which moves Gen and Ryuta into assisting her with building geta. Gen, Ryuta, and Masa attempt to steal copper from a shipyard to buy penicillin for Kimie, but their boat sinks as they return from the yard, forcing the trio to return to shore empty- handed. Later, they witnessed the Americans had conducted an improper burial on the remains of the victims who suffered nuclear attack, and were chased off. However, they discover copper bullets in an abandoned firing range, and Ryuta gets Masa's gang to collect them into a wheelbarrow. Gen and Ryuta return home with money for the penicillin, but they discover Kimie in her death throes and carry her to a hospital. Along the way, Kimie dies on Gen's back after urging him to live on without her. Gen has Kimie cremated and races Ryuta, Masa, and the other orphans while reminiscing upon his parents' influence on his life.

The event commemorated the 72nd anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion. in the world. The anniversary show is CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest- running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934. The show consisted of six matches, with the main event being a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair vs. hair match between H√©ctor Garza, Perro Aguayo Jr., and Universo 2000. It also featured four Six-man tag team matches, including a Mini- Estrella match. The show also saw a singles match for the vacant CMLL World Women's Championship. Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Critical appraisal In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, the Weissers give Office Lady Rope Slave a negative review, giving it one and a half points out of four. They judge that Oniroku Dan's script shows none of the style that has made his work popular. They also fault director Fujii as being barely competent. \\"This is truly shabby entertainment,\\" they conclude, \\"There's probably a redeeming maxim stuck somewhere in this mess, but the whole thing is too tasteless and too misogynist for anyone to care.\\" Availability Office Lady Rope Slave was released theatrically in Japan on January 23, 1981.

WLCU/ULCM has offices in many major centers of Lebanese presence worldwide. 1960 - mid-1990s The organization, founded in Beirut, Lebanon in 1960, under the name World Lebanese Union and later in 1973 on the name was changed to World Lebanese Cultural Union to promote the cultural aspects of the Lebanese people throughout the world. It strives to unite descendants of Lebanese origin and friends of Lebanon into one worldwide organization or union with the aim to promote and preserve Lebanese culture and heritage and to ensure its spirit for generations to come. The Lebanese Civil War, deep political and at times confessional differences and Lebanese official government interventions have resulted in resentment and formation of rival groups, although the official historical organization claims it is the only one abiding by WLCU bylaws as amended in 1985 and duly recorded at the Interior Ministry in Beirut. Late 1990s - fragmentation Persistent opposition to the legal status of the officially sponsored WLCU body resulted in late 1990s in a clear rift between some world bodies and the traditional leadership of the WLCU. The splinter groups protested the hegemony of official Lebanese government bodies on the process of decision-making, in clear contravention of the original charter of the organization as a non-political and non-governmental world body representing the Lebanese emigrants independently of the ruling government of the time. The rift expanded further with political affiliations of the official body (during the Presidency of Ahmad Nasser, later replaced by Massaad Hajal) with the sponsorship of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry and Interior Ministry permits, and the opposition WLCU movement run by splinter group Presidents Bechara Bechara, Joe Beayni, Anis Karabet, Elie Hakmeh, Eid Chedrawi (2009) and Michel Doueihi (2012).NNA Lebanon: ŸÖŸäÿ¥ÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸäŸáŸä ÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥ÿß ŸÑŸÑÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ´ŸÇÿßŸÅŸäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖ - ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÜÿß ÿ≥ÿßŸÖŸäÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿπ ÿ≠ŸÇ ŸÑŸÑŸÖÿ∫ÿ™ÿ±ÿ® ŸàÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿ≥Ÿäÿ© ŸÖŸÜ ÿ£ŸáŸÖ ÿ£ŸáÿØÿßŸÅŸÜÿß This latter group is also an INGO associated with the DPI and accredited with the ECOSOC of the United Nations. 2010 - further divisions 2010 general congress of the official WLCU organization resulted in further split from Ahmad Nasser organization with a new splinter group previously running under Nasser to hold its independent congress and election of Albert Matta as President of a third WLCU grouping worldwide.WLCU.ws website: ŸÑÿß ÿµŸÑÿßÿ≠Ÿäÿ© ŸÑŸàÿ≤Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿ±ÿ¨Ÿäÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∫ÿ™ÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸà ŸÑŸÖÿØŸäÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∫ÿ™ÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿßÿ±ŸÉÿ© In November 2012, there was a joint meeting on occasion of Lebanese Independence to unify the faction led by Albert Matta with the historical jurisdiction under Massad Hajal, but no tangible result for unification could be achieved.Sawt al Farah interview with Massaad Hajal, June 16, 2013 On 25 October 2013, the historical jurisdiction held its general assembly in Beirut re-electing its previous president Ahmad Nasser to a new term after the end of the presidency of Massad Hajal.

In the 1991 classification, 34 wines were classified using three categories: Outstanding (A), Outstanding (B), and Excellent. Only one wine was classified as Outstanding (A): Penfolds Grange Shiraz.Langton's Magazine: Classification of Australian Wine V - Historical analysis Langton's sees its classification as \\"loosely modelled on the Bordeaux Classification of 1855\\", but with its regular reclassifications it is more similar to the Classification of Saint- √âmilion wine, although with several differences: no official governmental recognition, a much wider geographic scope, and with several different wine styles classified using the same categories. Langton's Classification of Distinguished Australian Wine II was published in 1996, and included 64 wines in four categories: Outstanding A (three wines), Outstanding, Excellent A, and Excellent. Langton's Classification of Australian Wine III was published in 2000, and included 89 wines in the four categories also used for classifications IV and V; Exceptional (seven wines), Outstanding, Excellent, and Distinguished. From classification III, fortified wines (\\"Port\\") were no longer included. Langton's Classification of Australian Wine IV of 2005 included 101 wines, of which 11 at the Exceptional level. In 2009, Langton's was purchased by Woolworths. Despite concerns raised at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the purchase went ahead, and Woolworths therefore owns the Classification.

The event commemorated the 71st anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion in the world. The Anniversary show is CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest-running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934. The show consisted of six matches, with the main event being a Lucha de Apuestas, elimination match where all four competitors put their mask on the line. The competitors were Rayo de Jalisco Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr., Universo 2000 and Canek. It also featured four Six-man tag team matches, including a Mini-Estrella match. The show also featured CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion √öltimo Guerrero defending the title against L.A. Park. Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992.

After defeating the Carthaginians at the Battle of Syracuse in 397 BC, Dionysius had been expanding his territory and political influence by conquering Sicel lands and planting Greek colonies in northeastern Sicily. Tauromenium was a Sicel city allied to Carthage and in a position to threaten both Syracuse and Messina. Dionysius laid siege to the city in the winter of 394 BC, but had to lift the siege after his night assault was defeated. Carthage responded to this attack on their allies by renewing the war, which was ended by a peace treaty in 392 BC that granted Dionysius overlordship of the Sicels, while Carthage retained all territory west of the Halykos and Himera rivers in Sicily. Background Carthage had intervened in favor of Segesta in 409 BC against Selinus, which led to the sack of both Selinus and Himera in 409 BC. This led to Hermocrates raiding Punic territory, and the retaliation of Carthage saw the destruction of Akragas, Gela and Camarina by 405 BC, when a peace treaty ended the war with Carthage in control of much of Sicily and Dionysius to power in Syracuse. After strengthening Syracuse between 404‚Äì398 BC, Dionysius attacked the Phoenician city of Motya with an army of 80,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, along with a fleet of 200 warships and 500 transports carrying his supplies and war machines in 398 BC, igniting the first of four wars he was to lead against Carthage.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p47 After Dionysius sacked Motya, Himilco arrived in Sicily with an army numbering 50,000 men along with 400 triremes and 600 transports.Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, pp107 Himilco first stormed Motya, where the mostly Sicel garrison under Biton was easily overcome,Diod. X.IV.55 then lifted the siege of Segesta, and Dionysius retired to Syracuse instead of offering battle in western Sicily against a superior army.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp183 Himilco returned to Panormus, garrisoned the Carthaginian territories, and then sailed to Lipara and collected 30 talents of silver as tribute.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, pp173 The Carthaginian force next sailed for Messana and easily captured and sacked the city. The occupation of Messana gave the Carthaginians control over the Strait of Messina and a harbor that could house their entire fleet, and also put them in a position to hinder naval traffic between Italy and Sicily. The Greeks had controlled this strategic position since 725 BC. The Carthaginians were also in a position to alley with Rhegion, which was hostile to Syracuse. Strategic considerations Himilco chose not to set up base at Messana, he probably was not confident about holding the city this far away from Carthage.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp184 Furthermore, majority of the Greeks of Messana were holed up in the hill fortresses nearby, and reducing them required time, which in turn would enable Dionysius to strengthen himself for the coming battle. The ultimate Carthaginian goal was the defeat of Syracuse, Messana was just a sideshow. Bringing reinforcements from Carthage would be time consuming as Carthage had no standing army and would need time to raise fresh mercenaries, while dividing the field army to Guard Messana would decrease his striking power against Dionysius. Himilco on the other hand could not entirely ignore the hostile Greek fortresses in his rear, as they might cause problems once he left the site. His solution was simple and ingenious at the same time, something that is termed indirect approach.Hart, B.H. Liddle, Strategy 2nd Edition, pp15 The solution Himilco chose to plant a city at Mt. Taurus, where some Sicels had already settled,Diod. X.IV.59 and populated it with allied Sicels and fortified the place, and in doing so killed several birds with a single stone. The city was near enough to block any Greek movements from Messana but was far enough away to fall victim to a surprise attack, and it could serve as a future base of operations. Furthermore, all the Sicels hated DionysiusDiodorus Siculus, X.IV.90 and except those from Assorus, they now abandoned the Greeks and either joined Himilco or went to their respective homes, decreasing the strength of Dionysius without Carthaginians striking a single blow. Epaminondas of Thebes in 370 BC used the same strategy when he rebuilt Messene and founded Megalopolis in Spartan territory after failing to take Sparta by force, and decreased their territory and manpower successfully. Sicels and Greeks: mixed relations Before Himilco built Tauronemium, Dionysius had permitted the Sicels to settle at Naxos, a nearby Greek city Dionysius had sacked and depopulated, an act that apparently did not impress the Sicels, and they chose to join Himilco at the first opportunity. Their past history with the Greeks may have been a reason. Naxos was the first Greek colony in Sicily, settled in 734 BC on Sicel land. From that date Sicels had been the victims of Greek aggression. Leontini was the next colony, settled by Naxos, where the Greeks promised to live in peace with the Sicels. The Greeks at Leontini got colonists from Megara (who later founded Megara Hyblea) to drive the Sicels out of that city.Polyneaus V.5.1 On the other hand, Sicels also lived on friendly terms with Greeks, Hippocrates had hired Sicel mercenaries to fight both Sicels and Greeks and slaughtered the Sicel mercenaries when convenient,Polyneaus V.6.1 Sicels and Greeks of Camarina also banded together to fight Syracuse, and much of Greek culture was absorbed by Sicel communities. The Greeks joined hands to defeat Ducetius, a Sicel warlord who tried to create a united Sicel state in the 440s. Dionysius had attacked the Sicels towns of Herbessus,Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.7 HennaDiodorus Siculus, X.IV.14 and HerbitaDiodorus Siculus, X.IV.15 prior to starting the war with Carthage, so the Sicels had cause to hate him.Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.58 Sicily during 396‚Äì394 BC The Carthaginians moved south towards Catana after the Sicels were secure at Tauromenium.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p173 Dionysius moved his forces to Catana also but, due to the rash tactics of his brother Leptines, the Greek fleet was heavily defeated at the naval battle of Catana.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p53-54 The Sicilian Greek cities which had become tributary to Carthage after 405 BC had all revolted in 398 BC, and along with the Sicels and the Sikans had joined Dionysius in his attack against Motya. After the defeat at Catana the Sicilian Greek soldiers returned to their respective homes when Dionysius decided to withstand a siege in Syracuse against their wishes. The Sicels had also turned against Dionysius after the establishment of Tauromenium and had sent soldiers to help Himilco during the siege of Syracuse in 397 BC. Himilco besieged Syracuse itself in the autumn of 397 BC. After the Carthaginian forces were devastated by a plague, Dionysius managed to decimate the Punic fleet and shut up the army survivors in their camp in the summer of 396 BC. Himilco, after bribing Dionysius, fled to Africa with Carthaginian citizens, while Dionysius enslaved the abandoned Carthaginian soldiers. Carthage: plagued by problems The return of Himilco after abandoning his troops at the mercy of Dionysius did not sit well with the Carthaginian citizens or their African subjects. Himilco publicly took full responsibility for the debacle, dressed in rags visited all the temples of the city pleading for deliverance and finally committed suicide. The divine was not mollified as a plague swept through Africa weakening Carthage further, and to top things off, the Libyans, angered by the desertion of their kinsmen in Sicily, gathered an army numbering 70,000 men and besieged Carthage itself. Mago, the victor of Catana, (and possibly a member of the Magonid family)Lancel, Serge., Carthage A History, pp114 took command. The standing Punic army was in Sicily and recruiting a new one would have been time consuming and probably very costly (Himilco's abandonment of mercenaries would have made mercenaries wary), so he rallied Carthaginian citizens to man the walls while the Punic navy kept the city supplied, as the Libyans had no ships to counter the Carthaginian fleet. Mago then used bribes and other means to quell the rebels. Mago in Sicily After securing the safety of Carthage, Mago moved to Sicily, where the Punic city of Solus had been sacked by Dionysius sometime in 396 BC. Carthage was unwilling or unable to provide Mago with additional forces, and he had to make do with the Punic garrison left by Himilco and whatever forces he could gather in Sicily.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol IV, p169 The Carthaginians caught a break when Dionysius chose not to invade the Punic territories in western Sicily immediately lifting the siege of Syracuse. The Elymians had stayed loyal to Carthage since the start of the war, while the Sicilian Greeks and Sikans were not threatening and most of the Sicels were not hostile when Mago arrived in Sicily. Instead of trying to recover the lost Punic conquests through force, Mago adopted a policy of cooperation and friendship, giving aid to Greeks, Sikans, Sicels, Elymians and Punics regardless of their prior standing with Carthage. Many of the Greeks had been victims of the duplicity and aggression of Dionysius (he had destroyed Greek cities Naxos, Leontini and Catana and driven out the population) and even preferred to live under Punic rule.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol. 4, pp58 ‚Äì pp59 The Carthaginians allowed Greeks from Naxos, Catana and Leontini, made refugees by Dionysius, along with Sicels and Sikans to settle in Punic territory, while alliances were made with Sicel tribes being threatened by Dionysius.Diod. X.IV.90 The Greeks cities, free of Carthaginian over lordship since 398 BC, now moved from a pro Syracuse position to a neutral one, either feeling threatened by Dionysius or because of the activities of Mago.Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.88 Syracuse: Dionysius secures position Dionysius did not immediately attack Punic Sicily after lifting the siege of Syracuse in 396 BC, although no formal treaty had been made ending the war with Carthage. The war had been costly and he may have been short of money, he also had to deal with a revolt of his mercenaries, and furthermore, he feared a fight to the finish with Carthage as it might end up finishing him.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol. 4, pp149 ‚Äì pp151 After securing Syracuse and resettling the rebellious mercenaries at Leontini (or having them killed after taking them to Leontini in the pretext of handing the town to them),Polyainos V.2.1 Dionysius began to secure his position in eastern Sicily. Campaigns of Dionysius The city of Rhegion, which is situated across Messana in the Italian mainland, was hostile to Dionysius because the tyrant was responsible for the destruction of Naxos, Catana and Leontini, fellow Ionian Greek cities of Sicily. Rhegion had aided the Syracusan rebelsDiodorus Siculus, X.IV.8 in 403 BC against Dionysius (ironically Carthage helped bail Dionysius out) and had launched an unsuccessful campaign against Syracuse in 400 BC.Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.40-41 Furthermore, Dionysius held a personal grudge: The citizens of Rhegion told him to marry their hangman's daughter when he sought a wife from Rhegion.Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.44, X.IV.07 The destruction of Messana had left Rhegion in a position to dominate the Strait of Messina, and Carthage with an opportunity to join hands with Rhegion and threaten Syracuse from the north, just as Anaxilas of Rhegion had done in 480 BC against Syracuse before the 1st battle of Himera. Securing the north Dionysius chose not to attack Carthaginians in western Sicily while the threat of Rhegion forcing a two front war on him existed, instead he rebuilt and repopulated Messana with 1,000 colonists from Locri and 4,000 Medma from ItalyFreeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol IV, pp152 and some from Messene in mainland Greece, who were later relocated to Tyndaris when Sparta objected to settling the Messenians in Messana.Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.78 The original inhabitants of Messana, homeless since the sack of their city in 397 BC, were settled at Tyndaris, another city built by Dionysius after he forced the Sicel city of Abacaenum to cede lands to the new colony in 395 BC, which eventually housed 5,000 citizens.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, pp 153- pp156 The founding of Messana and Tyndaris helped secure the north eastern coast of Sicily for Dionysius. Rhegion, fearing Dionysius might use Messana as a base against them, planted the Greek colony of Mylae between Messana and Tyndaris and populated the city with the refugees of Naxos and Catana,Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.87 thus reducing the territory of Messana. The colonists of Mylai, aided by Rhegion and led by the exiled Syraccusan general Heloris, attacked the acropolis of Messana, but the Mesanians, aided by some mercaneries of Dionysius, were victorious; the Messanians then attacked Mylae, which surrendered, the inhabitants were allowed to leave, and many took refuge with the Sicels.Diodorus Siculus X.IV.87 Prelude to Tauromeniun Dionysius attacked the Sicels and took Smeneous (exact location unknown) and Morgantina, around which the Punic city Solus and Sicel city Cephaleodium were betrayed to him, and the Sicel town Enna was sacked with the booty used to fatten his coffers. Syracusan territory by now had expanded to border Agyrium. Agyris, tyrant of Agyrium was a ruthless man, having become rich after killing the leading citizens of Agyrium, commanded 20,000 citizens and many fortresses and was second only to Dionysius in Sicily.Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.95 Furthermore, Agyris had aided the Campanian mercenaries sent by Carthage to rescue Dionysius in 403 BC (when the Greek rebels had him besieged in Syracuse and he was close to capitulating),Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol. 4, pp18 ‚Äì pp21 so Dionysius had a personal debt to consider. Sicel allies of Syracuse Dionysius chose not to provoke Agyris or Damon, ruler of Centuripae but made alliances with the Sicel cities of Agyrium, Centuripae, Herbita, Assorus (this city had stayed loyal to Syracuse after other Sicels had deserted to Himilco when Tauromenium was founded in 397 BC)Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol. 4, pp107 and Herbessus, creating a buffer zone for Syracuse in central Sicily. Thus having created a buffer in Central Sicily, Dionysius resolved to deal with Rhegion. Tauromenium was sitting between the territory controlled by Syracuse and could hinder Syracusan army/fleet movements, so Dionysius chose to attack the enemy nearest to Syracuse first in the winter of 394 BC. Opposing forces Dionysius had mustered an army of 40,000 foot and 3,000 horsemen,Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, p93 from both citizens and mercenaries (at least 10,000, if not more)Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp178 for attacking Motya in 398 BC, perhaps along with 40,000 Greek, Sicel and Sikan volunteers.Diodurus Siculus, X.IV.47 At Catana in 397 BC Dionysius commanded 30,000 foot and 3,000 horse, perhaps he was short of cash to hire mercenaries and part of his forces were manning Syracuse. The exact size of the Greeks army in 394 BC is not known, nor is the role played by the Greek fleet. Greek forces The mainstay of the Greek army was the Hoplite, drawn mainly from the citizens by Dionysius had a large number of mercenaries from Italy and Greece as well. Sicels and other native Sicilians also served in the army as hoplites and also supplied peltasts, and a number of Campanians, probably equipped like Samnite or Etruscan warriors,Warry, John, Warfare in the Classical Age, pp103 were present as well. The phalanx was the standard fighting formation of the army. The cavalry was recruited from wealthier citizens and hired mercenaries. Dionysius also had the services of a number of Iberian troops, former members of Himilco's army. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields and short thrusting swords.Goldsworthy, Adrian, The Fall of Carthage, p 32 Dionysius probably had an army which was predominantly made of mercenaries, as Greek citizens liked short campaigns and were reluctant to fight during off season.Freeman, Edward A, History of Sicily Vol. IV, pp164 Sicel warriors The number of Sicels soldiers present at Tauromenium is not known. Large Sicilian cities like Syracuse and Akragas could field up to 10,000‚Äì20,000 citizens,Diodorus Siculus, X.III.84 while smaller ones like Himera and Messana between 3,000Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.40‚Äì6,000Diodorus Siculus XIII.60 soldiers. Tauromenium probably could field a similar numbers like Messana. The Sicels may have come from ItalyThucidides, 3.103.1 and their forces may have displayed Oscan influence. The Sicel tribes lived in villages around a hilltop fort, their citizen force probably built around units of 100 like the Oscans and Latins. Sicel soldiers armed themselves, and may have adopted some Greek style equipment. Poorer citizens formed the infantry while wealthier citizens the cavalry. Like the Samnites,Warry, John, Warfare in the Classical Age, pp 103 Sicels probably had troops armed with 2 javelins (for poking and throwing), while some may have carried longer spear for thrusting, while hide covered round shields carried by both type of troops, who also wore helmets, shin guards and a square breastplate, with wide belts protecting their middle. Some Sicels may have borrowed the cuirass, kepis and greaves from the Greeks. Cavalry wore bronze armour and carried swords and lances.Ray, Fred Eugene, Land Warfare in 5th Century BC Greece, pp 53-54 Sicels may have favored open order ambushes and raids in their mountain homeland, but also formed battle lines when needed with the javelinmen in front and lancers backing them up and cavalry protecting the flanks. Light troops were also used, and in sieges women and children could be sued as impromptu peltasts hurling tiles, bricks and other missiles. Beginning of campaign The Syracusan army approached the city from the south and encamped at the ruins of Naxos and set about cutting off the access to the city. The Sicels put up a stubborn defence; the city was perched on cliffs which were not accessible by siege engines unless siege ramps could be built. Dionysius was not interested in starving the Sicels out and set about planning an assault of the city. Dionysius chose to attack, extend the siege in winter, which was unusual in ancient times as it often meant combating both the elements and the enemy; logistics were also a prime concern as the scope for foraging (crops were not ready for harvest) was limited. However, Dionysius may have based his decision on the fact that the Carthaginians and Rhegians, most likely source of help for the Sicels, would not be prepared for a winter campaign, and the Sicels would be caught off guard as well. Defenses at Tauronemium A generic representation, not to exact scale, geographic features partially shown The city of Tauromenion was built atop the 200 m high Mt. Taurus, surrounded by ravines and walls that covered the most vulnerable places. The main acropolis was built on the highest point and overlooks the town, being 212 m from sea level. The Sicel town is said to have another acropolis, which probably occupied the place of the Greek Theater. The western gate of the city was situated on the south wall. The city overlooked the site of Naxos, which was the first Greek colony in Sicily, and from that place the aggression of the Greeks against Sicels began. The Sicels were determined to hold on to Tauromenium, which was a gift from Carthaginians who had never attacked them, and had enabled them to recapture the lands of their forefathers. Night commando The most famous siege in Greek history, that of Troy, was resolved by a night attack. Dionysius was no stranger to night operations, having twice pulled off the feat at Motya and Syracuse. He had nothing like the Trojan Horse to dupe the Sicels with and was about to find out third time may not be \\"charmed\\" for him. The Sicels had refused to contest the siege openly so the Greeks settled in at Naxos. The snow covered the heights of Mt. Taurus as the winter solstice approached, and the Greeks observed that the guard was slack on one of the forts of Tauromenium. Dionysius chose a moonless, stormy night to scale the walls of the fortress, probably situated on the peak where the Greek Theatre now stands, with a picked group of mercenaries. The cold and the jagged sides of the cliff took their toll in the dark and Dionysius suffered cuts to his face, but the detachment managed to successfully scale the heights and take possession of the acropolis without difficulty. Urban warfare If Dionysius hoped to avoid a fierce urban battle by launching a surprise attack he failed, because just as the Greeks entered the town led by Dionysius the Sicels woke up and began to gather; more soldiers from the Acropolis on Mt. Taurus swelled their ranks and they launched a counterattack. The soldiers of Dionysius, probably tired from their arduous climb, got clobbered, 600 Greeks were immediately cut down and the Sicels sent the survivors tumbling down the side of the mountain. As the Greeks rolled or scrambled down the sides many lost their armor. Dionysius was one of the few who retained their breastplate ‚Äì a small consolation but a matter of pride for him. Tauromenium remained untaken; Dionysius packed up and went home. Aftermath The defeat at Tauromenium had serious consequences. The Greek cities of Akragas and Messana deposed the supporters of Dionysius from power when the news of the debacle became known. The situation worsened when Mago gathered up his forces and raided Messana, but Dionysius defeated the Carthaginians at the Abacaenum to prevent further damage befalling him. Tauromenium remained free for 2 more years before falling victim to super power politics. Caught in a jam at the Battle of Chrysas in 392 BC, both Mago and Dionysius agreed to terms formally concluding the war which started in 398 BC. One on the conditions was Carthage agreeing to Syracusan over-lordship of Sicels. Dionysius occupied Tauromenium in 391 BC, expelled the Sicels and installed his mercenaries on the site. In 358 BC a Greeks town was founded there, and it remained Greek until passing into Roman hands. After settling his affairs in Sicily, Dionysius began a campaign against Rhegion in 390 BC. He failed to take the city in 390 and 389 BC and finally succeeded in 387 BC. Three years later, again he started a war with Carthage that lasted until 375 BC and ended in his defeat.

FEANF was influenced by the French Communist Party, and saw the struggle against French colonialism in Africa as part of a wider struggle against Western imperialism.Schmidt, Elizabeth. Cold War and Decolonization in Guinea, 1946-1958. Western African studies. Athens: Ohio University Press, 2007. p. 127 FEANF played an important role for the formation of communist organizations in Francophone Africa.Martens, Ludo, and Hilde Meesters. Sankara, Compaor√© et la r√©volution burkinab√®. Anvers: Editions EPO, 1989. p. 117 In addition, FEANF largely contributed to creating a centralized voice that united all African student groups in France, while their actions highlighted the greater disparities within the French colonial system. Founding FEANF was founded in 1950, when a preliminary congress was held in April 1950 in Lyon, followed by a meeting in Bordeaux in December 1950. The Bordeaux meeting was attended by cells of African students from Paris, Toulouse, Montpellier and Bordeaux. The Paris group, led by Amadou- Mahtar M'Bow and Louis Atayi, dominated the debates. The Bordeaux meeting adopted the FEANF statues, which called for the unification of all African student associations in France. Among its first goals was to ‚Äúdefend the material and moral interests of the students.‚Äù The statues also stated that FEANF was independent of any political party. The Lyon cell soon affiliated itself to the organization soon afterwards.Dian√©, Charles. Les grandes heures de la FEANF. Paris: Ed. Chaka, 1990. pp. 41-42 First and Second Congresses The first federal congress of FEANF was held March 21‚Äì22, 1951 in Paris. The congress elected an Executive Committee, which included Solange Falad√© (medical student from Dahomey) as President, Amadou-Mahtar M'bow (from Senegal) as General Secretary, N'ki Traor√© (from Guinea, also the Secretary of the RDA Students Association) as Joint General Secretary and Abdou Moumouni (from Niger, also the editor of Les √©tudiants anti-colonialistes) as Treasurer. By the end of 1951 FEANF had around 1,000 members.Dian√©, Charles. Les grandes heures de la FEANF. Paris: Ed. Chaka, 1990. pp. 42-43 Politically, the first FEANF Executive Committee was rapidly seen as very 'moderate'. Its President tried to mobilize a separate structure, GAREP, but failed to gather any sizeable number of followers from the founding core of FEANF. Compared to FEANF, GAREP was reluctant to have contacts with pro-Soviet structures.Bianchini, Pascal. Ecole et politique en Afrique noire: sociologie des crises et des r√©formes du syst√®me d'enseignement au S√©n√©gal et au Burkina Faso (1960-2000). Paris: Karthala, 2004. p. 64 The second FEANF congress was held April 14‚Äì15, 1952. At the second congress, the leadership was taken over by members of the African Democratic Rally (RDA). The organization declared its support for African independence. There was also a notable Senegalese dominance over the new Executive Committee. The medical student Edouard Sankhal√© became the new FEANF Chairman. Mamadou Samb became Vice Chairman. Both Sankhal√© and Samb were also in the RDA Students Association leadership. Alioune B√¢ (law student, later a prominent member of the African Independence Party, PAI) became General Secretary, Youssoupha Sylla (medical student, activist of the RDA Students Association) First Joint Secretary, Babacar Niang (science student, head of the publication La voix de l'Afrique Noire) whilst Abdou Moumouni retained the position as Treasurer. Except for Moumouni, all of these men were Senegalese. After the change in leadership, FEANF began to have contacts with the Prague-based International Union of Students.Dian√©, Charles. Les grandes heures de la FEANF. Paris: Ed. Chaka, 1990. p. 44 Eventually, FEANF became an affiliate of IUS.Wallerstein, Immanuel Maurice.Africa: The Politics of Independence and Unity. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. p. 214 Struggle for Independence In 1954 the General Students Union of West Africa (UGEAO) was founded in Dakar. FEANF and UGEAO worked closely. Both were oriented towards Marxism, and opposed the more moderate line adopted by RDA. In 1956, under the leadership of the Guinean medical student Charles Dian√©, FEANF adopted a more radical line towards demanding independence. The organization opposed the loi Cadre, which it considered as a move to Balkanize Africa. FEANF preferred that rather than creating many separate African states, a federation be created in West Africa.O'Toole, Thomas, and Janice E. Baker. Historical Dictionary of Guinea. Historical dictionaries of Africa, no. 94. Lanham, Md: Scarecrow Press, 2005. p. 85 Gradually FEANF became more vocal in its criticism against the increasingly collaborationist positions of RDA, in spite of the fact that many FEANF leaders had been members of RDA. In May 1958 the FEANF organ L'√âtudiant d'Afrique noire expressed sharp criticism against RDA leader S√©kou Tour√© for not having publicly called for a 'No'-vote (i.e. a vote for independence) in the upcoming constitutional referendum. In June the FEANF leadership decided that the organization would campaign for the 'No'. During the summer vacation, many FEANF cadres travelled to Africa and took part in pro-independence mobilizations there. In August 1958 FEANF took part in forming a united front for campaigning for independence, together with UGEAO, UGTAN, RDA Students Association, RJDA and the African Youth Council.Schmidt, Elizabeth. Cold War and Decolonization in Guinea, 1946-1958. Western African studies. Athens: Ohio University Press, 2007. p. 143 The rift between RDA and FEANF brought FEANF closer to the main rival of RDA, the African Regroupment Party. Among their many initiatives, they strove to improve the standard of living for African students. The grants students received to study in France did not include provisions for housing. Thus, many students struggled to find housing, especially because many landlords were unwilling to rent to Africans. The efforts of the FEANF, along with the government of Dakar and the Ministry of Overseas France, a hotel was purchased specifically for students from French West Africa. In 1951, the Maison de la France d‚ÄôOutre Mer was completed in Paris. Along with housing, FEANF leaders fought for improved conditions within housing. Many African students could not afford heating and suffered from malnutrition. As a result, a large number succumbed to tuberculosis or venereal diseases.  French Administration Response  The French became gradually became suspicious of the organization due to its connections with African nationalist and communist groups. The colonial administration developed a system of surveillance to monitor FEANF activities while keeping positive political relations with the group because they represented most African students in France. They sought to maintain the favor of the leaders primarily through the allocation of funding. French administrators granted financial aid to the FEANF for projects concerning housing for colonial students and ‚Äúcultural care‚Äù programs. These programs provided funding for cultural organizations that focused on African arts and culture; for example, approving a folklore troop‚Äôs request to receive drums from Dahomey. Underscoring the French administrators‚Äô actions was a fundamental misunderstanding between themselves and the FEANF. The French believed that student issues stemmed from psychological problems they encountered due to their in-between status as African elites in a French environment. By providing funding, administrators worked to make students feel at home while remedying the culture shock that could affect student performance in academics and lead to physical sickness. However, as the FEANF sought to expose, their problems stemmed from the discrepancies and consequences of the colonial system. France touted that through Western education, they were guiding the next generation of African leaders. However, these students often left France disillusioned and disenchanted by their poor treatment and the inferior status accorded to them. Even though the French took steps to address the tangible issues affecting African students, they failed to take into account that their colonial system as a whole had put these students in this position in the first place. National Sections FEANF included various territorial/national affiliates. Many of them were French sections of students organization based in the respective territories/countries. As of 1957-1958, the following organizations were affiliated to FEANF; *Cameroon: Kamerunese National Students Union (UNEK) *Chad: Chadian Students Association (AET) *Congo: Congolese Students Association (AEC) *Dahomey: Dahomeyan Students Association in France (AEDF, a section of General Union of Students and Pupils of Dahomey based in Cotonou) *French Soudan: Soudanese Students Association in France (AESF, a section of Soudanese Scholar Union based in Bamako) *Gabon: Gabonese Students Association (AEG) *Guinea: Guinea Students Association in France (AEGF, a section of General Union of Students and Pupils of Guinea based in Conakry) *Ivory Coast: Association of Students of the Ivory Coast (AECI, a section of the Students Union of the Ivory Coast based in Abidjan) *Mauritania: Association of Students of Mauritania in France (AEMF) *Niger: Nigerien Students Association in France (AENF) *Oubangui-Chari: Oubangui Students Association (AEO) *Senegal: Senegalese Students Association in France (AESF) *Togo: Togolese Students Association (AET, more commonly known as Jeune Togo) *Upper Volta: Association of Students of Upper Volta in France (AEVF)Dian√©, Charles. Les grandes heures de la FEANF. Paris: Ed. Chaka, 1990. pp. 55-63 Later phase In 1966 another student movement, MEOCAM, was launched with the objective to compete with FEANF over the influence in the African students community in France. MEOCAM failed to make any lasting impact, though, as it was torn apart by internal conflicts.Bianchini, Pascal.

Paris: Karthala, 2004. p. 123 In its later phase of existence, FEANF suffered from internal divisions and defections. In 1972 there was a dispute between the Dahomeyan and Cameronian students. In 1975 the Central African students disaffiliated from FEANF, followed by the Gabonese in 1977.Dian√©, Charles. Les grandes heures de la FEANF. Paris: Ed. Chaka, 1990. p. 20 In 1980 the organization was 'dissolved' by the French authorities. This move followed the disbanding of the AED (Dahomey) in 1979 and the closure of the UNEECI in earlier in 1980.

He holds two Guinness World Records as the world's fastest painter and the world's most prolific artist. He has also been called the \\"King of Schlock Art\\" and the \\"King of Toilet Paper Art\\" because of a novel means of painting he developed using a palette knife and toilet tissue instead of a paintbrush.  Early life  Katz was born in 1932 in Galicia, Poland. At age 13 he studied under Dr. Hans Fokler of the Munich Academy. After World War II, he lived for a while in a displaced persons camp, where he earned a diploma in carpentry, and he said later that toilet paper was his \\"diploma in art.\\" He moved to the United States in 1949, when he took a job in carpentry while maintaining a sideline with his art. While working on his unpublished Dictionary of Color in 1956, he decided to try painting with his palette knife instead of his brushes. After some time he also began experimenting with the use of rags; when he ran out of rags he turned to toilet tissue. He would use up almost 10000 toilet paper rolls each year for his paintings. As of February 2007, over his career he had painted more than 280,000 paintings. Over his long career, he established himself as a painter, comedian and television personality. An obituary The Jewish Press, Nov. 19, 2010 described him as \\"creating 'instant art' and entertaining generations of guests in the old Borscht Belt hotels.  Instant Art  On May 9, 1988, Katz painted a 12- by 16-inch canvas of a child in just 30 seconds setting a new Guinness World Record. Katz described his method of painting as \\"Instant Art,\\"using the motto Paint it good, paint it fast, and sell it cheap\\" page 3,The Jewish Press,Nov. 19, 2010 because of how quickly he would complete these paintings. In a 1987 event to benefit the Boy Scouts of America, Katz completed 103 paintings (selling 55 of them on the spot) in 12 hours. He is listed as a human oddity in Ripley's Believe It Or Not because of his ability to paint full works of art in less than five minutes. A 2003 review of a serious painting http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/15335/ said \\"Normally this artist's works are notable only for their carefree and speedy execution, but this painting is a welcome exception.\\"  Death  Katz died on November 12, 2010 after suffering a stroke. He was 78.

Video Volunteers is a registered non-profit in the state of New York in the US. History Video Volunteers was founded in 2003 by Jessica Mayberry after she spent a year as a fellow of the American India Foundation training rural Indian women in filmmaking. Video Volunteers originally operated from offices in New York, NY and Goa, India. Mayberry works closely with co-director Stalin K, Indian documentary filmmaker and community radio activist, as well as original co- founder of Drishti Media, Arts and Human Rights. Work Video Volunteers‚Äô provides disadvantaged communities with the journalistic, critical thinking and creative skills they need. VV's models for locally owned and managed media production teach people to articulate and share their perspectives on the issues that matter to them ‚Äì on a local and a global scale. Through communication media, Video Volunteers offers a livelihood option for people from poor areas while also providing a service to those communities. To this end, VV uses their low-cost community media models. Programs File:Vactivthumb.jpg IndiaUnheard, is a program that is constituted of a network of \\"community correspondents\\" who are stringers trained to tell stories about their own communities. IndiaUnheard Community Correspondents make 3-4 min videos for which Video Volunteers pays Rs 1300 each. These videos are later shown on social networking sites and sometimes on TV which link rural communities with a truly global audience. This is the only program that Video Volunteers runs on its own, while all others are run with funding from other NGOs where Video Volunteers is only the trainer. This was Video Volunteers‚Äô flagship Community Video Unit program, created in partnership with many of the leading NGOs in India, establishes and equips locally operated video production units in severely media-deprived areas. By training eight ‚Äì ten local Community Producers that make up each unit in all aspects of video production, this enables them to produce films that address issues relevant to their community, such as child marriage, health, temple prostitution, water, sanitation and women's rights. Regular screenings of the films are held for hundreds of villagers in their locale, followed by solution-centric discussions that transform ideas and images into proactive measures. However, currently none of the CVU are in production for lack of fund. In Eastern Uttar Pradesh, one of the most underdeveloped areas in India, Video Volunteers has initiated, as part of the UNDP-IKEA a large scale micro credit initiative called Saksham. Enterprising women from within the self-help groups formed under the micro credit initiative are given training in photography and video production. By developing communication skills, the project intends women themselves to be able to document and monitor the changes. In 2009 Video Volunteers had this program in partnership with the Brazilian NGO Casa das Caldeiras to launch 'VCU.br. This program selects ten graduates of Brazilian favela media programs and trains them over a course of a year in producing and distributing videos for mainstream TV. The Community Radio Forum-India is a registered association of community radio broadcasters, researchers and advocates in India. Video Volunteers was the secretariat of the Community Radio Forum (CRF) from September 2008 to February 2010, and Stalin K, the Managing Trustee of Video Volunteers, is the former Convener of the forum. CRF believes in the power of community radio, is committed to democratization of India's airwaves and works to enable community organizations to set up their own Community Radio Station. Videoshala started in 2007 as a joint project by Video Volunteers and two Gujarat-based NGOs, Drishti and Udaan. Videoshala is a program that trains community members how to produce educational videos, using the visual medium to incorporate values of democracy, diversity and citizenship in the video kits. Locally trained producers from the community produce the educational videos and screen them in schools. The films are screened to children in 200 schools throughout the state of Gujarat. In the year 2009, Video Volunteers partnered with Global Fund for children (GFC) in a pilot project called Videoactive Girls. Under the project, which was a learning initiative of The Nike Foundation's Brain Trust of Practitioners, VV developed a toolkit on how community-based organizations and the adolescent girls they serve can harness, produce and use the power of the visual media to tell their stories. Research In collaboration with the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India's leading business school, VV implemented a research project to explore methods of evolving community-based media to generate high levels of financial sustainability. IIM's centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship and VV work together to explore methods and possibilities of generating revenue through the mainstream media in collaboration with other NGOs. Another area that the project aims to explore is how such community video businesses can be supported by micro credit lending. Honors and awards Video Volunteers has received grants from the Knight News Challenge and the Echoing Green Foundation. VV won a 2006 Tech Museum Award and the NYU Stern Business School Social Business Plan Competition in 2008.http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/jessica- mayberryhttp://w4.stern.nyu.edu/berkley/bpc.cfm?doc_id=100264 Video Volunteers is active in the US, India, and Brazil, and has partnered with such organizations as Witness, the Global Fund for Children, Pangea Day, MTV, and others. VV was short-listed by the Development Gateway Awards, and in 2008 they were one of the five shortlisted organizations for the King Baudouin Foundation (of Belgium) International Development Prize. #MeToo Allegations In October 2018, multiple allegations of sexual harassment at workplace were made against co-founder Stalin K. While it was publicly announced that he had stepped down as director, internal leaks showed otherwise. The organisation's website continues to list him as 'managing trustee'. In July 2020, the Video Volunteers Board announced in a statement on its website that the Local Complaints Committee at the Office of the Collector North Goa dismissed the charge of sexual harassment against Stalin K. The post also mentioned that this finding was in alignment with the results of a independent investigation by the Video Volunteers Board of Directors[https:www.videovolunteers.org/]. Collaborations Video Volunteers has engaged in partnership, funding, consultancy and training relationships with many leading organizations, including the UNDP, Witness, The Fledgling Fund, the Art Action Foundation of Singapore, The Global Fund for Children, Pangea Day, International Youth Foundation, HIVOS, Creative Visions Foundation and Goethe-Institut. Concepts developed by Video Volunteers have been supported by USAID, UNESCO, and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. In May 2010, Video Volunteers acted as the community media partner for the UN's World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS) Forum. Video Volunteers‚Äô work has been featured on MTV, Nickelodeon, Al Jazeera, The Star Network, Pangea Day, several CNN platforms, prominent Indian news stations, and Current TV.

Like all the nine major routes, the N1 conventionally begins at the Grand Place (Grote Markt) in central Brussels and leads to the Porte d'Anvers (Antwerpsepoort), on the R20/N0 Small Ring Road. The actual trunk road starts off at Sainctelette Square. From there it follows the Avenue du Port (Havenlaan) and Chauss√©e de Vilvorde (Vilvoordsesteenweg) to connect with the R21 Second Ring Road at Van Praet. The road continues its way through the Port of Brussels on the Avenue de Vilvorde (Vilvoordselaan) and passes underneath the R0's tall bridge at Vilvoorde. The N1 then proceeds through Vilvoorde and leaves the agglomeration. Between Vilvoorde and Antwerp the road is called Brusselsesteenweg, Antwerpsesteenweg and Grote Steenweg. It passes through Zemst, crosses the E19 motorway and connects to the R12 Mechelen ring road. From Mechelen the road passes through the municipalities of Sint- Katelijne-Waver, Rumst, Kontich, Hove, Edegem, Mortsel (R11 ring road), Wilrijk and Berchem (R1 motorway and R10 ring road). From there the N1 enters the city of Antwerp as Mechelsesteenweg and joins the central ring road (Britselei/Frankrijklei/Itali√´lei). Leaving Antwerp to the northeast on the Noorderlaan and IJzerlaan, it enters Merksem and continues to Kleine Bareel junction, where it crosses the E19 once again. The final part of the N1 is known as Bredabaan and passes through Brasschaat and Wuustwezel, before crossing the border with the Netherlands near Zundert. In the Netherlands it ought to continue as National Route 8, but the trunk road system has been declassified long ago, leaving the provincial road number N263.

Their validity is somewhat doubtful, as the group was established to separate, out of a large group of closely related Teleostei, a mere two rather peculiarly autapomorphic orders at best. In some treatments, it is even monotypic.Nelson (2006): pp.207-208,212-213 As originally conceived, the \\"Stenopterygii\\" include the Ateleopodiformes and Stomiiformes. Sometimes, the former are removed to form a monotypic superorder Ateleopodomorpha. These lineages are moderately advanced teleosts, but each is uniquely adapted to a deep-water oceanic environment. Their plesiomorphies are similar to the Salmoniformes and other Protacanthopterygii, but plesiomorphic traits are no reliable indicator of a close relationship. Nonwithstanding, the \\"Stenopterygii\\" appear to be close relatives of the Protacanthopterygii. Some cladistic analyses find at least the Stomiiformes deep within the latter superorder.Nelson (2006): pp.207-208,212-213, Diogo (2008) It thus cannot be ruled out that the \\"Stenopterygii\\" are better included in the Protacanthopterygii. An alternative approach is to consider the entire group - \\"Stenopterygii\\", Protacanthopterygii, the monotypic superorders \\"Cyclosquamata\\", and perhaps the monotypic superorders \\"Lampridiomorpha\\" and \\"Scopelomorpha\\" - an unranked clade named Euteleostei. But this would probably require splitting up the Protacanthopterygii, so that each euteleost superorder would at most contain 2 orders (though most would be monotypic), as the relative placement of all these groups is not very well resolved. Such a profusion of monotypic taxa is generally rejected by modern taxonomy, if it is not absolutely required to adequately reflect phylogeny.Diogo (2008) Moreover, owing to the uncertain relationships of the euteleosts to the less advanced Otocephala (which include the superorders Clupeomorpha and Ostariophysi) and the more advanced teleosts (e.g. Acanthopterygii), it may well be that the supposed \\"clade\\" is merely an evolutionary grade. Such a paraphyletic group would according to modern understanding not warrant a taxon name at all. In this case, a possible solution would be to expand the Protacanthopterygii to subsume all the small \\"superorders\\", and to treat the Euteleostei as including the Protacanthopterygii and their more \\"modern\\" relatives.

The Commission has been nicknamed the Angelides Commission after the chairman, Phil Angelides. The Commission has been compared to the Pecora Commission, which investigated the causes of the Great Depression in the 1930s, and has been nicknamed the New Pecora Commission. Analogies have also been made to the 9/11 Commission, which examined the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Commission had the ability to subpoena documents and witnesses for testimony, a power that the Pecora Commission had but the 9/11 Commission did not. The first public hearing of the Commission was held on January 13, 2010, with the presentation of testimony from various banking officials. Hearings continued during 2010 with \\"hundreds\\" of other persons in business, academia, and government testifying. The Commission reported its findings in January 2011. In briefly summarizing its main conclusions the Commission stated: \\"While the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis were years in the making, it was the collapse of the housing bubble‚Äîfueled by low interest rates, easy and available credit, scant regulation, and toxic mortgages‚Äîthat was the spark that ignited a string of events, which led to a full-blown crisis in the fall of 2008. Trillions of dollars in risky mortgages had become embedded throughout the financial system, as mortgage-related securities were packaged, repackaged, and sold to investors around the world. When the bubble burst, hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage- related securities shook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them. This happened not just in the United States but around the world. The losses were magnified by derivatives such as synthetic securities.\\"Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission-Press Release-January 27, 2011 The Commission was explicit in its concerns about insurance giant American International Group, financial giants Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, each of which the government brought under consideration for financial rescue. In April 2011, the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released the Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse report, sometimes known as the \\"Levin-Coburn\\" report. Creation and statutory mandate The Commission was created by section 5 of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-21), signed into law by President Barack Obama on May 20, 2009. That section of the Act: * Set the purpose of the Commission, i.e., \\"to examine the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States.\\" * Set its composition of 10 members, appointed on a bipartisan and bicameral basis in consultation with relevant Committees. Six members are to be chosen by the congressional majority, the Democrats (three of these by the Speaker of the House and three by the Senate Majority Leader) and four by the congressional minority, the Republicans (two from the House Minority Leader and two from the Senate Minority Leader). * Expressed the \\"sense of the Congress that individuals appointed to the Commission should be prominent United States citizens with national recognition and significant depth of experience in such fields as banking, regulation of markets, taxation, finance, economics, consumer protection, and housing\\" and also provided that \\"no member of Congress or officer or employee of the federal government or any state or local government may serve as a member of the Commission.\\" * Provided that Commission's chair be selected jointly by the congressional majority leadership and that the vice chair be selected jointly by the congressional minority leadership, and that the chair and vice chair may not be from the same political party. * Set the \\"functions of the Commission\\" as: * Authorized the Commission to \\"hold hearings, sit and act at times and places, take testimony, receive evidence, and administer oaths\\" and \\"require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, and documents.\\" This subpoena power was also held by the Pecora Commission, but not the 9/11 Commission. * Provided that \\"a report containing the findings and conclusions of the Commission\\" shall be submitted to the President and to the Congress on December 15, 2010, and that at the discretion of the chairperson of the Commission, the report may include reports or specific findings on any financial institution examined by the Commission. * Provides that the chairperson of the Commission shall, not later than 120 days after the date of submission of the final report, appear before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee to testify regarding the Commission's findings. * Provides for the termination of the Commission 60 days after the submission of the final report.

The first meeting of the Commission took place in Washington on September 17, 2009, and consisted of opening remarks by Commissioners. On January 13, 2010, Lloyd Blankfein testified before the Commission, that he considered Goldman Sachs' role as primarily that of a market maker, not a creator of the product (i.e.; subprime mortgage-related securities). Goldman Sachs was sued on April 16, 2010 by the SEC for the fraudulent selling of collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages, a product which Goldman Sachs had created.http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-16/goldman- sachs-sued-by-sec-for-fraud-on-mortgage-backed-cdos.html, retrieved April 19, 2010 February 26‚Äì27 the Commission heard from academic experts and economists on issues related to the crisis.

Writer Joe Nocera of The New York Times praised the commission's approach and technical expertise in understanding complex financial issues during July 2010. July 27, The composition of the commission's staff changed several times since its formation. The executive director J. Thomas Greene was replaced by Wendy M. Edelberg, an economist from the Federal Reserve. Five of the initial fourteen senior staff members resigned, including Matt Cooper, a journalist who was writing the report. Darrell Issa, a top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, questioned the Federal Reserve's involvement as a possible conflict of interest, and there has been disagreement among some commission members on what information to make public and where to place blame. Mr. Angelides called the criticisms \\"silly, stupid Washington stuff,\\" adding: \\"I don't know what Mr. Issa's agenda is, but I can tell you what ours is.\\" In a joint interview the commission's chairman, Phil Angelides (D), and vice chairman, Bill Thomas (R), said that the turnover's effects had been exaggerated and that they were optimistic about a consensus.Staff Losses and Dissent May Hurt Crisis Panel; The New York Times; September 2, 2010 Report The Commission's final report was initially due to Congress on December 15, 2010, but was not released until January 27, 2011.Harsh Words for Regulators in Crisis Commission Report; The New York Times; January 27, 2011 In voting on the adoption of the final report the Commission was split evenly along partisan lines, with Angelides, Born, Georgiou, Graham, Murren, and Thompson (appointed by Democrats Pelosi and Reid) all voting in favor and Thomas, Hennessey, Holtz-Eakin, and Wallison (appointed by Republicans Boehner and McConnell) all dissenting. Among those dissenting Thomas, Hennessey, and Holtz-Eakin collaborated on a single report while Wallison, from the American Enterprise Institute drafted his alone and proposed that the crisis was caused by government affordable housing policies rather than market forces. However, this view has not been supported by subsequent detailed analyses of mortgage market data.Michael Simkovic, Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization The Commission reached nine main conclusions (directly quoted): * We conclude this financial crisis was avoidable. \\"There was an explosion in risky subprime lending and securitization, an unsustainable rise in housing prices, widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices, dramatic increases in household mortgage debt, and exponential growth in financial firms' trading activities, unregulated derivatives, and short-term \\"repo\\" lending markets, among many other red flags. Yet there was pervasive permissiveness; little meaningful action was taken to quell the threats in a timely manner.\\" The Commission especially singles out the Fed's \\"failure to stem the flow of toxic mortgages.\\" * We conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the nation's financial markets. \\"More than 30 years of deregulation and reliance on self-regulation by financial institutions, championed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and others, supported by successive administrations and Congresses, and actively pushed by the powerful financial industry at every turn, had stripped away key safeguards, which could have helped avoid catastrophe. This approach had opened up gaps in oversight of critical areas with trillions of dollars at risk, such as the shadow banking system and over-the-counter derivatives markets. In addition, the government permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what became a race to the weakest supervisor.\\" * We conclude dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions were a key cause of this crisis. \\"Too many of these institutions acted recklessly, taking on too much risk, with too little capital, and with too much dependence on short-term funding. ... [Large investment banks and bank holding companies] took on enormous exposures in acquiring and supporting subprime lenders and creating, packaging, repackaging, and selling trillions of dollars in mortgage-related securities, including synthetic financial products.\\" The report goes on to fault \\"poorly executed acquisition and integration strategies that made effective management more challenging,\\" narrow emphasis on mathematical models of risk as opposed to actual risk, and short-sighted compensation systems at all levels. *We conclude a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency put the financial system on a collision course with crisis. \\"In the years leading up to the crisis, too many financial institutions, as well as too many households, borrowed to the hilt. ... [A]s of 2007, the leverage ratios [of the five major investment banks] were as high as 40 to 1, meaning for every $40 in assets, there was only $1 in capital to cover losses. Less than a 3% drop in asset values could wipe out a firm. To make matters worse, much of their borrowing was short-term, in the overnight market‚Äîmeaning the borrowing had to be renewed each and every day. ... And the leverage was often hidden‚Äîin derivatives positions, in off-balance-sheet entities, and through \\"window dressing\\" of financial reports available to the investing public. ... The heavy debt taken on by some financial institutions was exacerbated by the risky assets they were acquiring with that debt. As the mortgage and real estate markets churned out riskier and riskier loans and securities, many financial institutions loaded up on them.\\" *We conclude the government was ill-prepared for the crisis, and its inconsistent response added to the uncertainty and panic in the financial markets. \\"[K]ey policy makers ... were hampered because they did not have a clear grasp of the financial system they were charged with overseeing, particularly as it had evolved in the years leading up to the crisis. This was in no small measure due to the lack of transparency in key markets. They thought risk had been diversified when, in fact, it had been concentrated. ... There was no comprehensive and strategic plan for containment, because they lacked a full understanding of the risks and interconnections in the financial markets. ... While there was some awareness of, or at least a debate about, the housing bubble, the record reflects that senior public officials did not recognize that a bursting of the bubble could threaten the entire financial system. ... In addition, the government's inconsistent handling of major financial institutions during the crisis‚Äîthe decision to rescue Bear Stearns and then to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, followed by its decision not to save Lehman Brothers and then to save AIG‚Äîincreased uncertainty and panic in the market.\\" *We conclude there was a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics. \\"In our economy, we expect businesses and individuals to pursue profits, at the same time that they produce products and services of quality and conduct themselves well. Unfortunately ... [l]enders made loans that they knew borrowers could not afford and that could cause massive losses to investors in mortgage securities. ... And the report documents that major financial institutions ineffectively sampled loans they were purchasing to package and sell to investors. They knew a significant percentage of the sampled loans did not meet their own underwriting standards or those of the originators. Nonetheless, they sold those securities to investors. The Commission's review of many prospectuses provided to investors found that this critical information was not disclosed. *We conclude collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis. \\"Many mortgage lenders set the bar so low that lenders simply took eager borrowers' qualifications on faith, often with a willful disregard for a borrower's ability to pay. ... While many of these mortgages were kept on banks' books, the bigger money came from global investors who clamored to put their cash into newly created mortgage-related securities. It appeared to financial institutions, investors, and regulators alike that risk had been conquered. ... But each step in the mortgage securitization pipeline depended on the next step to keep demand going. From the speculators who flipped houses to the mortgage brokers who scouted the loans, to the lenders who issued the mortgages, to the financial firms that created the mortgage- backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), CDOs squared, and synthetic CDOs: no one in this pipeline of toxic mortgages had enough skin in the game. When borrowers stopped making mortgage payments, the losses‚Äîamplified by derivatives‚Äîrushed through the pipeline. As it turned out, these losses were concentrated in a set of systemically important financial institutions.\\" *We conclude over-the-counter derivatives contributed significantly to this crisis. \\"The enactment of legislation in 2000 to ban the regulation by both the federal and state governments of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives was a key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis. ... OTC derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways. First, one type of derivative‚Äîcredit default swaps (CDS) fueled the mortgage securitization pipeline. CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgage-related securities backed by risky loans. ... Second, CDS were essential to the creation of synthetic CDOs. These synthetic CDOs were merely bets on the performance of real mortgage-related securities. They amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread them throughout the financial system. ... Finally, when the housing bubble popped and crisis followed, derivatives were in the center of the storm. AIG, which had not been required to put aside capital reserves as a cushion for the protection it was selling, was bailed out when it could not meet its obligations. The government ultimately committed more than $180 billion because of concerns that AIG's collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system. In addition, the existence of millions of derivatives contracts of all types between systemically important financial institutions‚Äîunseen and unknown in this unregulated market‚Äîadded to uncertainty and escalated panic, helping to precipitate government assistance to those institutions.\\" *We conclude the failures of credit rating agencies were essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction. \\"The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown. The mortgage- related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. ... [T]he forces at work behind the breakdowns at Moody's ... includ[ed] the flawed computer models, the pressure from financial firms that paid for the ratings, the relentless drive for market share, the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits, and the absence of meaningful public oversight.\\" Dissenting Statements Hennessey, Holtz-Eakin, and Thomas In a 27-page dissenting statement, Vice Chairman Bill Thomas and Commissioners Keith Hennessey and Douglas Holtz- Eakin criticized the majority report for being an \\"account of bad events\\" rather than a \\"focused explanation of what happened and why.\\" According to the three Republicans, the majority report ignored the global nature of the financial crisis and, consequently, focused too narrowly on US regulatory policy and supervision. For those reasons, the dissent argues that the majority's conclusion that the crisis could have been avoided with more restrictive regulations, in conjunction with more aggressive regulators and supervisors, is false. The dissent lists ten essential causes of the financial and economic crisis: Credit bubble, Housing bubble, Nontraditional mortgages, Credit ratings and securitization, Financial institutions concentrated correlated risk, Leverage and liquidity risk, Risk of contagion, Common shock, Financial shock and panic, Financial crisis causes economic crisis. Wallison American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Peter Wallison authored a 93-page dissent in which he disagreed with both the majority report and the three other Republican appointees. Wallison argued that the US government's housing policies‚Äîimplemented primarily through the government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac‚Äîcaused the financial crisis. In specific, Wallison named the GSEs' Affordable Housing goals, heightened enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Best Practices Initiative as the primary culprits. According to Wallison, these programs, which were intended to give low- and moderate-income borrowers better access to mortgage credit, ultimately required Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce the mortgage underwriting standards they used when acquiring loans from originators. Because the GSEs dominated the mortgage market, they set the underwriting standards for the entire industry and pushed private institutions into riskier loans. Wallison concludes that these policies fueled a massive housing bubble full of non-traditional, risky loans that ultimately led to a financial crisis. Regarding the AEI paper, Phil Angelides, chairman of the FCIC, has stated: \\"The source for this newfound wisdom [is] shopworn data, produced by a consultant to the corporate-funded American Enterprise Institute, which was analyzed and debunked by the FCIC Report.\\" Reception The report made The New York Times and The Washington Post best sellers lists and The New York Review of Books hailed it as \\"the most comprehensive indictment of the American financial failure that has yet been made\\" and \\"the definitive history of this period.\\" The vote of the four Republicans on the commission to ban the words \\"Wall Street,\\" \\"shadow banking,\\" \\"interconnection,\\" and \\"deregulation\\" from the main report‚Äîwhich was rejected by the six Democratic commissioners but carried out in the dissenting Republican report‚Äîwas criticized by some such as Bethany McLean,Covering the Republicans' Crisis Commission DocumentDecember 17, 2010 By Ryan Chittum Paul Krugman,Wall Street WhitewashBy PAUL KRUGMANDecember 16, 2010 and Shahien Nasiripour.Financial Crisis Panel In Turmoil As Republicans Defect; Plan To Blame Government For CrisisShahien Nasiripour Business columnist Joe Nocera also criticized the partisanship of the Republican members of the commission who issued a nine-page, three- footnote minority report before the report had been written.

SRII is in blue. View is along the membrane, extracellular space is on the top. Only transmembrane helices of HtrII are resolved. Sensory rhodopsin II (SRII), also known as pharaonis phoborhodopsin (ppR), is a membrane protein of archaea, responsible generating the phototaxis signal. Sensory rhodopsin II is found in Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis.  Structure  Structure of sensory rhodopsin II is typical for microbial rhodopsin. It consists of seven transmembrane a-helices with retinal molecule connected via Schiff base to K205. Notable feature of sensory rhodopsin II is presence of charged residue Y199 on the surface of the hydrophobic region. This residue is responsible for binding of sensory rhodopsin II transducer protein - HtrII. HtrII consists of two transmembrane helices, two HAMP-domains and methyl- accepting signalling domain. In case of Halobacterium salinarum HtrII also comprises extracellular chemosensor region, which is responsible for serine sensing.  Function  SRII in the plasma membrane binds its transducer via a number of bonds. Photon absorption induces structural changes in SRII, which when conducted to HtrII. HtrII in turn regulates level of unbound kinases in cytoplasm. Kinases regulate rotation of flagella via phosphorilation. Thus phototaxis signal is converted in bacteria' motion.

Her first film Love Serenade won the Cam√©ra d'Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. She has written and directed two other feature films Walk the Talk (2000) and South Solitary (2010). Barrett's script for South Solitary was awarded multiple prizes, including the Queensland Premier's Prize and the West Australian Premier's Prize. Her first novel Rush Oh! (2016) was shortlisted for the 2016 Indie Awards for Debut Fiction and the 2016 Nita May Dobbie Award, and long-listed for the 2016 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction. Her second novel The Bus on Thursday was released in 2018. Early life and education Barrett was born in Melbourne in 1961. In 1985, she moved to Sydney, where she studied screenwriting at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS). In 1988, during her final year at the AFTRS she made a short film entitled Cherith which won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Short Fiction. Television Barrett began her career in television ‚Äúwith production work on the Logies.‚Äù After meeting Verity Lambert, she was given the opportunity to direct for a television series The Boys From the Bush. She continued working in television during the 1990s and 2000s, directing episodes for various television series including Love My Way, Wild Boys, Offspring and A Place to Call Home. Film  Love Serenade  Shirley Barrett's first feature Love Serenade (1996) was a film that explored, ‚Äúhow women can get completely the wrong idea about some men.‚Äù It was shot almost entirely on location in Robinvale, Victoria. The story concerns two young sisters who develop a fierce and competitive crush on their neighbour, a brooding and self-centred radio personality. The film humorously incorporates \\"small town constrictions with visual flights of fancy\\". The sisters are played by Miranda Otto and Rebecca Frith and George Shevtsov stars as the washed up deejay. The film was generally well-received, with Variety describing it as ‚Äúone of the most striking, fully formed and assured debuts in years.‚Äù It won the Camera D'Or (Best First Feature) at Cannes film Festival 1996, and Barrett was awarded Best New Director at the Vallodolid International Film Festival 1996.  Walk the Talk  Her second feature Walk the Talk (2000) was also inspired by the location in which the film is set; Walk the Talk in this case, the Gold Coast , Queensland. \\"Shirley had met Carter Edwards, a variety circuit veteran who appears in the film as Marty\\". This encounter \\"came in handy when Walk the Talk started to develop as a script\\". The film is \\"about dreamers and schemers, isolation and redemption, populated with iconic places and people\\", and stars Salvatore Coco as Joey, a desperately ambitious young man and Sacha Morler as his girlfriend Bonita. After winning a large settlement from an accident that leaves Bonita paraplegic, Joey starts a talent agency hoping to \\"make his mark on the world\\". Joey encounters Nikki Raye (Nikki Bennett), ‚Äúa variety club singer‚Äù and decides to represent her as an agent in attempts to thrust her, and himself into the limelight. The characters that Shirley Barrett created in Walk the Talk are \\"relegated to the fringes of a hero's journey\\". The comedic effect of the film emerges through the \\"desperation of these people living on the margins\\". Variety described it as \\"a bitingly funny, hard-hitting and yet compassionate examination of a bunch of losers on the fringe of showbiz.\\"  South Solitary  Barrett's third feature South Solitary (2010) is \\"another tale of outcasts\\". The film stars Miranda Otto (who starred in Love Serenade) as Meredith a lonely young woman. This time around, she situates the actress \\"on an island in 1927, tending to a lighthouse so isolated that the only way of communicating with the mainland is via carrier pigeon\\". In the film, Meredith and ‚Äúher uncle George (Barry Otto), a lighthouse keeper who has come to replace the previous one.‚Äù They arrive on the desolate island and meet the island's inhabitants, a family consisting of the mother Alma (Essie Davis), her husband Stanley (Rohan Nichol) and their daughter Nettie (Annie Martin). Similar to her character's romantic perils in Love Serenade, \\"Meredith is desperate for some kind of connection with men\\", which drives her to have an affair with Stanley. As the film continues, \\"the population of the island dwindles to two\\", leaving Meredith in the company of Fleet (Marton Csokas), \\"a returned First World War soldier recovering form shell shock\\". Meredith is searching and longing for companionship while Fleet \\"shies away from the confusion and misunderstandings of human contact\\". Despite this tension between the characters, they develop affections for one another.  Novels   Rush Oh!  Barrett's first novel Rush Oh! (2015) is set in Eden, N.S.W. in 1908. It tells the story of a family of whalers and their unusual relationship with a pod of killer whales. It is based on a true story.  The Bus on Thursday  Barrett's second novel The Bus on Thursday (2018) tells the story of a young woman recently recovering from breast cancer who takes a job as teacher in a tiny school in a remote country town, where she finds herself set upon by demons.

Police stated that he was a \\"low-level conduit by United States government intelligence agencies and the United Kingdom's MI-6\\" from 1981 to 1986, and the case stirred a conspiracy theory that the family was murdered by assassins or terrorists because of Spiro's history as an intelligence operative. Murders On November 5, 1992, Spiro's wife, Gail Spiro, 41, his daughters, Sara, 16, and Dina, 11‚Äîas well as their son, Adam, 14, were found shot to death in their beds in their luxurious, rented home in the Covenant section of Rancho Santa Fe, California, north of San Diego. Each had been shot in the head execution-style with a large caliber handgun as they slept. For the ensuing three days, Spiro was the only suspect in the slaying. On the afternoon of the fourth day, Spiro was found dead behind the wheel of his Ford Explorer in a rocky canyon on the western edge of the Anza-Borego Desert.

It was first proposed at First Great Western's Stakeholder Event in March 2008. The aim of the project is to develop half-hourly services through central Bristol which will also serve the surrounding West of England region. Transport campaigning groups Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways (FoSBR) and Transport for Greater Bristol are actively supporting the proposal, as are the three unitary authorities under the West of England Combined Authority and North Somerset Council. History Background Earlier plans for a metro system were promoted by then MEP Richard Cottrell in 1986 and acts of Parliament were secured. This would have used existing track, with new build through the city centre. However, the scheme folded when Advanced Transport for Avon was wound up with debts of ¬£3.8 million. Rail usage in the West of England doubled in the ten years between 1999 and 2009. A campaign for a Greater Bristol Metro was launched in February 2012, with plans prepared by engineering consultancy Halcrow Group. The scheme was estimated to cost ¬£22 million at 2008/09 prices and could be completed between 2016 and 2021. The 2012 plans included station reopening costs, estimated by Bristol City Council to be an average of ¬£5 million each. Related estimates for reopening of the Portishead Railway and for four-tracking between Parson Street and Filton Bank were reported as approximately and respectively. It was subsequently reported that the Portishead Railway reopening would cost around . Planning and implementation The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. Councillor Tim Kent stated in September 2012 that the first part of the scheme, on the Severn Beach Line, would be delivered \\"next year\\". Local politicians at the launch of the Metro campaign. An opinion piece in the Bristol Evening Post in June 2011 called for the establishment of an Integrated Transport Authority for the West of England and for progress on the metro proposal. During the Rail Priority Conference organised by the West of England Partnership in November 2011, delegates travelled on the Portishead line, the Severn Beach line and the Henbury Loop, using sections of track not currently used for passenger traffic. In early 2012, during the consultation phase for the new Great Western rail franchise, Bristol City Council and local rail user groups launched Bristol Metro 2013 to ask bidders to incorporate metro plans into their bids. Bristol MPs were lobbied in Westminster by Dawn Primarolo (MP for Bristol South) and Steve Webb (former MP for Yate). The Saltford Station Campaign Group and Bath and North East Somerset Council suggested in April 2012 that the reopening of Saltford station could be part funded by means other than those included in the West of England Partnership's report. By 2015, little progress had been made on the project, with the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership producing a Key Principles Report in November 2015 reiterating the aspiration to reopen lines and increased train frequencies as well as discussing future potential transport projects for the West of England region, including new rail transit based options referred to as MetroWest++. The options outlined include reopening the Thornbury Branch Line, a Yate to Bath route, the use of tram train technology, a link to the city centre and a connection to Bristol Airport. A 2015 report was produced by Arup, appointed by Bristol City Council, to analyse potential cost of electrifying both phases of MetroWest, with Arup concluding a total cost of ¬£175 million. Delays and cost overruns By 2017, the planned opening date for the Portishead Line was aimed to be 2020. In March 2017, MetroWest reported a substantial increase in the estimated costs of Phase 1, owing to the work required to upgrade the line in the Avon Gorge to achieve the line speeds required for a half-hourly service, and to reroute road traffic away from a level crossing in Ashton Vale. The original ¬£50 million cost estimate had increased to ¬£145M, which was reduced to ¬£116M by changing the planned frequency to hourly. In 2018 the local authority made a bid for funding from central government that was turned down, placing the project into uncertainty. However ¬£31 million of funding was promised in April 2019 by Chris Grayling, the Secretary of State for Transport. The current revised date for the opening of the Portishead line is 'by 2023'. In August 2019, North Somerset Council announced it would be submitting a development consent order to the Government by the end of September, with a proposed 2023 opening being reiterated. Project description The MetroWest Project has two phases. MetroWest Phase One involves the reopening of the Portishead Line, and hourly services between Severn Beach and Bath Spa. MetroWest Phase Two consists of reopening the Henbury Line, with half-hourly services between Weston-super-Mare and Yate. New rail lines The two major components of the MetroWest project include the reopening of the Portishead Railway, with stations at Pill and Portishead; and the Henbury Line with stations at Ashley Down, Filton North and Henbury to passenger traffic with services to Bristol Temple Meads, with the two new lines expecting to generate 0.4 million passengers each per year. In April 2016, it was reported by North Somerset Times that the North Somerset Council had agreed to buy two pieces of land for the creation of the Portishead and Pill stations at the cost of ¬£880,000. Upgrades and new stations on existing lines Work in 2018 to reinstate the two extra tracks at the site of Horfield railway station Upgrades to existing lines include the four- tracking of Filton Bank, the line from Bristol Temple Meads to Bristol Parkway, in order to separate local journeys from express and long distance trains, similar to the S-train principle. This work was completed in 2018NR agrees ¬£33m contract for Bristol four-tracking Rail issue 761 12 November 2014 page 24 and will allow two trains per hour between Bristol Temple Meads and Yate, and two trains per hour from the Severn Beach Line to Bath Spa, which are expected to generate 0.25 and 0.6 million passengers per year respectively. In 2017, ¬£2.23 million was allocated for construction of the Portway Parkway station which had been under discussion since 2009, of which ¬£1.67m came from the government's New Stations Fund, with additional funding coming from the West of England Combined Authority and West of England Local Enterprise Partnership. Ground surveys began in 2017, with completion originally planned for 2019; however, planning permission was not granted until March 2019. Further potential station reopenings include Ashton Gate, St Anne's Park, Saltford and Horfield. Future extensions Extensions are proposed north from Yate to Gloucester and southeast from Bath to Westbury, with WECA in talks with Network Rail to determine the necessary infrastructure. In 2016, Wiltshire Council were studying the potential of a MetroWest extension to Chippenham which would see a reopened Corsham station between Chippenham and Bath Spa. Airport rail link A report produced by the West of England LEP into improving access to Bristol Airport from the city centre studied the potential of a heavy rail link to the airport, either branching from Parson Street following the A38 road, from Nailsea & Backwell, or from Yatton using the old trackbed of the Wrington Vale Light Railway. However, by 2017 it was confirmed the airport link was likely to form part of Bristol's proposed mass transit network. Thornbury Branch Line Suggestions were made to reopen the Thornbury Branch Line. However, in 2017 the West of England Combined Authority found there would be several challenges in delivering this proposal, as the former rail alignment into Thornbury is now occupied by an industrial estate and there is no practical routing into the town. The station would therefore have to be located on the edge of Thornbury at a significant distance from the town centre, making it less attractive to passengers. The Grovesend tunnel would also need to be reopened, with its current condition unknown, and there would be capacity constraints at Westerleigh Junction. This led to the Authority deciding not to pursue reopening the line. FOSBR continue to advocate reopening the line in the future. In 2020, the line was mentioned by Railway Gazette International as having potential for future funding from the Department for Transport's \\"Restoring Your Railway\\" initiative.

Early history The 17 Punjab Haidri could trace its origins to 1818, when it was raised at Sehore, as a mixed force of infantry and cavalry by the State of Bhopal for service with the British. It was known as the Bhopal Contingent and was employed to keep peace in the lawless regions of Central India. Following the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny, the contingent was reorganized by Lieutenant Colonel James Travers, VC, as the Bhopal Levy in May 1859. In 1865, it was redesignated as the Bhopal Battalion. In 1878, the battalion participated in the Second Afghan War, where it operated on the Line of Communication. Men of the Bhopal Regiment disembarking at Rhodes following the unconditional surrender of German forces, 1945. 330px 9th Bhopal Infantry Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the Bhopal Battalion's designation was changed to 9th Bhopal Infantry. During the First World War, the 9th Bhopal Infantry was dispatched to France in 1914. The regiment suffered heavy losses at the Battles of Neuve Chapelle, Festubert, Givenchy and the Second Ypres. In 1915, they arrived in Mesopotamia, where they were engaged in fierce fighting on the Tigris Front. Sepoy Chattar Singh was awarded the Victoria Cross for exceptional valour at the Battle of Wadi on 13 January 1916. By the time the regiment returned home in March 1919, only fifteen men remained of those who had sailed for France in 1914. The 9th Bhopal Infantry raised three more battalions, which were disbanded after the war. Subsequent history In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 16th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 9th Bhopal Infantry with the 30th, 31st, 33rd and 46th Punjabis. The battalion's new designation was 4th Battalion (Bhopal) 16th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion again fought with great distinction in the Italian East Africa, North Africa and Italy. It suffered 250 casualties in the Battle of Cassino alone. In 1947, the 16th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 15th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 4/16th Punjab was redesignated as 17 Punjab. In 1948, the battalion fought in the war with India in Kashmir, while during the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pakistan Wars, it again fought with great gallantry at Lahore, where Major Raja Aziz Bhatti was awarded the Nishan-i-Haider, Pakistan's highest gallantry award in 1965. 17 Punjab Regiment was redesignated due to its outstanding performance by Chief Of Army, Gen M Zia ul Haq as 17 Punjab Haidri in 1979.

He was professor of geology at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris from 1819 to 1861, and was responsible for the development of the geological gallery in the museum. Family Cordier was born in Abbeville in 1777 to a family of English origin.Cordier Collection at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle mnhn.fr, (in French), English translation, accessed 21 September 2009 In 1817 he married C√©cile Borgella, a niece and pupil of Louis Ramond de Carbonni√®res. Together they had four sons and six daughters. Career Cordier entered the √âcole des mines in 1794 and followed the well-known courses of Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763‚Äì1829), Ren√© Just Ha√ºy (1743‚Äì1822) and D√©odat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750‚Äì1801). He gained his \\"dipl√¥me d‚Äôing√©nieur\\" in 1797 and followed Dolomieu first on an expedition to the Alps, then as a scientist on Napoleon's expedition to Egypt from 1798 to 1799. Arriving in Alexandria, Cordier immediately began his researches into the country's mineralogy and geology, with particular focus on the formation of the Nile valley. On Dolomieu's taking ill, both of them attempted to return to France. Although Cordier was taken prisoner in Taranto, subsequently being transferred to Messina in Sicily, he was freed after three months in captivity as a result of Dolmieu's intervention and returned to France. In 1802 he published M√©moire sur le mercure argental, and in 1808 Description du dichto√Øte, which revealed his deep interest in mineralogy. Cordier rose to the position of \\"ing√©nieur en chef\\" in 1809 and in 1816 he published his account of basalt: Sur les substances min√©rales dites en masse, qui servent de base aux roches volcaniques. In 1822 he was elected to the French Acad√©mie des sciences. In 1830 he was appointed ma√Ætre des requ√™tes in the Conseil d'√âtat. In the same year he participitated in the foundation of the French Geological Society (the Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France). In 1832 he became inspector-general of mines in the south-west of France and in 1837, \\"conseiller d'√âtat\\". He was made Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1837, then Grand Officer in 1859; In 1839 he was made a Peer of France. Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle Cordier started work at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in 1819, when he succeeded Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond (1741‚Äì1819) to the chair of geology. Cordier held this position until his death in 1861. He was appointed director of the museum three times (from 1824 to 1825, from 1832 to 1833, and from 1838 to 1839) and was responsible for the creation of the \\"Galerie de g√©ologie\\" in the museum. During his stewardship the collection grew from 1,500 specimens in 1819 to 200,000 in 1861, the year of his death in Paris. He made 51 geological journeys during his life, collecting specimens from within France (the Pyrenees, Languedoc, Maine, the Ardennes, the Vosges, Saxony and the Auvergne) as well as Tuscany, Liguria and the Alps. Many of the rocks that formed part of the museum's collection were sent to him from various continents by colleagues and friends. By 1844 Cordier had classified 337 types of rock.

The instability occurs as follows. A compressive magnetohydrodynamical wave propagating at right angles to the direction of propagation of the radiation creates variations in the density of the gas. More radiation is able to pass through the low density regions than through the high density regions, and the imbalance in radiation pressure acts to drive gas out of the low density regions, along the magnetic field lines. This further decreases the density of the low density regions, which in turn allows more radiation to propagate through them, leading to runaway growth of the instability.

It is a two-story brick dwelling in the Italianate architectural style built around 1880. In 1984 it and its neighboring barn were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the only remaining house from that era on that block. While its form is Italianate, its upper arches are more typical of Renaissance Revival buildings, a style that was starting to become popular at the time of the building's construction. Its architect is unknown. At the time of its listing on the Register it doubled as a residence and antique shop. Today, however, as at the time of its construction, it is solely used as a residence. Buildings The building is located on the west side of South Main, midway between the intersections with Parrish and (on the west side) Phelps, and Clark streets. One block further to the south, South Main intersects with Western Boulevard (New York State Route 5 and U.S. Route 20), running parallel to the north shore of Canandaigua Lake. The terrain is level, reflecting the proximity of the lake. To both the north and south are houses of newer construction, mostly smaller in size as well. These give way to larger commercial properties, such as the gas station on the Parrish corner. Across the street is a similar combination of newer houses and larger commercial buildings with large parking lots, with a large storage facility on the land behind them. To the west the land is wooded and largely undeveloped as far as Sucker Brook, other than the back lots of commercial properties on Parrish. The house sits on a one-acre (4,000 m) lot sheltered by mature trees, in contrast to the more open, and smaller, neighboring lots, with its gravel driveway on the south. It is a two-story, three-bay structure on an exposed stone foundation, topped with a truncated hipped roof pierced by two corbellled brick chimneys at the ends. A two-story, one-bay projecting pavilion is located in the center of the north elevation, matched by a two- story bay window on the south side. Attached to the west (rear) elevation is a two-story wing, also with a hipped roof and chimney, projects. On its west is a one-story wood frame addition with a gable roof and clapboard siding with irregular fenestration. A small one-story enclosed frame clapboard-sided porch is nestled in the southwest corner between it and the main block. On the east (front) facade the main entrance, in the northernmost of the three bays, is sheltered by a flat-roofed wooden porch supported by four ornate wooden pillars with scroll brackets and pierced woodwork at the roofline. Wooden steps with pierced quatrefoils rise up to it, flanked by metal handrails. The porch's brick foundation is topped with a wooden deck. A stone water table sets off the foundation stone from the brick facing the house. Windows on the facade are all one-over-one double-hung sash windows set in a slightly recessed wooden surround and topped by segmentally arched drip molds, as are all windows elsewhere on the building. The only deviation is above the front porch, where two narrower versions of the windows echo the double main entrance doors below. Above the second story is a projecting molded cornice that continues around the entire main block. The frieze it sets off features a large semi-circular cross-gable set with a round-arched single-pane casement window in paneled stone trim. At the top of every bay except those on the pavilion and bay window is a recessed elongated oval oculus set in stone trim. The roofline is marked by a wide overhanging eave with another molded cornice. The main entrance has two sets of double doors set in a segmental-arched entryway topped with a drip mold, similar to the windows. The outer doors are wooden with three large glass panes. They protect a pair of wooden inner doors with decoration similar to that on the porch just outside. Among the original interior features in the house are its original stairwell and two marble mantels. History Very little is known about the house's origins. Its builder, architect and original owners or inhabitants are unknown. It is, however, believed that the house and adjacent barn, a contributing resource to the National Register listing, were built around 1880. An Italianate overall form was combined with upper-level decoration that reflected the newer Renaissance Revival style. At the time of its construction neighboring houses were in similar Late Victorian modes. Over time they were all demolished, leaving only 426 to exemplify its two styles. In 1984, when the house was listed on the Register, its owner was operating an antique shop on the ground floor, leading to the use of \\"building\\" rather than \\"house\\" in the listing name. The front steps also had wooden balustrades rather than their current metal rails.

Robert Beale (1541 ‚Äì 25 May 1601) was an English diplomat, administrator, and antiquary in the reign of Elizabeth I. As Clerk of the Privy Council, Beale wrote the official record of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, to which he was an eyewitness. Early life Robert Beale, born in 1541, was the eldest son of a London mercer, Robert Beale (died c. 1548), and Amy Morison, thought to have been a daughter of Sir Richard Morison.. He was educated at Coventry, likely at the school set up there by John Hales, with whom he was closely associated, and whose brother, Stephen Hales (d. 1574), was married to Sir Richard Morison's sister, also named Amy.At his death in 1572, John Hales made Beale overseer of his will. According to Bell, Hales 'imparted to Beale his views on religious and social reform, as well as his interest in classical learning'.. Although he never took a degree, Beale studied civil law, and may have attended Cambridge.. As a Marian exile Beale studied at Strasbourg, where he lived at the house of Sir Richard Morison. After Morison died in 1556, Beale studied 'logic, rhetoric and Greek' under John Aylmer at Zurich.. In 1562 Lord John Grey of Pyrgo consulted him concerning the validity of the marriage of his niece Lady Catherine Grey with Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, and Beale made a journey to the continent to lay the case before OldendorpiusJohann Oldendorp, 1480‚Äì1567 and eminent Italian canonists. The opinion which Beale formed he subsequently maintained in a Latin tract; a royal commission, with Archbishop Matthew Parker at its head, pronounced the marriage void at the time, but its validity was established in 1606. Diplomatic career In 1564 he obtained a post with the English embassy in Paris, and travelled into Germany. Walsingham found him in Paris on his appointment as ambassador- resident there in 1570, and made him his secretary. In the correspondence between Lord Burghley and Walsingham of this period he is frequently mentioned as carrying despatches between Paris and London. A witness to the massacre of St. Bartholomew two years later (24 August 1572), he wrote a Discourse by way of Letter to the Lord Burghley shortly after the event. The same year he succeeded Robert Monson, then raised to the bench, as M.P. for Totnes. About this time he was appointed clerk to the council. In April 1575 he was sent to Flushing to recover goods which the Flushingers had seized, consisting partly of merchandise and partly of property of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford; and in the following year he accompanied Admiral William Winter to the Low Countries to demand the liberation of the English merchant ships on which the Prince of Orange had laid an embargo in the Scheldt River in retaliation for acts of piracy committed by English privateers on Dutch shipping. The ships were set free at once, but an indemnity for the detention, which Beale was instructed to claim, was disputed. After the Formula of Concord of 1577 had defined so-called Cryptocalvinists as heretics, Beale toured nine German courts for Queen Elizabeth, to intervene with Lutheran princes for religious toleration. He impressed Hubert Languet, who gave him an introduction to Sir Philip Sidney. During Walsingham's absence in the Netherlands in the summer of 1578 Beale acted as secretary of state, as also in 1581 and 1583, on occasion of Walsingham's missions to France and Scotland in those years. In the autumn of 1580 he took part in the examination of Richard Stanihurst about the conveying of Gerald Fitzgerald, Lord Offaly, to Spain at the instigation of Thomas Fleming. In 1581 he was one of the commissioners who took the depositions of Edmund Campion before his trial; his commission extended only to threatening with torture. The same year Walsingham was appointed governor of the Mines Royal, and made Beale his deputy. Between 1581 and 1584 he was employed in negotiating with Mary, Queen of Scots, at Sheffield, and was suspected of secret partiality to her cause. Eventually (1584) he wrote to Walsingham of a lack of progress. In 1584 Beale was returned to Parliament for Dorchester, which he also represented in the two succeeding parliaments (1586 and 1589). In November 1586 he was despatched with Lord Buckhurst to Fotheringay, to notify the Queen of Scots of the fact that sentence of death had been passed upon her. Early in the following year, Beale carried the warrant to Fotheringay and performed the duty of reading it aloud in the hall of the castle by way of preliminary to the execution, of which he was an eye- witness, and wrote an account. Though a Puritan, Beale maintained the principle of toleration, both in Parliament and as a writer. He published a work impugning the right of the crown to fine or imprison for ecclesiastical offences, and condemning the use of torture to induce confession, and followed it up at a later date with a second treatise (by 1584) on the same subject. John Whitgift then drew up and laid before the council a 'schedule of misdemeanours' alleged to have been committed by Beale; no notice was taken of it. Beale had shown the archbishop the manuscript of another work on the prerogative of the bishops, which caused a clash. In the summer he served on logistics under Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in the Netherlands during the attempt to relieve Sluys. In 1589 he was employed in negotiation with the Dutch States, and next year with Burghley and Buckhurst adjusted the accounts of Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby, commander in the Netherlands. In 1592 the attitude which Beale assumed in a debate on supply with another speech against the inquisitorial practices of the bishops, gave so much offence to the queen that he was commanded to absent himself both from court and from Parliament. In 1592 he addressed a lengthy letter to Burghley as Lord Treasurer vindicating his opinions on church government. The following year he was returned to Parliament for Lostwithiel. In 1595 Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex tried to deprive Beale of his office of clerk to the council in favour of one of his own creatures; Beale wrote (24 April 1595) to the Lord Treasurer. He was also clerk to the Council of the North; Beale concluded his letter by begging that he might be allowed a deputy to do the business of the office at York during his absence. His request was granted, one John Ferne being appointed in the following August. In 1597 he was with Sir Julius Caesar in a commission to examine into complaints by the inhabitants of Guernsey against Sir Thomas Leighton, their governor. In 1599 he was placed on a special commission to hear and adjudge the grievances of Danish subjects who complained of piratical acts committed by English subjects. In 1600 he was appointed one of the envoys to treat for peace with the King of Spain at Boulogne. The negotiation fell through, the representatives not being able to agree on the question of precedency. Private life In 1601 Beale died at his house at Barnes, at eight o'clock in the evening of 25 May. He was buried in Allhallows Church, London Wall. He left two daughters, of whom one, Margaret, married Sir Henry Yelverton, who had Beale's books and papers at Easton-Maudit. The library was sold in 1784, and the manuscripts went to the British Museum. The other daughter, Catherine, married Nathaniel Stephens, of Easington, Gloucestershire. He had been a member of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries, and is mentioned by Thomas Milles in the epistle dedicatory to his Catalogue of Honour. In 1582 he discussed the North-west Passage with John Dee, John Davis and Adrian Gilbert. He had another house at Priors Marston, in Warwickshire, and is described as of that place in the inscriptions on the tombstone of his wife and daughter Catherine. Marriage and issue Beale married Edith St. Barbe, the daughter of Henry St. Barbe of Somerset, and sister of the wife of Sir Francis Walsingham, by whom he had two sons and nine daughters.. Works Throughout life Beale was a collector of books. His written works include: *Argument touching the Validity of the Marriage of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, with Mary, Queen-dowager of France (sister to King Henry VIII), and the Legitimacy of the Lady Frances, their daughter. In Latin, MS. Cambridge University Library Dd. 3, 85, art. 18. *A Large Discourse concerning the Marriage between the Earl of Hertford and the Lady Catherine Grey. In Latin, MS.

He was the author of language course texts in three languages, both on his own and with two co-authors. He was later in his life a historian, particularly of Fort Street High School in Sydney, Australia. Horan was posthumously awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2000, and in 2001 an annual award in French studies was established in his honour, \\"the Ron Horan Prize for French\\", through the Faculty of Arts at Sydney University. Education and early career Ron Horan was born in Sydney, and had his secondary education at Fort Street Boys' High School just before and in the early years of the Second World War. He then entered the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sydney but he interrupted his studies to serve in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for three years as a radar operator and finally trained as an officer and translator. After the war he completed his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, majoring in French (Honours) and German. He later gained a Diploma in Education. After a short appointment at Sydney Boys' High School, his \\"country service\\", he joined the staff of Fort Street, where he taught for 36 years. Many of those years were spent as modern languages master and he later became deputy principal. His teaching subjects were French, German and English. As a practical guide for students he compiled the Fort Street Speller, which is presented to all pupils upon their arrival at the school. This guide has made its way into many avenues of public administration. Ron Horan has also been actively involved in the broader sphere of education. He served for ten years as a teacher and deputy principal at Eastwood Evening College and then a further 22 years as its principal. With co-authors, he has published French and German language course books, which are widely used in Australia and around the world. Books Horan was an author of language textbooks which have been popular in Australia and abroad for decades. With John Wheeler, he co-authored \\"Senior French\\" in two volumes, first published in 1961, later to become \\"A New French Course\\", in five volumes, that is still a standard in school education and the University of the Third Age. This junior to senior French textbook chronicled the life of the Ravel family and is still in print. Later, with John Slinn, he co-authored \\"A New German Course\\" in two parts. And still later, after his retirement, Horan wrote the \\"English Series\\", an exploration of the English language for all learners comprising \\"Spelling English\\", \\"Exploring English\\" and \\"Using English\\".The English Series This series is in its second edition in hard copy and new e-book format. In the mid 1960s, in co-operation with the Phillips Corporation, he built one of the first Language Laboratories in the world at Fort Street. He also recorded vinyl disc, magnetic tape and cassette recordings to accompany these resources. Horan served on many education committees, and was president of the Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations (AFMLTA). After he had retired he wrote books about the school with \\"Fort Street, the School\\" being followed by \\"Maroon and Silver\\". Awards and recognition In honour of his work with these students and in regard to the history of the school in general, in 2007 the \\"Ron Horan History Room\\" was inaugurated by the 1955 year students.

The company Bitly, Inc., was established in 2008. It is privately held and based in New York City. Bitly shortens 600 million links per month, for use in social networking, SMS, and email. Bitly makes money by charging for access to aggregate data created as a result of many people using the shortened URLs. In 2017, Spectrum Equity acquired majority stake in Bitly for $64 million. As of August 2018, Bitly has shortened over 37.5 billion URLs.  Products  The Bitly URL shortening service became popular on Twitter after it became the default URL shortening service on the website on May 6, 2009. It was subsequently replaced by Twitter's own t.co service. The company behind Bitly launched a similar service, but for online videos, to determine what videos are the most popular on the web. The company offers a paid solution called Bitly Enterprise that provides advanced branding features, audience intel, omnichannel campaign tracking and more. Companies can use their own custom domains to generate shortened links; for example, The New York Times uses \`nyti.ms\`, and Pepsi uses \`pep.si\`. This allows the company to push brand awareness on services such as Twitter but use the Bitly engine to generate the shortened URLs and track marketing metrics. Bitly Enterprise also has advanced analytics features and uses Bitly data to provide advanced social insight tools for companies and brands.  Technology  The company uses HTTP 301 redirects for its links. The shortcuts are intended to be permanent and cannot be changed once they are created. URLs that are shortened with the bitly service use the \`bit.ly\` domain or any other generic domain that the service offers. Starting October 12, 2010, users could automatically generate QR codes that, when scanned with a mobile QR code reader, automatically directed users to shortened links. This was later removed. On May 29, 2012, Bitly announced \\"Bitmarks\\", a new search feature, with enhanced public profiles and an iPhone app. Preview short URLs To see a short URL's information, that is to reveal or preview any Bitly URL \`https://bit.ly/x\` just append a plus sign \\"\`+\`\\", as in \`https://bit.ly/x+\`, for example \`https://bit.ly/1sNZMwL\` should be copy and pasted into the browser address bar as \`https://bit.ly/1sNZMwL+\`. This allows users to see and check the long URL before visiting it. Alternative domains \`.ly\` is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Libya. In 2011, the bit.ly address was set to redirect to bitly.com. The .ly TLD is controlled by the Libyan government, which has previously removed one domain deemed incompatible with Muslim law. Any shortened URL generated with bitly can also be accessed by replacing that domain with any one of the following: * bitly.com * j.mp (registered to bitly, and using the top-level domain of the Northern Mariana Islands, a commonwealth of the United States). * A custom domain, registered separately by the user and redirected to bitly's servers via the DNS record.

Biography Early life Michaels was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Raymond Roscoe Michaels and his wife Esther Marie Holcomb.Michaels, Raymond Roscoe. - California Death Records. - SSN: 495-09-4409. - California Department of Health Services Office of Health Information and Research. - Vital Statistics Section.). Her father had been a baseball catcher. He then became a food broker. Michaels had the same birthday as Franklin D. Roosevelt and was born five weeks before he was inaugurated as president of the United States on March 4. Before her third birthday her father sent the president a birthday card informing him of the connection. Roosevelt replied sending Dolores his best wishes on her birthday. She began studying ballet at age five, and went to New York City to study dance and drama before she graduated from Bishop Hogan High School. Her older sister, Gloria Michaels, had gone to New York City and joined the traveling cast of Brigadoon. When the musical came to Kansas City, 16-year-old Dolores was invited to join them. Michaels moved to Laguna Beach, California after she married interior decorator Maurice Martin√© in 1953. They separated in 1958. In January 1959, she filed for divorce. At the hearing, she testified that Martin√© had moved them into an expensive unfinished house, without heat or water, and that he expected her to bathe in the ocean, something she didn't want to do because she was constantly catching a cold. The divorce became final on September 29, 1959. During her separation and after the divorce, she dated actor John Duke. Acting career Michaels was discovered when she was doing a scene in an acting class at 20th Century-Fox's talent school. A group of producers and directors were in the audience, and after the scenes were finished, the audience voted on who gave the best performance. She won and got a contract with 20th Century-Fox. Joanne Woodward was supposed to have the part of Mildred Pritchard in The Wayward Bus (1957), but Woodward dropped out to star in The Three Faces of Eve, and the part went to Michaels at the last minute, her first acting role. United Press International wrote in a review of the film that Michaels' \\"torrid\\" scene, a seduction scene in a hayloft where she makes a pass at the bus driver (Rick Jason), \\"manages to steal the sexiest scene in the picture,\\" over better known sirens as Jayne Mansfield and Joan Collins, and wrote that Hollywood had not had a scene like this since Jane Russell in The Outlaw. Director Victor Vicas shot the scene twice, an \\"A\\" scene and a \\"B\\" scene, because of the censors. Her publicist released a biography that stated she had attended the University of Kansas for one year and was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. But, people, trying to remember if they knew her, at both the university and the sorority could find no record of her at either entity. The fact was that she had enrolled at the university in the fall of 1951 and was \\"rushed\\" by the sorority, but she only stayed at the school a few weeks and then dropped out, and she did not join the sorority. Her publicist had fabricated her biography to enhance it. Early in her Hollywood career, she struggled with her weight as she was a compulsive eater. After trying all kinds of diets, she realized that the problem was \\"mental.\\" While a ballet dancer in New York City, her weight reached 152 pounds, this on a five-foot-five-inch frame. By the time she signed her contract with 20th Century-Fox, though, she weighed 135 pounds. She developed work-related anxiety; she lost weight when she was not working, but once she got a role, she started eating again, at times eating a two-pound box of chocolates in a single sitting. Michaels would eat fruit and cottage cheese all day and then raid the refrigerator at midnight, sometimes not even remembering that she had until she opened the refrigerator the next morning. The turning point came after the death of her father (he died April 15, 1959); he was the one who had pushed her in her career, and without him, she felt lost. She went into psychological analysis and learned that she needed to \\"respect\\" her job. Michaels went down to 115 pounds and her career took off. She told Associated Press Hollywood reporter Bob Thomas: \\"I'm convinced that most weight problems stem from mental causes. But most people who lose weight on diets gain it back because they don't know the reasons why they crave food. Generally it is because of some frustration in their lives.\\" Her psychologist told her to act and not dance ballet. Michaels wanted to be taken seriously as an actress and not be treated as a sex symbol. When one reporter asked her for her measurements, she responded \\"You can go to the wardrobe department and find out.\\" She also said that she had never been asked to go to the studio photo gallery, stating, \\"That's part of the old Hollywood glamour nonsense. Also, it's in bad taste. I'm not a sexpot, I'm an actress\\". Later she told Hollywood columnist Erskine Johnson: \\"I favor the truly sensual photograph over the coyly teasing garter shots. I'd even rather be posed artistically nude than photographed giggling from behind a Venetian blind. I have never objected to posing. It's just that I wanted to build a career as an actress first\\". Michaels' acting career lasted 10 years, from 1953 to 1963. Among her final appearances was the role of murderer Jo Sands in the 1962 Perry Mason episode \\"The Case of the Playboy Pugilist.\\" She made her final appearance the following year on an episode of The Lloyd Bridges Show. After John Duke, she started dating Argentine actor Alejandro Rey, whom she met on the set of Battle at Bloody Beach. She then started dating novelist-screenwriter Bernard Wolfe (1915‚Äì1985), who proposed to her in 1962, but she sent the engagement ring back to him with a note that read \\"I don't wanna.\\" Michaels and Wolfe married in Los Angeles on June 1, 1964.California Marriage Index, 1960‚Äì1985. - California Department of Health Services Office of Health Information and Research. - Vital Statistics Section. The marriage was her second and his first. He was 48 and she was 31. The couple divorced in October 1969.California Divorce Index, 1966‚Äì1984. - California Department of Health Services Office of Health Information and Research. - Vital Statistics Section. Personal life Dolores Michaels was introduced to her second husband, Bernard Wolfe, by fellow actress, Susan Oliver. Wolfe and Michaels were wed in June 1960 in a civil ceremony at the Beverly Hills Courthouse. They remained married until Wolfe's death on Oct. 27, 1985. She and Wolfe had twin daughters, Jordan and Miranda, born in Los Angeles on July 23, 1970. Dolores Michaels Wolfe died at the age of 68 in West Hollywood, California of natural causes on September 25, 2001.

It crosses the A 1 autobahn at the Holdorf exit. The B 214 then continues, crossing the Damme Hills and runs north of the D√ºmmer lake through numerous boggy (moor) areas. In Nienburg it crosses the River Weser. East of the Leine river B 214 runs parallel to the Aller through the southern part of the L√ºneburg Heath. It crosses the A 7 motorway at the Schwarmstedt exit. Behind Celle it changes direction to the southeast and continues on west of the river Oker. In Ohof near Meinersen it runs over the Hanover‚ÄìBerlin high- speed railway, where there was a level crossing until 1997. Beyond the Wendeburg village of Neubr√ºck it crosses the A 2 motorway and then the Mittelland Canal. Passing through Watenb√ºttel it finally arrives at Brunswick.

Origin  The metalled, man-made road (Chaussee) between Brunswick and Celle was built from 1804 to 1815 and called Celler Stra√üe. The westernmost section between Lingen, F√ºrstenau and Bersenbr√ºck was opened to traffic on 1 July 1856. A regular post coach ran on this road from that day until the opening of the Rheine‚ÄìQuakenbr√ºck railway on 1 July 1879. From 1925 the section between Freren and Lingen was served by a bus line.  Former routing and names  Between 1934 and 1938 the road was called the Reichsstra√üe 214. The B 214 used to run within Brunswick past its present end at Amalienplatz down Celler Stra√üe and the western arm of the Oker and the Radeklint to the city centre. Since the Reichsstra√üe times many of the B 214's former routes through villages and towns have been replaced by ring road section, the last (in 2008) being the bypass around Diepholz. Since the B 214 now crosses the Weser at Nienburg together with the B 6, there is no longer the risk of it being closed due to flooding.  Replacements  The section between Brunswick and Watenb√ºttel and the so-called northern ring road in Brunswick around the formerly separate village of √ñlper was replaced in the 1980s by the roughly 4 km long A 392 motorway (so-called Nordtangente Braunschweig), which then runs on eastwards to the exit at Hamburger Stra√üe. The very short A 392 even has a motorway intersection, the √ñlper Knoten with the A 391.  Cancelled plans  The route from Nienburg as far as the crossing with the B 3 near Celle was originally to have been upgraded to form part of the scrapped A 32 autobahn project.  Tourism   Holiday routes  The German Timber-Frame Road runs along the B 214 between Celle and Brunswick.

In June 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a report (Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network) strongly indicating that the reopening of the next station in the Fawley direction, Hythe, would be viable, in that the ratio of business, economic and social benefits to costs would be as high as 4.8. The possibility of reopening Marchwood station was not mentioned in ATOC's proposal. Further studies for Hampshire County Council led to a 2014 decision not to devote further resources to reopening of the line, but planned future housing growth in the Waterside area, including 1,500 announced in 2017 on the site of the former Fawley Power Station has again reopened interest in the proposal. The line has been identified as a priority for reopening to passenger use by Campaign for Better Transport. On 28 July 2020, South Western Railway ran a 'fact-finding train' down the branch line, stopping at Marchwood, to demonstrate the branch line's potential.

Four of the buildings make up the Mary Ball Washington Museum and Library, founded in 1958, whose purpose is to preserve and interpret the history of Lancaster County, Virginia.Official website of The Mary Ball Washington Museum and Library Retrieved January 2012 and Accompanying photo and Accompanying map The Lancaster Court House Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History Lancaster County was formed from Northumberland County in 1651, and plans for a courthouse were prepared three years later, and it was built by William Norgham. Although the original Building's exact location is now unknown, it is assumed to have stood very near the Coromotan River, given the order referencing \\"ye building of a courthouse in Coromotan ...\\" and mentions an inlet. However, the location proved unpopular, so the courthouse was moved to land of Captain William Ball by 1698. It was moved again circa 1738, and the county seat in 1740. The current courthouse was opened in 1861 and built on what had once been the Upper Tavern. It was remodeled consistent with Thomas Jefferson's Roman Revival courthouse designs in 1937. The complex includes the old clerk's office and former jail, both dating back to the 18th century. The town itself was authorized in 1691 by Virginia's General Assembly, on the west side of the Corrotoman River. Furthermore, the county's records date back to the colonial period, unlike many Tidewater counties whose records were destroyed in the American Civil War, since Lancaster County avoided much devastation. After the war, the county encouraged emigration, even distributing a pamphlet The Northern Neck of Virginia as a Home for Immigrants in Northern States, Canada and Europe. The 1872 Confederate memorial dates from this effort and is believed to be the first such monument erected in the Commonwealth. The historic district, essentially a linear village, also includes a tavern built circa 1800, a mid-19th-century post office, Carpenter-Gothic church, turn-of-the-century store, and many detached mid-19th-to-early-20th-century dwellings.

Early life Patrick Gray, the son of Patrick Gray, 5th Lord Gray, and of his wife Barbara (a daughter of William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven) grew up as a Protestant and attended the University of Glasgow. In 1575 he married to Elizabeth Lyon, daughter of John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis, a marriage that failed shortly afterwards. Patrick traveled to France, converted to Roman Catholicism and became a supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots (died 1587). Political life On his return to Scotland in 1583 Patrick gained notability as a political schemer and diplomat, endearing himself to the young King James whilst he plotted with James Stewart, Earl of Arran to keep Mary in prison. In October 1584 he was appointed a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and made Master of the King's wardrobe and menagerie, in charge of the king's jewels, clothing and tapestry, and the employment of tailors and shoemakers.Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 8, (1982), 434 no. 2478; 436, no. 2486. He was sent by James VI as Scottish Ambassador to England in 1584 to broker with Elizabeth I over the fate of Mary. On his return to Scotland, after the execution of Mary, Patrick was declared a traitor, jailed and later banished from Scotland. James VI forgave Patrick and allowed him to return to Scotland in 1589, restoring his offices to him, although the Master of Gray continued his scheming career implicating himself in a number of intrigues and plots. Later life In 1584 he was sent to England with William Keith of Delny and Robert Melville to intercede for the life of Mary, Queen of Scots. Their speeches and manner of mediation were said to have been counter-productive.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), 564 On 20 July 1585 the Master of Gray married Lady Mary Stewart, daughter of Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney and cousin to King James. The marriage was attended by most people at court except the followers of the Earl of Arran.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 8, p. 34. Mary, Mistress of Gray, was a friend of Jean Stewart, Countess of Argyll, who left her a gown of cloth of gold, a black velvet gown with gold trim, and scented 'must' beads in 1588.Letters to the Argyll Family (Edinburgh, 1839), p. 75 Jean Stewart's mother Elizabeth Bethune was married to the Master of Gray's uncle James Gray. On Monday 3 May 1598 the Duke of Holstein, brother of Anne of Denmark, came to Fowlis Castle for dinner during his progress, escorted by William Schaw. Lord Gray was ordered by James VI to meet him six miles from the castle.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, 13:1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 179. In November 1598 the Master of Gray was travelling in Picardy then visited the Earl of Gowrie at Orl√©ans. He spoke to Esm√© Stewart's widow, Catherine de Balsac, at Aubigny-sur-N√®re, who feared her son, Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox was plotting with Henry Kier, (a Catholic agent). Gray was trying to secure Lennox's inheritance. He had an audience with the King of France who was waiting for James VI to send him Scottish hunting hounds.HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray (London, 1877), pp. 659-660. In May 1601, the John Erskine, Earl of Mar and Edward Bruce, Commendator of Kinloss returned from an embassy to London. Although they had reached an understanding on the succession of James VI to the throne of England, it was kept secret. The apparent lack of achievement was seen as an opportunity for Mar's political opponents to supplant him, and the Master of Grey attempted, without success, to gain the confidence of Robert Cecil in England. Cecil however did not even tell Gray of his secret correspondence with the Scottish King. In the domestic arena, Gray also was involved in a coalition of Anne of Denmark and the Duke of Lennox against Mar.John Duncan Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland, 13:1 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. xxxi, xxxxiv, xxxviii. Patrick became 6th Lord Gray, on his father's death in 1609, three years before his own death in 1612. He was succeeded by his son Andrew Gray, 7th Lord Gray.

Gray asked for a silver basin and jug, the lightest (and cheapest) and gilded only on the borders.

Fort Washington, PA: London Publishing Company, 2001. (pg. 47) best known by his ring name Knuckles Nelson is a retired American professional wrestler, promoter and trainer who wrestled throughout the North American independent circuit during the 1990s and 2000s. He competed in several regional promotions such as the Century Wrestling Alliance, the National Wrestling Alliance and the United States Wrestling Association. He also briefly appeared in World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation as well as touring Japan as Super Destroyer between 1997 and 1999. He was a founding member of Tony Rumble's The Brotherhood, a \\"heel\\" stable which dominated NWA New England during the late 1990s, and which included Eric Sbraccia, Dukes Dalton and Rick Fuller. He and Sbraccia won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1998, and defended both the World and NWA New England titles with Sbraccia and other Brotherhood members in their home promotion for almost two years. Following Rumble's death, Nelson helped run NWA New England for a time and later became a full-time booker and promoter for Wrestling Star Wars until his retirement in 2003. As head of \\"The Combat Zone\\" wrestling school, he was involved in training several independent wrestlers, most notably, Yankee Pro Wrestling veteran \\"Big Gun\\" Jim Sergeant. Biography Early life and career Born in Providence, Rhode Island. As a child, he often watched wrestling on Fox 25 Boston and was a fan of both World Class Championship Wrestling and the Von Erich family as well as a reader of wrestling newsletters The Torch and The Observer. As a young man, he decided to try his luck in the business after reading an article in the Warwick Beacon of a retired professional wrestler starting a local independent promotion. He and a friend visited a trainer at the promotion's headquarters, then occupying a rundown warehouse in Providence, and returned the following day to start their first training session. It was there that they met local independent wrestlers Bob Evans and Paul Lazon who invited them to their wrestling school in Freetown, Massachusetts. Nelson took them up on their offer and soon began training at the Freetown facility. It was there that he met Nick Steel and Brian Brieger who, in addition to Evans and Lazon, became his principal trainers. One of his earliest matches was against his former trainer Bob Evans whom he defeated at a show in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He eventually made his debut in 1994, under the name Tully McShane, and spent some time in Coastal Pro Wrestling before meeting Tony Rumble who would bring him into his emerging Boston promotion, the Century Wrestling Alliance. Century Wrestling Alliance (1995-1998) Nelson's first match in the CWA was under a mask and against Rumble himself. He suffered a bloody mouth during the match and Rumble ended up beating him with a Boston crab submission hold. Rumble paid him $100 and booked for three more shows beginning the start of his long career in the promotion. Rumble didn't like the \\"Tully McShane\\" name and began helping develop his later in-ring persona, Knuckles Nelson. On February 4, 1995, Nelson made a one-time appearance in the United States Wrestling Association where he teamed with The Shadow against PG-13 (J.C. Ice & Wolfie D). PG-13, then feuding with Tommy Rich and Doug Gilbert over the USWA Tag Team Championship, were attacked by their rivals during the post-match interview. Back in the CWA, he was initially paired with Sonny C as The Cash Money Boys but split up and feuded with each other during 1996. A top contender to the CWA Heavyweight Championship during this time,\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Winter 1996): pg. 45. he was unable to take the title from then champion Kevin Sullivan. He did, however, win the CWA Television Championship from Vic Steamboat in Derry, New Hampshire on July 6, 1996. Earlier that year, he had also appeared on the 1st annual Eddie Gilbert Memorial Show in Cherry Hill, New Jersey defeating the Inferno Kid after hitting him with brass knuckles. He was also a regular on the promotion's television show, Mass Madness. On one occasion, during a match against a young Steve Bradley, Nelson attempted to use his brass knuckles but lost them to Bradley. The referee, seeing the foreign object, immediately disqualified Bradley giving Nelson the win. It was also on the show that he started teaming with Erich Sbraccia. On March 17, 1997, Knuckles Nelson appeared on Monday Night Nitro alongside longtime independent star T. Rantula to take on Lex Luger & The Giant in Savannah, Georgia. He and his tag team partner lost the match when The Giant pinned Nelson with a chokeslam and, following the match, Luger put T. Rantula in the \\"Torture Rack\\". On May 18, he faced another WCW tag team, The Power Company (Dave & Dean Power), whom he and partner Tre lost to. At the end of the night, Nelson and Tre took part in a 10-man tag team match with Tony Rumble, Waldo and Rick Fuller to beat Vic Steamboat, El Mascarado, Baby Black and the Power Company. Holding the CWA Television Championship for over a year and a half, Nelson lost the title back to Steamboat in Brattleboro, Vermont on December 8, 1997. NWA New England (1998-1999) On January 24, 1998, Knuckle Nelson appeared at a CWA fundraising event, billed as \\"Killer Kowalski Night\\" held at the high school in Ridgefield, CT. Along with Killer Kowalski in attendance, other high-profile stars included Tony Rumble, King Kong Bundy, Tito Santana, Devon Storm and Johnny Grunge. That same night, the CWA announced that it would be joining the National Wrestling Alliance and changed its name to NWA New England. That same year, Rumble arraigned for Nelson to tour Japan as Super Destroyer with Barry Darsow and Wild Bill Irwin, Irwin having once been a mainstay of World Class Championship Wrestling. By early-1998, Nelson had formed a successful tag team with Erich Sbraccia as part of Tony Rumble's \\"heel\\" stable The Brotherhood. Two months before dropping the television title to Steamboat, they had won the CWA Tag Team Championship from The Extremists (Ace Darling & Devon Storm) and held the titles until the CWA became NWA New England. He and Sbraccia later represented NWA New England in an interpromotional match at the NWA 50th Anniversary Show where they faced NWA World Tag Team Champions The Border Patrol (Agent Gunn & Agent Maxx) from NWA All-Star Wrestling. This was a \\"Four Corners\\" match that included Team Extreme (Kit Carson & Khris Germany) from NWA Southwest and Barry Windham & Tully Blanchard, although Windham was later replaced with Dr. Tom Prichard. Together with manager Tony Rumble, The Brotherhood defeated The Border Patrol to win the titles. Although the NWA wanted Nelson and Sbraccia to tour the various NWA territories to defend the championship, Rumble fought to keep the titles in New England. Their run as the tag team champions is considered one of the high points in NWA New England's history. On February 18, 1999, Knuckles Nelson also won the NWA New England Heavyweight Championship from Trooper Gilmore in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Early in their title reign, Sbraccia was injured and other members of the stable often substituted for him. The titles were held up on March 3, 1999, when Nelson and his partner were forced to miss a scheduled title defense in North Richland Hills, Texas due to heavy snow. Staying in NWA New England, he and Dukes Dalton defeated Jason Rage & Slyk Wagner Brown at a house show in Southbridge, Massachusetts several days later. He and Sbraccia also made their first WWF appearances, though wrestling in separate singles matches, taking on Hardcore Holly and Mideon respectively in the opening matches of Shotgun Saturday Night. The Brotherhood were given back the belts after a June 10 rematch in Dallas, Texas winning via disqualification. He and Rick Fuller briefly lost the titles to The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock & Johnny Grunge) in Bolton, Massachusetts on June 17, but regained them two days later with Dukes Dalton in Dorchester. He and Dalton also won the NWA Tag Team titles from The Arc Angels (Damon D'Arcangelo & Phoenix King) in Somerville on August 22 which, in addition to the NWA World Tag Team titles, they continued to defend for another month. He made another WWF appearance on the September 11th edition of WWF Jakked against The Big Boss Man. He and Dukes lost the NWA New England titles almost two weeks later to the New York Posse (Curtis Slamdawg & Jay Kobain) in Somerville, Massachusetts on September 22. He wrestled Slamdawg, who also succeeded him as heavyweight champion, in a singles match at Somerville's Good Time Emporium that same day. He would face him again at an event for Connecticut Championship Wrestling in East Haven, Connecticut at the end of the year. On September 25, he and Dukes Dalton, managed by Jeff Katz, lost the NWA World Tag Team titles to Team Extreme (Kit Carson & Khris Germany) at the NWA 51st Anniversary Show at the Grady Cole Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. On October 30, he made a second appearance on WWF Jakked with Dukes Dalton against The Headbangers (Mosh & Thrasher). He and Dalton would regain the belts a final time, beating the New York Posse in Thomaston, Connecticut on October 2, and would continue to hold the belts until the stable split up early the next year. When promoter Tony Rumble died of a heart attack in November 1999, he and Katz were chosen by his widow and co-owner Ellen Magliaro to take over running the promotion. Shortly thereafter, Nelson started his own promotion and Katz moved to Las Vegas to take over the morning drive show on that market's most successful talk radio station. After that, he and Katz were replaced by Jason Delgatta. Delgatta portrayed Tony Rumble's kayfabe son, \\"Boston Bad Boy\\" Jason Rumble who would remain the top star in the promotion. Wrestling Star Wars and retirement (1999-2003) Nelson founded Wrestling Star Wars, a regional promotion based in Salisbury Beach, Massachusetts, which he initially started in memory of Tony Rumble feeling it was his duty \\"to continue his work\\". On October 11, 2003, Nelson retired from the business in favor of spending more time with his family. In August 2009, he gave an interview with longtime NWA commentator Brian Webster discussing his post-wrestling career and the current state of wrestling.

The established Jewish religious communities in Israel desire to maintain and promote the religious character of the state, while the secular community wishes to reduce the impact of religious regulations in their everyday lives. Occasionally, one political side seeks to make changes to inter-communal arrangements, but these are often met by political opposition from the other side. The status quo preserves the established religious relations in Israel, and only small changes are usually made. Origins The prevailing view attributes the origins of the status quo to a letter sent by David Ben-Gurion, as chairman of the Jewish Agency Executive, on 19 June 1947, to the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel,Israel in the Middle East: Documents and Readings on Society, Politics, and Foreign Relations, Pre-1948 to the Present, editors Itamar Rabinovich and Jehuda Reinharz. - The Status Quo Letter DOC English translation in order to form a united policy to present to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), which had commenced its fact-finding tour four days earlier. The letter was meant to address their concerns that the emerging State of Israel will be a secular one, which might hurt the status of religion and religious institutions, as well as the values of their followers. In the letter, Ben- Gurion stated that neither the Jewish Agency Executive nor any other body in the country is authorized to determine in advance the constitution of the emerging Jewish state, and its secular character. One precondition from the U.N, for the establishment of the Jewish state was freedom of thought and freedom of speech to all its citizens. It was considered that the letter would satisfy the concerns of religious parties. The letter stipulated policy principles in four main areas that were considered fundamental to Orthodox Judaism: *Shabbat (the Sabbath of Judaism)‚Äîthe Jewish state's day of rest would be that of Judaism, between sunset on Friday and sunset on Saturday. *Kashrut (religious Jewish kosher laws regarding food)‚Äîkitchens in the Jewish state's official institutions would keep kosher as defined by the authorities of Orthodox Judaism, but privately each individual would be free to choose whether to observe these rules. *Family laws (marriage, etc.)‚Äîa single judicial system would be preserved for the purpose of marriage and divorce, with these being conducted in rabbinical courts for Jews and by the relevant religious authorities for people of other faiths, as was the case before; there would be no civil marriage. *Education‚Äîfull autonomy to the different Jewish denominations, while stipulating the minimum standards in fields such as the Hebrew language, Jewish history, science, etc. Personal status issues The status quo arrangement in Israel officially recognises the authority of only the Orthodox Judaism rabbinate on all personal status issues. However, each of the main Jewish denominations has a different view of 'Who is a Jew?'. The definition has potential implications in a range of areas including the Law of Return, on nationality and other purposes. The Orthodox Judaism rabbinate has a very strict interpretation of Jewish status and conversion standards and has demanded recognition only of Orthodox conversion to Judaism. The Orthodox monopoly in Israel has for many years been criticised and a political stumbling block in the relations between the more conservative religious community and the state and secular Jews in Israel. The Law of Return The political debate over 'Who is a Jew?' has symbolized the secular‚Äìreligious divide in Israel and the way it has been handled. It was the principal objective of Zionism that Palestine should be the homeland for the Jewish People. When Israel was formed in 1948, that objective was taken over by the new State. The Law of Return, enacted in 1950, stipulates that every Jew has a right to make aliyah (immigrate to Israel), hence the importance of a clear definition of who is a Jew. According to the halakha (Jewish law), a Jew is an individual who was born to a Jewish mother or one who converted to Judaism. Therefore, in those early days of the Jewish state, a temporary vagueness on the issue of 'Who is a Jew?' suited the Consociationalism form of democracy that exists in Israel, since every ruling provoked a political storm. Along with the recognition of the Status quo as the regulating arrangement, a political custom has evolved, in which the Ministry of Interior would be held by one of the religious parties represented in the Knesset (the Israeli parliament); the Minister of Interior is principally responsible for citizenship, residency and identity cards (Teudat Zehut). This custom is part of the principle of Consociationalist democracy that requires governmental rewards to be granted on the basis of each party's relative importance in the eyes of the political players. Twenty years after the Law of Return was enacted, the definition of 'Who is a Jew?' was ruled to be an individual who was born to a Jewish mother, or one who has converted and is not also under any other religion at the same time. At the same time however, the right of entry and settlement was extended to people with one Jewish grandparent and a person who is married to a Jew, whether or not he or she is considered Jewish under Orthodox interpretations of Halakha. The political reality of the founding fathers of the state of Israel was one that emphasized the form of Consociationalism democracy. The pattern of this model could be seen in the secular‚Äìreligious fracture, and especially against the background of not having been implemented in other areas of divisions in the Israeli society.

Production Hardy Bucks was created in 2007 when Chris Tordoff (Viper Higgins) filmed Martin Maloney (Eddie Durkin) and Owen Colgan (Buzz McDonnell) for a college project. After sitting on the footage for a year, Tordoff uploaded the shorts to YouTube. The show's popularity eventually got it commissioned by RTE who took editorial control of the show. Hardy Bucks was entered into the RT√â Storyland competition and from a total of 122 applications, nine projects were commissioned to make one episode each. These episodes were released in March 2009. With all nine projects on the website, the public could vote for their favourite and at the end of every month the shows with the fewest votes would be voted off, leaving the remaining teams to make the next episode with the same ‚Ç¨8,000 budget per episode. Hardy Bucks made it all the way to the finals (final two teams) and ultimately won the competition with the largest number of votes.

Here, he met Danish singer and accordion player Maia Aarskov and English guitar player and singer Cy Nicklin, and they joined forces in the folk rock trio Cy, Maia & Robert.Bille 1997, \\"Cy, Maia & Robert\\", p. 124 Folk rock in Cy, Maia & Robert: 1965‚Äì67 Cy, Maia & Robert's first release was an album entitled On the Scene in 1966.Gjedsted 1985, \\"Cy, Maia & Robert\\", p. 63 It contained one original song (written by Leli√®vre), and amongst other cover songs a version of Paul Simon's \\"A Church Is Burning\\", whom the trio met and played with during his tour around the Danish folk circuit in 1965. The album was well received by the Danish music press who admired the trio for their high technical musicianship. The trio's second album Out of Our Times came out the following year, 1967. This time it consisted of all original material, with the music written by Leli√®vre and the words by Paul Secon. Another critical success in Denmark, the reputation of Out of Our Times reached England, and the trio was invited to London to re-record \\"I‚Äôm on My Way\\" as a \\"business card\\" to bigger markets. There were plans of a US release and an appearance on English TV, but bad advice and amateurish management delayed these plans. In the meantime, the musicians had internal disagreements on the musical direction, and when in November 1967 they had all their musical equipment stolen, the trio of Cy, Maia & Robert split up during the height of their success. The fact that their records did not sell as well as hoped for also added to their problems. Three recordings with three Campbells: 1967‚Äì68 While still in Cy, Maia & Robert, Leli√®vre and Nicklin accompanied Scottish folk singer Alex Campbell on the live album Alex Campbell at the Tivoli Gardens, recorded in 1967 at Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. During March and April 1968, still in Copenhagen, Leli√®vre played with drummer James \\"Jimmy\\" Campbell and bass player Iain Campbell in the short lived trio Full Limit. Fronted by Maia Aarskov they released a single, \\"Cheers Dears\\" / \\"Natural Man\\", on Metronome Records as Maia & Full Limit. Hereafter Leli√®vre proceeded to record a nearly-acoustic album of songs with Iain Campbell, whom he had met and befriended the previous year. The album Alliance was released in October the same year under the name Robert & Iain. The six songs penned by Leli√®vre contain lyrics entirely in French, and five of them were recorded by him alone, with just an acoustic guitar. London, solo project and High Crossfield: 1969 In November 1968 Leli√®vre met Julie Driscoll and her manager Giorgio Gomelsky who invited him to travel to London in January. However, in December he received an invitation from Paul McCartney to record an album for the newly established Apple Records. Consequently, Leli√®vre went to London in December 1968, but the deal with Apple never materialised. Instead he signed a contract as songwriter and studio musician for Gomelskys rising record company, Marmalade Records. With the participation of‚Äîamongst others‚ÄîJohn McLaughlin and Brian Auger, he recorded a number of songs at London's Advision studio destined for a future solo album. For reasons remaining unclear, the solo album was never released but two of the songs‚Äî\\"Dis-toi-bien\\" and \\"J'ai vu ton visage\\"‚Äîcame out on a single in France on Marmalade Records under the name L√©lievre. \\"Dis-toi-bien\\" also appeared on Marmalade's 1969 sampler compilation Marmalade 100 Proof. This album was released shortly before the label folded and Leli√®vre consequently terminated from his contract. Leli√®vre returned to Denmark in June 1969 where he re- established work with old friend Cy Nicklin in a new band, High Crossfield. This band existed only a few months, but managed to appear on both Danish national radio and TV although they never recorded in the studio.Gjedsted 1985, \\"High Crossfield\\", p. 112 Progressive rock in Pan: 1970 In October 1969, Leli√®vre and High Crossfield bass player Arne W√ºrgler formed what was to become L√©lievre's most notable musical constellation: The progressive rock band Pan. Leli√®vre and W√ºrgler enrolled four other Danish musicians: Brothers Thomas and Michael Puggaard-M√ºller (guitar and drums), jazz-organist Henning Verner (who previously had performed with Dexter Gordon), as well as singer and lyricist Niels Skousen who initially shared the vocals with Leli√®vre but left Pan already in January 1970.Gjedsted 1985, \\"Pan\\", p. 181Bille 1997, \\"Pan\\", p. 341 Pan released their first single \\"In a Simple Way\\" / \\"Right Across My Bed\\" in January that year, followed by their eponymous titled debut album in May. All music and words on this album are written by Leli√®vre, with two songs in French and the rest in English, and the arrangements and production are tight in order to fit the sophisticated blend of rock, blues, folk, jazz and even small drops of classic.Asbj√∏rnsen 2000, \\"Pan\\" At the time of its release, Pan was hailed by the Danish press, and Dagbladet Information even named it \\"the best Danish rock album released so far\\". With time the album has gained status as one of Danish rock history's classic albums. It is listed as the fourth best Danish rock album of the 1970s in Politikens Dansk Rock, the reputed encyclopedia of Danish rock music. Pan was very much in the public eye in 1970. They played numerous concerts and festivals in Denmark and Germany and featured in two Danish radio broadcasts and one national television show. The two radio broadcasts were recorded and released on CD in 2004 by Danish label Karma Music under the title Pan on the Air ‚Äì Danish Radio Sessions 1970. They also wrote 20 minutes of instrumental music to the Swedish film Deadline and played the roles of a touring band in the film. However, despite the success on stage and in the media, the Pan album did not sell well, and the band slowly disintegrated during the late autumn of 1970. Second solo project, imprisonment and death: 1971‚Äì73 After Pan disbanded, Robert Leli√®vre recorded a solo album in 1971 with some of the members of Pan and other Danish musicians. On this album all songs except one had French lyrics. The album was subsequently judged too uncommercial by the record company, Sonet Records, and remains unreleased to this day. Under the threat of imprisonment as deserter from the army, Leli√®vre had since his departure in 1962 never returned to his native France. Nevertheless, in interviews he often expressed that he was longing for home: \\"How much I wish I can see my motherland again. I miss France, especially at this time of the year. Please, do not understand me that I do not like Denmark. It is just a thought ‚Äì to walk on the streets in the place where people speak the same language as myself.\\" So when the French government in 1972 issued an amnesty he went home to fulfill his dream. Despite the amnesty Leli√®vre was shipped off to a French prison. Upon his release, L√©lievre returned to Denmark where times got even more difficult. Haunted by inner demons and frustrated with the music business he took his own life on 26 August 1973 in Copenhagen. \\"An ignorant world lost one of the most talented songwriters of his generation\\", wrote Norwegian author Dag Erik Asbj√∏rnsen 30 years later in his book Scented Gardens of Mind: A Comprehensive Guide to the Golden Era of Progressive Rock (1968‚Äì1980).

Typical Nord-Sud decorations, with colourful tiles and an indication of the destination at the end of the station. S√®vres ‚Äì Babylone The Nord-Sud Company (English: North-South; French: Soci√©t√© du Chemin de Fer √âlectrique Nord-Sud de Paris) was an operator of underground trains in Paris established in 1904, which built two lines (now Line 12 and part of Line 13) and had a concession to build a third. It was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain de Paris (CMP) in 1930 and incorporated into the Paris M√©tro. History Concept The North-South was the initiative of Jean- Baptiste Berlier, an engineer from Lyon trained at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Mines de Saint-√âtienne, who had previously attempted to build an underground tubular tramway in 1897. In 1901 he proposed, with the financial support of Xavier Janicot, to construct a line between Montparnasse and Montmartre passing through the Gare d'Orsay and Gare Saint-Lazare through two parallel tunnels, consisting of a series of metal hoops, at a similar depth to the London \\"tube\\". This method of construction was intended to allow more direct routes to be taken, unconstrained by the street pattern. The City of Paris wanted to try this experiment and he obtained the concession on 28 December 1901. The charter provided that the costs of construction and rolling stock would be borne entirely by the concessionaire, although in the case of the CMP's lines, the City of Paris had fully funded the network infrastructure. The concession covered three proposed lines: * line A would join Montmartre to Montparnasse as an additional north-south line to the west of line 4 * line B would serve the north-west of Paris only by connecting Saint-Lazare station to Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen * line C would serve the south-west only by connecting Montparnasse station to Porte de Vanves. Financing and authorisation The Soci√©t√© du chemin de fer √©lectrique souterrain Nord-Sud de Paris (French for \\"Paris North-South underground electrical railway company\\", abbreviated to the Nord-Sud company) was created in July 1902 and replaced Berlier and Janicot as the concessionaire. The substitution was approved by a decree on 26 March 1907. The company was affiliated with the Omnium Lyonnais and formed with a capital of two million francs, the capital required increased gradually to seventy- five million francs in 1910, after the raising of thirty-five million francs of capital in 1909. The Nord-Sud aimed to distinguish itself from its rival by the high-quality decoration of its stations and trains as well as by certain technical differences. Line A between Montmartre and Montparnasse would provide substantial traffic in the absence of an existing line on this route. This was a real threat to the tram companies and to the CMP, which objected to the potential competition. Despite the delay caused by the CMP's opposition the line between Montmartre (Place des Abbesses) and Montparnasse was declared of \\"public utility\\" (a key step in the French legal process for authorising construction) on 3 April 1905. A law of 19 July 1905 completed the concession by declaring of public utility the complementary sections from Montparnasse to Porte de Versailles and the branch to Saint-Lazare and the Porte de Saint- Ouen. The extension of from Abbesses to Jules Joffrin was declared of public utility on 10 April 1908. The stretch from La Fourche to Porte de Clichy was declared of public utility on 11 June 1909. On 24 January 1912 the extension from Jules Joffrin to Porte de la Chapelle was approved and finally the line C from Montparnasse to Porte de Vanves was approved on 19 July 1912. This brought the total length of the network approved under the concession to . Construction During early studies, it appears that construction of a deep underground railway as in London quickly proved impossible because of the different nature of the ground in Paris. Beneath the water table, soil is actually very diverse in nature and waterlogged, making it impossible to build a metal tunnel. Establishing the line at an even greater depth would have been more expensive. The lines were built well above the water table, like those of the CMP, just below the road, which meant that the line had a particularly tortuous alignment contrary to the original plans. The characteristics of the railway provided the specifications are similar to those of the CMP lines in relation to loading gauge, maximum grades and the minimum radius of curvature. Although the cost of construction was fully funded by the company, the City of Paris placed a levy on each ticket sold. It represented one centime per ticket for traffic of less than thirty millions passengers; for higher traffic levels the fee increased to two centimes per 2nd class ticket and 2.5 centimes for a 1st class ticket. The ticket price was set at 15 centimes in 2nd class and 25 centimes for 1st class. A return fare was fixed at 20 centimes, with a period of validity of only eight hours. In fact, fares were identical on the Nord-Sud and CMP networks, with transfers between networks to be provided free by the concession. Opening After fast construction despite the difficulties, Line A opened on 5 November 1910 from Porte de Versailles to Notre-Dame-de- Lorette, despite being postponed because of the 1910 flood. Line B opened on 26 February 1911 from Saint-Lazare to Porte de Saint-Ouen. The new network was technically very similar to that of its direct competitor, but the stations and rolling stock were more elaborate. The station names were written in porcelain instead of the enamel plates used by CMP, and directions to the trains were set out in tiles in the roofs of the tunnels. The section of line A from Notre Dame de Lorette to Pigalle opened on 9 April 1911; the section of line B from La Fourche to Porte de Clichy opened on 20 January 20, 1912; and finally the section of line A from Pigalle to Jules Joffrin opened on 30 October 1912. The completion of the northern end of line A from Jules Joffrin to Porte de la Chapelle was then delayed by the outbreak of World War I. The Nord-Sud company completed this extension during the war: it was opened on 23 August 1916. Legacy During the 1920s the company took the necessary steps for building line C, Porte de Vanves to Montparnasse. But the construction costs of Nord-Sud lines made it impossible for it to survive and on 1 January 1931, it was taken over by mutual agreement by its rival, the CMP. The former lines of the Nord-Sud company were then gradually integrated into the CMP network: old line A became line 12 and line B became line 13. Line C was built soon after by the CMP during the 1930s and became old line 14, until it was absorbed by line 13 in 1976 following the construction of an intermediate section.

It has been shown to be the same as C. pedicellata, and under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the older name (C. coccinea) should be used. Taxonomic history In 1901, Charles Sprague Sargent chose a lectotype for Crataegus coccinea from among Linnaeus's specimens, but chose a specimen that resembles C. dodgei Ashe. Sargent's lectotype opinion was followed by other authors until he realized his error and corrected it in 1909. The name C. coccinea has also been misapplied to specimens of C. intricata Lange. For almost 100 years, particularly since 1910, this species was generally called Crataegus pedicellata Sarg. except by a few authors. Linnaeus's original description was inadequate to make a decision between various unrelated species, including C. nigra, C. phaenopyrum, and C. mollis. A component of the 2003 lectotype decision was that John Claudius Loudon had founded series Coccineae on C. coccinea, which includes C. pedicellata, to which Linnaeus's specimen 187 of the Clifford Herbarium (now at the British Museum) is considered to belong. With this taxonomy, C. pedicellata Sarg. is a heterotypic synonym of C. coccinea L.

Range In North America, this species is found from Alaska east to Newfoundland, south through the mountains to Washington, northern Arizona, and northern New Mexico. In Europe, it is found in mountainous areas like the Pyrenees and Alps, as well as the far north. It is also found in parts of Russia, including Siberia, and Kamchatka. left Description The wingspan is 17‚Äì26 mm. The male wing uppersides are silver- coloured, steely blue or pale shining blue and become increasingly brown towards the edges. The female wing uppersides are almost entirely brown but with a slightly bluish pollination in the basal region. The incidence of darkening increases with altitude. All wings usually have small, dark disk spots that are sometimes surrounded by white. Both sexes have white-rimmed black dots on the pale grey-brown ground of the forewing underside, while the underside of the hind wings reveals striking white spots and occasionally orange-colored dots on the greyish-brown ground. Despite a large geographic variability in the pattern of the wing, the species is, in Europe, clearly distinguishable from other bluish species in a complex of three species widely separated geographically. Only two species overlap in range in Europe that could be confused. In the Alps and the Pyrenees, the more local and less frequent, Aricia nicias, has fine underside markings and a white stripe. In the Pyrenees, Agriades pyrenaicus may also fly in the same locations. In this species the underside forewing submarginal spots are bold black not faint grey-brown and the black markings on the underside hindwing are relatively greatly reduced or absent. Other similar species do not overlap in distribution. They are Agriades zullichi (Spain) and Agriades aquilo (Arctic Europe), and are sometimes viewed as subspecies of Agriades glandon. Ecology The butterfly flies from mid-May to September depending on the location.Arctic Blue, Butterflies of Canada Recorded food plants include Astragalus species (including Astragalus alpinus), Androsace species (including Androsace bungeana and Androsace septentrionalis), Soldanella, Diapensia lapponica, Vaccinium, and Saxifraga species (including Saxifraga bronchialis, Saxifraga spinulosa, and Saxifraga oppositifolia). Subspecies and taxonomy Several subspecies have been described: *A. g. glandon (de Prunner, 1798) (Pyrenees, Alps) *A. g. aquilo (Boisduval, 1832) (Arctic Europe and Arctic Canada) *A. g. franklinii (Curtis, 1835) (Alaska) *A. g. wosnesenskii (M√©n√©tri√©s, 1855) (Srednesibirskoe, northeastern Siberia, Kamchatka) has the pale spots of underside smaller and more widely separated from one another, especially on the hindwing. *A. g. rustica (Edwards, 1865) (Colorado) *A. g. aquilina (Staudinger, 1901) (polar tundra of Siberia) *A. g. megalo (McDunnough, 1927) (British Columbia) *A. g. bryanti (Leussler, 1935) (Alaska, Northwest Territories) *A. g. lacustris (Freeman, 1939) (Manitoba) *A. g. centrohelvetica Rezbanyai-Reser, 1981 (Switzerland) *A. g. punctatus Austin, 1998 (Arizona) *A. g. cassiope Emmel & Emmel, 1998 (California) *A. g. kelsoni Emmel & Emmel, 1998 (California) *A. g. ustjuzhanini Yakivlev & Churkin, 2003 (Mongolia) *A. g. saluki Churkin, 2005 *A. g. brutus Churkin, 2005 (eastern Sayan Mountains) *A. g. rubini Churkin, 2005 (eastern Kazakhstan) *A. g. batchimeg Churkin, 2005 (Mongolia) *A. g. labrador Schmidt, Scott & Kondla, 2006 (Labrador, Newfoundland) The relationships between these taxa are not yet fully understood.

In living individuals the pseudopodea emerge through the multiple apertures that line the apertural or leading face of the test. Alveolinids first appeared near the beginning of the Late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, some 150 million years after the superficially similar fusulinds became extinct at the end of the Permian. Irregular coiling is found in the first volutions in the microspheric forms of most genera, indicating a close relationship with the Miliolidae. Alveolinella is an exception as the proloculus in the microspheric form is perforate and the first volutions are peneroplid in character, suggesting it, Alveolinella, may have a different origin than the other alveolinids.

Formed in 1903 as a militia formation based in Victoria, the brigade later served during the First World War as part of the Australian Imperial Force, allocated to the 1st Division. During the war, the 2nd Brigade took part in the fighting at Gallipoli, including the Battle of Krithia where it lost almost a third of its strength. Later they took part in the Battle of Lone Pine before being withdrawn back to Egypt in December 1915. Following this the brigade was transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium where, between March 1916 and the armistice in November 1918, they took part in most of the major Allied operations. In the 1920s the brigade reverted to a part- time militia formation, once again based in Victoria, forming part of the 4th Division. During the Second World War, the brigade remained a part of 4th Division until 1943, when it was reallocated to the 2nd Division based in Western Australia where they were tasked with carrying out garrison duties before being redeployed to Darwin at the end of the year as the threat of invasion by the Japanese decreased. It was eventually disbanded in early 1945. History Formation Originally formed in 1903 as a Militia unit of the Commonwealth Military Forces, it was established in Victoria and consisted of four battalion-sized units‚Äî5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Australian Infantry Regiments.Kuring 2004, p. 39. In 1908 the units were retitled so that they became the 1st Battalions of their regimental designations. In 1912, the compulsory training scheme was introduced and at this time the brigade was reorganised as part of the 1st Military District, with constituent units were spread across various locations in Queensland including Toombul, Nundah and Brisbane.Australian Military Forces 1912, pp. 15‚Äì16. First World War During the First World War, the brigade was re-constituted as part of the Australian Imperial Force, as part of the 1st Division. Made up of four battalions that were raised from volunteers for overseas service from Victoria, each consisting of 1,023 menBean 1941, p. 37‚Äî5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Battalions‚Äîand initially under the command of Colonel James Whiteside McCay,Grey 2008, p. 85. and was among the first Australian formations to be sent overseas. As part of the 1st Division, after initial training, it was sent to Egypt, where they took part in the defence of the Suez Canal in the wake of the First Suez OffensiveBean 1941, p. 163. before taking part in the Gallipoli campaign, landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, coming ashore in the second wave. Troops from the 1st and 2nd Brigades at Lone Pine, 6 August 1915 Early in May the battalions of the 2nd Brigade moved from the beachhead at Anzac Cove to the British and French lodgement at Cape Helles where on 8 May they were involved in the Second Battle of Krithia, carrying out the first brigade-level attack by Australian infantry against an entrenched enemy forceKuring 2004, p. 51. and during which they suffered losses equal to roughly a third of its strength in what was a largely unsuccessful attack. After this the 2nd Brigade returned to Anzac Cove on 16 May. During the August Offensive they took part in the Battle of Lone Pine during the August Offensive. Following this the brigade was involved in largely defensive duties until they were withdrawn as part of the general evacuation of Allied troops from the peninsula in December 1915.Kuring 2004, p. 55. Following this the brigade returned to Egypt where they once again took part in the defence of the Suez Canal before embarking for France in March 1916. Arriving shortly after this, they took up positions in the trenches of the Western Front. Their first significant involvement in combat in Europe came in July 1916 during the Battle of Pozi√®res and after this, over the course of the next two and a half years, they took part in most of the major Allled operations against the German Army. Other notable engagements that the brigade took part in included the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917, the Spring Offensive and the Hundred Days Offensive in 1918. During the war, the units of the 2nd Brigade suffered 7,988 casualties of which 3,958 were killed. Eight men from these units also received the Victoria Cross. Inter war years In 1919, the 2nd Brigade, was reformed as part of the Militia, in the 1st Military District in Queensland. Initially it consisted of six battalion-sized units: the 2nd and 5th Battalions, 9th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 25th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment.Kuring 2004, p. 107. The following year, it was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division in VictoriaPalazzo 2001, p. 91. and in 1921 when the AIF was finally officially disbanded, the citizen force infantry regiments were reorganised to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF.Kuring 2004, p. 93. In 1924 the brigade was part of the 3rd Military District in Victoria, consisting of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Battalions.Kuring 2004, p. 110. Over the course of the inter war years, the brigade's component units changed a number of times as the economic pressures of the Great Depression lead to a reduction in the size of the Militia and the amalgamation of a number of battalions.Kuring 2004, p. 112. In 1928, just before the end of compulsory military training, the brigade consisted of the 5th, 6th, 23rd and 32nd Battalions.Palazzo 2001, p. 102. Later, in 1934, it was made up of the 5th, 6th, 8th and 14th Battalions.Kuring 2004, p. 111. These units remained in the brigade until 1939.Kuring 2004, p. 113. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the Australian government decided to raise an all-volunteer force for overseas service. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force.Grey 2008, p. 146. Although conscription was reintroduced in early 1940, the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) prevented the dispatch of conscripts to fight except within the boundaries of Australia and its external territories.Palazzo 2001, p. 153. As a result, as the units of the newly raised 2nd AIF were sent overseas to North Africa, the Militia were called up progressively for three months continuous training in order to improve the overall readiness of Australia's defences.Palazzo 2001, p. 147. Initially, the brigade was composed of four infantry battalions under the overall command of temporary Brigadier George Langley: the 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment), the 6th Battalion, the 14th Battalion (Prahan Regiment), the 32nd Battalion (Footscray Regiment) and the Melbourne University Rifles. However, in early 1940, the Australian Army's brigade establishment was reduced from to three battalions in order to fall in line with standard British doctrine. In October 1942, Militia units from the 2nd and 4th Divisions took part in large-scale defensive exercise in Geraldton, Western Australia. Following the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941, and their subsequent advance through Malaya and New Guinea, units of the Militia were called upon to carry out garrison and defensive duties around Australia in response to the perceived threat of invasion.Stanley 2008, p. 132. The 2nd Brigade was mobilised at Mount Martha, and initially assigned to defend the Melbourne area. In this role, two battalions were deployed to Flinders and Portsea, while brigade headquarters and two other battalions remained around Red Hill.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2058. Following this the 14th and 32nd Battalions were merged and later transferred to the 6th Brigade. In February 1942 the Melbourne University Rifles were also removed from the brigade's order of battle. In May 1942 the 2nd Brigade, as part of the 4th Division moved from Victoria to Western Australia and at this time the brigade gained the 2/11th Battalion, a Western Australian AIF unit that had fought in North Africa, Greece and Crete, before being virtually destroyed and brought back to Australia. In October 1942, along with the rest of the 4th Division and units from the 2nd Division they took part in a corps-level exercise in Geraldton, Western Australia.Kuring 2004, p. 151. In early 1943, the 2nd Brigade was transferred to the 2nd Division, based in the Mount Lawley area, where they carried out garrison duties along with the 5th and 8th Brigades. In July the 2/11th Battalion were transferred to the 19th Brigade in Queensland. Later, in August 1943, however, the brigade was moved to Darwin, when it became part of the LHQ Reserve.Dexter 1961, p. 280. In September 1943 the 5th and 6th Battalions were joined by the 19th Machine Gun Battalion, and then in December by the 10th/48th Battalion. By late 1944, however, the threat of invasion no longer existed and the division along with many of its component units were disbanded in order to ease some of the labour shortages being experienced in the Australian economy.Palazzo 2001, p. 174.Kuring 2004, p. 150. Between August and November 1944 most of its component units were transferred out and disbanded and as its strength diminished, the 2nd Brigade was finally disbanded on 8 January 1945 while at Wallgrove, New South Wales.Long 1963, p. 25.

It is well known among modern-day Latinists as the place where documents of the Catholic Church are written in or translated into Latin. History The Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters, or in short Secretariate of Briefs, was one of the so- called offices of the Roman Curia which were abolished in the 20th century. The secretary for Latin letters was a prelate or private chamberlain whose duties were to write the letters of less solemnity which the sovereign pontiff addresses to different personages. By the time of Pope Paul VI's reform of the Roman Curia, the office once known as Secretary for Briefs to Princes had been renamed more prosaically as the Latin Language Department of the First Section of the Secretariat of State. No longer headed by a Cardinal, it had lost some of its luster, but it remained the real communications hub at the Vatican. 21st century Reginald Foster is an American Catholic priest and friar of the order of Discalced Carmelites, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 14 November 1939. A noted Latin expert, he works in the Latin Letters Section of the Secretariat of State in the Vatican. Foster became one of the Pope's Latinists in the late 1960s. Today, the office's seven Latinists have a steady stream of work, and sometimes they fall behind. When Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs encyclical, Caritas in veritate, was published in July 2009, no Latin text was released, apparently for the first time. The translators were still working on the document, and the Latin version was published only at the end of August, only after it had been sent by DHL to Foster's sickbed for corrections.'Nulli secundus': Recovering U.S. Priest Leaves Hole in Latin Office References Category:Latin language Category:Secretariat of State (Holy See) ","title":"Latin Letters Office"},{"id":"24409190","text":"The 96th Delaware General Assembly was a meeting of the legislative branch of the state government, consisting of the Delaware Senate and the Delaware House of Representatives.

Built in 1881 to carry the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway across the Hereford Road at an angle of approximately 45¬∞, it was built as a ribbed skew arch with stone spandrels and wing walls, and ribs of blue brick. The railway line was closed in 1959 and the bridge is now used as part of the Ledbury Town Trail footpath. History The Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal opened in two phases in 1798 and 1845, but in 1863, after a period of financial difficulty, it was leased to the Great Western Railway and in 1881 work started on converting the southern section into a railway. The Ross and Ledbury Railway Company's intention was to build a line between Ledbury and Ross-on-Wye via Dymock, where the Newent Railway Company planned a junction and a line that would link to the Great Western Railway at Over Junction, west of Gloucester. Both companies received Parliamentary approval in 1873, but due to financial difficulties building was delayed for two years, by which time the Ross and Ledbury Railway had abandoned its plan to reach Ross and linked with the Newent Railway head-on to provide a through route from Ledbury to Gloucester. The line opened to traffic on 27 July 1885, when the existing Ledbury station was renamed Ledbury Junction, the Ledbury and Gloucester line curving away from the Worcester and Hereford Railway line on an embankment immediately west of the station. Just south of the junction the double-track line was carried at an awkward angle of approximately 45¬∞ over the Hereford Road, now part of the A438, by an arch bridge of \\"unusual design\\". The two smaller companies were amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1892, and on 4 January 1917 the double track between Ledbury and Dymock was singled to provide materials for the Great War. The line closed to passenger traffic on 11 July 1959, with the section between Ledbury and Dymock closing completely and Ledbury Junction station reverting to its old name, while the southern section remained open to freight traffic until 30 May 1964. Many bridges along the closed line were dismantled and in some cases just the abutments remain, but Hereford Road bridge remains intact and is currently in use as part of the Ledbury Town Trail footpath, with a nearby information board making the following extravagant claim: The skew canal bridge to which reference is made is still in place at Monkhide, carrying a minor road over one of the few remaining stretches of the old canal. However, now that the railway has been dismantled the canal has become the subject of an active and ambitious restoration scheme. Design and architecture The oblique bridge was built in 1881 and constructed with stone abutments, parapet walls, spandrels and wing walls but to accommodate the skew it was built with 13 separate staggered but overlapping ribs in blue brick. Photographs show that each rib forms a separate segmental right arch equal in width to three stretcher bricks (each nominally long), and offset from each of its neighbours by the width of six header bricks (each nominally 4¬Ω inches (115 mm) wide), thus providing as a whole for a skew angle of approximately 45¬∞. This method of construction was first proposed by British-born American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1802 and later championed by French civil engineer A. Boucher, and has the advantage of being one of the simpler ways of building a skew arch, but set against that it has received considerable criticism for being \\"weak, ugly and wasteful of materials\\". The bridge is relatively unadorned and devoid of fussy detail. The smooth blue brick ribs contrast with the rusticated pink sandstone and the east parapet wall carries a plain date stone to mark 1881 as the year of construction.

After three days the Pakistanis withdrew with the loss of 66 tanks (31 confirmed). The Indians admitted to the loss of 6 Centurions. The battle coincided with the Battle of Asal Uttar where the Indians were again successful. It was followed by the Battle of Chawinda, where the Indian offensive was halted. On 22 September a ceasefire came into force. Battle The battle commenced on 10 September 1965 when Indian troops launched a massive attack in the Phillora sector headed by Indian 1st Armoured Division. Equipped with four armoured regiments, and with a motorised infantry brigade attached, the division faced stiff opposition from the Pakistani 6th Armoured Division. Pakistani aircraft attacked the Indian forces. Their tanks suffered little damage while the supporting transport and infantry columns were harder hit. Over the next two days there was intense fighting before the outnumbered Pakistani troops made a tactical retreat towards Chawinda. At this point India claimed to have destroyed 66 Pakistani tanks.Zaloga, Steve (1999) The M47 and M48 Patton tanks pg.34-35. According to ex-Pakistan Army Major and military historian A.H.

In 1785, by which time he was an alderman, he was elected Sheriff of London and knighted whilst in office.Complete baronetage In 1792 he was elected Lord Mayor of the City of London. It was reported that this was a time: In the same year he was one of the three men returned as Members of Parliament for the Parliamentary constituency of Malmesbury. In 1793, Sanderson became president of Bridewell Hospital where he is acknowledged to have transformed the way it was managed. The hospital took in poor people and was a cross between a prison and a school. Later the institution's two roles were split, and in time the school became King Edward's School, Witley. Sanderson was a member of William Wilberforce's Proclamation Society, which had been founded following a 1787 royal proclamation instituted by Wilberforce via the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice was intended to be a remedy for a perceived rise in immorality. Sanderson was also a member of the Philanthropic Society and the vice-president of Magdelen Hospital. On 6 December 1794, Sanderson became Sir James Sanderson, Baronet of London.LeighRayment, accessed September 2009 Bridewell (c.1808) where Sanderson was president (a governor) In the following parliamentary election he was returned as the member for Hastings together with Nicholas Vansittart. Vansittart went on to be one of the most successful Chancellors of the Exchequer, whilst Sanderson became a friend and admirer of William Pitt the Younger and was \\"a favourite\\" of him and the king. Sanderson was married twice, first to Elizabeth Judd of Chelmsford. By his second wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Skinner), Sanderson gave his name via his daughter, Elizabeth Skinner Sanderson, to his grandson, the physician Sir John Burdon-Sanderson. (Sanderson had made it a condition of his will that his heirs should take his surname; and in 1815 his new family took his arms, from 1794, as well.) A painting of him, from which he was described as handsome, was placed in the court room of Bridewell Royal Hospital.

Terraced housing was introduced to Australia in the 19th century. Their architectural work was based on those in London and Paris, which had the style a century earlier. Large numbers of terraced houses were built in the inner suburbs of large Australian cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, mainly between the 1850s and the 1890s. The beginning of this period coincided with a population boom caused by the Victorian and New South Wales Gold Rushes of the 1850s and finished with an economic depression in the early 1890s. Detached housing became the popular style of housing in Australia following Federation in 1901. Terraced houses in the Sydney suburb of Millers Point. With artificial urban boundaries, new townhouse type developments‚Äîoften nostalgically evoking old style terraces in a modern style‚Äîreturned to the favour of local planning offices in many suburban areas. The modern suburban versions of this style of housing are referred to as \\"town houses\\". Terraced houses in Australian cities are highly sought after, and due to their proximity to the CBD of the major cities they are often expensive, much like terraces in New York City.  History and description  Susannah Place in Sydney is one of the earliest surviving examples of terraced housing Terraced housing in Australia ranged from expensive middle-class houses of three, four and five-storeys down to single-storey cottages in working-class suburbs. The most common building material used was brick, often covered with stucco. Many terraces were built in the \\"Filigree\\" style, distinguished through heavy use of cast iron ornament, on balconies and verandahs, sometimes depicting native Australian flora. As many terraces were built speculatively, there are examples of \\"freestanding\\" and \\"semi-detached\\" terraces which were either intended to have adjoining terraces added. In the first half of the twentieth- century, terraced houses in Australia fell into disfavour and many became considered slums. In the 1950s, urban renewal programs were often aimed at eradicating them entirely, not infrequently in favour of high-rise development. In recent decades, there has been a very strong revival of interest in terraced houses in inner-city areas, with many examples having been gentrified. Victoria Melbourne Terraces in Carlton, Victoria featuring the elaborate ornamentation which exemplifies the \\"Boom Style\\" of the late Victorian era. Cypress Terrace, East Melbourne, an example of well- preserved terraces Melbourne's flat terrain has produced regular terraced house patterns. The wealth of the gold rush fuelled speculative housing development and also ensured that many terraces were built with ornate and elaborate details in a generally Italianate style, reaching its zenith in the 1880s with what is often referred to as \\"boom\\" style. The generic Melbourne style of terrace is distinguishable from other regional variations. The majority of designers of Victorian terraces in Melbourne made a deliberate effort to hide roof elements with the use of a decorative parapet, often combined with the use balustrades above a subtle but clearly defined eave cornice and a frieze, which was either plain or decorated with a row of brackets (and sometimes additional patterned bas-relief). Chimneys were often tall, visible above the parapet and elaborately Italianate in style. Individual terraces were designed to be appreciated on their own as much as part of a row. Symmetry was achieved through a central classical inspired pediment or similar architectural feature, balanced by a pair of architectural finial or urns on either side (though these details were subsequently removed on many terraces). The party walls were almost always decorated with corbels (which sometimes depicted heads), and the large wooden entry doors were decorated with stained or etched glass surrounds. Many Melbourne terraces also featured a unique style of polychrome brickwork, influenced heavily by the early work of local architect Joseph Reed and often highly detailed (though in many terraces this distinctive feature has been later painted or rendered over, although some have since been sandblasted or stripped back). The Melbourne style incorporated decorative cast iron balconies (of the filigree style). The demand for imported cast iron eventually led to the establishment of local foundries. As a result, Melbourne has more decorative cast iron than any other city in the world.Cast Iron ‚Äì a City Dressed in Lace Melbourne style terraces were often set back from the street rather than built to the property line, providing a small front yard. Decorative cast-iron fencing, regularly dispersed with rendered brick piers, was typically used, and the party wall of the end terraces would sometimes, but not always, extend to the property line to join the fence. Cliveden Mansions in East Melbourne was modelled on the terraces of London and was the largest terraced house ever built in Melbourne. It was demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the high-rise Hilton Hotel. History of terraced housing in Melbourne The earliest surviving terraced house in Melbourne is Glass Terrace, 72‚Äì74 Gertrude Street, Fitzroy (1853‚Äì54). Royal Terrace at 50‚Äì68 Nicholson Street Fitzroy, completed three years later is only slightly younger and is the oldest surviving complete row. Multi-storey terraced housing became prevalent in the Melbourne suburbs of Middle Park, Albert Park, East Melbourne, South Melbourne, Carlton, Collingwood, St Kilda, Balaclava, Richmond, South Yarra, Cremorne, North Melbourne, Fitzroy, Port Melbourne, West Melbourne, Footscray, Hawthorn, Abbortsford, Burnley, Brunswick, Parkville, Flemington, Kensington and Elsternwick. Free-standing terraces and single-storey terraces can be found elsewhere within 10 kilometres of the Melbourne city centre. Terraced housing fell out of favour with Melbourne councils and after the First World War some actually sought to ban them completely. The increase of slums in areas of terraced housing saw the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects in 1910 identify the problem as being caused by small inner city allotment sizes. The Housing and Slum Reclamation Act of 1920 shifted the responsibility for slum reclamation to local councils. The consequence was a shift toward larger block sizes and, inevitably, urban sprawl. During the 1920s, many terraced houses in Victoria were converted into flats. Although Melbourne retains a large number of heritage registered terraces, many rows were substantially affected by widescale slum reclamation programs in favour of the Housing Commission of Victoria's high-rise public housing plans during the 1950s and 60s. Later private development of walk-up flats and in-fill development has further reduced the number of complete rows. However the 1960s saw a new trend of restoration as part of the gentrification of Melbourne's inner suburbs.THE GENTRIFICATION OF INNER MELBOURNE. A Political Geography of Inner City Housing by LOGAN, William Stewart. University of Queensland Press. 1985 As a result, streets and suburbs which contain large intact rows of terraced housing are now fairly rare. Suburbs such as Albert Park, Fitzroy, Carlton, Parkville and East Melbourne are now subject to strict heritage overlays to preserve what is left of these streetscapes. A late 19th century terrace of six houses in South Geelong, similar in style to those found in inner Melbourne. Some of the more notable examples of terraced housing in Melbourne include the heritage registered Tasma Terrace, Canterbury, Clarendon Terrace, Burlington Terrace, Cypress Terrace, Dorset Terrace, Nepean Terrace and Annerly Terrace (East Melbourne), Blanche Terrace, Cobden Terrace, Holyrood Terrace (Fitzroy), Rochester Terrace and the St Vincent Gardens precinct (Albert Park), Royal Terrace, Holcombe Terrace, Denver Terrace, Dalmeny House & Cramond House, and Benvenuta (Carlton), Marion Terrace (St Kilda) and Finn Barr (South Melbourne). Regional Victoria Outside of Melbourne in Victoria, the larger cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong have some scattered historic terraced houses in inner areas, ranging from modest examples to impressive, though generally short, rows. The smaller seaside resort town of Queenscliff has a number of examples from the late 19th century. The towns of Portland and Port Fairy, established early in Victoria's development, have a handful of plain, mainly single-storey, verandah-less early Victorian examples. Other early country towns occasionally have a single example of the same type. New South Wales Sydney Regency style terraces in Millers Point. Sydney has some of Australia‚Äôs oldest terraced housing. Terraced houses were a feature of the city from around the 1830s. Susannah Place (1844) is one of the earliest still surviving. Others include; Corana and Hygeia, a pair of two- storey Victorian terraced houses built in 1896; Avonmore Terrace (1888), now a boutique hotel. Hortonbridge Terrace, grand triple-storey row of five houses built in 1890. The Horbury Terrace (1836), which is a Georgian terrace that has been reused as offices, and it is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Due to Sydney's higher density, most terraces tend to be taller than those found in Melbourne, where it is not unusual to find terrace houses of up to four storeys, exemplified by roof features and Dormer windows. Early Georgian style sandstone terraces are found in many of the city's inner suburbs. The terraces of some Sydney suburbs exhibit a distinctly regional variation, with some having Italianate features. The undulating topography of Sydney's inner suburbs means that many of the terraces are typically staggered up hills rather than level or uniform. Sydney terraces were more likely to make a feature of the roof than their Melbourne counterparts, often featuring high-pitched dormer windows, but contrasted with much shorter and plainer chimneys. Building rules introduced in 1838 required party walls to be raised above the roofline, which helped define the Sydney style and skyline of Many of Sydney's terraces have been subjected to gentrification, such as these in Glebe terraced suburbs. The terraces often lack a parapet and feature high- pitched roof with dormer windows and attics to make use of the roof space. Sydney terraces were often built right up to the property line; Sydney's narrow streets also make for more intimate street scapes where terraced. As housing developed in Australia, verandas became important as a way of shading the house. From the mid-19th century in particular, as more people became affluent, they built more elaborate homes, and one of the favoured elaborations was the filigree, or screen, of cast iron or wrought iron. This developed to the point where it has become one of the major features of Australian architecture. In contrast to the British practice of the day, under which dozens or even hundreds of houses were constructed by a developer as a single housing estate, Sydney practice was normally to build a short run of houses, an interesting example being the \\"Castle Terrace\\" in Paddington. They feature pitched corrugated iron roofs with round dormer windows, exposed party walls and chimneys with four terracotta pots. The double storey verandahs are rich in iron lacework. Most Sydney terraces are firmly anchored into solid sandstone, which provided an opportunity to follow the British practice of constructing a Terraces in Paddington, New South Wales exemplify the local variation found in Sydney. Large rows with taller dormer windows often appear to march up and down hills.basement storey below street level, reached by a flight of stairs down from the street. Many examples of this are to be found in Paddington. In the suburb of Balmain, there are examples of houses actually constructed from local sandstone, rather than bricks covered with stucco. Another Sydney innovation was the cantilevered verandah which allowed inner city terraces and corner shops to utilise the space above the public footpath and giving the houses a distinctive appearance. Suburbs where terraced housing is prevalent include those in the inner city such as , , , Bondi Junction, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and Woolloomooloo.

Almost all of them be found in a conservation area just east of the central business district on The Terrace, Wolfe Street, Tyrell Street, Bull Street and Watts Street, including Buchanans Terrace (). Campbell Street in Wollongong features the city's only heritage terraced houses. The city of Dubbo has examples of Victorian terraces and semi-detached houses close to the city centre, mostly in the Darling Street area. , , and Wagga Wagga have a large number of modest terrace houses. Queensland Brisbane The Mansions in Brisbane CBD, possibly Queensland's most notable row. In Brisbane, Queensland, apart from government buildings, stone and attached buildings were deprecated, and in fact legislated against by the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885. Enacted as a public health and anti-slum measure, it set a minimum frontage of about 10 metres for each residential block, thus effectively ending the building of terraces, although a few terraces were built as a single rental project, were not subdivided, and managed to bypass the legislation. However, only a handful of elaborate heritage listed examples remain, mostly clustered in the Central Business District (The Mansions and Harris Terrace on George Street and Petrie Terrace on Petrie Terrace), and a handful of singular rows in the inner suburbs (Cook's Terrace on Coronation Drive, Milton, and Edmonstone Street in West End). Most of these examples notably differ in style to terraces in other Australian cities in that as a regional variation, most of them incorporated elements of the Queenslander. In particular high-pitched or hip roof, covered in corrugated galvanised iron is notable as a dominant and practical design element. Nostalgic replicas became popular in Brisbane in the 1980s and 1990s in mock-Victorian style, in an attempt by developers to appeal to wealthy migrants from interstate. As a result, there are some quite convincing replica Sydney and Melbourne-style terraces along Gregory Terrace in Brisbane. South Australia A row of terrace houses on North Terrace in the Adelaide city centre. Some of the oldest terraces in Adelaide are located on North Terrace. The Marine Terraces on the esplanade in the suburb of Grange, a row of large three-storey filigree terraces built in 1884, are also notable. Western Australia In Perth, Western Australia, there are a handful of examples in the inner city and Fremantle's Point Street. Tasmania Despite the relatively small size of its major cities in comparison with those on mainland Australia, Tasmania, being one of the oldest European settlements, has a number of fine examples of terraced housing, particularly in inner Hobart. Launceston has some good examples as well, mostly in the central business district and East Launceston, including Alpha Terrace, which has striking similarities to many of the terraces in Sydney's hilly suburbs.

The Master opts to be frozen artificially for a hundred years in a remote location, after which he expects to be revived and get an artificial heart implanted in his body. However, the secret of his resting place has been lost over time, and the Master is only revived a long time later than expected (on the order of millions of years). He opens his eyes, eager to visualise how the future Man looked like, and is in for a terrible shock. As he looks at the insects surrounding him, he realises that Man had lost the Man-Insect war.

In 1980 he became a member of the band Narodno Blago (National Treasure) which performed rhythm and blues and occasionally performed as the supporting band for Split punk rock musician Fon Bi≈°kiƒá, with whom they performed covers of The Rolling Stones, Ramones and The Clash songs. Narodno Blago disbanded in 1983, and Belan became the member of the band Aquilla. The band performed Dalmatian folk songs, and Belan played mandolin. ƒêavoli and solo career Neno Belan (on the left) performing with Fiumens in Novi Sad In 1984 Belan formed the band ƒêavoli (The Devils), which performed music inspired by 1950s rock and roll.

In 1991 ƒêavoli disbanded due to the outbreak of Yugoslav wars, and 1991 Split Festival, where Belan and Anja ≈†ovagiƒá Despot were scheduled to perform the song \\"Ljubav postoji zbog nas\\", was canceled. Belan appeared on the Split Festival in 1992 performing song \\"Zaboravi\\". In 1993 he released his first solo album, Vino noƒái (Night Wine). The album vas recorded with members of Daleka Obala. Vino noƒái featured hits \\"Zaboravi\\", \\"Sunƒçan dan\\" (written by Zdravko Bajan, a former member of Narodno Blago), \\"A gdje si ti?\\" and \\"Ljubav postoji zbog nas\\" (previously unreleased duet with Anja ≈†ovagiƒá Despot). The album also featured English language versions of \\"Vino noƒái\\" and \\"Sunƒçan dan\\".

It ordered German support for Iraq's Arab nationalists, who were fighting the British. Background F√ºhrer Directive No. 30 dealt with German intervention in support of Arab nationalists in the Kingdom of Iraq. During the 1930s, representatives of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy attempted to gain favor with various Iraqi nationalists and promised support against the British. On 1 April 1941, Rashid Ali and members of the pro-Axis \\"Golden Square\\" staged a coup d'etat against the pro-British government of Regent Amir Abdul Illah. On 2 May, after tensions mounted on both sides, the British launched pre-emptive air strikes against Iraqi forces and the Anglo-Iraqi War began. Rashid Ali immediately requested that the Germans make good on the earlier promises of assistance.Lyman, pp. 63-65 Full text On 23 May 1941, Hitler issued F√ºhrer Directive No. 30 which said:Churchill, Chapter 14, The Revolt in Iraq, p. 234 :1. The Arab Freedom Movement is our natural ally against England in the Middle East. In this context the uprising in Iraq is of special importance. This strengthens the forces hostile to England in the Middle East beyond the Iraqi frontier, disrupts English communications, and ties up English troops and shipping at the expense of other theaters.Churchill, Chapter 14, The Revolt in Iraq, p. 234 :I have therefore decided to hasten developments in the Middle East by supporting Iraq. Whether and how it may be possible, in conjunction with an offensive against the Suez Canal, finally to break the British position between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf is a question that will be answered only after Barbarossa. :2. In connection with my decision I order the following for the support of Iraq: (a) Support by the air force. (b) Dispatch of a military mission. (c) Arms deliveries. :3. The military mission (cover name ‚Äì Special Staff F) will be under the command of General [Hellmuth] Felmy. Its tasks are: (a) To advise and support the Iraqi armed forces. (b) Where possible, to establish military contacts with forces hostile to England outside of Iraq. (c) To obtain experience and intelligence in this area for the German armed forces. The composition of this organization will be regulated, in accordance with these duties, by the Chief of the High Command in the Armed Forces. Chain of command will be as follows: (a) All armed forces personnel sent to Iraq, including liaison staff in Syria, will be under the command of the head of the military mission with the proviso that orders and guidelines for the aviation units will come exclusively from the High Command of the Air Force. (b) The head of the military mission will be subordinate to the Chief of the High Command in the Armed Forces, with the proviso that orders and guidelines for the aviation units will come exclusively from the High Command of the Air Force. (c) The members of the military mission are, for the time being, to be regarded as volunteers (in the manner of the Condor Legion). They will wear tropical uniforms with Iraqi badges. Also, Iraqi markings will be worn by German aircraft. :4. The Air Force: The employment of the air force in limited numbers is intended, apart from direct effects, to increase the self-confidence and fighting spirit of the Iraqi people and armed forces. :5. Arms Deliveries: The Chief of the High Command in the Armed Forces will issue the necessary orders in this respect. (Deliveries to be made from Syria, in accordance with the agreement reached with the French in this matter, and from Germany.) :6. The direction of propaganda in the Middle East is the responsibility of the Foreign Office, which will cooperate with the High Command in the Armed Forces, Operations Staff ‚Äì Propaganda Section. The basic idea of our propaganda is: The victory of the Axis will free the countries of the Middle East from the English yoke, and will give them the right to self-determination. All who love freedom will therefore join the fight against England. No propaganda is to be carried out against the French in Syria. :7. Should members of the Italian Armed Forces be employed on duties in Iraq, German personnel will cooperate on the lines laid down in this directive.

She has been described by one critic as \\"the irrepressible, incomparable, unstoppable Ms. Manning ‚Äì life and soul of British contemporary music\\". Personal life The daughter of Gerald Manville Manning and Lily Manning (n√©e Thompson), Manning was born in Norwich in 1938. She was educated at Norwich High School for Girls, the Royal Academy of Music (graduating LRAM in 1958), and the Scuola di Canto at Cureglia, Switzerland. She was promoted to ARCM in 1962.MANNING, Jane Marian, in Who's Who 2009, A & C Black, 2008. In 1966, she married the composer Anthony Payne, but she does not use her married name professionally. Career Manning's London d√©but was in 1964 and her first BBC broadcast in 1965. She first sang at a Henry Wood Promenade Concert in 1972, was part of The Matrix with Alan Hacker. She founded her own virtuoso ensemble, called Jane's Minstrels, in 1988. Manning specialises in contemporary music. Her unique voice and infallible sense of pitch have made her an exemplary performer of new music. She is also widely considered to be one of the world's finest performers of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire. She has sung regularly in concert halls and festivals throughout Europe, with more than three hundred world premi√®res given. She toured Australia and New Zealand in 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1996, 2000, and 2002, and the United States in 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1996, and 1997. She is the author of an important book called New Vocal Repertory in two volumes. In his preface to Manning's 65th birthday concert at Wigmore Hall in 2003, the British critic Bayan Northcott wrote: > It was an inspired choice to present Jane Manning as Miss Donnithorne, not > only because she is an artist of astonishing gift but because she is also > one of the greatest performers of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, and in her > performance of the Maxwell Davies, the two pieces are palpably linked.... > Her performance is desperately touching, the more disturbing for being > played as reminiscence.... a performance of scorching intensity (without > conductor). Several leading composers have composed new works for Jane Manning including Harrison Birtwistle, James MacMillan and Colin Matthews. She commissioned the grand opera King Harald's Saga from Judith Weir in 1979. Richard Rodney Bennett's choral work Spells was written for her, as was Matthew King's The Snow Queen (1992). The critic Ivan Hewett has written of Manning: > For many people Jane Manning is simply the voice of contemporary classical > music in this country. Anyone who took an interest in this burgeoning area > of music in the 1970s and '80s grew up with the sound of her astonishing > voice in their ears. It‚Äôs instantly recognisable, but it‚Äôs also a chameleon. > Whether she‚Äôs faced with the pure angular leaps of Anton Webern, the throaty > suggestiveness of Schoenberg or the black, crazed humour of Gyorgy Ligeti, > Jane Manning is always equal to the task.

Miller was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). He began his involvement with politics at age 18, when he distributed materials in support of Democrat Al Smith's 1928 presidential campaign against Republican Herbert Hoover. He then held various leadership positions in the Utah Democratic Party and the Young Democrats of America and in city government. From 1951 to 1952 Miller served in the Utah House of Representatives. Afterward he was elected to the Utah State Senate, representing the 4th Senate District in Salt Lake City. He was Senate Democratic Whip in 1961. Miller began serving as Utah's Secretary of State in 1965. From 1974 to 1975 he served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. In 1976, the Utah Legislature passed a law that replaced the office of Secretary of State with the office of Lieutenant Governor. Miller thus served as the first Lieutenant Governor of Utah from 1976 to 1977, when his term ended. Miller was part of the administration of popular three- term Governor Cal Rampton.http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0571.xml/complete At the time, the Lieutenant Governor's duties included serving as superintendent of the Capitol grounds.

Many Hispanophones in the countries of Hispanic America have two given names, plus a paternal surname (primer apellido or apellido paterno) and a maternal surname (segundo apellido or apellido materno).  Colonial Hispanic America  In the colonial period and nineteenth century, it was common to have between one and three given names followed by a second name with a \\"de\\" (from) in front. For example, the Saint Teresa de Los Andes whose real name is Juana Enriqueta Josefina de los Sagrados Corazones Fern√°ndez del Solar. Where \\"Juana\\", \\"Enriqueta\\" and \\"Josefina\\" are her first names, followed by the second name \\"de los Sagrados Corazones\\". Her paternal surname is \\"Fern√°ndez\\" and her maternal surname is \\"del Solar\\". Another form of second name can be preceded by a \\"de\\" particle, which can be varied to \\"del\\" or \\"de los\\". Examples are \\"Jos√© del Pilar\\", \\"Rosa del Carmen\\", \\"Fidelina de las Mercedes\\". These second names are only used in formal occasions, and in many cases only registered in the birth, marriage and death certificates.  Modern day  Children who are not recognized by their father or to be raised separately have been legally treated in two ways, changing from time to time according to the civil registration norms. One way is to be registered with only a first surname that is the mother's surname. The second way is to have the mother's surname as first surname and second surname. Another case is to only register the father's surname and not giving reference to the mother, in accordance with US naming customs. This can be done to avoid legal and clerical complications in the future. Argentina Generally speaking, Argentine family names usually consist of a single, paternal surname. However, due to the large number of people of Spanish descent, many Argentines still use the surnames of both parents. In modern day Argentina, it's not common for married women to adopt their spouse's surname after marriage, although in the past some did add the spousal surname after their own with a de (of), as in, Mar√≠a L√≥pez de Mart√≠nez. This usage is no longer seen in recent generations. Chile Instead of primer apellido (first surname) and segundo apellido (second surname), legally, the following expressions are used: apellido paterno (paternal surname) and apellido materno (maternal surname). Both surnames are equally important and having two surnames is obligation for any person in birth registrations, the use of them are mandatory for any official document.http://www.registrocivil.cl/Herramientas/PreguntasFrecuentes/faq_4.html#nac_i6https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=172986&idParte;=8720662 In Chile people never replace their surnames by the spouse‚Äôs ones at marriage. Spouse‚Äôs name adoption is not socially practiced and the possibility of so doing is not even contemplated by the law. Although a woman may socially use the marital conjunction de, it is omitted in her legal name. For example, former first lady Marta Larraechea very often is called Marta Larraechea de Frei, but her full legal name remains Marta Larraechea Bol√≠var. As another example, Soledad Alvear is almost never called Soledad Alvear de Mart√≠nez; her full legal name is Mar√≠a Soledad Alvear Valenzuela. This social practice, though, has long ago begun to fall into disfavor and very few women would these days accept to be referred to in this manner. Colombia In Colombia, the use is two surnames: first the paternal surname and then the maternal surname. Married women used to change their second last name for their husband first last name adding the preposition \\"de\\" between the two last names. However, in recent years, married women do not change their original family names for their husband's. Children who are not recognized by their father are registered with the two maternal surnames. Cuba, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico In Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico, both men and women carry their two family names (first their father's, and second their mother's). Both are equally important and are mandatory for any official document. Married women never change their original family names for their husband's. Even when they migrate to other countries where this is a common practice, many prefer to adhere to their heritage and keep their maiden name. They also use \\"de\\", as explained below. Ecuador In Ecuador, a couple can choose the order of their children's surnames. Most choose the traditional order (e.g., Guerrero Garc√≠a in the example above), but some invert the order, putting the mother's paternal surname first and the father's paternal surname last (e.g., Garc√≠a Guerrero from the example above). Such inversion, if chosen, must be consistent for all children of the marriage. Uruguay Uruguayans carry two surnames, as is the practice in most Spanish-speaking countries. Such custom has been recognized under Uruguayan laws No. 15.462 and 19.075. Regarding names, it is a common practice for Uruguayans to carry two names. Under Section 5 of Law No. 15.462, it is forbidden to the Officers of Public Registrars to register \\"names that are extravagant, ridicule, immoral or that may provoke a misunderstanding regarding the sex of the child to whom it is being imposed.\\". Regarding surnames, according to those laws, if no agreement has been reached, the first surname shall be the father's surname (paternal surname), and the second surname shall be the mother's surname (maternal surname, or maiden surname). Women do not change their surnames upon marriage in Uruguay. In some instances, such as high society meetings, the partner's surname can be added after the person's surnames using the preposition de (of), but it is not a practice officially or legally provided, recognized or accepted. Since 2013, parents may invert this order by mutual agreement, at the naming of the first child of the couple. Subsequent children must be named following the same order, since once the order of the surnames has been established it cannot be changed. If there is no agreement on the order, the rule shall apply depending on the type of couple: in case of heterosexual couples, the order shall be as in general practice (first surname shall be the paternal surname and the second surname shall be the maternal surname). Same-sex parents may choose the order of both surnames of the children (either from birth or adoption) by mutual agreement. In case of disagreement the order of the surnames is determined by draw. For example, Natalia Marisa Oreiro Iglesias is the daughter of Carlos Florencio Oreiro Poggio and Mabel Cristina Iglesias Bouri√©. Note that the marriage between her parents did not mean that the mother lost her maiden surnames. In Uruguay, foreigners may retain use of their cultural naming customs, yet upon being granted the Uruguayan national identification document called C√©dula de Identidad, they are legally obliged to assume Spanish-style names (a name or two, and two surnames). If the naturalised person is from a one-surname culture (paternal surname), the maiden's name of the mother needs to be obtained, and if such cannot be evidenced, the surname is then duplicated. Venezuela In August 2007, a draft law by the Venezuelan National Electoral Council thus sought to change the national Venezuelan naming customs: > 'Civil Registry Organic Law Project: Limitation upon the inscription of > names Article 106 \\"...[civil registrars] will not permit... [parents] to > place names [upon their children] that expose them to ridicule; that are > extravagant or difficult to pronounce in the official language; that contain > familiar and colloquial variants that denote a confused identification, or > that generate doubts about the determination of the sex. In these cases, the > registrar will offer, as reference, a listing of the most common names and > surnames... The names of boys, girls, or adolescents of the country's > indigenous ethnic groups and the names of foreigners' children are excepted > from this disposition....\\" Popular complaint against the naming-custom-limiting Article 106 compelled the Venezuelan National Electoral Council to delete it from the Civil Registry Organic Law Project.No se incluir√° en anteproyecto de ley de registro civil art√≠culo relacionado con los nombres , National Electoral Council, 13 September 2007 It could be said that common names like Elvio Lado (which can be pronounced as \\"el violado\\", meaning \\"the raped one\\") or M√≥nica Galindo (which can be pronounced as \\"Moni caga lindo\\", meaning \\"Moni shits prettily\\") would count as an example of violation to this law. de In some instances, such as high society meetings, and with no legal value (except in Argentina), the husband‚Äôs surname can be added after the woman‚Äôs surnames using the conjunction de (\\"of\\"). Thus Leocadia Blanco √Ålvarez, married to a Pedro P√©rez Montilla, may be addressed as Leocadia Blanco de P√©rez or as Leocadia Blanco √Ålvarez de P√©rez. This format is not used in everyday settings and has no legal value.Spanish naming customs Medbib In other nations doing so is frowned upon. The contemporary naming custom now practises the wife retaining her surname. The use of the husband‚Äôs surname by a wife is typically encountered in social situations where the connection to the husband is being stressed. Her full formal married-name (√Ångela L√≥pez S√°enz de Portillo) is the documentary convention in only some Latin American countries. Where it exists, the custom provides her with ceremonial life and death wife-names, √Ångela L√≥pez, Sra. de Portillo (√Ångela L√≥pez, Wife of Portillo) wherein Sra. (se√±ora, \\"Mrs\\") connotes \\"wife\\"; and √Ångela L√≥pez S√°enz, vda. de Portillo (√Ångela L√≥pez S√°enz, Widow of Portillo), wherein vda. (viuda, \\"widow\\") denotes widowhood. Some names have the de conjunction without association to marriage at all. Instead they may reflect the geographical origin of the individual or that of the individual ancestors. Thus there are men named Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, Jos√© de Guzm√°n Ben√≠tez, Cristi√°n de la Fuente and Oscar de la Renta. Legal implications The Hispanic preference for using the first surname from the father over the second surname from the mother occasionally results in serious legal problems in the United States, where, by social convention, most people have a first name, an optional middle name, and a single last name inherited solely from the father. For example, the 2006 decision on Corona Fruits & Veggies v. Frozsun Foods, from one of the California Courts of Appeal, held that a creditor had failed to perfect its security interest in the strawberry crop of a debtor whose full true name was \\"Armando Mu√±oz Ju√°rez.\\"Corona Fruits and Veggies, Inc. v. Frozsun Foods, Inc., 143 Cal. App. 4th 319, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 868 (2006). In accordance with Mexican naming convention, he frequently went by Armando Mu√±oz, and signed documents by that name, and the creditor's financing statement therefore referred to him as \\"Armando Mu√±oz.\\" The court ruled: \\"Debtor's last name did not change when he crossed the border into the United States. The 'naming convention' is legally irrelevant[.]\\" In other words, under the California implementation of the Uniform Commercial Code, the debtor's \\"true last name\\" was Ju√°rez (his maternal surname). Indexing According to the Chicago Manual of Style, Spanish and Hispanophone names are indexed by the family name. In case there are two family names, the indexing is done under the father's family name; this would be the first element of the surname if the father's and mother's or husband's family names are joined by a y. Depending upon the person involved, the particle de may be treated as a part of a family name or it may be separated from a family name. The indexing of Hispanophone names differs from that of Portuguese of Lusophone names, where the indexing occurs from the final element of the name.\\"Indexes: A Chapter from The Chicago Manual of Style\\" (Archive).

In April 2003, Sidi Ali was the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) candidate for the House of Representatives of Nigeria for Abuja South Federal Constituency, covering the Gwagwalada, Kuje, Kwali and Abuja area councils. The election was marred by reports of vote rigging, bribery and other irregularities. His election was confirmed after an initial result that gave victory to the rival PDP candidate was appealed since some ballots had not been included in the count. In turn, the PDP appealed the decision to nullify the election of their candidate, who had died two months after the election, saying the election should be a re-run due to his death. Their appeal was rejected. Later, Sidi Ali changed allegiance to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). During a PDP campaign flag- off meeting before the April 2007 elections, he advised political opponents not to use thugs to destabilize the elections.

They could trace their origins to 1846, when they were known as the Regiment of Ludhiana (or the Loodiana Regiment). During the Indian Mutiny they were relied upon to hold Benares throughout the period of the Mutiny. In 1861, they became the 15th Bengal Native Infantry and shortly afterwards to the 15th (Ludhiana) Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry in 1864. Further changes in title followed they became the 15th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry (Ludhiana Sikhs) in 1885, the 15th (Ludhiana) Sikh Infantry in 1901 and the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs following the Kitchener reforms of the Indian Army in 1903. To honour the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Indian they took part in the Rawalpindi Parade 1905. During this time they took part in the Battle of Ahmed Khel and the Battle of Kandahar in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. They then took part in the Battle of Tofrek and Suakin in the Mahdist War, the Chitral Expedition and the Tirah Campaign and World War I. During World War I they were part of the 8th (Jullundur) Brigade, 3rd (Lahore) Division they served on the Western Front in France, in Egypt as part of the Western Frontier Force, and in the Mesopotamia Campaign. After World War I the Indian government reformed the army again moving from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 The 15th Ludhiana Sikhs now became the 2nd Battalion, 2 Sikh Regiment. This regiment was allocated to the new Indian Army after independence. The 15th Sikhs being given a heroes' welcome upon their arrival in Marseille, France during the First World War. Victoria Cross The Ludhiana Sikh Regiment in China, Circa 1860, during the Second Opium War Lieutenant John Smyth 15th Ludhiana Sikhs, was awarded the Victoria Cross, the United Kingdom's highest award for bravery in combat. The citation for this award, published in the London Gazette read: The 15th Ludhiana Sikhs and the Senussi In 1914, during the World War I the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs operated as part of the 8th (Jullundur) Brigade, 3rd Lahore Division on the Western Front in France, but was moved to Egypt in the late 1915 to fight against the Senussi, a tribal sect of Muslims led by Sayed Ahmed, also known as the Senussi. The devout Muslims were trained in battle and assisted by several Turkish military officers. The support received from the influential Turkish leader Nuri Bey has brought the Senussi a considerable advantage while fighting off the Italian occupiers of Libya. When the German submarines started aiding Turkey and the Senussi by bringing weapons to Libya and attacking the coast of Egypt, Nuri Bey, half-brother of Enver Pasha, the Turkish War Minister at the moment, persuaded Sayed Ahmed to fight against Britain and join forces with Turkey to invade Egypt in the Turkish Holy War. The Senussi were given the first mission in Egypt after a German submarine sank two British ships in November 1915 at the western coast of Egypt. They were given the task of keeping the survivors of the attacks on Tara and Moorina in captivity. Two British outposts were afterwards attacked by the Senussi at Sidi el Barrani and Sollum, determining the British Headquarters located in Cairo to give orders of withdrawal. British troops posted west of Matruh withdrew leaving back in their haste the Egyptian Coastguards at Sollum most of whom deserted the British order and joined forces with the Senussi. Wadi Senab On 20 November 1915 the Western Frontier Force was formed with Commander Major-General A. Wallace in the lead. The Western Frontier Force consisted of an infantry brigade containing partially trained battalions, the 2/7th and 2/8th Middlesex, the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs and the 6th Royal Scots, and the cavalry brigade containing three British Yeomanry regiments. The 15th Sikhs represented the regular major unit of the Western Frontier Force. The garrison placed at Matruh gathered more than 1,300 men by December, while the Senussi numbered with approximation over 2,000 men in that area. The 15th Ludhiana Sikhs were given the first mission against the Senussi on 11 December when General Wallace appointed Lieutenant-colonel J.L.R. Gordon leader of a column and gave him the task of breaking the ranks of the enemy at Duwwar Hussein. The column sent also consisted of the Notts Battery with guns, armoured cars and the 2nd Composite Yeomanry Regiment. The first clash with the enemy in the Wadi (valley) Senab turned favorably only when the squadron of Australian Light Horse intervened and helped the cavalry. Gordon left one company of the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs behind to protect the camp and planned to march towards Duwwar Hussein using two routes. While the British soldiers were driven back by the heavy trained Senussi without engaging in battle, No. 2 Company of the Sikhs, who were appointed as the advanced guard, started firing and fighting back winning some mounts. While the enemy‚Äôs flank increased and the British cavalry couldn‚Äôt reorganize in time, the advanced guard, the 15th Sikhs were ordered to withdraw. Captain C.F.W. Hughes, the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs commander, decided to remain stationary in order to protect the wounded. With the combined help of the troops and the sloop, , which fired at the Senussi with two 4-inch weapons, the enemy was forced back and the 15th Sikhs gained the opportunity to regroup and take care of the dead and the wounded. ‚ÄòThe enemy had been driven off, but had been able to retire unmolested, and must be given credit for the surprise and the vigour of his attack. Had the standard of training and the experience of the whole column been equal to those of the 15th Sikhs, the Senussi might have been heavily defeated.‚Äô Conclusion 15th Sikhs were involved in the action around Wadi Majid and Halazin as well until their orders were to proceed to India. The 15th Sikhs constituted a serious aiding force for the understaffed and untrained Western Frontier Force. The results obtained by this regiment were seen with distinction and 15th Sikhs were given the honour ‚ÄòEgypt 1915-17.‚Äô After the Indian Army‚Äôs post-war reforms, the regiment became known as the 2nd Battalion, 2 Sikh Regiment.

She is noteworthy for having become, half a century later, the patroness of the writer Frederick Rolfe. Caroline Shirley was born in England at around Christmas in 1818. It is known that she was baptized on 29 December that year in the Church of St Mary and St Chad at Brewood in Staffordshire, but the precise date of her birth cannot be established because in those days there was no requirement for the date of birth to be registered. Her father was Robert Sewallis Shirley, Viscount Tamworth (9 November 1778 ‚Äì 6 June 1824), heir to Robert Shirley, 7th Earl Ferrers (1756‚Äì1827), and her mother was a servant girl in Earl Ferrers's household. Her father died when Caroline was only five, but her grandfather the Earl, when he died in 1827, left a will in which he made surprisingly generous provision for her. In 1837 she married the thirty-year-old Duke . By coincidence, Duke Lorenzo had also been born illegitimately. His mother, having fallen pregnant to a Russian officer, a Colonel named Carl Marshall, also of English descent, gave birth to the child in her husband's palazzo, and in 1834 the Roman Rota upheld Lorenzo's claim to the dukedom on the ground that a child born in the marital home was presumed in law to have been the legitimate offspring of the head of the house. Lorenzo and Caroline were each heirs to a fortune, the security of which depended to some extent upon their nationality and religion, and the couple decided they should go through a sequence of four marriage ceremonies. They were first married in a brief civil ceremony at Gretna Green on 26 August 1837. Caroline was then received into the Catholic Church, and on 17 September Thomas Griffiths, Vicar Apostolic of London married the couple in his private chapel in Westminster. Then on 28 October their marriage was solemnised in an Anglican service at Trinity Church, St Marylebone, after which they left for the Papal States and a fourth ceremony to satisfy the requirements of the authorities in Rome. The couple returned to Italy and watched with satisfaction as their two sons grew to manhood. Over the course of the 1850s, Caroline and her family were converted to the cause of a united Italy. When in 1860 the French emperor withdrew his troops from Rome, Lorenzo was appointed Commissary for the Piedmontese forces at Rieti. Caroline was unreservedly on the side of unification, and publicly defended the pro-unification troops, however unruly they became. After Lorenzo's death in 1866, his two sons, Francesco and Bosio, began to use their homes to store guns. This caused the papal government to order the confiscation of all the Sforza Cesarini properties, not restored to them until Victor Emmanuel entered Rome in 1871, accompanied by Duke Francesco, Caroline's elder son, as one of his royal consiglieri. Throughout the remainder of her life Caroline was loath to accept that the papal authorities had had the slightest justification for their actions, which she preferred to characterise as petty harassment. In 1890, the English writer Frederick Rolfe ('Baron Corvo') was expelled from the Scots College in Rome, where he had been testing his vocation to the Catholic priesthood. Duchess Caroline, who had been introduced to Rolfe by one of her young relatives, Mario Sforza Cesarini dei Conti Santa Fiora, took pity on him. She invited him to spend the summer at the Palazzo Sforza Cesarini at Genzano di Roma outside the capital where, according to his biographer, \\"he gained a lasting insight into Italian history and character\\". Rolfe made friends with a group of the local Genzano ragazzi, with whom he explored the local countryside and whom he later immortalised in his folk tales Stories Toto Told Me. When he returned to England in November 1890, the Duchess initially forwarded him a monthly allowance, on the understanding that he would work steadily on his writing, but she terminated this allowance several months later, playing no further part in his life. Rolfe experts believe that, in giving him the opportunity to imbibe Italian culture over many carefree months, Caroline was an important early influence on Rolfe's writing.

II p. 437. who gained notoriety by his excesses, he was several times in serious trouble with Parliament itself, and among the accusations in a privilege case was his attitude to Magna Carta.

He produced the first substantial translation of The Iliad into English. Life He was born the son of Francis Hall who was surveyor of Calais. He was most likely born in Calais where his father's principal estates were, and where the family lived. On his father's death when he was 12 or 13, he became a ward of Sir William Cecil, and was brought up in the household with Thomas Cecil. He seems to have studied for a short time at St. John's College, Cambridge, but took no degree. Roger Ascham encouraged him in his studies, and about 1563 he began a translation of Homer into English. Subsequently, he travelled in Italy and southeastern Europe. In January 1569 he returned to England from Constantinople. On 2 April 1571 he was elected M.P. for Grantham, and on 8 May 1572 was returned again for the same constituency to the parliament which sat till 1583. Nine days after his second election the House of Commons ordered him to answer at the bar of the house a charge of having made lewd speeches both within and without the house. Witnesses were directed to meet at Westminster, and deliver their testimony to the speaker in writing. On 19 May Hall was brought by the serjeant-at-arms to the bar. He apologised for his conduct, and was discharged after the speaker had reprimanded him. In the following year he was in more serious trouble. He was playing cards in Lothbury (16 December 1573), when he quarrelled over the game with one of his companions, Melchisedech Mallory. A temporary truce was patched up, but the quarrel soon broke out with renewed violence. According to Mallory, Hall declined to fight; but on 30 June 1574 a serious affray between the disputants and their followers took place at a tavern near Fleet Bridge, and in November Edward Smalley, and other of Hall's servants, attacked and wounded Mallory in St. Paul's Churchyard. Mallory obtained a verdict in a civil action against Smalley, and Hall began a libel suit against Mallory. But while the suit was pending, and before Smalley had paid the damages, Mallory died on 18 September 1575. Mallory's executor failing to receive the damages from Smalley caused him to be arrested. As the servant of a member of parliament, he claimed immunity from arrest, and the House of Commons ordered his discharge, at the same time directing the serjeant-at-arms to rearrest him, on the ground that he was fraudulently seeking to avoid the payment of a just debt A bill was introduced, but was soon dropped, providing that Hall should pay up, and be disabled for ever from sitting in parliament. Finally, Smalley and Matthew Kirtleton were committed to the Tower of London for a month by order of the house, and thenceforward until Smalley gave security for the payment. Hall printed a long account of the quarrel with Mallory, in the form of a letter dated from London, 19 May 1576, from 'one F. A. . . .to his very friend L. B., being in Italy.' Henry Bynneman printed about a hundred copies, but Hall only distributed fourteen. Hall was severe on the action of Sir Robert Bell, the speaker, and other members of parliament. Parliament was in recess at the date of the publication, and did not resume its sittings till January 1581. In 1580 the privy council summoned Hall before it, and he apologised for the tone of his book, but still kept a few copies in circulation. On 16 January 1581 Thomas Norton, M.P., at the opening of the new session of parliament, brought the offensive work to the notice of the house. A committee was appointed to examine Hall, Bynneman, and others, but Hall's answers to the committee proved unsatisfactory, and on 14 February 1581 he was for a second time summoned to the bar of the house. He declined to comment on the subject-matter of the book, but in general terms acknowledged his error, and asked for pardon. By a unanimous vote he was committed to the Tower for six months, or until he should make a satisfactory retraction; was ordered to pay a fine to the queen of five hundred marks, and was expelled from the house for the present parliament. A new writ was issued for Grantham, and the book was condemned by a resolution of the house as a slanderous libel. The session closed on 18 March, but Hall does not appear to have been released till the dissolution of parliament, 9 April 1583. On 23 July 1582 he begged Lord Burghley to obtain permission for him to study in a foreign university. On 27 November 1585 Hall is said to have been elected for a third time M.P. for Grantham; but on 12 December notice was given to the House of Commons that he had not attended during the session. To the parliament returned in October 1586 he was not re-elected, but he brought an action against the borough of Grantham for arrears of wages due to him as member in an earlier parliament. On 2 December 1586 Hall's claim was referred to a committee of the House of Commons, and he agreed to forego the demand on 21 March 1587. Hall was in trouble again in 1588. He was in the Fleet Prison as early as June, and in October he wrote to Burghley from prison regretting that he had left Burghley's service, and that the queen was incensed against him. He intended (he said) to remove himself by habeas corpus to the King's Bench prison. He submitted to the council in November, and was thereupon released from prison. Early in 1591 he mentions, in further letters to Burghley, his quarrel with the widow Frances Radclyffe, Countess of Sussex, the injuries he sustained by his long confinement in the Tower, and the anxieties caused him by the enmity of one Richard More, who claimed his lands. In 1597 Burghley interceded with the barons of the exchequer, who pressed him for payment of ¬£400 which he owed the crown. On 28 November 1604 he pointed out, in a letter to James I, the corruptions prevalent in the elections to the newly summoned parliament, and advised an immediate dissolution. His son Cecil married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Griffin Markham. Works Hall's chief literary work was Ten Books of Homer's Iliades, translated out of French, dedicated to Sir Thomas Cecil, London, 1581. This is the first attempt to render Homer into English. Hall closely follows the French verse translation of the first ten books by Hugues Salel (Paris, 1555), but occasionally used some Latin version. Hall's copy of Salel's translation is in the British Library, with his autograph on the title-page and the date 1556 affixed. His verse is rhymed fourteeners; the work if clumsy held its own till superseded by George Chapman's translation. Notes References * Further reading *Herbert G.

Ireland c. 900 The First Viking Age in Ireland began in 795, when Vikings began carrying out hit-and- run raids on Gaelic Irish coastal settlements. Over the following decades the raiding parties became bigger and better organized; inland settlements were targeted as well as coastal ones; and the raiders built naval encampments known as longphorts to allow them to remain in Ireland throughout the winter. In the mid 9th century, Viking leader Turgeis or Thorgest founded a stronghold at Dublin, plundered Leinster and Meath, and raided other parts of Ireland. He was killed by the High King, M√°el Sechnaill mac M√°ele Ruanaid, which was followed by several Irish victories against the Vikings and the seizure of Dublin in 849. Shortly after, a new group of Vikings known as the Dubgaill (\\"dark foreigners\\") came to Ireland and clashed with the earlier Viking settlers, now called the Finngaill (\\"fair foreigners\\"). The wavering fortunes of these three groups and their shifting alliances, together with the shortcomings of contemporary records and the inaccuracy of later accounts, make this period one of the most complicated and least understood in the fledgling city's history. In 853 a Viking warlord called Amla√≠b (, possibly Olaf the White) arrived and made himself king of Dublin. He ruled along with his brothers √çmar (√çvarr, possibly Ivar the Boneless) and Auisle (√Åsl). For the next fifteen years or so, they used Dublin as their base for a series of campaigns against Irish kingdoms. During these conflicts they briefly allied themselves with several Irish kings. The Dublin Vikings also carried out a number of raids in Great Britain at this time. The deaths of Ivar (c.873) and Olaf (c.874) were followed by internecine conflict among the Vikings. Although intermittent warfare between the Vikings and the Irish continued, these inner conflicts weakened the Viking colonies and made it easier for the Irish to unite against them. In 902, Cerball mac Muirec√°in, king of Leinster, and M√°el Findia mac Flannac√°in, king of Brega, launched a two-pronged attack on Dublin and drove the Vikings from the city. However, in 914 the Vikings now known as the U√≠ √çmair (House of Ivar) would return to Ireland, marking the beginning of the Second Viking Age. Early Viking raids Rathlin Island In the year 795 Vikings (probably of Norwegian origin) raided islands off the coast of Ireland for the first time.AU 795.3: \\"The burning of Rechru by the heathens....\\" AFM 790.6 [=795]. Rechru has been variously identified with Lambay Island, off the coast of Dublin, and Rathlin Island, off the northeast coast of Ireland. See See also Brut y Tywysogion 795, which supports the identification with Lambay. The dates given in the extant versions of the Annals of Ulster for the period from the late 5th century to 1013 are antedated by one year, events in this period being dated one year before they actually took place (O'Rahilly (1946), p. 241). These dates have been silently corrected in the present article (and in the online version of the Annals of Ulster at CELT). Dates in the other annalistic sources cited in this article are often at variance with the corrected dates in the Annals of Ulster; these have not been corrected (though the correct date is given in parentheses), as they are not always due to copyists' errors but are often the dates given by the original authors. This was the beginning of a new phase of Irish history, which saw many native communities ‚Äì particularly ecclesiastical ones ‚Äì relocate themselves on the continent, or further afield in places like Iceland and the Faroe Islands, to escape the pagan marauders. For about two decades the invaders confined their activities to coastal settlements; raiding parties were generally small and there is no evidence that any of them wintered in Ireland during this early phase of \\"hit-and-run\\" activity. Typically the Vikings would arrive at a settlement without warning, plunder what goods and people they could ‚Äì the people were usually sold as slaves, though notable personages were often held for ransom ‚Äì before retreating to their Scandinavian or British bases. This period lasted from 795 until 813, after which there occurred a hiatus of eight years.The Annals of Ulster record no Viking raids for the years 814 through 820. Southern U√≠ N√©ill It is now thought that these early raids were launched directly from southwest Norway, and that during the period of calm (814‚Äì820) the Norwegian Vikings were occupied in northern Britain, laying the foundations of a new kingdom referred to in Irish sources as Laithlind (later Lochlainn).√ì Corr√°in (1998): \\"... we know from good archaeological evidence that early Viking raids on Ireland originated [in Rogaland].\\" Laithlind was once thought to be in Norway but it is now identified with Viking settlements in the British Isles, especially those in Scotland and the Isle of Man.√ì Corr√°in (1998), though this opinion is not undisputed. Lochlainn, a corruption of the supposedly Norse term Lothland, was used in later centuries to refer to Norway. In 821 the raids on Ireland were resumed with an attack on Howth, in which a large number of women were abducted.AU 821.3. But the pattern of attacks had begun to change: raiding parties became larger and better organised; inland settlements were targeted as well as the more vulnerable maritime ones; and naval encampments were established to allow the marauders to remain in Ireland throughout the winter.Such an encampment was known in Irish as a longphort and in Old Norse as a wintersetl. In a second wave the Vikings returned later as permanent settlers. It is likely that this second wave of attacks originated in Laithlind ‚Äì in northern Britain and the Scottish Isles ‚Äì rather than in Norway. The leaders of these raids, however, were probably still freebooters and adventurers, acting largely on their own behalf. An actual Kingdom of Laithlind was probably not firmly established until the 830s, after which the attacks on Ireland became more protracted and better co-ordinated.√ì Corr√°in (1998). In 833, during one such attack, a raiding party sailed up the Liffey and plundered the monastic settlement at Clondalkin.AU 833.5; CS 833; AClon 830 [=833]. Turgesius Conaille Muirthemne. For more than a dozen years in the middle of the 9th century, most of the Viking raids in Ireland appear to have been part of a co-ordinated effort to conquer the country on behalf of the King of Laithlind. If later accounts are to be believed, this campaign was initially masterminded by a warlord referred to in Irish annals as Turgesius, Turg√©is or Turges.The Old Norse form was √ûurgestr. Variant forms that are sometimes found include √ûorgest (Thorgest), √ûorgils, √ûorgisl and √ûorgerr. The Old Norse forms of personal names, attested in the 12th or 13th century, are often quite different from the original Proto-Norse forms; the names recorded in contemporary British and Irish sources have the virtue of being contemporaneous with the original Scandinavian forms. According to the medieval Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, Thorgils was a son of the first King of Norway Haraldr h√°rfagri (Harald Fairhair). However, that this son of Harald should be Turgesius is chronologically impossible, as Harald was born around 851. Turgesius‚Äôs identity remains uncertain to this day. Some commentators have identified him with the semi-legendary Danish warlord Ragnar Lodbrok.John O'Donovan (1860), pp. liii ff. and p. 124; Charles Haliday (1884), pp. 30 ff; Todd (1867), p. liii; . According to Saxo Grammaticus,Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum Book 9 Ragnar raided Ireland, killing a king called Melbricus. This has been identified with a raid on Conaille Muirthemne in 831 in which the king M√°el Brigte was abducted by Vikings.AU 831.6. Conaille Muirthemne was a dynastic sept that ruled a minor kingdom in County Louth in the overkingdom of Ulaid or Ulster. Turgesius has also been identified with a son of Gu√ûfri√û or Gudfred, the Danish king who fought against Charlemagne between 804 and 810.Montgomery (2006). It is thought unlikely, however, that he or any other Viking rulers in Ireland can be linked to native Norwegian dynasties.√ì Corr√°in (1998): \\"The kings and sons of kings mentioned in the Irish annals cannot, therefore, be linked to any Norwegian dynasty.\\" From perhaps as early as 832 until 845 Turgesius terrorised the country and plundered dozens of Christian sites. In the process he supposedly oversaw the establishment of several Norse settlements ‚Äì including one at Dublin in 841 ‚Äì and became master of the northern half of the island, known in the Irish annals as Leth Cuinn, or ‚ÄúConn's Half‚Äù. In the Saga of Harald H√•rfagre, Snorri tells us that √ûorgils ruled his newly conquered domains from Dublin, and that he was \\"a long time king over Dublin\\". In the Annals of Ulster, however, Turg√©is is only mentioned in connection with an encampment on Lough Ree in 845.AU 845.3. It is likely that his role in history was greatly exaggerated by later chroniclers and that he played no direct part in the foundation of Viking Dublin.

In 837 a fleet of sixty longships sailed up the River Liffey and raided \\"churches, forts and dwellings\\", including presumably those at Dublin.AU 837.3; CS 837; CGG 12; AClon 834 [=837]. According to the latter there were sixty-five ships in this fleet. Later in the same year, a certain Saxolb (S√∂xulfr), \\"chief of the foreigners\\", was killed in Brega by the U√≠ Colgain, a branch of the C√≠anachta Breg.AU 837.9; CS 837; CGG 21; AClon 834 [=837]. The Chronicon Scotorum and the Annals of Clonmacnoise ascribe \\"the first taking and possession of the Danes in Dublin\\" to this year. But this was only a foretaste of things to come. In 841 the Vikings returned to Dublin, this time not as raiders but as conquerors. They seized the ecclesiastical settlement at Duiblinn and established a longphort, or naval encampment, nearby; where precisely is still a matter of debate, but the present site of Dublin Castle is a likely candidate, as it overlooked the Black Pool (Duiblinn, from which the city of Dublin takes its name), which would have served as a natural harbour.AU 841.4 and 842.2; CS 841 and 842; AClon 838 [=841] and 839 [=842]. Four years later the Annals of Ulster refer also to foreigners at √Åth Cliath; this may simply be a loose reference to the settlement at Duiblinn, but it is possible that the native settlement of √Åth Cliath was also seized and a second longphort established on the Liffey ‚Äì possibly at Usher's Island.AU 845.12 These settlements were temporary wintering camps () and probably amounted to little more than pirate bases. From their new base in Dublin, the Vikings plundered many territories in Leinster and the Midlands as far as the Slieve Bloom Mountains.AU 841.4; CS 841; AClon 838 [=841]; CGG 16; Many more raids were to follow. In 845 the Vikings of Dublin plundered D√∫n Masc (Rock of Dunamase in County Laois), killing the abbot of T√≠r d√° Glas (Terryglass in County Tipperary) and other dignitaries;AU 845.2; CS 845; CGG 19; AClon 842 [=845]; AI 844.1 [=845]. other ecclesiastical settlements plundered in the same year included Kildare, Clonenagh, Kinnitty (County Offaly), Killeigh, Kells, Monasterboice, Duleek, Swords and Finglas.CGG 19. In 845 they also set up an encampment near Tullamore.AU 845.12: \\"An encampment of the foreigners of √Åth Cliath at Cluain Andobuir.\\" Cluain Andobair is the plain around Killeigh, County Offaly, about 8 km south of Tullamore. See also AClon 842 [=845]. In 845 Turgesius was captured by the King of Mide M√°el Sechnaill and drowned in Loch Uair (Lough Owel in County Westmeath).AU 845.8: According to the Annales Islandici, Ragnar Lodbrok died in 845. Whatever the true extent of Turgesius's power in the country, this stroke of good fortune proved to be a turning point in ‚ÄúThe War of the Irish with the Foreigners‚Äù (Irish: Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib) as this period of Irish history is called.Like the late Norse sagas, the 12th-century chronicle Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib is now considered to be a less than reliable account of this period of Irish history, though it does contain some intriguing details that shed light on the bare records in the annals. See, for example, √ì Corr√°in (1998) for hostile comment. Though somewhat dated, James Henthorn Todd's translation of 1867 is still an indispensable resource for this period of Irish history, thanks to Todd's 206-page introduction, numerous footnotes and detailed appendices. Several Irish victories followed. In 847 Cerball mac D√∫nlainge the King of Osraige defeated the Norsemen of Dublin and their leader Agnonn (H√°kon) at Carn Brammit.AU 847.4; AFM 845.12 [=847]. The location of Carn Brammit is unknown. The following year the Norsemen suffered a series of decisive setbacks. M√°el Sechnaill defeated them at Forrach (Farrow near Mullingar in County Westmeath).AU 848.4; CS 848. Todd (1867), p. lxviii, identifies Forrach with Farragh, which is near Skreen in County Meath, but Hogan (1910), s.v. forrach, identifies it with Farrow, a townland on the shores of Lough Iron. CGG 21 and 22 also record victories by the U√≠ N√©ill (i.e. M√°el Sechnaill) at Ardbraccan in County Meath (Geoffrey Keating understood this to be the battle in 837 in which the U√≠ Colgain killed Saxolb), at Caisglinne (location unknown, but this possibly refers to the same victory as that at Forrach), and at Rathcommair (probably near Clonard, County Meath). Tomrair (√û√≥rir), the heir-designate of the King of Laithlind, was slain in a battle with √ìlchobar mac Cin√°eda the King of Munster and Lorc√°n mac Cellaig the King of Leinster at Sciath Nechtain (near Castledermot in County Kildare).AU 848.5; AI 848.2. In the same year Tigernach mac F√≥cartai King of Loch Gabhair (Lagore, the royal seat of South Brega) inflicted a significant defeat on the Norsemen in an oakwood at D√≠sert Do-Chonna.AU 848.6; CS 848. The location of D√≠sert Do-Chonna is unknown, but St Mochonna was associated with the coast of north County Dublin, which was in Brega. These defeats culminated in an attack on Dublin itself in 849. The Viking settlement was plundered and probably destroyed ‚Äì at least temporarily ‚Äì by M√°el Sechnaill, who was now High King of Ireland, and Tigernach mac F√≥cartai.CS 849; AFM 847.16 [=849]. A fleet of 140 longships arrived in Dublin in the same year. The expedition was led by \\"adherents of the king of the foreigners\\" and their objective was \\"to exact obedience from the foreigners who were in Ireland before them\\". It was also recorded that \\"afterwards they caused confusion in the whole country\\".AU 849.6; CS 849; AFM 847.17 [=849]; CGG 17 and 19. It is possible that this fleet was sent by the King of Laithlind in an attempt to regain lost ground ‚Äì or was he perhaps hoping to profit from the discomfiture of rival Scandinavians? The following year, we are told, the Norsemen formed an alliance with Cin√°ed mac Conaing, the King of Cianachta North Brega, and plundered the territories of M√°el Sechnaill and Tigernach and destroyed Tigernach's crann√≥g in Lagore.AU 850.3; CS 850; AFM 848.10 [=850]: The nearby oratory of Trevet was burned \\"with seventy people in it\\" during the attack on Lagore. Cin√°ed was drowned by M√°el Sechnaill and Tigernach the following year. If this attack was in retaliation for the sacking of Dublin the previous year, it suggests that the fleet of 849 was indeed sent by the King of Laithlind. Dubgaill and Findgaill : In 851 a significant development took place: \\"The Dubgenti came to √Åth Cliath, made a great slaughter of the Findgaill, and plundered the naval encampment, both people and property.\\"AU 851.3; CS 851; CGG 20. It is believed that this refers to the first appearance in Ireland of a new faction of Vikings. Called the Dubgaill or Dubgenti (\\"Dark Foreigners\\" or \\"Dark Gentiles\\"),Dictionary of the Irish Language : dub; Gall; genti. these were possibly Scandinavians of Danish or Anglo-Danish origin who hoped to take advantage of the shifting fortunes of the town's inhabitants, known as the Findgaill or Findgenti (\\"Fair Foreigners\\" or \\"Fair Gentiles\\"),Dictionary of the Irish Language : finn. who were possibly Scandinavians of Norwegian origin ‚Äì though there is still no consensus among historians as to the meaning of these terms.See √ì Corr√°in (1998), Dumville (2005) and Downham (2007) for divergent views. 17th-century historians (e.g. the Four Masters and Geoffrey Keating) were generally of the view that the Dubgaill were Danes and the Findgaill Norwegians. Whatever their provenance, the Dubgaill defeated the Norsemen of Dublin and destroyed their settlement; in the same year they raided the longphort at Lind D√∫achaill (Linns, near Annagassan in County Louth) and slaughtered the Findgaill.AU 851.3; CS 851; AFM 849.9 [=851] and 849.10 [=851]. In the Annals of Ulster the wording of the relevant entry makes the outcome of the raid on Lind Duachaill uncertain, but in other sources the Dubgaill are clearly the victors of both encounters. The following year the Dubgaill inflicted another significant defeat on the Findgaill at Sn√°m Aignech (Carlingford Lough). The leaders of the Findgaill in this encounter are called Stain (or Zain) and Iercne (or Iargna). In the Fragmentary Annals Zain and Iargna are co-regents (leithr√≠). Iercne () died in the battle; his sons are mentioned in connection with Dublin in 883 and 886. The leader of the Dubgaill is called Horm (?Ormr), who was slain in 856 by Rhodri the Great the King of Gwynedd.AU 852.3; AFM 850.16 [=852]; CS 852; CGG 20; FAI 235. According to the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, the Dubgaill were initially defeated in this encounter, before rallying and overcoming the Findgaill, whose fleet numbered 160 ships. The battle lasted \\"three days and three nights\\" according to the Chronicon Scotorum. Later that year the Norsemen suffered two defeats in the same month at the hands of the Cianachta Breg: one at Inch near Balrothery in County Dublin, and one at R√°ith Aldain (Raholland, County Meath).AU 852.8; CGG 22. The territory of the Cianachta Breg extended north from the Liffey to the baronies of Upper and Lower Duleek in County Meath. A year later, in 853, a Viking warlord called Amla√≠b () came to Dublin and made himself king ‚Äì the first in the fledgling city's history ‚Äì receiving hostages from the Vikings and tribute from the Irish.AU 853.2; CS 853; AFM 851.15 [=853]; CGG 23. See also the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland FAI 239: \\"Also in this year, i.e. the sixth year of the reign of M√°el Sechlainn [851, though the previous entry records an event which is dated in the corrected Annals of Ulster in 849], Amla√≠b Conung, son of the king of Lochlann, came to Ireland, and he brought with him a proclamation of many tributes and taxes from his father, and he departed suddenly. Then his younger brother √çmar came after him to levy the same tribute.\\". In the same annals, FAI 259 seems to duplicate this entry under the year 853: \\"Amlaib, son of the king of Lochlann, came to Ireland, and the foreigners of Ireland gave him hostages.\\" Did Amla√≠b levy tribute in 851 before settling in Dublin in 853? Amla√≠b is described in the Annals of Ulster as \\"the son of the King of Laithlind\\"; it would appear, then, that he was the leader of the Findgaill, sent by his father Gu√ûfri√ûFAI 401 identifies his father as Gothfraidh mac Ragnaill. to do battle with the Dubgaill.√ì Corr√°in (1998), p. 24. Dumville (2005) and Downham (2007), however, believe that Amla√≠b and his kinsmen belonged to the Dubgaill, who supplanted the Findgaill around this time. Amla√≠b has been identified with two individuals who appear in Old Norse sources, but whose historicity and provenance are uncertain: √ìl√°fr inn hv√≠ti (Olaf the White) and √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson (Olaf the Son of Gu√∞r√∏√∞r). √ìl√°fr inn hv√≠ti was the son of Ingjald Helgasson and a descendant of both H√°lfdan hv√≠tbeinn (Halfdan Whitelegs) of Vestfold in Norway and Ragnar Lodbrok.L√°ndn√°mab√≥k, Chapter 15. √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arsson was the son of Gudr√∏d the Hunter.Ynglinga Saga, Chapter 53. Like so many other Scandinavian characters in this period of Irish history, Amla√≠b's precise identity is still uncertain, though he is probably the same person as Amhlaoibh Conung (√ìl√°fr konungr, or Olaf the King), who is mentioned in the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland.FAI 239. According to the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, M√°el Sechnaill tried to come to terms with this dangerous new rival in 854, but without success.FAI 243. Having made himself undisputed leader of the Norsemen in Dublin ‚Äì whether Findgaill or Dubgaill ‚Äì Amla√≠b departed for Britain, where he was involved in numerous military campaigns. When Amla√≠b returned to Dublin in 856 or 857,FAI 259; AU 857.1. he was accompanied by two of his brothers, √çmar () and Auisle ().FAI 239; FAI 347. Cf. AU 863.4, though the identification of the three kings as Amla√≠b, √çmar and Auisle is probably a late interpolation. The Old Norse form of Auisle has yet not been determined; in addition to √Åsl, Au√∞g√≠sl, O√≠sle, H√°sli and Eywysl have been suggested; the Old English Eowils is probably the same name. √çmar has been identified with Ivar the Boneless (), a semi-legendary character who appears in the Old Norse sagas. According to Norse tradition, √çvarr was a son of the semi-legendary Danish warlord Ragnar Lo√∞brok.Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr. The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland provide an alternative genealogy, but one which dates from the 11th century ‚Äì and therefore equally suspect.FAI 401: \\"Iomhar son of Gothfraid son of Ragnall son of Gothfraid Conung son of Gofraid.\\" Gothfraid Conung, or King Gu√ûfri√û, could refer to the Danish king Gudfred, who fought against Charlemagne between 804 and 810, though his father was called Sigfred. It was very unusual for Norse leaders of this date to name one of their sons after themselves; perhaps the Fragmentary Annals' \\"m. Gothfraid Conung m. Gothfraid\\" is a corruption of \\"m. Gothfraid Conung i. Gothfraid an R√≠\\" (\\"son of Gothfraid Conung, i.e. Gothfraid the King\\"). See √ì Corr√°in (1998) and Downham (2007) for hostile comment. According to another entry in the Fragmentary Annals, √çmar and Auisle were Amla√≠b's brothers, all three being sons of Gofraid mac Ragnaill the King of Laithlind.FAI 239, FAI 347. Other sources refer also to an Albdann (H√°lfdan), who has been identified with the semi-legendary brother of Ivar the Boneless H√°lfdan Ragnarsson of Norse folklore. (Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr). Under the year 878, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (A) refers to an unnamed \\"brother of Inw√¶re and Halfdene\\"; this is the only evidence from contemporary (or nearly contemporary) sources that H√°lfdan was a brother of Amla√≠b, √çmar and Auisle ‚Äì but only if the identification of Inw√¶re and √çmar is correct. Dumville (2005) believes √çmar, Auisle and Albdann were brothers, while Amla√≠b was \\"probably a kinsman\\". Montgomery (2006) makes H√°lfdan an uncle of Amla√≠b and √çmar; this may be supported by Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib (Chapter 25), which refers to H√°lfdan as \\"Ragnall's son\\", Ragnall being the alleged name of Amla√≠b and √çmar's grandfather (FAI 401). But Ragnall may simply be an Irish form of Ragnar, meaning Ragnar Lodbrok. Montgomery identifies Ragnall with Turgesius. √çmar became Amla√≠b's co-regent in Dublin around 857. Auisle was co-regent from about 863 until his death in 867. Campaigns in Ireland Ailech, the royal seat of the Northern Ui N√©ill. Whatever their provenance, both the Findgaill and the Dubgaill were politically and militarily active throughout the islands of Britain and Ireland for the remainder of the 9th century. For the next fifteen years or so, Amla√≠b and √çmar used Dublin as their base of operations for a series of campaigns, which may have involved Vikings from both factions. To avoid the inconvenience of having to wage wars on several fronts, they formed alliances with several Irish leaders. Amla√≠b may have married daughters of √Åed Findliath King of Ailech,Ailech or Elagh was the royal seat of the kings of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. of Cin√°ed mac Conaing the King of Brega, and of Cerball mac D√∫nlainge the King of Osraige.Cin√°ed mac Conaing was drowned in the River Nanny in 851 by M√°el Sechnaill I for allying himself with the Norsemen the previous year and plundering the territories of the Southern U√≠ N√©ill (AFM 849.8 [=851]). It is possible that the Cin√°ed who was Amla√≠b's father-in-law was Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n King of Scotland. At least one daughter, Helgi, is said to have been born to Amla√≠b by one of his Gaelic wives. See FAI 357; FAI 292; Alfred P. Smyth, New History of Scotland. They also forged an alliance with the King of Osraige Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, who was one of the most powerful and ambitious men in the country. In 856 a major conflict arose between the Norsemen and M√°el Sechnaill, who was then allied to mercenaries of mixed Gaelic and Scandinavian background known as the Gallgo√≠dil.AU 856.3; CS 856. In that year two important ecclesiastical settlements in Brega ‚Äî Slane and Lusk ‚Äî were sacked.AU 856.3, 856.8; CS 856; AFM 854.2 [=856], 854.9 [=856]. The perpetrators of these attacks are not named, but the Norsemen of Dublin were probably behind both of them.Downham (2007), pp. 17‚Äì18. The south- west of Ireland c. 900. In 857 the conflict shifted to Munster, where Amla√≠b and √çmar defeated Caittil Find and the Gallgo√≠dil.AU 857.1; CS 857; CGG 23. The following year √çmar and Cerball mac D√∫nlainge defeated the Cen√©l Fiachach and the Gallgo√≠dil at Ara T√≠re.CS 858. Ara T√≠re is near Nenagh in County Tipperary, Munster. The Cen√©l Fiachach, however, were subjects of M√°el Sechnaill. In 859 Amla√≠b, √çmar and Cerball jointly attacked M√°el Sechnaill and the Gallgo√≠dil in Mide.AU 859.2. In the same year, however, at the royal Synod of R√°ith Aeda Meic Bric (Rahugh, County Westmeath, in the territory of the Cen√©l Fiachach), a temporary peace was made between the contending parties. Cerball submitted to the High King and his kingdom of Osraige was transferred from Munster to Leth Cuinn, placing it under M√°el Sechnaill's authority; this transfer of sovereignty was sanctioned by the king of Munster M√°el Gualae mac Donngaile.AU 859.3; CS 859. Later that year, however, M√°el Gualae fell into the hands of the Dublin Norsemen, who killed him in a pagan sacrifice.AU 859.3 and Haliday (1884), p. 126; CGG 23 seems to imply that M√°el Gualae's men were ultimately victorious against the invaders, despite the loss of their king. Thus ended ‚Äì for a time, at least ‚Äì the alliance between Cerball mac D√∫nlainge and the Norsemen. The following two years were marked by the fluctuating fortunes of both natives and invaders; alliances between the two were fluid and the conflict was relentless. Cerball mac D√∫nlainge joined forces with his new overking M√°el Sechnaill, while Amla√≠b and √çmar aligned themselves with one of M√°el Sechnaill's enemies, √Åed Findliath of Ailech. In 860 M√°el Sechnaill and Cerball took up arms against √Åed Findliath and another of the High King's principal enemies, Flann mac Conaing of Brega, defeating them (though not decisively) at Moy near Armagh.AU 860.1; AFM 858.4 [=860]; CS 860; FAI 279. According to the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, Amla√≠b was among the defeated, being now married to √Åed's daughter. In 861 √Åed and the Norsemen of Dublin jointly plundered M√°el Sechnaill's territories in Mide,AU 861.1; CS 861; AFM 859.4 [=861]. but M√°el Sechnaill defeated them at Drumomuy near the River Feegile on the border between County Offaly and County Kildare.CS 861; AFM 859.3 [=861]. See here for the location of Drumomuy. In 862 √Åed, Flann and the Norsemen of Dublin once again invaded Mide, but M√°el Sechnaill's death in November of that year effectively brought the campaign to an end. √Åed Findliath succeeded him as High King.AU 862.2; AU 862.3; CS 862; AFM 860.9 [=862]. After M√°el Sechnaill's death his kingdom of Mide was divided among two claimants to the throne, Lorc√°n mac Cathail and Conchobar mac Donnchada.AU 864.2. The succession of √Åed led to another series of alliances between natives and invaders. The Norsemen of Dublin now allied themselves with Lorc√°n mac Cathail, one of the rival kings of Mide. In 863 Lorc√°n, Amla√≠b, √çmar and Auisle invaded Flann mac Conaing's kingdom of Brega, during which invasion they plundered the megalithic tombs in the Boyne Valley, an unprecedented act of sacrilege.AU 863.4. CGG 23 attributes the overthrow of the D√©isi Breg (of Upper and Lower Deece) at Cluain Daim (location unknown) to Amla√≠b, which may have occurred during this campaign. Flann mac Conaing had been an ally of the Norsemen the previous year. 863 also saw the death of Muirec√°n mac Diarmata, the King of Leinster, at the hands of the Norsemen; so Amla√≠b and his allies must also have campaigned south of the Liffey.AU 863.3; AFM 861.5 [=863]; CS 863; FAI 311. Muirec√°n is described as King of N√°s and Airther Life. N√°s na R√≠ogh (Naas in County Kildare) was the royal seat of the U√≠ F√°el√°in, an important branch of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge confederation which monopolised the kingship of Leinster in this period; Airther Life was the eastern part of the plain of the River Liffey. This may reflect the fact Muirec√°n's sovereignty did not extend beyond his family's territory, despite the fact that he was nominally the King of Leinster. The following year, however, everything had changed again. Lorc√°n was blinded by √Åed Findliath, and Amla√≠b drowned his co- regent Conchobar mac Donnachada at Clonard, an important ecclesiastical site in Mide.AU 864.1; AU 864.2; AFM 862.8 [=864] and 862.9 [=864]; CS 864; CGG 23; AClon 862 [=864]; Haliday (1884), p. 126. Campaigns in Britain Moy and Armagh. In 866 the Norsemen of Dublin turned their attention to Britain. Amla√≠b and Auisle plundered the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu in Scotland in that year, returning to Dublin with many hostages.AU 866.1. The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and AClon place this invasion in the year 864. The following year the brothers are reported to have quarrelled over one of Amla√≠b's wives and Auisle was killed.AU 867.6; FAI 347; AClon 865 [=867]. In CGG two accounts of Auisle's death are given: in CGG 24 \\"Ossill\\" dies in battle in Munster; in CGG 29 \\"Ossil\\" is murdered by his brother Amla√≠b. It has been claimed that from 865 to 869 √çmar and a kinsman H√°lfdan accompanied the Great Heathen Army which ravaged the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Britain around this time. The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle refer to the leaders of this army as Ingware and Ubba.ASC(F) 870. Ingware has been identified with √çmar, though Ubba's identity is unknown.According to the late 9th-century Welsh historian Asser, Ingware, Halfdene and Ubba were sons of Ragnar Lodbrok ‚Äî Life of King Alfred 878. The 10th-century historian √Üthelweard noted that the fleet of the Great Heathen Army arrived \\"from the north\\" in 865 and wintered in East Anglia.√Üthelweard, p. 25; ASC(A) 866 [=late 865]. An early no-longer-extant copy of the ASC was √Üthelweard's principal source. This suggests that the invasion was launched from Laithlind, though the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle refers to the invaders as Danes, and they are often linked to a band of Vikings who pillaged northern France between 845 and 865.The Chronicle does not distinguish between Norwegian and Danish Vikings, referring to all of them as heathen men, Northmen or Danes. The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (FAI330) refer to the Great Heathen Army as \\"Aunites (that is, the Danes)\\", but explicitly connects the invasion with domestic troubles in Laithlind. Ingware's army is reported to have crossed the Humber the following year and captured York, the capital of Northumbria. In 867 Mercia was invaded but no major engagement took place, as the Mercians sued for peace.This was the year Auisle was murdered by his kinsmen in Ireland. The relevant entries in the Annals of Ulster (AU 867.6) and the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (FAI 347) seem to implicate √çmar in the murder, which suggests that he was in Ireland at the time, and could not therefore be the same man as Ingware, who was campaigning in England throughout 867. In late 869 the Great Heathen Army wintered in Thetford, East Anglia. In November they defeated Edmund the King of East Anglia and seized his kingdom.ASC(A) 870 [=late 869]. At this time the army was led by Ingware and Ubba, but the following year the army's two heathen kings are called Bachsecg and Halfdene (Halfdan Ragnarsson).ASC(A) 871, 872. In 870 √çmar was campaigning with his brother Amla√≠b in Scotland,AU 870.6. so it appears that his kinsman H√°lfdan took his place as one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army in England. According to Aethelweard's Chronicon Igwares (Ingware) died in 870 ‚Äì a detail which must be accounted for by those historians who believe that √çmar and Iguuar were one and the same individual.√Üthelweard, p. 26. Charles Haliday (1884), p. 40, believed that the discrepancy of three years between the death of Igwares and √çmar (AU 873.3) was insignificant, and he actually cited the early deaths of the two men as \\"strong evidence\\" that they were one and the same individual. Curiously, however, Haliday did not identify √Üthelweard's Igwares with the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's Ingware, whom he believed was an illegitimate brother of Igwares. Halfdene continued the conquest of northern England with the assistance of the Great Summer Army, which arrived in 871. Repton was taken in 873, which led to the fall of eastern Mercia. In the winter of 874 he settled on the Tyne in Northumbria, from which numerous attacks on the Picts and Strathclyde were launched.ASC(A) 875. In 875 or 876 Halfdene divided Northumbria in two: the northern kingdom of Bernicia remained a puppet state ruled by Angles, while the southern kingdom of Deira or J√≥rv√≠k was ruled directly by the Danes. Halfdene then disappears from the Chronicle. In 875 Albdann (H√°lfdan) is reported to have \\"deceitfully killed\\" Amla√≠b's son Oist√≠n (Eysteinn) and taken Dublin.AU 875.4; CGG 25. It may be possible, then, to synchronise the activities of Ingware and Halfdene in England as recorded in the English annals with the activities of √çmar and Albann in Ireland and Laithlind as recorded in the Irish annals; nevertheless, some discrepancies remain, and this has led a number of modern historians to reject the identity of Ingware and √çmar (though not necessarily that of Halfdene and Albdann).See Ivar the Boneless and its Talk Page for further discussion. In 870 Amla√≠b and √çmar besieged Ail Cluaithe, or Dumbarton, the capital of Strathclyde; they captured the stronghold following a four-month siege, and returned to Dublin in 871 with a great deal of plunder.CS 871. Later that year they stormed the fortress of D√∫n Sobairche or Dunseverick in County Antrim with the assistance of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain, whose leader was the High King √Åed Findliath.AU 871.3. The taking of Dunseverick is recorded after Amla√≠b and √çmar's return to Dublin, but they may have besieged the fortress on their way home from Scotland. The death of the King of Leinster Ailill mac D√∫nlainge in this year (AU 871.4; CS 871) has also been ascribed to Amla√≠b and √çmar. Before the end of 871, Amla√≠b returned to Scotland to suppress a Norse uprising against his father Gofraid mac Ragnaill.FAI 400. During this time (871‚Äì872), √çmar and Amla√≠b's son Oist√≠n (Eysteinn) plundered Ireland \\"from east to west and from north to south\\".FAI 401. By 878 the Findgaill and Dubgaill were dominant in many parts of Britain, controlling territories in Scotland, Strathclyde, Northumbria, East Anglia, Wales and Mercia. Their expansion was eventually halted by Alfred the Great of Wessex, whose victory in the Battle of Edington in May 878 paved the way for the creation of the kingdom of England.In 878 a \\"brother of Inw√¶re and Healfdene\\" landed in Devonshire in Wessex, but he was slain in the ensuing battle (ASC(A) 878). Amla√≠b, √çmar, Auisle and Albdann were all dead by 878. Domestic troubles In 866, when Amla√≠b and Auisle were invading Fortriu, Flann mac Conaing King of Brega took advantage of their absence to exact revenge for their invasion of 863, inflicting a significant defeat on the Norsemen.FAI 326. In the same year Cenn√©tig mac Ga√≠th√©ne, king of Lo√≠gis, defeated the Norsemen at Mindroichet (Mondrehid in County Laois).AFM 864.8 [=866]; FAI 329; AClon 865 [=866]. In 867 a force led by Cenn√©tig and M√°el Ciar√°in mac R√≥n√°in burned Amla√≠b's fortress at Clondalkin, near Dublin, and killed 100 of his followers.AU 867.8; AFM 865.12 [=867]; FAI 349; AClon 865 [=867]. See also AClon 897, which seems to be a duplicate entry. M√°el Ciar√°in mac R√≥n√°in was a champion of the Leinster nobility, though he was originally of the Ciarraige Luachra of West Munster. They followed this up with a successful attack on Dublin itself in the same year, in which Odolb Micle was killed. This shadowy figured may have been Amla√≠b and √çmar's regent.FAI 362; AFM 865.15 [=867]. Undeterred by this setback, Amla√≠b plundered the monastery of Lis M√≥r in Munster (Lismore, County Waterford) before the end of the year.AI 867.1; CGG 29, which has been misplaced. According to one interpretation of Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, it was on this occasion that Auisle lost his life.CGG 24. According to Chapter 29, Foenteran mac Drognean, chieftain of the Fir Maige F√©ne (of Fermoy), is said to have burned Amla√≠b's camp on the same night that Lismore was attacked, and Amla√≠b afterwards murdered Auisle. Both events ‚Äì the burning of the camp and the murder of Auisle ‚Äì are attributed to the intercession of St Mochuda, the patron of Lismore. In 869 M√°el Ciar√°in mac R√≥n√°in came to a grisly end. Having been expelled from Leinster by jealous rivals, he allied himself by marriage to the High King √Åed Findliath and invaded Leinster. He was defeated, however; his body was hacked to pieces and his head cut off. Subsequently his head was given to the Norsemen of Dublin, who used it for target-practice before casting it into the sea.FAI 377. In the same year, Amla√≠b plundered the great monastic settlement of Armagh.AU 869.6; CS 869; AClon 867 [=869]. This raid was possibly launched in retaliation for the death of his son Carlus, who had lost his life the previous year fighting for the kings of Leinster and Brega against √Åed Findliath (the protector of Armagh) in the Battle of Cella Ua nDaigri (Killineer, County Louth).AU 868.4; CS 868; FAI 366. AFM 866.9 [=868]; AB 255; AClon 866 [=868]; AI 868. CGG 29 records that 500 Findgenti fell in this battle, which would seem to imply that the ruling dynasty of Dublin ‚Äì to which Carlus belonged ‚Äì were Findgenti. We are not told when precisely the alliance between Amla√≠b and √Åed Findliath (established around 860) fell apart; possibly it happened when √Åed became High King in 862. In 870, while Amla√≠b and √çmar were besieging Dumbarton, √Åed Findliath laid waste Leinster \\"from Dublin to Gowran\\", though it is not clear whether Dublin itself was attacked during this campaign.AU 870.2; AClon 868 [=870]. Dublin and Gowran were on the borders of Leinster, so the expression may mean \\"the whole of Leinster\\". In the same year, a leader of the Dubgaill called √ölfr invaded eastern Ireland and killed M√°el Sechnaill mac N√©ill, one of the two kings of South Brega .AU 870.7; CS 870; AClon 868 [=870]. In 872, we are told by the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, \\"the kings of the foreigners\\" massacred the men of the Three Plains and the Three Comanns in Counties Laois, Kildare and Carlow.FAI 407: \\"A massacre of Fir na Tr√≠ Maige and the Tr√≠ Comainn as far as Slieve Bloom by the kings of the Foreigners, in the snow on the feast of Brigit [1 February].\\" AFM 870.10 [=872]. The Men of the Three Plains were the U√≠ Ellaig or U√≠ Cellaig, a branch of the U√≠ Bairrche Maige hAilbe of Counties Laois, Carlow and Kildare. The Three Comanns were the U√≠ Buide, U√≠ Crimthainn √Åin and the U√≠ Faircheall√°in of Counties Laois and Kildare. If these kings were Amla√≠b and √çmar, this must have been their last raid on Irish soil, for within a year √çmar was dead.The order in which the three locations are named in FAI 407 and AFM 870.10 [=872] ‚Äî from south to north ‚Äì suggests that the raiders came from Waterford, though kings of Waterford are not recorded until the 10th century. It is possible that Amla√≠b and √çmar sailed around the coast from Dublin to Waterford and then sailed up the River Barrow. √çmar's death is recorded in the Annals of Ulster and the Chronicon Scotorum under the year 873.AU 873.3; CS 873. The description of √çmar as \\"king of the Norsemen of all Ireland and Britain\\" supports the identification of √çmar with Ingware, though the term Britanniae may have excluded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, where Ingware campaigned. In the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, under the same year, it is reported that \\"the king of Lochlainn\\" died of a \\"sudden horrible disease\\".FAI 409: \\"√âg righ Lochlann, .i. Gothfraid, do tedhmaimm gr√°na opond. Sic quod Domino placuit.\\" (\\"The king of Lochlainn died, i.e. Gothfraid, of a sudden horrible disease. Thus it pleased God.\\") The identification of righ Lochlann (\\"the king of Lochlainn\\") as Gothfraid (i.e. √çmar's alleged father) was probably added by Duald MacFirbis or his anonymous secretary, who made the only extant copy of these annals in the 17th century. In the original 11th- century manuscript the subject of the entry was simply called righ Lochlann, so this entry probably records the death of √çmar, whose death is not otherwise noted in the Fragmentary Annals, rather than that of his father. John O'Donovan, who edited and translated the Fragmentary Annals (p. 198) in 1860, took this entry to refer to √çmar, as did James Henthorn Todd in his translation of Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib (p. 270). Earlier in the Fragmentary Annals, √çmar and Amla√≠b are called na righ Lochlann, or \\"the kings of Lochlainn\\" (FAI 388). See √ì Corr√°in (1998), pp. 36 ff. for further discussion. This cause of death is not mentioned in any other source, but it raises the interesting possibility that it was the crippling effects of this unidentified disease that led to √çmar's Old Norse sobriquet √çvarr inn beinlausi, or Ivar the Boneless.The Norse sources understood \\"boneless\\" to mean that Ivar was impotent, had no legs, or that his limbs were so enfeebled he had to be carried about on a shield. According to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, Amla√≠b died around 874‚Äì875 in Dollar during a protracted campaign against Constantine I of Scotland. (The interpretation and translation of this passage are still matters of scholarly debate.) According to the Icelandic Landn√°mab√≥k, Chapter 15, Olaf the White \\"fell in battle in Ireland\\". These deaths ushered in three decades of uncertainty for the Norse settlements in Ireland. Internecine conflict between the different factions weakened the colonies and made it easier for the Irish to unite against them. During this period most of the Norse colonies at Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick fell under the sway of native rulers, as the former allies of the Norsemen turned against them. It has even been claimed that Cerball mac D√∫nlainge assumed the kingship of Dublin around this time (possibly with the consent of its Norse inhabitants),The Icelandic Landn√°mab√≥k , Chapter 1, and the Annales Islandici (AD 875) make Kiarval [Cerball] King of Dublin in the late 9th century. See Todd (1867), pp. lxxx ff. but there is nothing in the Irish sources to support this. Epigoni The Scandinavian dynasty of Dublin. In Dublin Amla√≠b was succeeded by one of his sons, Oistin (Eysteinn); but Albdann (H√°lfdan), the leader of the Dubgenti and conqueror of Northumbria, also claimed the throne. In 875 H√°lfdan invaded the settlement and killed Eysteinn,According to Saxo Grammaticus's Gesta Danorum, Book 9, Dublin was once besieged by two Danish princes, Canute (Knut Danaast) and Harald, sons of Gorm the Old; Canute was surprised by the King of Dublin and killed by one of the king's archers. According to the Annales Islandici, this event took place in 875, the year H√°lfdan took Dublin from Eysteinn (though Kiarvalus [Cerball mac D√∫nlainge] is named as the King of Dublin in 875). It is difficult, however, to align the chronologies of the various sources. Gorm's son Harald is usually identified with Harald Bluetooth, the first Christian King of Denmark, who died around 985, more than a century after this siege of Dublin. Haliday (1884), p. 67, identifies this siege with a later one that took place in 927. but the High King √Åed Findliath intervened and expelled him from the city,CGG 25; √Åed surprised H√°lfdan during a banquet in his honour. replacing him with √çmar's son Barith (),CS 881. who was the foster-father of √Åed's son.FAI 408: \\"In this year, i.e. in the eleventh year of √Åed's reign, Barith came (now he was the foster-father of the king's son) and ‚Ä¶\\" But see , who identifies Oist√≠n as Barith's foster-son. It seems, however, that fosterage was another method used by the Norsemen to forge alliances with native rulers. This was the last serious conflict in the War of the Irish with the Foreigners for a generation. Later chroniclers record that Ireland enjoyed a \\"Forty Years' Rest\\" from foreign invaders between 876 and 916.CGG 26. The existence of any such \\"Rest\\" has been disputed. H√°lfdan was slain in a battle with the Findgaill in Loch Cuan (Strangford Lough) in 877.AU 877.5; CS 877; CGG 25. In the relevant entry in the Annals of Ulster he is described as the leader of the Dubgenti;The name H√°lfdan means \\"half-Danish\\", which may or may not be significant. In Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib Barith is named as the leader of the Findgenti; this would seem to support the theory that H√°lfdan's brother Ingware was not the same man as √çmar the Norse king of Dublin, the former being of the Dubgenti and the latter of the Findgenti.CGG 25: \\"A battle was fought between themselves, viz., between the Fair Gentiles and the Black Gentiles, that is to say, between Barith and Ragnall's son [H√°lfdan], in which fell Ragnall's son and many with him.\\" (Ragnall probably refers to Ragnar Lodbrok, H√°lfdan's alleged father.) According to one recension of CGG, Barith received an injury in this battle which left him lame for the remainder of his life. thumb Barith had been active in Ireland while Amla√≠b was still on the throne; he may have participated in Amla√≠b's raid on Lismore in 867;CGG 24. CGG 27 also refers to a son of √çmar burning Lismore, but this probably refers to Sichfrith Ivarsson, who sacked the monastery in 883. also in 867 he narrowly avoided assassination during a raid in Connacht in which a kinsman H√°imar was killed,FAI 350. See also CGG 25, which may be a reference to the same expedition: \\"The same party [Barith and Oist√≠n], two years before, had ravaged Mide and Connacht, until they came to Corcomroe and Loop Head. These were all killed by the men of Ireland.\\" and in 873 he and Oist√≠n had invaded Munster with a fleet of ships.AI 873.3: \\"B√°rid with a great fleet from √Åth Cliath [went] by sea westwards, and he plundered Ciarraige Luachra under ground, i.e. the raiding of the caves.\\" CS 873: \\"Mumu [Munster] was attacked by the foreigners of √Åth Cliath.\\" CGG 25, which records the plundering of Emly and the Decies of Waterford in this campaign. Six years later Vikings plundered Armagh and held the abbot and the lector hostage; Barith may have been behind this raid. Finally, in 881, he sacked the oratory of St Cian√°n at Damhliag in Brega (Duleek in Meath).AU 881.3; CS 881. It is possible that Barith was also Lord or King of Limerick.AFM 922.9 [=924]; CS 924. In both entries it is unclear whether Barith or his son Colla is being referred to as Lord or King of Limerick. What's more, it is possible that this Barith was not the son of √çmar but another Barith who is called \\"B√°rid mac Oitir\\" at AU 913. Intermittent warfare between the Norsemen of Dublin and their Irish neighbours continued despite the forty years' rest. Barith died in 881 shortly after sacking the oratory of St Cian√°n;AU 881.3. CGG 24 says that \\"Baethbarr\\" was drowned at Dublin, attributing his death to the miraculous intercession of St Ciar√°n rather than St Cian√°n. CGG speaks of a Baethbarr, a Baraid and a Barith, but parallels with the Annals of Ulster suggest that they are all references to the same individual. he was succeeded by an unnamed son of Auisle, who is referred to in the annals as Mac Auisle. In 883 Mac Auisle was killed by Otir (Ott√°r) the son of Iercne (i.e. J√°rnkn√©, who had been killed by the Dubgaill at Carlingford Lough in 852) and Muirgel the daughter of M√°el Sechnaill I.AU 883.4; CS 883. The motive for this killing is unknown, but it suggests that there was an alliance by marriage between M√°el Sechnaill and J√°rnkn√©. Mac Auisle was succeeded in turn by another son of √çmar, Sichfrith Ivarsson (883‚Äì888),The Old Norse form of his name has not been determined; it may have been Sigfr√∏dr or Sigur√∞r. who burned the monasteries of Lismore and Cloyne in the first year of his reign.AI 883.1; CGG 27. He may also have been responsible for an attack on the ecclesiastical settlement of Kildare in 885 or 886 in which the vice-abbot Suibne mac Duib d√° Boirennn was taken captive with 280 others.AClon 870 [=885]; AU 885.10; CS 886; AFM 883.11 [=885]. The Annals of Ulster records \\"Dunetathe do denum i Cill Daro\\", which has been translated at CELT as \\"Secret murder was committed in Cell Dara\\". The same entry is translated into Latin as Depraedatio facta in Kildaria (\\"Plunder committed in Kildare\\") in Volume 4 of Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres. During Sichfrith's reign there was further civil unrest in the colony, caused by another son of J√°rnkn√© called Eol√≥ir.The Old Norse form of this name has not been determined. It may have been Halld√≥r or Hel√∏ri. In 886 Eol√≥ir killed Airem√≥n mac √Åedo, one of the two kings of Ulster.AU 886.1; CS 886. Eol√≥ir appears to have been a claimant to the throne of Dublin around this time.CS 891 refers to an Eolair son of Barith, so there may be some confusion between two rival of the same name. A son of Barith would certainly have some claim to the throne his father held. In 888 Sichfrith routed the forces of the High King Flann Sinna (a son of M√°el Sechnaill).CS 888: \\"The foreigners of Duiblinn inflicted a battle rout on Flann son of Mael Sechnaill and there fell there Aed son of Conchobor, King of Connacht, and Lergus son of Cruinn√©n Bishop of Cell Dara [Kildare], and Donnchad son of Mael D√∫in, superior of Cell Delca Kildalkey, and many others.\\" AClon 888; CGG 27, which has been misplaced. It has been suggested that the death in 888 of Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, who may have been the true overlord of Dublin at this time, acted as a catalyst for Flann Sinna's attempt to conquer the city.Todd (1867), p. lxxxi, though the Annals of Ulster record the attack on Dublin before Cerball's death. Flann Sinna's mother Lann was a sister of Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, while Amla√≠b's son Oist√≠n (Eysteinn) is said to have been married to a granddaughter of Cerball mac D√∫nlainge. thumb In 888 Sichfrith Ivarsson was assassinated by his brother Sitric I, who held the throne for five years (888‚Äì893).AU 888.9: \\"Sichfrith m. Imair, rex Nordmannorum, a fratre suo per dolum occisus est\\"; CS 888; CGG 27, which calls Sichfrith \\"Sitriuc\\"; AClon 888, which calls Sichfrith \\"Juffrie [Jeffrey] mac Iwer\\". Todd (1867) identifies this Sitric with the \\"Lord of the foreigners of Limerick\\" mentioned by the Four Masters (AFM 938.13), though it is possible that the Lord of Limerick was his son Aralt (Harald). Downham (2007) makes this Harald a son of the later Sitric II. During this time the Dubliners were strong enough to carry out successful raids on major monasteries. They plundered Ardbraccan, Donaghpatrick, Dulane, Glendalough, Kildare and Clonard all within the space of two years (890‚Äì891).√ì Corr√°in (2008), p. 22; CS 891. But a son of Barith called Eolair was killed by the U√≠ Amalgada of T√≠r Amalgada (Tirawley in County Mayo).CS 891. Tirawley is an Anglicisation of T√≠r Amalgada, \\"Amalgaid's Land\\". It is possible that this Eolair was not Barith's son but the son of J√°rnkn√© referred to above. In 893 another conflict arose and the ruling dynasty in Dublin split into two factions, one led by Sitric and the other by a pretender called Sigfrith the Jarl ( or Sigur√∞r). This shadowy figure may have been the same Sigfr√∏√∞r who was King of J√≥rv√≠k from 895‚Äì900; a Viking called Sigfr√∏√∞r also led a Northumbrian fleet against Wessex in 893; it is possible that all three were one and the same man.AU 893.4; see Downham (2007), pp. 77 and 79. The Annals of Ulster record that, \\"the foreigners of √Åth Cliath [Dublin] became dispersed, one faction following the son of √çmar [Sitric I] and the other faction following Sigfrith the Jarl.\\" It is possible that Sitric was deposed and Sigfrith the Jarl became king, but this is not at all certain; it is also possible that both factions left the city. The Annals of Inisfallen record that, \\"The heathens departed from Ireland this year [893].\\"AI 893.2.Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib also implies that Sitric son of √çmar and his people went to Scotland around 892.CGG 27, which has been misplaced. Whatever the truth of the matter, Sitric returned the following year.AU 894.4. It is not clear whether he expelled Sigfrith the Jarl or whether the latter had already left of his own accord. In 895 a Norseman called Gl√∫niarann (\\"Iron Knee\\", an Irish translation of the Norse J√°rnkn√©) led an army from Dublin to Armagh, where 710 prisoners were captured. In 896 Sitric I was slain \\"by other Norsemen\\";AU 896.3. he was succeeded, probably, by his son or nephew Ivar II the Younger.Downham (2007), p. 26, suggests that Gl√∫niarann succeeded Sitric I. In the same year \\"Amla√≠b grandson of √çmar\\" and Gl√∫niarann's son Gl√∫ntradna were slain by the Conaille Muirthemne of County Louth and Ait√≠th mac Laigni the King of Ulster.AU 896.7, CS 896 (both of which are mistranslated in the English versions at CELT) and AFM 891.15 [=896]. Todd (1867), p. 271, makes this Amla√≠b a son of Sitric I, who was slain in the same year. The Conaille Muirthemne's territory lay in the overkingdom of Ulaid (Ulster). Later in the same year the Norsemen of Dublin killed Flannac√°n mac Cellaig, King of Brega.AU 896.9 We are not told whether these events were linked. Little is known of the reign of Ivar II; Kildare was plundered again by \\"the heathens\\" in 900, which may have been his doing.CS 900. The final blow fell in 902, when Cerball mac Muirec√°in King of Leinster and M√°el Findia mac Flannac√°in King of Brega launched a two-pronged attack on Dublin from the north and the south, and drove Ivar II out of the city.AU 902.2; CS 902. Ivar II died in Fortriu in 904 (AU 904.4). Cerball mac Muirec√°in was a son of the earlier King of Leinster Muirec√°n mac Diarmata, whom the Norsemen of Dublin had killed in 863, so long-nurtured vengeance may have been a motive for this attack. The Norsemen's defeat was comprehensive. They fled, leaving \\"great numbers of their ships behind them, and escaped half-dead across the sea.\\"AU 902.2. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, some survivors of the initial onslaught took refuge on Ireland's Eye, where they were besieged.AFM 897.7 [=902]. The event is antedated by five years and the old name of Ireland's Eye, Inis Mac Nes√°in has been corrupted in transmission. Some of the ousted Norsemen fled to Wales under Hingamund (), a shadowy figure who may have usurped Ivar II's throne shortly before the fall of Dublin. Hingamund was driven out of Wales and eventually settled in the Wirral in the northwest of England, where he was granted lands by √Ü√∞elfl√¶d the Queen of Mercia, who was acting as regent for her chronically ill husband √Üthelred.FA 429; Annales Cambriae 902; Brut y Tywysogion 900, which calls Hingamund's followers \\"black pagans\\". Others are said to have fled to the Loire valley in France.See Downham (2007), p. 27, for references; T. D. Kendricks, A History of the Vikings (1930), p. 282, though no source is cited. Ivar II went to Scotland, where he died in 904.AU 904.4; cf. Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, which records a Norse defeat at Strathearn in the same year. Dublin was now under Gaelic control, and remained so for fifteen years. Excavations have revealed that the site of Viking Dublin was not actually abandoned during these years. Presumably it was only the ruling dynasty and their warriors who were expelled; many families of Norse farmers, traders, artisans, etc., may have remained, under the jurisdiction of native Irish chieftains. Cerball mac Muirec√°in probably claimed sovereignty over Dublin, as the city lay within the traditional boundaries of his kingdom of Leinster. AFM 904.9 refers to Cerball as the spouse of \\"Liffey of the Ships\\". Cerball was succeeded as King of Leinster by Augaire mac Ailella, who died in the Battle of Confey in 917 ‚Äì the battle which led to the recapture of Dublin by Ivar II's cousin or brother Sitric Caech. The First Viking Age was at an end. The archaeological record Dublin c. 900. This period of Dublin's history is still very obscure. Despite the existence of a wealth of documentary evidence for Viking activity in the Dublin region throughout the 9th century, relatively little archaeological evidence has been unearthed to corroborate the testimony of contemporary annalists. The pioneering 19th-century historian Charles Haliday bewailed the silence of contemporary Irish sources \\"respecting the social position, religion, laws, and monuments of those who occupied Dublin for more than three hundred years on all facts ... excepting such as relate to their inroads and devastations\\".Haliday (1884), p. 4. Most of our knowledge concerning the day-to-day lives of the Norse settlers in Dublin has been learned from extensive excavations at Wood Quay and in the neighbourhoods of Winetavern Street and Fishamble Street. The Norse built their houses almost exclusively out of perishable materials such as wood and straw, but many early buildings have been preserved in this area in a two-metre-thick waterlogged layer of estuarine mud, making Dublin one of the most important Norse sites in Europe. To date, more than two hundred houses have been excavated. Among the few recent discoveries relating to this period are the graves of five young Viking warriors, one of which was found at Ship Street Great about 100 metres to the southwest of the Black Pool, the other four being clustered together on the southeastern shore near South Great George's Street. Radiocarbon analysis suggests that all five died in the 9th century, possibly before the establishment of a Viking longphort at Dublin. Oxygen isotope analysis has revealed that two of these warriors were from Scandinavia and two from somewhere in the British Isles, possibly the western coast of Scotland. In total, about one hundred Viking burials from this period have been unearthed in the Dublin region, but most of these discoveries were made serendipitously in the 19th century and few were properly excavated. Most of these burials were accompanied by typical Viking grave goods ‚Äì swords, spear-heads, shields, daggers, penannular brooches and various decorative items ‚Äì including hacksilver (i.e. small pieces of silver cut from coins or jewellery and used as currency).; Evidence for early Viking burials has also been recovered at Cork Street, Bride Street, Kildare Street, Dollymount and Donnybrook. More extensive cemeteries have been uncovered at Kilmainham, Islandbridge, Phoenix Park, Parnell Square and College Green, but it is thought that these date from the Second Viking Age after 902. The cemetery at College Green consisted of several burial mounds (Old Norse: haugr), which are thought to have contained the remains of some of the Norse kings of Dublin; the last of these mounds had been removed by the end of the 17th century.Clarke (2002), p. 3. Longphort Temple Bar West in the 9th century. One of the enduring controversies in the history of Dublin concerns the existence and location of the longphort, or naval encampment, which the Annals of Ulster claim was established by the Vikings at Dublin in 841. The Annals refer to encampments at both Duiblinn and √Åth Cliath, which has led some archaeologists to conclude that there were two such encampments at Dublin: one in the vicinity of the ecclesiastical settlement of Duiblinn, and one further upstream at or near Usher's Island and the Ford of Hurdles (√°th cliath, from which the urban settlement took its name). It is possible, however, that the annalists were simply using two closely related names to describe one and the same longphort. Evidence for a late 9th-century settlement has been unearthed in the vicinity of Parliament Street in Temple Bar West, about 100 metres north of Dublin Castle. It appears that this early phase of settlement was confined to a small region at the confluence of the Poddle and the Liffey, bounded on the west by what are now Fishamble Street and Werburgh Street and on the east by the Poddle estuary, which roughly followed the course of today's Parliament Street. Simpson, Linzi, Director's Findings Temple Bar West (1999), Temple Bar archaeological Report No. 5. Dublin. Parallels have been drawn between the Norse settlement of Dublin and that of Waterford, which also appears to have been established at the confluence of a major river and a minor tributary.Halpin (2005), pp. 99‚Äì102. To date, no archaeological remains of any longphort or wintersetl have been unearthed; nevertheless, the possibility that there was no actual encampment in this early period can be discounted. A wealth of contemporary documentary evidence serves to confirm that throughout the second half of the 9th century Viking Dublin was a successful and thriving settlement from which numerous raids were launched throughout the country. Furthermore, a succession of warlords ‚Äì many of them claiming the title King of Dublin ‚Äì made Dublin their principal power-base, and from there launched a series of military campaigns against enemies in Ireland, Britain and further afield. The most likely possibility is that the longphort was established on the gravel ridge overlooking the Black Pool ‚Äì the most easily defended location in Dublin ‚Äì and that its remains were subsequently buried or obliterated by the later 10th century settlement of Dyflinn, which was built in the same location (not to mention Dublin Castle, which presently occupies the site). The discovery of what are thought to be late 9th-century earthen banks in Ross Road and Werburgh Street (immediately west of Dublin Castle) lends some support to this theory.; . The other possibility is that the longphort was situated on the eastern or southern side of the Black Pool, and that Norse settlement began here, expanding northwards and westwards across the Poddle in the late 9th century. Norse houses to the west of these banks all appear to date from the Second Viking Age (917‚Äì1170).Hayden (2002), p. 66. It is also a possibility that the location of the longphort was changed after the destruction of the original settlement in 849. Housing The population of Dublin during the so-called \\"longphort phase\\" is estimated to have been quite considerable, amounting perhaps to several thousands. According to the annals, the Vikings of Dublin lost as many as 900 warriors at Carn Brammit in 847 without being overrun. It is assumed that streams of new immigrants from Britain and Scandinavia sustained the early settlement in the face of almost continuous hostility on the part of the native Irish. Like their Irish neighbours, the Norsemen of Dublin used the post-and-wattle method to construct their dwellings. A series of sturdy vertical posts were first driven into the ground; these were then interlaced with horizontal osiers, as in basketwork. A plaster of mud and dung was generally applied to the outer surfaces of the walls to seal them (wattle-and-daub). Finally, the roofs were thatched with straw. There was usually just one door, and no windows. Typically, the houses were 10‚Äì50 m2 in ground area, and were often provided with small gardens or vegetable plots, as well as adjoining workshops and storehouses. Inside, the houses were sometimes partitioned with curtains or wooden partitions, but usually they consisted of a single room; furniture was spartan, consisting of little more than benches and store chests; floors were strewn with rushes or straw; the only source of heat or light (other than the doorway) was the hearth in the centre of the living room. Rush lights fuelled by mutton fat were available, but they were expensive. A shuttered hole in the roof served as a chimney. Archaeological evidence suggests that in addition to the naval encampments, the Vikings established numerous scattered dwellings along both banks of the Liffey in the 9th and 10th centuries. Almost one hundred Viking burials have been uncovered at Kilmainham, Islandbridge, College Green, Parnell Square and in the Phoenix Park; in the majority of cases it cannot be determined whether they belong to the First or the Second Viking Age. The burials at Kilmainham and Islandbridge were associated with earlier Christian graveyards, though there was nothing about them to suggest that the deceased were other than pagan. In the opinion of a number of historians these burials are indicative of a significant early Viking settlement in this region, some three kilometres west of √Åth Cliath; it is even possible that the longphort mentioned in the annals as being at Duiblinn or √Åth Cliath was actually further upstream in this area.Clarke (2005), p. 3. A handful of domestic habitations from the same period have also been found at Temple Bar West in the heart of the modern city. Typically these early houses were sunken structures, or Grubenh√§user, with wattle-lined walls, stone or wattle floors, and no hearths. They were built on the left bank of the Poddle close to its confluence with the Liffey. At a later date ‚Äì possibly in the 9th century ‚Äì these sunken structures were filled in and replaced with more densely spaced post-and-wattle structures indicative of more intensive settlement. These later dwellings are now identified as Type I houses, characterised by the possession of a central hearth flanked by two raised benches or bedding areas, a roof supported by four internal posts, and a doorway at each end of the building.Wallace, P. F., Aspects of Viking Dublin (1988); Wallace, P. F., The Viking Age Buildings of Dublin (1992). These houses have been compared to Norse dwellings that were built in the early 9th century at Kaupang in Vestfold, Norway.Downham (2007), p. 174. Neighbouring houses were connected by wattle paths and there are some indications of formal property boundaries. Associated with these Type I houses were animal pens. Excavations at these and other sites have revealed a rural community of farmers, quite different from the urbanised and industrial community of the 10th century. The four burials excavated near South Great George's Street were also associated with domestic habitations, suggesting that the deceased had been members of a settled Norse community and not the fatalities suffered by a transient raiding party. Late in the 9th century a large metalled road was laid down in the middle of the Temple Bar West site, connecting it with the Liffey.Simpson, Linzi, Director's Findings (1999), Temple Bar Archaeological Series No. 5, Dublin. It is also thought that South Great George's Street follows the course of an early medieval route ‚Äì or possibly even the eastern boundary of a longphort, assuming that there was a naval encampment along the eastern shore of the Black Pool at some stage in the settlement's early history. Clondalkin Amla√≠b is known to have built a fortress at Clondalkin, eight kilometres west of √Åth Cliath. This was an important seat of Norse power for more than a century. Significantly, the fortress was built on the remains of an old monastic site, which has led some historians to wonder whether a similar thing might not have happened at the ecclesiastical enclosure of Duiblinn. The annals are silent as to the ultimate fate of the latter settlement and its community ‚Äì no Abbot or Bishop of Dublin is mentioned after 785; the possibility remains that it was abandoned in the late 8th century before the arrival of the Norsemen, who simply annexed it and built their longphort on the site. In 867 a force led by the king of Lo√≠gis Cenn√©tig mac Ga√≠th√©ne burned the fortress at Clondalkin and killed 100 of Amla√≠b's followers.AU 867.8; AFM 865.12 [=867]; FAI 349; AClon 865 [=867]. Viking activity in the Dublin region is also indicated by the discovery of numerous silver-hoards in the east and midlands of Ireland.Downham (2007), p. 23.

History The Father Ray Sponsor a Child Foundation (FRSAC) was started in memory of Father Ray Brennan who worked for nearly 40 years in and around the town of Pattaya Thailand until his death in 2003. Ray initially established an orphanage there because one day he found an abandoned baby on the rectory doorstep. He eventually established a multitude of projects which are fully documented in the article about the Father Ray Foundation. However US Residents who supported the various projects found that they were unable to make tax deductible contributions directly to Fr Ray and his projects. When Ray died, Ron Small from the United States formed the Father Ray's Sponsor a Child Foundation to support the projects that Ray initiated plus many others. The US foundation permits US contributors to deduct their contributions. The foundation is an IRS approved 501c(3) charity incorporated in the state of New Jersey. Mr. Small who operates the foundation has spent much time in Thailand assisting the various projects there and overseeing the efficient use of funds collected in the US in support of the projects. Operations Father Ray's Sponsor a Child Foundation focuses on supporting disadvantaged and vulnerable children across Thailand. It helps provide full care, including accommodation, education and medical care to over 850 children. It also helps support health and nutrition projects to over 1500 children. The charity helps support a range of projects across Thailand run by its partner organizations, the Father Ray Foundation in Pattaya, Thailand and the Thai Children's Trust in London. In addition, the foundation provides support via the Thai Children's Trust to many other projects including the Camillian Center, the Duang Prateep Foundation, the Good Shepherd Sisters and the Diocese of Chanthaburi. In the United States, FRSAC supports a program called \\"Dinner with Santa\\" Website * us.fr-ray.org  Dinner with Santa Program The \\"Dinner with Santa\\" program works in cooperation with participating public elementary schools to provide a happy Christmas to children selected by the school district as deserving aid during the holiday season. It works as follows: *An elementary school makes the decision to participate in the program, applies to the Foundation and becomes a \\"Dinner with Santa\\" participant *The school determines which families with a child at the school may be in need of special assistance at Christmas. They contact the child's parents and determine if the parents want their child to receive the benefits of the program. *If so the parents provide a list of both clothing and other necessaries plus toy suggestions for their child. *About three weeks prior to Christmas, the school provides the Foundation with the number of children to attend along with the wish list for each child, the child's age and first name. * The Foundation purchases the items on the wish list, each item is gift wrapped and a gift tag affixed to each package. *The children and their parents are invited to a pre-Christmas dinner at a local restaurant. *Everyone enjoys the festive dinner and then as dessert is being served, Santa and Mrs. Claus make an appearance. *Santa distributes the gifts to each child. *The Foundation picks up the all the expenses, purchases and wraps the gifts.

She is best known for her work to gain support for designating some of the last remaining tall grass prairie land in the American Midwest, as the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve. This land was publicized in a Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition (S.I.T.E.S.) in 1976-86 as a Bicentennial Exhibition. The exhibit has been digitally preserved by Kansas State University's Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art. Duncan has paintings and photographs hanging in museums across the country, including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine, the Spencer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas,Patricia DuBose Duncan at the Spencer Museum of Art. the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art in Manhattan, KS, and the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art in St. Joseph, MO. Missouri. Early life Duncan was born in 1932 in Nashville, Tn. Duncan lived with her family in El Dorado, Arkansas and then Roanoke, Virginia until 1944 when the family relocated to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Duncan attended the Philadelphia Museum School on a scholarship. Her family moved again, and she went to high school in St. Louis, Missouri. From 1950-1954, she attended Washington University School of Fine Arts where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree focused on painting and printmaking. Duncan married another graduate of the Washington University, Herb Duncan. He joined the Navy soon after the Korean War draft was enacted, and during his service, he was stationed in Newport, Rhode Island and Long Beach California. While in Long Beach, Duncan was invited \\"into a group show at the Long Beach Art Museum\\". Herb was stationed in Sasebo Japan in 1956. While there, Duncan studied woodblock printing and other artforms, with a focus on exploring Japanese aesthetics. This work led to her first one-person show, and exhibit in Sasebo, Japan in 1956. Returning to the states in 1957, Duncan studied at the Kansas City Art Institute of Art. Career Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Much of Duncan's work during the 1970s focused on the interests of the environmental movement. The Smithsonian Institution, with additional support from the Hallmark Corporation, commissioned Duncan to create a large traveling exhibit as part of their Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service: \\"The Tallgrass Prairie: An American Landscape.\\" This show traveled across the United States from 1976 to 1986 and visited 300 venues in all 50 states. The exhibit was largely responsible for creating public interest in the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas. Without Duncan's creation of the exhibit, and active lobbying of artists, journalists, public figures, and politicians the preserve likely would not have been created.Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, National Park Service. Notably, she recruited noted photographer and Kansas native, Gordan Parks, to help her with the campaign. She also published a book of writings and photographs: Tallgrass Prairie: The Inland Sea. Maine Following a residency at the Maine Photographic Workshops, she moved to Maine in 1986 and established a studio in Belfast Maine. There she continued to work on photography and painting. Art collections The University of Kansas established the Patricia DuBose Duncan Collection. Kansas State University's Marianna Kistler Beach Museum also contains 98 works by Duncan. The Beach Museum of Art published a collection of her art, Taking Root: the Art of Patricia Dubose Duncan.

Oveson has held several state offices in Utah, most notably the third Lieutenant Governor of Utah, and the federal office of National Taxpayer Advocate for the Internal Revenue Service. He resides in Bountiful, Utah. Biography Early life and education Oveson was born in 1952 in Provo, Utah and raised in Orem, Utah, where his father worked for Geneva Steel. He attended Brigham Young University and earned a degree in accounting. He became a certified public accountant, working for an Orem accounting firm for several years before starting his own accounting and auditing business. Career Oveson launched his political career with a successful run for Utah State Auditor in 1980. The Republican Party's presumptive nominee had been disqualified from running because he had not lived in Utah for the required five years. Oveson became the Republican nominee instead and soon became the youngest person elected to statewide office in Utah at the age of 28. His performance as State Auditor led Utah House of Representatives Speaker Norm Bangerter to say that he \\"audit[ed] like a junkyard dog.\\" In 1984, rather than running for re-election, Oveson became the running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Norm Bangerter. Bangerter and Oveson won the Republican primary in August 1984, overcoming the wealthy Congressman Dan Marriott's well-funded campaign, which was backed by party leaders. Next, in the general election, Bangerter and Oveson defeated the Democratic tandem of former Congressman Wayne Owens and Dale Carpenter, then the director of the state Department of Community and Economic Development. Bangerter and Oveson received about 56% of the vote. They were narrowly re-elected in 1988. As lieutenant governor, Oveson directed a statewide performance audit aimed at reducing the cost of government. In 1990, Utah was named \\"Best Managed State\\" by Financial World.Roc Consulting Group profile Soon after his second term expired, Oveson was appointed Chairman of the Utah State Tax Commission in 1993 by Governor Mike Leavitt. In this capacity he redesigned the computer systems and processes for the commission and created the Utah Tax Law Library on CD-ROM.Val Oveson Appointed as Chief Information Officer He served in this position until 1998, when he was appointed the first head of the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate; this position had been created by legislation passed by Congress in 1996. In this role, Oveson led 2,300 employees in 74 locations across the U.S., reported independently to Congress on problems facing America's taxpayers, and recommended administrative and legislative solutions to stop the problems from recurring. In 2000, Oveson joined PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he was a managing director and lead of the knowledge management function for the state and local tax group. He was based in Washington, D.C. In 2003, Governor Leavitt selected Oveson as Utah's Chief Information Officer. Oveson was confirmed by the Utah Senate and served until the end of Leavitt's term. In 2004, during his tenure as state CIO, Oveson was named one of the Public Officials of the Year by Governing Magazine for his work in eGovernment.

The series consists of the titles XIII Century: Death or Glory, its stand-alone expansion XIII Century: Blood of Europe, and a XIII Century: Gold release, which combines the two titles. The games are similar in interface and game play to those of the Total War series but feature a more complex battle mechanism, in which results are calculated for each individual soldier in the units and the corps mechanics are more realistic. The units possess different grades of AI (called \\"Self Control\\"), which give them the capability to evaluate the situation: a low-Self Control unit demands more management by the player. There are more than 80 factors considered in battle, including such dynamics as the terrain and the direction of the attack, so victory depends more upon the correct use of units than the relative strength of them. The games' single campaigns are series of thematic battles. It is also possible to play battles in \\"Battlefield\\" mode, in which victory is assigned on the basis of points, which are scored by both killing enemy and occupying important locations.

They developed special aptitude and traditional skills for marine fishing. The main reasons for using Jambudwip were the island's proximity to the fishing grounds, presence of a natural creek for safe harbouring of their boats, and supply of drinking water.

The Commission was directed that certain persons shall be tried by it for the offence of conspiring to wage a war against the British King. The number of accused to be tried by the Commission was 24 in all. Out of these 24 persons, 14 were arrested and produced before the Commission, while nine were declared absconding and one had died. Though only 24 persons were accused of the offence, during the trial it transpired that there were a large number of persons who had participated in the venture. It was an Indian revolutionary movement directed against the British to win India's freedom by violent revolutionary means. Constitution of the Commission The three-member commission consisted of L.S.White (president) and members Kanwar Sain and Amir Ali. During the trial of the accused persons, the Crown was represented by Muhammad Zafarullah Khan and his team. The accused were represented by Asaf Ali with support from others. Accused before the Commission On 14 May 1931, nine accused were presented before the Commission. These were Nand Kishore Nigam, B.R. Gupta, Rudra Dutt Mishra, Bhagirath Lal, Hardwari Lal Gupta, K. R. Gupta, Harkesh Singh, Gajanand Potdar and Kapur Chand. On that day, the Crown presented Kailashpati, who had turned state's evidence, as a witness. Asaf Ali, who represented the accused, attempted an objection to the oath being administered to Kailashpati on various legal technicalities. The Commission overruled the objection and directed the administration of oath. The memory of Kailashpati was phenomenal and he gave such a vast volume of detailed information on every minor and major subject, which ran into about 900 pages of deposition, that it became impossible for the prosecution to tie the loose ends of the story to secure conviction for the accused. It was primarily for this reason that at the final stage of the trial, the Commission was disbanded by the Government before a verdict could be given by it. The prosecution also presented other approvers in support of its case. These included Girwar Singh, who was produced on 24 February 1932 by the prosecution, and Dandpani Venkat Tailang, who was examined by the prosecution on 8 March 1932. Other approvers included Ram Lal, Madan Gopal and Bal Kishon (alias Kishen Bal).  Barhelganj post office robbery  The primary goal of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) was to gain independence of India from Britain by use of armed revolution. Kailashpati had been introduced to the movement in 1923 and in March 1928 he was asked to assist it by robbing his employer, the post office at Gorakhpur. He was transferred to the branch at Barhelganj before finding a suitable opportunity to carry out the scheme. On 26 June 1928, he took all the available funds held by the Barhelganj office, being around Rs. 3000 ‚Äì and travelled with it by train to Cawnpore. He gave some of the money to Haldhar Bajpai and the remainder to Surendranath Pandey, with whom he stopped for two days. He then briefly moved into the room of Sheo Verma at the DAV College Hostel, where he met Sukhdev Raj, who was known as \\"Villager\\", Chandrashekhar Azad and Gaya Prasad. The group then split up, with Kailashpati moving to Lahore. In needs of funds in late 1929, the group determined to rob the Punjab National Bank in Lahore but the plan was first postponed and then abandoned  ‚ÄúThe Himalayan Toilets‚Äù  Armed revolution required weapons and at that time the HSRA had only small arms such as pistols and revolvers. Aware of the shortage of firepower, the HSRA sought to improve its position. They took to learning about chemical reactions from books in order that they could make bombs, then experimented accordingly. The successes were stockpiled and used in their missions, albeit not with great success. Sachchidananda Vatsyayan was known within the group as \\"Scientist\\" and was involved in the bomb-making activities. Babu Ram Gupta was a revolutionary and he used his shop in Billimaran as a facade for the purpose of buying bomb-making materials on regular basis. The intent was to manufacture picric acid, for which carbolic acid was also necessary. Towards this end, various items were bought through Gupta, including some sulphuric and nitric acids that were stored at Kailashpati's house until around the end of July and the beginning of August. At this time they were taken to the bomb factory, which was known as ‚ÄúThe Himalayan Toilets‚Äù and bore signage accordingly. For these materials, which also included sundries such as rubber gloves and some potassium cyanide, Gupta was paid Rs. 600. Two electric fans were also required and were hired by Bimal Prashad Jain. The fans were used to expel the fumes from the factory and, since picric acid turns water yellow, any water expelled from the factory was dyed with another colour before being allowed to run outside. Attempts were also made to manufacture soap, oil and cream in order to cover their activities, with attention being paid to the nature of the fat bought for these purposes in order to not contravene religious considerations. It was soon realised that the acid-making process was slow and various apparatus purchases were made in order to scale-up production. The revolutionaries also obtained ice from a restaurant to assist in the manufacture of guncotton using nitric and sulphuric acid. Nitroglycerine was also produced in the factory, and the group also intended to make hydrocyanic acid from potassium cyanide, initially purchased in weak form from Gupta and later in a stronger concentration from elsewhere. The revolutionaries knew that hydrocyanic acid produced a very toxic gas and that an antidote would need to be available if those manufacturing it were not to suffer. It was the inability to procure an antidote that caused them to abandon the attempt. Kailashpati had shown a bombshell to Jain and suggested to him that it would useful to produce something similar. Jain in turn used some engineering contacts in an attempt to produce the item but it came to nothing as the suspicions of his contacts were raised. At the end of October 1929, Bhagwati Charan Vohra was introduced to Kailashpati. At that time, Vohra was an absconder in the Lahore Conspiracy Case. He asked to meet Azad in Delhi  Viceroy's train  Soon after, Vohra criticised suggestions of killing relatively minor Raj officials and proposed instead to blow up a train carrying the viceroy, Lord Irwin. Yashpal was at that time living in the same Delhi house as Vohra and the two men were experimenting with arrangements of batteries to blow lightbulbs, thinking that such might be used as a primitive method of detonating guncotton. Early in December 1929, Vohra and Yashpal secured the agreement of Azad regarding blowing up the Viceregal train, the rationale of the HSRA being that it would prevent a meeting between Irwin and Congress. However, on 22 December, Azad said in a meeting that, although he agreed with the plan, since Congress leaders such as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi were against it, it ought to be postponed. Vohra, Yashpal and Tiwari thought Azad was wrong but the decision eventually went in his favour. Explanatory documents had been prepared for circulation after the now-aborted attack, along with two seals ‚Äì one of them representing a hand grasping a sword and the other the monogram ‚ÄúH.S.R.A.‚Äù ‚Äì that were to be used on them. In view of the turn in events, the documents were destroyed but Vohra managed to retain the seals. The attempt to blow up the train occurred some hours later on 23 December. According to S. K. Mittal and Irfan Habib, this \\"caused a commotion throughout the British Empire\\", following soon after the retaliatory murder of a police constable, John Saunders, and the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly, both of which acts had involved Bhagat Singh. Police activity in Delhi became intense and the Congress leader, Mahatma Gandhi, who was generally firm in his condemnation of violence, congratulated the viceroy, saying After a few days spent in hiding, Azad, Jain and Kailashpati left on foot for Nalgarha, around from the city. There they hid on a farm operated by sympathisers. On 1 January 1930, Azad and Kailashpati returned to Delhi. The following day, Yashpal also returned and he faced questions regarding why the train had been blown up in defiance of the decision of the meeting. Yashpal replied that he had yielded to the insistence of his companions, explaining that he and Vohra had gone to the scene on the morning of 23 December and that he had pressed the button that caused the explosion. They had worn military uniform so that no one should suspect them and had escaped by boarding a train headed for Ghaziabad. Azad was not at all satisfied with Yashpal's explanation.  The Philosophy of the Bomb leaflets  Two days after Yashpal arrived, Vohra returned and then Azad, Yashpal, Vohra and Kailashpati decided that in reply to a Congress resolution in praise of the Viceroy and in support of non-violence, a leaflet should be written by Vohra and distributed throughout India on the evening prior to ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù, that is, 25 January 1930. Specifically, they intended to address a pamphlet issued by Gandhi ‚Äì The Cult of the Bomb ‚Äì which had criticised their methods. In the event 500 leaflets were printed, entitled The Philosophy of the Bomb. These were then distributed on the intended day around educational buildings, to Congress workers and to press and news agencies. Other copies were posted to individuals, including Sir James Crerar, Home Member, Assembly, Delhi; Asaf Ali, the barrister; and Kamla Parshad Jain, of Baraut.  Plan to rescue Bhagat Singh and others  Later, there was a meeting in Cawnpore, attended by B. B. Tiwari, Satgur Dayal Awasthi, Vohra, Azad and Kailashpati. They decided to rescue the accused in the Lahore Conspiracy case by releasing a gas in court that would render everyone present senseless and permit the accused to be rescued. Aside from rescuing Kundan Lal, Kanwal Nath Tiwari, Bijay Kumar Sinha, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Batukeshwar Dutt, Ajay Kumar Gupta, and Sanyal, it had been decided that Mahabir Singh, Sukhdev Raj and Desh Raj were to be killed because they had made statements which had been of great assistance to the police. Further, Shiv Verma, S. N. Pande and three others (including Agya Ram) were to be given another chance to prove their sincerity, while the case of Gaya Prasad was to be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal as it was uncertain whether he had made a statement or not. Yashpal was charged with producing the gas to be used for the rescue attempt but found it impossible to do so. This caused a decision to effect rescue by a desperate attack on the court, for which the various conspirators undertook firearms practice away from Delhi. Funding for the rescue attempt proved to be a problem and a raid on the monthly wage delivery made to the Railway Clearing Accounts Office on the first of each month was considered. But in the meantime, a sum of Rs. 3000 was given by Durga Devi, the wife of Vohra, for the purpose of carrying out the rescue plan and so, as there was no urgent need for money, the plan of robbing the Railway Clearing Accounts Office was given up. About the beginning of May, some blank forms were brought from Cawnpore, which were to be typed and distributed to the public after the rescue of the prisoners at Lahore. It was arranged that after the rescue, the freed accused were to be sent to different places for safety. Arrangements for this took some time, during which Kailashpati arranged for Azad to meet Madan Gopal, who agreed to join in the rescue attempt. On 1 June, a group of the conspirators travelled by car to Borstal Jail. They were armed with pistols and also bombs. The plan was that while Bhagat Singh was to be led by police out of the jail gate towards the stationed police lorry, the captive was to rush towards the rescue-team, and the team, while taking control of the prisoner, was to deal with the emerging situation by killing any or all policemen who might obstruct the captive‚Äôs escape to freedom or pursue him to capture. Bhagat Singh had been informed in advance of this rescue plan and the rescue team was legitimately under the impression that Bhagat Singh would rush towards them. However, Bhagat Singh showed by his behavior as if he was under the impression that they would rush towards him. In this confusing situation, both remained where they were and Bhagat Singh was taken away by the police in a lorry. Having returned to their accommodation, the conspirators suffered the effects of some of their own bomb-shells exploding of their own accord. The entire team living there dispersed quickly on the following morning. Kailashpati was told in early June that Vohra had been killed in Lahore on 28 May 1930 through the explosion of a bomb which he was testing. Sukhdev Raj, who was with him, had been badly wounded in the foot and Vaishampayan had been burnt on the shin. Azad returned to Delhi and reported on the confused events of the failed rescue. He said that after his experience in Lahore he would never take any part in any action unless there was sufficient money and material. He also said that in order to raise funds the Railway Clearing Accounts Office should be raided on the first of the following month.  Attempt by HSRA to kill Yashpal  A Central Committee meeting of the party determined that Yashpal, who was not present, had wasted much money in the attempts on the viceregal train and the rescue of Bhagat Singh. Yashpal was also blamed for the death of Vohra in the bomb explosion and was criticised for abducting Vohra's wife, Prakasho, contrary to the party‚Äôs strict disciplinary rules of keeping one‚Äôs character clean in the matter of engaging with women. The meeting decided that Yashpal should be killed. It was also decided in the meeting that a terror campaign against highly placed government officials, approvers and traitors should be vigorously pursued throughout India. This decision was taken to terrify the Government and lower is public image, to win the confidence and sympathy of the general public and to teach a lesson to traitors and deter other weaklings within the party's rank from committing such anti-party and dangerous acts. The meeting also decided that the party should organize a public demonstration in Punjab to honour Vohra in order to highlight his work and sacrifice and also to motivate and mobilize other young people. Regarding Yashpal, the meeting decided that Kailaspati should go back to Delhi and send Yashpal to Cawnpore where Azad and Bir Bahadur Tiwari would kill him. After two or three days, Kailashpati left Cawnpore for Delhi and met Yashpal there. Kailashpati told Yashpal that Yashpal's presence was required by the Central Committee in Cawnpore. Yashpal made a brief visit to Cawnpore but returned to Delhi, much to the surprise of Kailashpati. Soon after, Kailashpati then discovered that Yashpal, Prakasho and Scientist had left the bomb-factory and had taken with them the available supplies of picric acid, guncotton and nitroglycerine, as well as a revolver. Azad returned to Delhi and was very upset by what had happened but the group were unable to locate Yashpal in Delhi. It was decided to seek him in Lahore and to kill him by any means when he was found. Yashpal had already reached Lahore by that time and had spread the word about the plan of his killing among his friends by taking the position that the decision of the Central Committee of the party had been arrived at in his absence ‚Äì without hearing his side ‚Äì which was contrary to justice. Consequently, many members of the party in the Punjab were opposed to the decision of the Central Committee. In these circumstances, the team assigned the task of killing him met Yashpal but did not execute the plan.  Gadodia Stores robbery  After abandoning the Railway Accounts office raid on 1 July, the party was in acute need of funds. It was suggested that a robbery take place at the Gadodia Stores in Delhi. The choice was affected by the fact that Bishamber Dayal was working there, and after a reconnaissance it was determined to act on 6 July. This action was a success, although the robbers were faced with a crowd of people who attempted to stop them as they left, causing them to fire their weapons in order to get away. The raid secured funds to the value of Rs. 13,250.  Appeal On 25 May 1932, Rudra Dutt Misra, Dhanwantri, K B Gupta, B R Gupta, S H Vatsayana, Azad Vidyabhushan, Vaishampayan and Bhagirath Lal Harkesh, individuals who were the accused sent a petition from 'Old Viceregal Lodge, Delhi' to the viceroy in his summer residence in Shimla. The conspiracy charge was finally dropped in February 1933 as untenable and the fact that there was not enough evidence to take it any further. Four of the accused were let off and the rest were to be tried individually 'for severe overt acts'.

It describes the heroic story of the events during the American Revolutionary War, in which filmmaker D. W. Griffith created a film adaptation of Robert W. Chambers‚Äô novel The Reckoning. The plot mainly centers itself on the battles of the New York State, with romance spliced into the individual movie scenes.http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/24americ.htmMagill's Survey of Silent Films, Vol.1 A-FLA p.137 edited by Frank N. Magill c. 1982; (3 book set; )  Plot  The story shifts between the British in Northern New York, and the colonial patriots in Massachusetts and Virginia. Much later in the film in New York, a little remembered sub-plot takes place. British general Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a loyal and ruthless supporter to the king, leads the Iroquois Native Americans in viciously barraging attacks against the settlers, including the massacre of women and children, who are siding with the Revolution. In Lexington, Massachusetts, Nathan Holden (Neil Hamilton) works as an express rider and minute man for the Boston Committee of Public Safety. At a mission to deliver a dispatch to the Virginia legislature, he meets Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster) and falls in love with her, but her father Justice Montague (Erville Alderson), a Tory judge, is not impressed with the rider.http://www.answers.com/topic/america-film-1 Captain Butler tries unsuccessfully to court Nancy. Nathan and Nancy declare that regardless of which side he fights for, they will always love each other. While visiting in Massachusetts, Justice Montague is accidentally shot by Nathan Holden. Nancy Montague's brother, Charles Montague (Charles Emmett Mack), is influenced by George Washington's heroism and decides that he wants to support the colonists. However, he dies shortly after being wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Nancy hides the truth from her father when she tells him that her brother died fighting for the crown. Nancy and her father travel to Mohawk Valley New York to the home of her Uncle Ashleigh Montague while Holden visits George Washington (Arthur Dewey) at Valley Forge. He gets sent to New York with Morgan's raiders to settle down the Native American attacks up north. Butler occupies the Montague estate. His men kill Montague's brother and he arrests Montague and takes Nancy prisoner. Holden arrives to spy on Butler and overhears his plans for a massacre attack. He leaves to sound the alarm, reluctantly leaving Nancy behind with Butler. Butler plans to force himself on Nancy, but the Native Americans decide to attack immediately and Butler is compelled to join them. Nancy escapes when Butler leaves for the battle, and she and Montague reach the fort safely before the attack. The attackers mount ruthless attack on the fort, ultimately breaching the walls and killing many settlers. The Morgan's raiders arrive and liberate the fort, saving the lives of Montague and Nancy. A separate group of militia and Native Americans chase down and kill Butler, putting a stop to his plan. Montague believes in Holden's worth, and allows him and Nancy to be together. The film concludes with the surrender of General Cornwallis and the presidential inauguration of George Washington.

Griffith (holding rifle) during filming Casting Griffith used many popular movie actors at the time, but he felt that there was no need for them to play the roles in his films, and could not afford most of them anyway, after they began to consume nearly all of his money in expensive productions. As a result, Lillian Gish, who acted in a well known film of his, Orphans of the Storm, departed him after he could not pay any more for her services, and left him with Carol Dempster, who had far less appeal than Gish. She showed very little on-camera allure with Neil Hamilton, and only good with reaction scenes and had limited facial expressions. Filming During filming, a soldier's arm was blown off. As Charles Emmett Mack recalls, \\"Neil Hamilton and I went to neighboring towns and raised a fund for him‚ÄîI doing a song and dance and Neil collecting a coin.\\"  Reception  Box office America did not receive as large an audience as Griffith's previous films did. It is possible that the director had trouble differentiating between the colonists and British, since they both held origins to Great Britain. The audience is not clearly shown who are the antagonists and the protagonists. In addition, the movie's time frame was not rational. The film's time period made for a very long romance for Nancy and Holden before they could actually be together, since the first scenes were in 1775, but concluded in 1789. Its failure was perplexing, despite heavy promotion, considering Griffith spent over a million dollars on the production.  Criticism  The film's climax was very original and thrilling, as in most other Griffith films, complete with action and exciting stunts in the rescue scenes. However, film critics described the motion picture as lacking in modernity of the time. The movie was unlike the other films of the time, at its original release.http://www.afilmcanon.com/journal/2007/4/1/griffith-america-1924.html The story did not quite fit together as a whole and the order of which scenes were presented in was very confusing to follow, but was rather effective in individual scenes. The usage of title captions was also criticized. There would be a block of text explaining motifs and character relationships rather than having the characters display them through their acting, which is not made clear on screen. The film was not completely useless to Griffith, but he was still in debt with massive amounts of money and did not receive that boost of attention he was hoping for.

It was created in Paris in 1841. Since January 2014, Leduc is part of the British Music Sales Group. History 1914 advertisement by Alphonse Leduc of Paris for mandolin music by Jules Cottin, R. Talamo, and Ferdinando de Cristofaro. From Philip J. Bone's book, The Guitar and Mandolin. √âditions Alphonse Leduc is a family business that has been passed down from father to son over five generations. The family is originally from Arnay-le-Duc, in the Burgundy region of France. The family musical origins began in Arnay-le-Duc in Burgundy and its first musician, Antoine Girard. Girard was a violinist who left his father's weaving shop to turn his attention to art. His son Charles Girard, who was born in Arnay-le-Duc in 1754, moved to Nantes and was the first full-time musician. The Girards were a large family and its Nantes branch added Leduc to its name, taken from its place of origin Arnay-le-Duc. From then on all of the Girards of this branch were known as Girard-Leduc, and often, for the sake of simplification in business, just Leduc. Alphonse Leduc Alphonse Leduc, teacher, composer, student and flute, guitar and bassoon pupil of Anton Reicha in Paris, was born in Nantes in 1804 and died in Paris in 1868. He transferred his publishing house from Nantes to Paris in 1841. His son, Alphonse-Charles Leduc (Paris 1844-1892), created the important instrumental teaching collections which became the company's specialty and have been constantly expanded ever since. Alphonse-Charles's son, Alphonse √âmile Leduc (1878‚Äì1951), continued the teaching collections, developed the company's school auditions and published several important symphonic composers. His sons, Claude-Alphonse (1910‚Äì1995) and Gilbert Leduc (1911‚Äì1985), who entered the business in 1928, managed and further expanded √âditions A. Leduc from 1951 to 1985.  Absorbed companies  √âditions Alphonse Leduc have absorbed a number of publishing companies during their existence, in recent years B.G., Bornemann, C.Y., Gras, Hamelle, Heugel, Hortensia, King, Notissimo and Ouvri√®res . They are exclusive agents in France for: Anton J. Benjamin (hire), Carl Fischer Music (hire), Dilia (hire), Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo (sales), E.P.T.C.

(sales) and Suvini-Zerboni (sales) and non-exclusive worldwide for U.M.P. (sales)(except U.K. and U.S.A.). Through Diffusion BIM, Alphonse Leduc also distributes internationally the brass music of all publishers worldwide. Alphonse Leduc and its subsidiary company Heugel have taken control of the well-known American music publishing and distribution company King Music, thus becoming a group of international scope. Heugel The history of the publishing house Heugel dates back to 1839 when Jacques L√©opold Heugel became the associate of the music publisher Jean-Antoine Meissonnier. They acquired a periodical, Le M√©nestrel, which had been founded in 1833 and was issued until 1940. Their association ended in 1842 when Heugel took over sole control. L√©opold Heugel was succeeded on his death in 1883 by his son Henri, since when the company remained in the family until it was bought by Leduc in 1980. The Heugel catalogue includes all musical genres, both French and international, in particular opera and operetta (Jules Massenet, Ambroise Thomas, Marc- Antoine Charpentier, √âdouard Lalo, L√©o Delibes, Jacques Offenbach, etc.). Since 1920 Heugel has published much modern music, including that of Reynaldo Hahn, Joseph Canteloube, Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Andr√© Jolivet, and, closer to us, Pierre Boulez, Henri Dutilleux, Betsy Jolas, Gilbert Amy. Le Pupitre, a collection of early music, was started in 1967 under the general editorship of Fran√ßois Lesure; its critical editions are highly respected by musicologists all over the world.  Hamelle  Hamelle was founded in 1877 by Julien Hamelle who had taken over the catalogue of Maho, a company founded in 1851. Julien Hamelle directed the firm until his death in 1917, when he was succeeded by his son Georges-Edgard. The catalogue, acquired and now distributed by √âditions Leduc, includes an important collection of piano music. Hamelle also published works of √âdouard Lalo, Vincent d'Indy, Gabriel Piern√©, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Charles-Marie Widor, and in particular, those of Gabriel Faur√© (Requiem, √âl√©gie, Pavane, as well as the famous M√©lodies etc.)  Present day  The fifth generation is represented by Fran√ßois Leduc (Claude's son) and Basile Crichton (the nephew of Claude and Gilbert Leduc), who have been the managers of the company since 1985, assisted by their respective brothers, Jean Leduc et Michel Crichton.http://www.alphonseleduc.com/english/maison.htm Alphonse Leduc was acquired by the Music Sales Group in January 2014.

It was recorded for the label EMI. The instrumental album follows a day in the life of an Indian shepherd from Kashmir. It is one of the most successful Indian albums and one that became popular with an international audience. It was very important in introducing Indian music to Western ears and internationally the best selling Indian music record. George Harrison, David Crosby, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan and Roger McGuinn are fans of the album.DIMERY, Robert. 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Quintet Publishing Limited, London, 2005, page 126. The atmospheric music is traditional, but the innovative use of guitar and flute make the sound more acceptable for Western audiences. Kabra plays slide guitar, Sharma santoor, Chaurasia bansuri and Tabla was played by Manikrao Popatkar. The artists became well known musicians as a result of this album. Today Call of the Valley is considered a classic and a milestone in world music. Shivkumar Sharma, the guitarist Brij Bhushan Kabra, and flutist Hariprasad Chaurasia were all aged about 30 when they made Call of the Valley. Conceived as a suite, they used their instruments to tell the story of a day in the life of a shepherd in Kashmir using ragas associated with various times of the day to advance the dramatic narrative.

Anderson (1909‚Äì1977), was a journalist in the UK. Born Lore Seligmann on 13 May 1909 to a German Jewish family, she joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) while a student in Frankfurt in 1927. She abandoned the KPD two years later over its sectarian attacks on the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), and subsequently joined a small left-wing SPD fraction, the Leninist Organisation, later known as Neu Beginnen. After Adolf Hitler‚Äôs rise to power in 1933, she left Germany for Great Britain, where she and her husband Paul Anderson (1908‚Äì1972) became members of the small group of socialist exiles from Nazi Germany in Britain that included Julius Braunthal and Franz Borkenau. Her long article \\"The Underground Struggle in Germany\\", published under the pseudonym Evelyn Lend, occupied nearly the whole of an issue of Fact, edited by Raymond Postgate, in 1938. She revisited the subject in Hammer or Anvil?: the Story of the German Working Class Movement, which George Orwell‚Äôs wife Eileen helped to edit and Orwell reviewed in the Manchester Evening News. The couple worked for British black propaganda radio station, Sender der Europ√§ischen Revolution which broadcast news and anti-Nazi propaganda to Germany between 1940 and 1942. She joined the left-wing weekly, newspaper Tribune in 1943 as assistant editor, covering foreign affairs. She became a close friend of Orwell when he joined the paper later the same year, and her strong antipathy to communism played a major role in determining the paper‚Äôs political stance in the late 1940s, although she was considered obsessive about eastern Europe by some members of staff. She was joint editor of the Tribune from 1946 to 1952, sharing the job first with Jon Kimche and then with Michael Foot.

It has been in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1931. This and Art of Painting are his only works that fall under history painting in the contemporary hierarchy of genres, though they still have his typical composition of one or two figures in a domestic interior. Both share several features: the perspective is almost the same, and there is a multicolor tapestry at the left of each painting, pulled to the left to disclose the scene. The Art of Painting also uses symbolism from Cesare Ripa of Clio, muse of history. Vermeer's Love Letter uses a similar gilt panel. The Allegory and The Art of Painting differ markedly in style and purpose from Vermeer's other works. Description The painting depicts a woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests on the edge of a table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen.Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., editor, Johannes Vermeer, catalogue of an exhibition of the same name organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis, The Hague; pp 190‚Äì195, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995 Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone. Iconography Vermeer's Art of Painting From Cesare Ripa's Iconologia Vermeer's iconography in the painting is largely taken from Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, an emblem book (a collection of allegorical illustrations with accompanying morals or poems on a moral theme) which had been translated into Dutch in 1644 by D. P. Pers. The artist used various symbols that Ripa described and illustrated in his book, along with symbols taken from other books and traditions. Two of the four allegorical figures of Faith (\\"Fede. Geloof\\" and \\"Fede Catholica. Catholijck of algemeen Geloof\\") given in Ripa's book provide many of the symbols in the painting, including the color of the woman's clothing, her hand gesture, and the presence of the crushed snake and the apple. In his book, Ripa states that Faith is the most important of the virtues. One image in the book shows her as a woman, dressed in white (signifying light and purity) and blue (which relates to heaven, as Ripa states in another text). Faith's hand on her breast symbolizes that the virtue rests in her heart. Christ is represented in the cornerstone crushing the snake (a symbol of the Devil), and the apple (the fruit Eve gave to Adam) represents original sin, which in Christian doctrine required the sacrifice of the Saviour. Ripa describes Faith as \\"having the world under her feet\\", and Vermeer used the symbol quite literally, showing a globe of the earth under the woman's right foot. (The globe, with its distinctive cartouche (decorative label) has been identified as one made by Hendrick Hondius). From other sources The crucifix, painting of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put them on the table next to her. According to Arthur Wheelock, a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, this is \\"an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character not found in the text.\\" By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland, Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix \\"may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms\\", a very Catholic idea. Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass. The pose of the woman (hand on heart and eyes raised) is similar to Ripa's image of Theology. The pose was uncommon in Dutch art, but Vermeer was considered an expert in Italian painting, in which the image was often used (especially those of Guido Reni [1575‚Äì1642], whose works were then owned in Holland). Wheelock believes the large book, which has a metal clasp, is a Bible, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art states on its website that the volume may be the Catholic Missale Romanum. The painting's iconography is not only Catholic, but some believe it is strongly influenced by Jesuit ideas. Departing from Ripa's allusion to the story of Abraham and Isaac (an Old Testament story said to prefigure the faithful sacrifice of Christ on the Cross), Vermeer instead uses an image of the Crucifixion itself ‚Äî an image dear to the Jesuits. Vermeer used Crucifixion, a painting from about 1620 by Jacob Jordaens (1593‚Äì1678). The painter may have owned a copy of the painting. (This may be \\"the large painting representing Christ on the Cross\\" described in an inventory of his household at his death. Two other items in the inventory may be in this painting: the \\"gold-tooled leather on the wall\\" of his home's kitchen, and an \\"ebony wood crucifix\\"). Another Jesuit influence in the painting is said to be the glass orb on which the woman sets her eyes. According to Eddy De Johgh, Vermeer appears to have taken it from a 1636 emblem book by the Jesuit Willem Hesius, Emblemata sacra de fide, spe, charitate. In the emblem, \\"Capit Quod Non Capit\\", a winged boy, a symbol of the soul, is shown holding a sphere reflecting a nearby cross and the sun. In a poem accompanying the emblem, Hesius states that the sphere's ability to reflect the world is similar to the mind's ability to believe in God.Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., editor, Johannes Vermeer, catalogue of an exhibition of the same name organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis, p 192, citing Eddy de Jongh, \\"Pearls of Virtue and Pearls of Vice\\", Simiolus 8: 69‚Äì97, 1975/1976, The Hague; pp 190‚Äì195, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995 Selena Cant has written that the sphere is \\"symbol of the human mind and its capacity both to reflect and to contain infinity.\\" The woman's pearl necklace probably relates to pearls as ancient symbols of virginity, according to Cant. There is no source for the light on her dress, perhaps indicating that she is lit by an inner illumination ‚Äî a strong indication to the viewer that she is not to be considered an individual, but a symbol, according to Walter Liedtke. Reception Many art historians have considered the painting one of Vermeer's less successful works. Cant, for instance, calls it \\"harder, more brittle, less convincing. Faith herself appears uncomfortable: finely dressed, she appears too worldly to be a spiritual symbol, too solid to appear transported, the intimacy too forced and her expression too artificial.\\" According to Wheelock, \\"[T]he iconographic demands of this subject strained the credibility of his realistic approach. While essential for the painting's symbolic content, the ecstatic pose of the woman and the crushed snake seem incongruous within this Dutch setting.\\" Walter Liedtke objected to Wheelock's point by asserting that the artist took a very realistic approach primarily in depicting the terrestrial globe and reflections in the glass sphere. Instead, according to Liedtke, the painting is best compared to contemporary Dutch paintings illustrating abstract concepts, including Adriaen Hanneman's Allegory of the Peace (1664; still in situ at the Eerste Kamer in the Binnenhof), a histrionic picture showing how reticent Vermeer was in this work; and Karel Dujardin's Allegory of the Immortal Fame of Art Vanquishing Time and Envy (1675; Historisches Museum, Bamberg); Gabriel Metsu's The Triumph of Justice (late 1650s; Mauritshuis, The Hague); Adriaen van de Velde's The Annunciation (1667; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)as well as works by Van Honthorst and early works of De Lairesse. Provenance Vermeer's imaginative use of symbolism in the painting indicates to Wheelock that the painter was not given specific instructions on the allegory but chose the various items himself. The original owner is unknown but may have been a Catholic in Delft, possibly the Jesuits in the city. The Metropolitan Museum of Art website states, \\"This late work was surely commissioned, probably by a patron who was learned as well as devout.\\" The painting was one of those apparently not among the 21 works by the artist collection of Vermeer's main patron, Pieter Claesz van Ruijven (1624‚Äì1674), and auctioned off in the Dissius sale of 1696. Its first known owner was Herman Stoffelsz van Swoll (1632‚Äì1698), a postmaster and a Protestant. That Swoll was familiar with collecting art is indicated by the fact that the best man at his wedding in 1656 was a famous collector, Gerrit Reynst. The year after Swoll's death, in 1699, the painting was auctioned off in Amsterdam along with other works in Swoll's collection (which included Italian works). The sale catalogue described the work as \\"A sitting Woman with deep meanings, depicting the New Testament\\", and also stated, \\"powerfully and glowingly painted\\". After spending time in an unknown collection, the painting (described as \\"depicting the New Testament\\") was auctioned off in 1718, again in Amsterdam. It was auctioned again in 1735 (described as \\"artfully and minutely painted\\"), and in the Ietswaart sale of 1749 (described as \\"as good as Eglon van der Neer\\"). The mixed fortunes of Vermeer's reputation in the 18th century can be seen in the prices paid for the painting at these various auctions: f 400 in 1699; f500 in 1718; f53 in 1735; f70 in 1749). By the early 19th century the painting apparently had found its way to Austria, where it was depicted in the background of Portrait of a Cartographer and His Wife by Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller in 1824 (now in Westf√§lisches Landesmuseum, M√ºnster). Atlases depicted in this painting contain maps primarily of Vorarlberg and Tirol at the western end of Austria, so perhaps the painting was in that area, according to Wheelock. At the end of the century, the painting (at that time mistakenly attributed to Eglon van der Neer) was part of the collection of Ilya Ostroukhov (and later Dmitry Shchukin) in Moscow, making it the fourth Vermeer owned by Russians at that time. In 1899 it was put up for sale by a dealer, W√§chtler, in Berlin. That year Abraham Bredius bought it for about DM 700. A Dutch newspaper at the time praised Bredius for the purchase: \\"With this acquisition of the new Delft Vermeer, the New Testament, as an Eglon van der Neer, Dr. Bredius has once again found a bargain with his perspicacious eye.\\" Bredius then loaned the work to the Mauritshuis, where it remained for the next 24 years, until 1923 when Bredius gave it to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam for a long-term loan. Bredius disliked the work, calling it (in 1907) \\"a large but unpleasant Vermeer\\". In 1928, he sold it through the dealer Kleinberger to Michael Friedsam in New York, who bequeathed it in 1931 as part of the Friedsam Collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it has remained. Exhibitions The painting has been loaned by The Met to a number of exhibitions that included multiple Vermeers being brought together from different museums. Amongst these were: *‚ÄùVermeer.

The firm also produced light offroad vehicles and later heavy road vehicles. During its existence, the company produced over 350,000 vehicles.Din Rocar, fabrica ce a produs autobuze pentru toatƒÉ »õara, nu a mai rƒÉmas nici fierul vechi History Tudor Vladimirescu (T.V.) Works (), named after the revolutionary Tudor Vladimirescu, was created in 1951, and the first production lines were made for rolling-stock equipment and agricultural machinery. From the 1960s much of T.V.'s motor vehicle production was based on use of domestic parts like components and mechanicals sourced from other Romanian manufacturers like ARO, Brasov, DAC, and SR. In 1956, the first bus was built on a truck frame, and in 1957 the production program was enlarged also for trolleybuses, mini-buses and pick-ups made after T.V.'s own designs. Beginning with 1968, Rocar started exporting vehicles in Eastern Europe, Africa, South America and Middle East and, in 1971, it bought a license from MAN, Germany. In 1974, its name changed to √éntreprinderea \\"Autobuzul\\" (). During the 1980s, due to harsh economy and shortages, the quality of ROCAR (Autobuzul) products decreased a lot, only export vehicles were of better quality. ROCAR issued a lot of prototypes, but very few of them went into series production. Also, with few exceptions, Autobuzul/ROCAR vehicles were almost omnipresent in Romania in the domain of persons transport vehicles and light to medium weight charges, as imports were banned in Romania. This situation will change after 1990 with the fall of communism in Romania. Until the 1990s, \\"Autobuzul\\" made exports to Bulgaria, Hungary, Soviet Union (later Ukraine), East Germany, Madagascar, Benin, Burundi, Irak, Colombia, USA. After 1990, Rocar (as it became known from 1991) started a cooperation with the bodywork company De Simon from Italy. During the 1990s, ROCAR lost most of its customers (urban transport companies), mainly because of the old technology which led to low quality, low production capacity, and high prices ‚Äì therefore many of their former customers bought second-hand buses and trolleybuses from the west, causing ROCAR high losses around the turn of the millennium until 2002 when it went bankrupt. In an attempt at building market share they launched a low floor bus and low floor trolleybus in cooperation with Autodromo BusOTTO in the 1990s, named 812, but because of low production capacity leading to a high price, it proved unattractive. ROCAR lost many employees between 1990 and 2002, either retired or found another job (in RATB, Truck & Bus services, car service, etcetera). Between 1990 and 2002 very few exports were made, while domestic demand was also very low. However, in 1996 ROCAR signed a contract with RATB and Bucharest Local Council for buses, therefore over 300 buses Rocar De Simon U412 were delivered between 1996 and 2002, and also renewed some manufacturing technologies, but the number of built vehicles was still too low, however after the moment when RATB hurt ROCAR some years before, by acquiring new DAF busses and some second hand busses, and later new Ikarus IK415T for trolleybuses. Trolleybuses were not any more from ROCAR, however a few ROCAR trolleybuses were delivered to RATB, 14 trolleybuses. However, the contract with RATB and Bucharest local Council did not improved the deteriorating situation of ROCAR of the mid to late '90s, because other public transport companies( and other customers like The Army or Interurban Transport Operators) in Romania completely refused to buy its products (main reason stated by them being the low quality products, prices are too high, low availability due to low production capacities, outdated, and they were acquiring instead second hand vehicles mostly (except for The Army, which were buying GRIVBUS or other new vehicles). ROCAR was also affected by concurrence of two new Romanian manufacturers of busses, trolleybuses and light weight transport vehicles, the same profile of ROCAR: ASTRA BUS ARAD, a new Romanian bus and trolleybus manufacturer, under IRISBUS and Grivbus another new Romanian bus and light weight transport vehicles manufacturer. They took some of ROCAR's customers, like RATB, Army, and some public transport operators as these two newer manufacturers were using newer technologies, manufacturing more actual vehicles, and with a better quality, and a higher capacity of production and lower prices. In 2001‚Äì2002, ROCAR signed a contract with Constanta Council for 100 Buses and 40 trolleybuses, but only 15 trolleybuses were delivered, two of them in half assemble state. Few buses were delivered to Constanta but were having major manufacturing deficiencies, therefore they were returned However Constanta Council paid for the undelivered buses. Massive second bus hand imports from west which continued in Romania even after 2000, and also contracts with ex soviet manufacturer MAZ and some other manufacturers ( Irisbus, Isuzu, BMC) gradually sent ROCAR to lack of demand and finally to bankruptcy. Rocar, after 1990, also suffered from technology retard, using outdated technologies, manufacturing outdated products (some of them even 30 years !) in low capacity, and at high prices, thus leading ROCAR to huge losses and loss of employees. Although Rocar De Simon U412 was a fairly modern vehicle with EURO 2 engine and automatic transmission, and chopper in case of some trolleybuses it did not prove a very big success, as many other transport companies still preferred second hand buses/trolleybuses or other new buses/trolleybuses (MAN, Mercedes, MAZ, Ikarus, BMC), accentuating the deteriorating situation of ROCAR. Rocar De Simon (E/U 412) remained in production until the factory went bankrupt. As a last attempt in their struggle, ROCAR was courted by SOLARIS BUS, for a partnership to assemble URBINO busses from Poland as CKD, but eventually cooperation between ROCAR and SOLARIS BUS failed, only one vehicle is supposed to be built (other said that only the badge ROCAR was attached to it, the bus was in fact made in Poland). However, in the past, many other well known manufacturers (like Scania, Daf, Renault, Volvo, Mercedes, even MAZ (they wanted a partnership with ROCAR in mid to late 2000, just like the one with De Simon, to assemble busses as CKD delivered by MAZ, models 103, 104, 105,107 were proposed)) wanted to buy ROCAR or wanted partnership with ROCAR for assembling busses, trolleybuses and light commercial vans, but eventually gave up, and after 2000, no company showed no interest. In Romania, ROCAR was the only bus and trolleybus manufacturer and small commercial vehicle, until ASTRA BUS ARAD and GRIVBUS appeared on the market. Rocar officially stopped production in early 2002 as there was no more demand for their products (however, production was restarted in the summer of 2002, but very few vehicles were built), exports were down, many workers left because they were unpaid for months, and by the late 2002 production fully ended and ROCAR went into bankruptcy, however not before last vehicles were delivered to companies which acquired them. Debts were at a very high level as were the losses. In the early 2003, while ROCAR was in its last days of life they made some repairs and reconditioning to some old buses belonging to the army and some other bigger companies (like Dacia), however no new demands were registered, and losses increased. In late 2003 and early 2004, the company was liquidated and radiated from the registry of commerce, ending 52 years of bus manufacturing in Romania. Its precursors are from now on, Grivbus and Astra Bus Arad. Some half assembled vehicles were sold to (or taken by) some customers together with spare parts and assembled by the customer, some other unassembled vehicles were sold as spare parts to customers which had previously acquired ROCAR products. Spare parts remained into the factory were also taken by companies which were operating ROCAR vehicles, probably as a debt, or by companies which were selling spare parts. It is rumored that some of these were sold by liquidators in order to recover some losses. Other old type vehicles remained unassembled in the factory were scrapped as they had no value, however many of their former customers were, by now, affording new modern vehicles. ROCAR also had a football team called Rocar Football Team, and had a football terrain and stadium. Also it had a high school, today named Grigore Cerchez. Product line City buses Roman 112U in Sighi»ôoara DAC 112UDM in T√¢rgu Jiu DAC 117UD in Pite»ôti Rocar De Simon U412 in Bucharest Rocar U812 Autodromo * M.T.D. ‚Äì Also called Mao Tze Dun, is the first bus manufactured between 1955 and 1958. It was first built at Vulcan Works in cooperation with URAC ITB, and then the production was moved to Rocar. It was mounted on a SR 201 truck chassis, and equipped with a SR101 engine ( or ZIS120), 90 HP. 8 metres long, 85 passengers. * T.V. 1 ‚Äì built from 1959 to 1960 on the chassis of a SR101 truck. One of the first buses from ROCAR (Autobuzul). It had a capacity of 86+1 passengers . Equipped with a 5.5 liters engine and 95 Hp gas engine from SR101. It was about 10 metres long. Top speed :60 km/h * T.V. 2 ‚Äì based on the SR101 truck chassis, but with a more modern architecture, with the engine mounted on the rear. Built between 1960 and 1968. Until 1962 it was equipped with the SR101 engine of 95 hp, but later was equipped with the SR114 engine of 140 hp. Top speed : 65 km/h respectively 80 km/h. 87 passengers capacity, 10 metres long. It was available in urban version ( TV 2 U), interurban version ( TV 2 R), and trolleybus version TV 2 E. In the 1970s, some of these buses were converted to diesel, using a SAVIEM D797-05 engine, or surviving models in the 1980s were converted to methane gas powered vehicles. Some higher comfort coach versions were equipped with 4 round headlights. * T.V. 7/71 R (Midibus) ‚Äì A mid sized bus, 7 metres long and about 29+30 passengers, built in 1964-67 (T.V. 7), and 1967‚Äì73 (T.V. 71R). Designed for interurban operations, or mountain routes. Equipped with a SR 113/114 gas engine. Top speed : 70 km/h. TV71 R is a slightly modernised variant in 1967. * T.V. 20 U/R (Urban/Rutier) ‚Äì A bus manufactured between 1968 and 1975. It is mainly identical with its predecessor, TV 2. Built in Urban, interurban and trolleybus version. 10 metres long, 90+1 passengers. Bus versions were equipped with SR114 gas engine, 140 hp. In the 1970s, some of these buses were converted to diesel, with D797-05 SAVIEM engine. Some other models, were converted to operate on methane GAS in the late 1970s early 1980s on surviving models. Top speed : 75 km/h. It was replaced in ROCAR's line up in 1974 with much more modern MAN based buses. * Roman Diesel A8 (1974‚Äì78), A-83 (1983‚Äì87) * Roman 109 RDM (1976‚Äì78) ‚Äì is a mid size coach, equipped with a Saviem D797-05 engine. It has a capacity of 37 passengers. 9 metres long * Roman 108 RD ‚Äì Midsize coach, based on 109 RDM. 7,8 metres long. 37 passengers . Available with 4x2 and 4x4 transmission. * Roman 112 UD ‚Äì the predecessor of DAC U112, with mainly the same technical specifications as its successor. It was manufactured under MAN Metrobus (de) licence. No articulated version. It was produced between 1974 and 1980, and operated by many transport companies in Romania. * DAC U112 UDM ‚Äì 27+78+1 passengers; independent suspension; engine: D 2156 HM 81 U ‚Äì 192 HP between the axles; mechanical gear box, 4 + 1 gears or 6+1 gears; top speed: 71 km/h; Also available with turbo charged 240 HP engine. * DAC U117 UD (articulated city bus) ‚Äì 42+102+1 passengers; engine options: D 2156 HM 81 U ‚Äì 192 HP / D 2156 MT 81 U ‚Äì 240 HP; mechanical gear box, 4 + 1 gears or 6+1 gears; top speed: 71 km/h * ROCAR 211 UD and 211 R ‚Äì Probably a partially low floor vehicle from ROCAR ( only front and mid door were low floor) manufactured between probably late 1980s and early 1990s. Built in very few exemplars, probably 2, served in RATB for a short time as test vehicles. It was equipped with D2156HMU TURBO 240 HP engine, and a number of 86+24+1 passengers. Engine placed in the rear. Also called PELICAN. 211R version probably equipped with import engines. In the presenting flyers it was also shown with A/C unit. Probably did not entered mass production due to low capacity of ROCAR, lack of investments and researching, but also probably due to low demand and lack of interest from other possible customers. One has the older sign of ROCAR while it was named Autobuzul ( a T included in a V, TV from Tudor Vladimirescu)suggesting it was made somewhere in the 1980s or very early 1990s and the other had the name ROCAR on its front, suggesting it was made after 1993. * U312 ‚Äì 25+78+1 passengers; rigid front axle; engine: RABA D 10 UTS ‚Äì 245 HP ‚Äì Euro 2 between the axles; automatic transmission, Voith DIWA D863.1, 3 + 1 gears; top speed: 67 km/h.

However, some models were also delivered with manual transmission. * Rocar U512 ‚Äì a single vehicle was seen ( and probably the only built) and sold to a particular ( unknown if more than one were built). It was powered by a man engine, identical to Rocar 412, but 230 hp, according to front badge. Unknown whether it was equipped with manual or automatic transmission. It was probably a prototype, however it resembles closely a De Simon. Painted in yellow and white. The rest of the bodies were used probably for E512 trolleybus counterpart. Totally 10 \\"512 type\\" ROCAR's are known to be built, 1 bus and 9 trolleybuses * Rocar 612U ‚Äì Only one vehicle built, with Mercedes Benz motor. * Rocar Solaris Urbino (Rocar 712) ‚Äì Romanian version of Solaris Urbino that was to be assembled by ROCAR; it is rumoured that Urbino series was going to be coded by ROCAR as 712 series. The buses were to be sent as CKD kits from Poland, and assembled by ROCAR, to be used as bus and trolleybus, but cooperation eventually failed shortly before ROCAR went bankrupt. Only one vehicle named ROCAR SOLARIS URBINO ever existed but unknown whether it was assembled by ROCAR or assembled in Poland and only badged ROCAR. It is rumored that this series was to be named 712, in ROCAR code. Series that never entered into series or mass production, as ROCAR went bankrupt. * Rocar U812 ‚Äì built under licence from BusOtto Autodromo. It was the only low floor bus made by Rocar which entered in regular service. Only one was built, number in RATB #98. It was built in 1998. It was not assembled in series, probably due to low capacity, high costs and lack of interest from potential customers (public transport companies mainly). It is Equipped with MAN engine D 0826 LUH 13 ‚Äì 260 HP ‚Äì Euro 2 found on De Simon U260, located in rear. Transmission is Voith DIWA D851.2, 3 + 1 gears, automatic. 25+82+1 places, 108 passengers totally . Still in use at RATB, along with Mercedes Citaro. Painted in red. This bus was presented at SAB ( Automobile show of Bucharest) in 1998. It was also built as trolleybus. Intercity buses & coaches * Roman/Rocar 111/112 RD/RDT (MAN Metrobus licence) ‚Äì 43+(27 for I 111)+1 seats; engine options: D 2156 HM 81 U ‚Äì 192 HP (I 111 only) / D 2156 MT 85 U ‚Äì 240 HP / D 2156 MTN 8 ‚Äì 256 HP; mechanical gear box, 5 + 1 gears; top speed: 110 km/h * Rocar 311 ‚Äì powered by homemade and foreign-made engines ‚Äì Euro 1 & 2; 43+1 seats; engine: Mercedes- Benz OM 442 A ‚Äì 340 HP; mechanical gear box, 6 + 1 gears; top speed: 110 km/h Trolleybuses Rocar DAC 217 E trolleybus in Cluj-Napoca Rocar 412E trolleybus in Piatra Neam»õ Rocar 812E low floor trolleybus in Bucharest * T12 (1955‚Äì58) ‚Äì reconstructed version of old trolleybuses. * T.V. 2E; T.V. 20E ‚Äì Mainly the same vehicle, however different in appearance. Built between 1958 and 1968 ( TV 2E) and 1968 and 1975 (TV20E). Were replaced starting in 1974 by more modern MAN based vehicles. Their technical specifications are mainly the same, but they are different in the exterior aspect. Both were 10 metres long, 87+1(T.V. 2E) passengers or 90+1(T.V. 20E) passengers capacity including the driver, 2 doors, and a 75 kW motor; top speed was 40‚Äì45 km/h. Last vehicles T.V. 20E were also built with an 85 kW motor, speed increased to 50‚Äì55 km/h. However they were modified in some cities where they were operated in parallel with DAC 112 E ROMANIA, with 125 Kw motors . It was not equipped with pneumatic suspension, it was instead equipped with leaf springs and 2 rigid axles ( however it was built on a truck chassis). The compressor was working intermittently, not continuous, as it was used solely for braking and door actuating. 15 articulated versions of this trolleybus (T.V. 2E based) were also built in 1964 (presumably by URAC- ITB) and rarely operated until 1967 by ITB but withdrawn from service, probably because of some deficiencies, high costs of manufacturing and low production capacities. Named T.V. 2E-A, 15 metres long. About 120 passengers capacity . T.V. 2E and 20E were withdrawn from operation between 1975 and 1982, however in some cities, they continued to be used as service or driver school vehicles until early to mid 1980s. * DAC 112 E ROMANIA ‚Äì sometimes mistakenly called ROMAN 112E, was a trolleybus based on ROMAN 112UD body. Same technical specifications as Rocar DAC 212E. ROMAN 112 E name is used to differentiate it from classical DAC 112 E. Manufactured between 1975 and 1982. No articulated version. Operated in the past in : Constanta, Bucuresti, Brasov, Cluj, Timi»ôoara, Cities with trolleybus system before 1980. They were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s and during 1990s. Built with TN76 125 kW motor, but also with a lower power version of this motor, producing 110 kW, probably economical versions. * DAC 112 E ‚Äì Trolleybus version of DAC 112 bus; Different body from DAC 112 E ROMANIA. Same specifications as DAC 212, however, DAC 112E was one of the first models, usually low height. It was available both with TN76 125 kW and TN81 150 kW motor, but also a 110 kW economical version was available. Pneumatic suspension. DAC 112 E were built in fewer exemplars than DAC 117 E which had a higher demand. Some 117E were transformed in 112 E. Some of these busses were having a contact and relays big box behind the driver, but these models were rare, however causing crowding between passengers. Top speed: 60 km/h. As a result of the harsh economy in the period it was manufactured, some of these models were not fitted with power steering, although originally designed to have power steering. Some of them were retrofitted with power steering after 1990. * DAC 117 E/EA ‚Äì Articulated, 17 m version of DAC 112E. First models were equipped with TN76 125 kW motor, but also TN81 150 kW versions existed. No 110 kW motor fitted. Many of them were low height. 36+112+1 passengers. Pneumatic suspension Some of them were later fitted with electronic choppers. Some of them were fitted with 180 KW motors, but these were modified at the owning garage, the motor being imported. Slightly lower number of passengers, because many of these vehicles were having a big contacts and relays box inside the saloon behind the driver. This is one of the particularities of DAC 117 which makes it easy identifiable. However, this big contact and relays box was also specific to some DAC 217, but to a lower extent. Top speed : 55‚Äì60 km/h. As a result of the harsh economy in the period it was manufactured, some of these models were not fitted with power steering, although originally designed to have power steering. Some of them were retrofitted with power steering after 1990. * DAC 122E or 123E ‚Äì Double articulated trolleybus based on DAC 117E. It could transport more than 170 passengers. To be mentioned that this vehicle was built by URAC RATB ITB, not by ROCAR ( ex Autobuzul)! It was built by adding another section between the first and the last section of the vehicle. It was a prototype, but was operated by ITB ( later RATB) under the number #7091. However, take into account that the name DAC 122 or 123E is not official, it is simply derived from DAC 117 ( 17 metres versions) and DAC 122/123 was 22 or 23 metres long ! It was built in the early 1980s and operated until late 1990s even early 2000. Only one was built although some more were to be built, but the project was abandoned due to the multitude of disadvantages of this vehicle ( difficult to be driven, low power of the motor ‚Äì the TN76 125 kW from early 117E, low speed) and higher costs, its only main advantages being high number of passengers to be transported. * 212E ‚Äì (single trolleybus with logical control unit) ‚Äì 28+64+1 passengers; motor: TN 76 ‚Äì 125 kW; top speed: 60 km/h. Versions with TN81 150 kW motor also existed. * 217E ‚Äì (articulated trolleybus) ‚Äì 39+117+1 passengers; motor: TN 81 ‚Äì 150 kW; top speed: 60 km/h. Similar in appearance with DAC 117, but it was taller. Also available with chopper. * 312E ‚Äì single trolleybus with chopper); 26+69+1 passengers; motor: TN 76 ‚Äì 125 kW; top speed: 60 km/h. Used in: Cluj, Iasi (1 vehicle numbered 512), Bucharest (2 vehicles 7447 and 7448), Timi»ôoara. * Rocar 317EC ‚Äì It is not the articulated version of ROCAR 312 E as many will suppose, it is in fact very similar in appearance with DAC 117E and 217E, but it is a taller model like 217. It is equipped with 150 kW engine TN96 and, usually, chopper and thyristors. Has the same number of passengers as 117 and 217. Many went to export, however, a few were used in Romania. Built after 1990 usually. Top speed : 60 km/h. It can be identified as having a slightly thicker second pillar on the left side near by the driver on the saloon side and the second thicker pillar after the articulation. * DAC 318ET ‚Äì A trolleybus with 2 motors TN 76 ‚Äì 125 kW and 2 motor axles, one behind and one in the front of the articulation. Only built as prototype. 18 metres long, 200 passengers. Top speed 60 km/h. * 412E (single trolleybus with chopper, traction motor located in overhang) ‚Äì 25+68+1 passengers; motor: TN 96R ‚Äì 150 kW; top speed: 60 km/h. Also available with AC traction system, with a three phase 155 KW motor, only one built. Used in: Bucharest (7454 and 7459 with AC traction system), Constanta (15 vehicles), Cluj (2 vehicles), Piatra Neamt (brought from Constanta 5 vehicles). Models from Constanta were in fact equipped with rheostatic controller and adapted for 825 V operation. * 512E ‚Äì single trolleybus with chopper, traction motor located in overhang; 20+68+1 passengers; motor: TN 76 ‚Äì 125 kW; top speed: 60 km/h. Used only in Bucharest. Not any more in use. Numbered 7449-7453 and 7455-7458. Only 9 vehicles built. There was also a single U512 Bus. * Rocar 812E ‚Äì Low floor trolleybus, made in 1998. It was the only low floor trolleybus from Rocar to enter in regular service. It belongs to RATB and it is numbered #7460. Like U812, its bus counterpart, it was made under BusOtto Autodromo licence.

He was the first Bishop of Syracuse, New York (1887‚Äì1912). Biography Patrick Ludden was born in Breaffy, near Castlebar, County Mayo, to Anthony and Ellen (n√©e Fitzgerald) Ludden. He graduated from St. Jarlath's College in Tuam in 1861 and then immigrated to North America, where he entered the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. After completing his theological studies, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Ignace Bourget on May 21, 1864. He was attached to the Diocese of Albany in New York, and there served as rector of St. Joseph's Church in Malone. He was shortly afterwards named chancellor of the diocese, and accompanied Bishop John J. Conroy as his theologian to the First Vatican Council. In 1872 he became rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and vicar general of the diocese. He was named rector of St. Peter's Church in Troy in 1880. On December 14, 1886, Ludden was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Syracuse by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on May 1, 1887 from Archbishop Michael Corrigan, with Bishops Bernard John McQuaid and Francis McNeirny serving as co-consecrators. During his 25-year-long tenure, he presided over a period of great growth in the young diocese. At the time of Ludden's arrival, the diocese contained 70,000 Catholics, 74 priests, 46 parishes, 20 mission churches, and 16 parochial schools. By the time of his death, there were over 150,000 Catholics, 129 priests, 80 parishes, 36 mission churches, and 21 parochial schools. He selected St. Mary's Church as his new cathedral in 1903, and dedicated it in September 1910. In 1911 he gained a degree of notoriety when he declared that the deadlock in the New York Legislature over the election of William F. Sheehan to the United States Senate was due to anti- Catholicism. Sheehan was later defeated. Bishop Ludden died at his residence in Syracuse, New York, aged 74. He is buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Syracuse. Bishop Ludden Junior/Senior High School is named after him.

APT argues that using systematic testing enables companies to measure the true incremental impact of any new initiative. Its \\"core value proposition is helping clients innovate more effectively through trial and error.\\" History APT was founded in 1999 by business consulting executives Jim Manzi (Oliver Wyman), Anthony Bruce (McKinsey & Company), and Scott Setrakian (Oliver Wyman).

APT's approach follows a larger business trend, evidence-based management, in which the scientific method is applied to business decision making. APT's software automates the cycle described by the Harvard Business Review: * Create a hypothesis * Design a test to gather information about the hypothesis * Execute the test * Analyze the test to determine how successful it was and what factors explain performance differences * Plan the rollout based on the analysis of the test APT's software has been noted for its emphasis on ease of use in test design and analysis and also for its ability to present both a high-level summary of a test and deep analysis of the specific attributes that affect performance in the test. APT differentiates itself from competitors by offering a unique approach, emphasizing conducting tests to gather data instead of simply simulating it. In February 2011, APT was awarded a patent that protects its core analytic technology for designing an in-market test and on matching test stores to control stores. Products The firm provides its products as web applications Its current products include . * Test and Learn for Sites (its flagship product, focused on analyzing remodelings, sales promotions, pricing strategies, and other changes made at the store level), * Test and Learn for Customers (focused on analyzing direct marketing and other customer offers), * Network Planner, * Market Basket Analyzer, * Merchandise Optimization, * Menu Optimization, * Category Management Insights, * Test and Learn for Ads.

Gorlaeus was born in Antwerp as the son of Jacob Godevaertsz van Ghoorle and Willemken Heijmolen, but fled as a teenager with his brother David to the Dutch Republic. He lived in Utrecht and already in 1570 held an influential position under the employment of stadtholder Adolf van Nieuwenaar. He married Susanna Patersson, with whom he had three children in the 1580s. In 1595 he moved to Delft where he remained until his death on 11 October 1608 and where he was buried in the Oude Kerk.

After two years at Erfurt he went to the School of Horticulture in Potsdam, graduating in Botanics, and then became head gardener at the Botanical Garden of Poppelsdorf near Bonn. In 1867 he went to the Paris World Exposition and settled there, working first as a labourer and then as head gardener in the Tuileries Garden. As the Franco-Prussian War approached, the increasingly tense atmosphere in Paris forced Winter to move south via Marseilles and Cannes to Hy√®res in the C√¥te d'Azur, where he worked as a plant illustrator for Charles Huber Freres & Co, a prominent nursery and principal source of novelty plants during that period.'Die neuen Pflanzen von Ch. Huber Freres & Co. in Hyeres', by D. J. Mabberley 1985 In 1869, Thomas Hanbury began work on his botanical gardens at Mortola and engaged Winter as a botanist. He devoted himself to this garden for five years, importing a wide variety of plants from Australia, New Zealand and California and acclimatising them to Liguria. When the work at Mortola was complete in 1874, Winter moved to Bordighera from where he designed and collaborated on many gardens, parks and nurseries on the Ligurian Riviera and the Costa Azzurra, as well as introducing and breeding roses, acacias and other flowers. In 1875, he created an experimental nursery at Vallone del Sasso, where he brought a wealth of rare tropical plants including palms, lianas and ficus. He designed beautiful gardens, such as those for the Empress Eugenie at Cap Martin, Prince Hohenlohe in San Remo, the Countess Foucher de Careil in Mentone, Villa Zirio in San Remo, Villa Bischoffsheim in Bordighera and Borgo Storico Seghetti Panichi in Ascoli Piceno.

Plot summary The book takes place inside the tower of Babel in to which humanity took refuge 1,000 years ago, as so to take protection from a cloud that poisoned the earth. The group of humans entered the tower in five separate groups, each also separated their area of the tower off as so to prevent possible diseased persons entering. The plot begins in the highest most portion of the tower when the main character's father gives him a cat who he says can speak; the opposition leader who is also the main character's father is assassinated whilst attending an Opera. The boy (Liram) then flees and is told by an acquaintance of his father that he must delve into the lower reaches of the tower; taking his cat with him, Liram descends alone. On the next floor, he awakes in a hospital and they recognise him as not being a member of their society; their belief of staying clean requires the shaving of one's hair, and after a medical inspection, a barber comes to shave his hair. The barber had discovered several years before, a baby girl with a pentagonal tattoo on her left shoulder. The barber notices that after shaving the hair on the boy's head; that he also has a similar tattoo. The barber introduces the boy to the girl (Ma√Øan) whom he discovered as a baby; and they inform him that he is a clef de Babel (a key of Babel), that there are five in total and that each of them has a specific power, Ma√Øan is able to walk through objects and walls, Ma√Øan then explains of a disc she saw in a temple which had a marking on that was very similar to their tattoos. They agree to steal the object, which they do. The monks discover who stole it and set out to hunt down and kill the culprits, thus forcing Ma√Øan and Liram to venture further down the tower.

Greetham was a tall, fair-haired right- handed batsman usually used in Somerset's late middle order and a right-arm seam bowler who, for a couple of seasons in the early 1960s, took enough wickets to be classed as an all-rounder. He was considered a good cover fielder, with a strong and accurate throw. Career He first played for Somerset in 1957 and became a regular player in 1959, when he hit 881 runs in the season and made his highest first-class score, an unbeaten 151 in the match against the Combined Services. One week after this innings, he made a second century, 104, including three sixes and 12 fours, against somewhat more demanding opposition in the match against Derbyshire. The innings, said Wisden, \\"revealed he could be relied upon when quick scoring was needed\\". The following two seasons, 1960 and 1961, saw Greetham make useful innings and take useful wickets, but he did not advance on his 1959 figures, making around 800 runs in each season and failing to score a century in either. In 1962, however, he made 1,000 runs for the first time in a season, finishing with 1151 at an average of 26.76 runs per innings, and taking 69 first-class wickets at an average of 20.91. There were no centuries in this season, but his seven for 56 against Glamorgan were the best innings bowling figures of his career, and when he took six for 19 and four for 29 against Lancashire late in the season he achieved 10 wickets in a match for the only time in his first-class career. Wisden was complimentary about Greetham's progress in 1962: \\"Greetham, previously a useful middle order batsman, developed into an extremely competent all-rounder,\\" it wrote. \\"A naturally aggressive right- hander, he scored over 1,000 runs for the first time and, bowling at a lively pace, took more wickets during the season than in his previous four years with the county.\\" Greetham was awarded his county cap in 1962. The 1963 season saw Somerset finish third in the County Championship, equalling the highest placing in its history to that point. Greetham was one of six players to pass 1,000 runs for the season, and his final aggregate of 1186 was his best for a single season, with the average of 28.23 runs per innings the highest of his career. Against Leicestershire at Weston-super-Mare, on a wet pitch, he made 141 in three hours; eight Somerset wickets had fallen for 145 when Greetham was joined by Harold Stephenson, the Somerset captain, and the pair put on 183 for the ninth wicket in 105 minutes. The stand remains the ninth wicket record for Somerset: it was equalled, but not surpassed, in 1990 by Chris Tavare and Neil Mallender. With the recruitment of fast bowler Fred Rumsey to Somerset in 1963, there was less bowling for Greetham, but he still took 44 wickets. Greetham was one of several Somerset batsmen for whom the 1964 season saw a regression. Unlike Peter Wight and Brian Roe, who suffered similar declines, he retained his place for most matches, but his aggregate of runs dropped by more than half to just 504, there was only one score of more than 50, and his average fell too to just 15. His bowling offered no consolation, and his wickets fell to just 17 and the average rose to more than 40 runs per wicket. There was a small improvement in batting in 1965, when he made 943 runs in all matches at an average of 21.93. The total included centuries in both the home and away matches against Middlesex. Wisden commented in its reports on both matches about the speed of Greetham's scoring and the power of his strokes, and later in the season noted \\"a remarkable innings\\" against Cambridge University in which Greetham, arriving at the wicket with 45 minutes of the first day to play, reached 73 not out by close of play (he went on to 93). But Greetham's bowling had disappeared almost entirely by this stage: in 28 County Championship matches in 1965, he bowled only six overs and took no wickets, and his only two wickets of the whole season came in the match against Cambridge University. The 1966 season was, like 1963, a successful one for Somerset, but this time Greetham played almost no part. Dropped after two matches in which he made only 26 runs, he did not regain his place except for one match against Cambridge University, in which he again took two wickets, but again failed with the bat. This was his last first-class match. Greetham \\"would have been made for one-day cricket\\", says one modern directory of Somerset cricketers. In fact, his record in the 10 Gillette Cup matches he played for Somerset between 1963 and 1966 was modest, with 150 runs in 10 innings and just three wickets. He did, however, retain his place in Somerset's one-day side longer than in the first-class team: his last first- team appearance was in the Gillette semi-final defeat by Warwickshire in August 1966. This was not, however, his final List A appearance.

It has served the rural parish, northwest of Shoreham-by-Sea and next to the River Adur, since the 11th century. Despite several re-buildings, some structural elements remain from that period. An important series of wall paintings, dating from the 12th to the 18th century, were uncovered in 1949. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. History The parish of Coombes existed, with the name Cumbe, at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, when it supported two manors and their associated settlements. Coombes was the larger at the time but neither it nor Applesham (the other hamlet) was significant. The settlements, high on the South Downs above the River Adur's floodplain, may have had their origins in a pair of Saxon-era estates. The Domeday Book recorded 31 people in Coombes and a further 16 in Applesham. Coombes parish church, whose original dedication has now been lost (although it has been attributed to John the Baptist), existed at the time of the Domesday Book. At that time it was a simple flint building in three parts: chancel, nave and a tower at the west end. It was built so far into the rising land of the hillside that the base of the west window was just above the ground. The building was added to and altered several times over the next few centuries in a manner that Ian Nairn described as a \\"century-by- century accretion of piety\\". Most of the nave, its south doorway and the chancel arch are Saxon but the chancel was rebuilt in the early 13th century and a priest's doorway was added. In the 14th century the nave windows were altered, but one 12th-century window survives in good condition. In the 15th century two new windows were added to the chancel, flanking surviving a Norman door. A porch was built on the south side of the nave in the 16th century, incorporating the original entrance doorway into the nave. The church suffered a near-total collapse in the early 18th century: the tower at the west end fell down, bringing most of the nave and chancel down with it. The congregation was allowed to rebuild the nave itself (shortening it in the process) and the chancel was rebuilt soon afterwards. Around the same time a tile-hung bell-turret was added at the west end. The church, unlike many in Sussex, was not restored or reconfigured during the Victorian era. Wall paintings The church is most noted for its extensive wall paintings. Most of the surviving designs date from the 12th century ‚Äî the oldest were produced in about 1135 ‚Äî but some are more recent. They were discovered in 1949 and preserved with minimal restoration, unlike many similar examples elsewhere. Designs include The Visitation, the Nativity of Jesus, Christ in Majesty and Christ delivering the Keys of Heaven to Saint Peter and the Book to Saint Paul. On the soffit beneath the chancel arch is a humorous sketch: a man with a gaping mouth grimaces as he strains to hold up the arch. An example of one of the wall paintings in the church One theory is that these early paintings are part of a series painted at churches by monks from Lewes Priory, England's first Cluniac house. Others survive at the churches in Clayton, Hardham and Plumpton. Architecture and fittings Tapsel gate Coombes parish church is a simple building of two parts: the chancel at the east end and the nave to the west, linked by chancel arch thick. A porch, incorporating the entrance door, faces south. The former west tower has been replaced by a small bell-turret at the west end of the roof. Flint rubble masonry, relieved by some dressings of ashlar, forms the walls. The roof is of Horsham Stone slates, in common with many historic Sussex buildings. Only one Norman window remains in its original condition, but several others are blocked up. The windows on the south side of the chancel are in the Perpendicular Gothic, while the 16th-century east window and 1724 west window are simpler. The churchyard is one of very few to have a tapsel gate ‚Äî a centrally pivoted gate unique to Sussex. An ancient crucifix was found in the churchyard in 1877, when it was moved into the church. The age of the brick and stone font is not known. It may be 19th century but other sources propose more ancient origins. The church today Coombes Church was listed Grade I by English Heritage on 12 October 1954. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and great national importance. As of February 2001 it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings and 119 listed buildings of all grades in Adur District.

They disappeared at the end of the Oligocene, leaving no survivors today.PaleoBiology Database: Anoplotheriidae, basic info Its name is derived from the (\\"unarmed\\") and Œ∏ŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ (\\"beast\\"), translating as \\"unarmed beast\\". They were most likely mid- sized terrestrial herbivores not too distantly related to camels, but smaller and low-slung with long and thick tails, and rather generalistic. The climate during their time was warmer than today, and their habitats were probably subtropical or even tropical, with plentiful rainfall and abundant vegetation. Tropical rainforest may at least initially have occurred all over the Anoplotheriidae's range. Ecologically, they may have resembled a large duiker of our time (e.g. the similarly sized yellow-backed duiker Cephalophus silvicultor), foraging in dense growth where their low builds would have been advantageous. Systematics and taxonomy The family Anoplotheriidae was assigned to Tesserachenae by Gray in 1821, to Belluae by Bonaparte (who named it Anoplotheriina) in 1850; to Artiodactyla by Cope in 1889, to Ruminantia by Gregory in 1910, and finally to its own superfamily Anoplotherioidea by Romer in 1966.C.-L.

Environ. Microbiol. 10(12): 3349-3365 The lifecycle of Syndinium is currently not well understood beyond the parasitic and zoospore stages.Skovgaard, A., Massana, R., Balagu√©, V., Saiz, E. 2005: Phylogenetic Position of the Copepod-Infesting Parasite Syndinium turbo (Dinoflagellata, Syndinea). Protist, 156(4): 413-423  History of Research  Syndinium was first described by French biologist √âdouard Chatton in 1910 as parasites of Paracalanus parvus, a marine copepod in the Mediterranean Sea. The first Syndinium species described was Syndinium turbo, which remains the most studied Syndinium species today. Due to there being 3 distinct zoospore morphologies for Synidium turbo, Chatton described it as 3 separate Syndinium species with the same host copepod species. This was corrected in 2005 when Skovgaard et al. discovered that the 3 zoospore morphologies of Syndinium turbo are genetically identical. Throughout the 20th Century researchers encountered Syndinium species in a range of copepod and radiolarian in marine habitats ranging from the Clyde Sea to Port Phillip Bay, Australia. In the 2000s, Syndinium is given renewed attention from protist researchers thanks to the maturation of metagenomics techniques such as environmental sequencing, bypassing the need to capture and culture. In 2001 rRNA amplification marine plankton samples led to the tentative establishment of group I and group II marine alveolates, two novel lineages that have not yet been cultivated in the laboratory. In 2005 researchers Skovgaard et al performed phylogenetic analyses using small subunit ribosomal DNA and proposed that Syndiniophyceae, the class in which Syndinium belongs, is the group II marine alveolates. By 2008 it was confirmed that the group I and II marine alveolates belong to the order Syndiniales, which includes the genus Syndinium.  Habitat and Ecology  Syndinium species have been recorded in a wide range of marine environments in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The range of Syndinium species may be increased by human activity, as genetic evidence of Syndinium along with other protist genera was discovered in the ballast water of oceangoing ships on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.Pagenkopp, L. KM., Fleischer, RC., Carney, KJ., Holzer, KK., Ruiz, Gm. 2016: Amplicon-Based Pyrosequencing Reveals High Diversity of Protistan Parasites in Ships' Ballast Water: Implications for Biogeography and Infectious Diseases. Microbial Ecology, 71(3): 530-42. As parasites, Syndinium infest planktonic copepods as well as radiolarians. Syndinium infections are fatal, and many motile zoospores pour out of the exoskeleton after consuming the host from inside out. Parasitism by Syndinium likely has a regulatory role on host populations, and in some conditions are responsible for sizable portion of host mortality rate.Kimmerer, W. J., McKinnon, A. D. 1990: High mortality in a copepod population caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate. Marine Biology. 107(3): 449-452 As the life cycle of Syndinium species are not completely known, the ecological role of Syndinium in non- parasitic life stages are unclear.  Description   Life Cycle  The complete life cycle of Syndinium species has not been entirely elucidated. The most well studied parts of the Syndinium life cycle involves the parasitic stage. When infesting a planktonic host such as a copepod, Syndinium species develop into a plasmodial stage, successively consuming host organs until the entire volume of the exoskeleton is occupied by the plasmodium, killing the host in the process. From the husk of the host one of three morphologically distinct zoospores emerge:  Macrospores  8-12Œºm long, 5-8Œºm wide, resembles an asymmetric gymnodinium and is biflagellar with the anterior flagellum being longer than that of the posterior. Cells are motile but not only show moderate amounts of locomotion and are able to survive one to two days after exiting the host. Mitotic nuclear division of Syndinium. Movement of chromosomes are controlled by extranuclear spindles.  Microspores  8-10Œºm long, 2-4Œºm wide, possesses a refractile body at the posterior end, is also biflagellar with a longer anterior flagellum 3 to 4 times the cell length and an anterior flagellum that is approximately the length of the cell. Refractile bodies are used as resource storage for the cell. Microspores are much more active compared macrospores but perishes after only 5 to 8 hours.  Rostrate Spore  resembles an Oxyrrhis cell. Has a teardrop shape overall with a beak like projection at the narrower anterior end. The anterior and posterior flagella are both like the cell in length, and are inserted in the transverse and longitudinal groove, respectively. Rostrate spores can survive for several days out of the host. Only one type of zoospore will emerge from any single host. Once the zoospores exit the host, the life stages of Syndinium are not well understood. Attempts to infect copepod hosts or to induce sexual reproduction between all combinations of zoospores have so far been unsuccessful.  Mitotic Nuclear Division  Unlike other dinoflagellates, Syndinium does not possess the conventional dinokaryon or the associated process of dinomitosis. Instead, Syndinium possess fewer but larger chromosomes than most dinoflagellates, as few as 4 compared to the typical 20 plus.Ris, H. 1975: Primitive mitotic mechanisms. Biosystems, 7(3-4), Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Syndinium are notable for their mitotic nuclear division mechanisms involving nuclear membrane attached kinetochores and associated V-shaped chromosomes pushed away from each other by axially aligned microtubules.Kubai, D. F., Ris, H. 1974: An Unusual Mitotic Mechanism in the Parasitic Protozoan Syndinium sp. Journal of Cell Biology, 60, Rockefeller University Press. This method of nuclear division, while not altogether rare within dinoflagellates, were first studied in Syndinium.

Species in this genus, such as Hematodinium perezi, the type species, are internal parasites of the hemolymph of crustaceans such as the Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). Species in the genus are economically damaging to commercial crab fisheries, including causing bitter crab disease in the large Tanner or snow crab fisheries of the Bering Sea. Introduction Hematodinium is a harmful parasitic dinoflagellate in marine decapod crustaceans, often dwelling in the hemolymph of host organisms . Drastic changes in the host‚Äôs vital organs, tissues, and hemolymph lead to the degeneration of the organism . Previous studies indicate that species in genus Hematodium affect many organisms in Order Decapoda, and may also affect Order Amphipoda and subclass Copepoda (Manier et al, 1971). These crustacean taxa include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, prawns, and shrimp ‚Äì all commercially important food sources for many countries. The effects of Hematodinium parasites are aggressive and can be lethal, thus capable of eradicating entire crab populations. Discoveries of Hematodinium pathogens in decapods span from western Atlantic Ocean to southern Australia . As a result of the prevalence of Hematodinium in many ocean waters, significant damage is done for many fishery industries around the globe. History of knowledge Hematodinium perezi is one of the first species to have been studied in genus Hematodinium . This organism is well-known and is consequently used as the main study subject for this genus. The first declaration of H. perezi was made in 1931 by Chatton and Poisson off the coasts of Normandy and France. They were discovered in swimming crabs Carcinus maenas and Liocarcinus depurator. At that time, Chatton and Poisson‚Äôs studies were not successful in generating reliable data on Hematodinium. This was because only a small percentage of tested crabs showed indication that they carried the H. perezi parasite. Nonetheless, future discoveries of similar diseases in other crabs have been linked back to H. perezi since Chatton and Poisson‚Äôs first sighting. Later affected crabs include Cancer pagurus (Latrouite et al., 1988; Stentiford et al., 2002) and Necora puber (Wilhelm and Boulo, 1988; Wilhelm and Mialhe, 1996). In 1994, a second species Hematodinium australis found in Australia has been distinguished from H. perezi. Hudson and Shields (1994) point out that besides its southern hemispheric location, the trophont size as well as the presence of rounded plasmodial stages differed between parasitic groups. Molecular research later confirmed the separation of H. australis from H. perezi . Up until now, there are only a few determining characteristics between Hematodinium species . All known species are found in crustacean hosts, have hemolymph-dwelling filamentous plasmodial stages, intrusive amoeboid trophont infections, and a dinokaryon. Species in speculation of belonging to genus Hematodinium are currently in need of further research. Lack of comparative work between the type species and the latest species discoveries prevent exploration of the diversity of genus Hematodinium . Difficulties arise due to the inaccessibility of representative type materials to use for comparative studies, and only a meager list of useful physical characteristics available between the type species and potential Hematodinium parasites . Therefore, newly discovered taxa are designated the general classification of Hematodinium sp. or are referred to being Hematodinium-like. In some cases, new parasite discoveries are incorrectly identified as H. perezi due to close resemblance to the type species. Habitat and ecology At the time of Small‚Äôs (2012) studies, 38 host crustacean species have been affected by Hematodinium parasites. Some of the economically-important infected hosts include tanner and snow crabs from the Northeast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, blue crabs in the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, Norwegian lobsters, and Edible crabs from Europe. It is anticipated that the geographical spread of Hematodinium will grow and reach various other aquatic regions globally due to oceanic currents, host movements and habitat expansions, as well as transportation vessels. Furthermore, as new crustacean species are targeted and fished as commercial seafood, new species of pathogens may be discovered. This was the case in a recent finding in multiple Asian crustacean farm facilities. notes that only aquaculture species from southern and eastern China have been documented, which include swimming crab P. trituberculatus, the mud crab S. serrata, and the ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda. In addition, a small new finding of Hematodinium parasites in crustaceans was also recently discovered in Russian waters. _Recent findings from infected Chinese crustacean farms_ In 2004, swimming crabs P. trituberculatus from Zhoushan were diagnosed with ‚Äúmilky disease‚Äù . They showed signs of lethargy due to the development of white muscle tissues and milky hemolymph. In addition, these crabs had a deficiency in cellular hemolymph and developed discoloured shells. Over 3000 acres of coastal aquatic culture was affected, with death rates as high as 60%. This was the first noted outbreak of its kind in China. In 2005, mud crabs S. serrata were infected with ‚Äúyellow water disease‚Äù in Zhejiang Province . Hematodinium trophonts, prespores, and dinospore stages were present in studied individuals. Affected mud crabs were thinner than usual, had white muscle mass, and had abnormal milky liquids below the carapace. Other mud crab culture regions in that same year were also hit with Hematodinium infections. During transit in between shipments, affected crabs had a ‚Äòcooked‚Äô orange appearance and died shortly after. In 2008, a disastrous Hematodinium infection epidemic shook ridgetail white prawn (E. carinicauda) aquacultures in Zhoushan . Shrimp were languid and had white muscles in their appendages. Most notable is the white colour of their hemolymph, giving the illness the name ‚Äúmilky shrimp disease.‚Äù Mortality rates reached 100%, completely wiping out many aquafarms. Research on the aforementioned epidemics show that the same parasite is able to infect multiple crustacean hosts, as amplified partial SSU gene and ITS1 rDNA regions from the parasite infecting ridgetail white prawn were exceedingly similar to the sequences from parasites infecting swimming crabs and mud crabs (Xu et al., 2010). Xu et al. (2010) were the first to report a Hematodinium infection in shrimp. _Recent findings from infected Russian crustacean farms_ Red king crabs P. camtschaticus and blue king crabs P. platypus from the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia studied in late 2006 had a tiny percentage of individuals that showed symptoms of a Hematodinium infection (Ryazanova, 2008). Scientists found that king crab hemolymphs developed a cream colour following parasite acquisition. Furthermore, prepared crab meat was unpalatable and was reminiscent of ‚Äúbitter crab disease‚Äù described in Tanner crabs (Meyers et al., 1987). Vast numbers of Hematodinium parasites ranging from different vegetative life stages were present in all sampled crab tissues (Ryazanova, 2008). Description of the organism Species belonging to genus Hematodinium bear the key identifying characteristics of dinoflagellates. These include a dinokaryon, a pellicle, naked gymnodinoid dinospores, and dinomitosis . Because only a handful of species in this genus have been studied, there is a poor understanding of their life cycle. Scientists speculate that spore ingestion is the main transmission pathway in which crustacean hosts acquire Hematodinium parasites (Shields, 1994). However, cannibalism with the ingestion of trophonts is another possibility. Vegetative cells known as trophonts are usually located in the host‚Äôs hemolymph and quickly multiply via schizogony. Plasmodia containing 2 to 8 nuclei are motile in H. perezi. Sporulation follows, leading to the formation of prespores then of dinospores. Dinospores supposedly exit the host through small openings in the carapace or through antennal glands. Macrospores are slightly larger than microspores by a few micrometers, and both are able to withstand ocean water conditions for several days. Discrepancies in life stages can occur due to the timing of parasite acquisition as well as due to varying maturation rates of parasites in different hosts (Shields, 1994). For example, in host C. bairdi, sporulation can occur in more or less than a year. In contrast, studies concerning hosts Portunus pelagicus and Scylla serrata suggest a faster development rate of Hematodinium parasites. _Life cycle of Hematodinium sp. in host Nephrops norvegicus_ One particular species with a known life cycle is the unnamed Hematodinium parasite taken from host Nephrops norvegicus. Appleton and Vickerman‚Äôs (1998) in vitro experiments describe the fusion of macrodinospores and microdinospores to produce filamentous trophonts that form colonies known as ‚ÄòGorgonlocks.‚Äô Next, these Gorgonlocks either progress into ‚Äòclump‚Äô colonies, or they become an interconnected plasmodial colony known as an arachnoid trophont. The arachnoid trophont enlarges to form an arachnoid sporont, which enters sporogony to produce sporoblasts. Sporogenesis follows in which sporoblasts develop into macro- and microspores, coming full circle with the life cycle. Appleton and Vickerman (1998) suggest that the life stage that scientists often encounter Hematodinium sp. is sporogony. However, other researchers oppose their proposition as trophic stages have been found in other hosts (Meyers et al., 1987). _Two examples of partial life cycles of Hematodinium sp._ An incomplete life cycle of a Hematodinium species in the hemolymph of host Chionoecetes bairdi was also documented by Eaton et al. (1991). The plasmodial trophont produced amoeboid trophonts, which then morphed into prespores and dinospores (Meyers et al., 1987). Both Meyers et al. (1987) and Eaton et al. (1991) described macrodinospores measuring between 12 and 14 mm long and microspores between 7 and 9 mm long. Additionally, a partial life cycle of Hematodinium sp. is made available by Shields and Squyars‚Äô (2000) observations in host Callinectes sapidus. This life history contrasts that of the parasite found in N. norvegicus described earlier. The vermiform plasmodium either buds to create more plasmodia, or it enters merogony. The vegetative amoeboid trophonts detach during segmentation, in which fission processes follow. Eventually, the amoeboid trophonts stop for a final fission division, as a result of high cellular densities. They proceed to a final sporogonal division to produce four dinospores. Practical importance Crustaceans make up a significant fraction of globally imported marine shellfish. They are economically important worldwide, therefore a single epidemic can result in a monetary loss starting at hundreds of thousands of dollars . Parasites belonging to genus Hematodinium contribute to the mortality rates of commercial crustaceans, thus able to initiate the decline of the crustacean market. A notable example is the economic effect of the ‚Äúbitter crab disease‚Äù caused by Hematodinium sp. on southeast Alaskan crabs. This infection alters the biochemical composition of crustacean flesh, resulting in an unpleasant change in taste . It takes only one affected host for the disease to sweep an entire shipment of crabs (Meyers et al., 1987). More than $250,000 was lost as a result of higher-than-normal crab mortality rates, as described by Meyers et al. (1987). Moreover, the state of Virginia faces an annual $500k to $1 million deficit as a result of unlisted declines in crustacean Callinectes sapidus populations during summer and autumn in highly saline waters . A complete assessment of the impact of Hematodinium sp. on commercialized shellfish is not possible due to the nature of living goods . Dead and/or distant crustaceans cannot be analyzed for parasitic infections. Young crabs and mature female crabs are often overlooked as well. Scientists have used several methods in the diagnosis of Hematodinium sp. in crustacean hosts. These include visual examination, wet smears, neutral red staining, histology, and molecular detection . Funding for further research on the impact of Hematodinium sp. on fisheries can be justified by the possible development of more versatile scientific methods to identify other ‚Äòat risk‚Äô crustacean populations.

Amoebophyra is a syndinian parasite that infects free-living dinoflagellates that are attributed to a single species by using several host-specific parasites. It acts as \\"biological control agents for red tides and in defining species of Amoebophrya.\\" Researchers have found a correlation between a large amount of host specify and the impact host parasites may have on other organisms. Due to the host specificity found in each strain of Amoebophrya's physical makeup, further studies need to be tested to determine if the Amoebophrya can act as a control against harmful algal blooms.  Amoebophyra strains  Different strains of Amoebophyra have been seen to infect different host species. Though research regarding the specificity of Amoebophyra is currently underway, the current hypothesis supported is that they range from non-host-specific to extremely host specific. Over twenty dinoflagellate species have been reported to be infected by some strain of Amoebophyra. It has proven to be difficult to determine whether or not a strain truly is host specific. Host specificity is confirmed not only through the strain's ability to infect various hosts, but their reproductive ability afterwards. If the Amoebophyra strain infects various hosts but is unable to successfully create following generations, then it would be considered host specific. Amoebophyra is mostly known for its correlation with harmful algal blooms (HABs). Abundance of certain strains have been linked to the decline of some HABs in marine life, while others have been found to cause it.  Infection Process  During its lifespan, Amoebophyra alternates between a free-swimming asexual reproductive stage called the dinospore, and a multinuclear growth phase within the host called the trophont stage. A dinospore will attach to the host (biology) cell‚Äôs outer surface, then enter the cytosol. Most infections proceed within the nucleus, though some are confined to the cytoplasm. Within ten minutes, the parasite arrives at the host‚Äôs nuclear envelope and significantly increases in size during the next twenty-four hours. Hosts infected by certain strains of Amoebophyra such as Amoebophyra ceratii are unable to reproduce before the parasite completes its life cycle and kills the host. It will continue to increase in size through nuclear divisions without the need for cytokinesis, resulting in a beehive-like appearance within the host. After killing the host, Amoebophyra grows to become mobile and wormlike, but soon separates into dinospores. These new dinospores then have a short period of time in which to find new hosts, as their survival time in water is meager. The aquatic environment can greatly affect the success of Amoebophyra, as a nutrient environment can influence its reproductive ability as well as its offspring‚Äôs infectivity.

The genus is marked by exosymbiotic bacteria gardens under its lists, the inter-organismal dynamics of which are a current field of research.

He coined the genus with originally only one species: the holotype Ornithocercus magnificus. He made his observations in the Atlantic Ocean and named the organism with regards to the wonder its form inspired in him. Stein originally grouped Ornithocercus in the Dinophysiden, a German taxonomic term that is no longer utilized. He specifically paired it with the genus Histioneis due to their morphological distinctiveness including what he described as a head-funnel and neck collar. Ornithocercus magnificus from the Bay of Villefranche. The little orange balls are symbiotic cyanobacteria. Until DNA barcoding became accessible, specific demarcation in the genus was a significant challenge due to the variability in morphological traits (specifically the cingular lists). While beautiful figures were published in the early 20th century, often their scientific value was limited due to the incompleteness of morphological analyses. Although the most fundamental taxonomic feature was the thecal structure, relatively few papers were available before the 1970s that critically analyzed thecal plates. Several works reported the number of plates incorrectly. A review of previous publications and update with novel research published by Tohru Abe in 1967 indicated morphological features had been previously misinterpreted and given unwarranted significance taxonomically. Availability of enhanced microscope technology allowed greater morphological understanding. Scanning electron microscopes gave greater clarity to surface features as well as revealing the dissimilarity between inner and outer surfaces (such as pore openings) while transmission electron microscopes allowed insights into cell wall development. The study of morphological variability within Ornithocercus species is an ongoing field. A 2018 study found that species O. quadratus could be three separate morphospecies based on inferences from modern imaging techniques of morphology. The genus is not as diverse as other dinoflagellate genera such as Dinophysis but does have at least 24 recognized species. It has been extensively studied around the world, with species found to inhabit waters including the North Arabian Sea, Eastern Tropical Pacific, Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Vitiaz Strait, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Aden, Southern Ocean, Boeton Str, California Current, Gulf of Mexico, Panamic Area, Peruvian Current Galapagos Eddy, and the coast of the Korean Peninsula.  Habitat & ecology  Species of Ornithocercus are found in tropical and subtropical oceans, limited to warm temperature-waters. Tropical waters are home to many genera of dinophysoid, the most common of which is the Ornithocercus with O. quadratus being the most widely distributed species. They are common in deep oceanic waters, with many species found predominantly below the euphotic zone. The existence of Ornithocercus in a brackish lagoon was also found in Terengganu at Gong Batu lagoon in Malaysia, indicating that it is not an isolated phenomenon.  Morphology  Species range in length from 40-170 ¬µm. They are therefore classed as microplankton. Ornithocercus heteroporus - prominent lists on display Ornithocercus is a thecate dinoflagellate. This means they are armored with overlapping cellulose plates collectively called a theca. The plates form within alveolae and therefore the wall is found within the cell membrane. Lists are rigid outgrowths from edges of specific thecal plates supported by ribs. The ribs vary in number and development between species (the number of ribs is species specific) and are necessary for expansive list growth. The theca consists of 17 or 18 plates which are divided into epithecal, hypothecal, girdle, and ventral area. The theca are divisible into left and right sides longitudinally by a sagittal suture; there is also a latitudinal girdle. Structurally complex, the genus is characterized by possession of extensive girdle and sulcal lists (wing-like extensions of the cell wall). Their theca have numerous pores which open flush to the surface of the plate on the outside but have a raised rim on the inside, their number being positively correlated with cell size. The hypotheca of most species are covered in areolae (shallow depressions) which are deepened by secondary thickening which takes place in mature cells. While hypotheca of some Histioneis can be embedded in mucus, Ornithocercus species have not been observed with a hypotheca associated mucus layer. The elaborate morphology of the genus is thought to be a disadvantage during active swimming . The lists have been posited to function in stability and creating feeding currents. The typical flagellar propulsion of dinoflagellates would be resisted by their morphology and the differences in list development between sides could act as a keel. The inhibition of rotation provided by their thecae would lead to increased water flow over parts of the cell which could enhance their feeding-current system. One study found that the area in contact with the highest volume of external medium due to water flow is also a region where there are markedly less barriers to nutrient transfer (two less membranes - including theca). By comparing extant morphologies in dinoflagellate species, it has been suggested that ancestral species were benthic and had streamlined cells. As lifestyles became more planktonic, the large cingular and sulcal lists evolved alongside. Rhabdosomes, rod-shaped bodies found in the cytoplasm (approximately 3 ¬µm in length and 0.25 ¬µm), have been observed in Ornithocercus species. They‚Äôre thought to function in prey capture as trichocysts although no signs of emission have ever been observed. The observation of a cytosome with a microtubular strand was used as evidence of potential food uptake via the peduncle.  Feeding & symbiosis  Ornithocercus lacks photosynthetic pigments (and chloroplasts) and they are thus obligate heterotrophs.Gaines, G., & Elbrachter, M. (1987). Heterotrophic nutrition. In: F. J. R. Taylor (Ed.), The biology of dinoflagellates (pp. 224‚Äì281). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Along with other heterotrophic dinoflagellate genera, they were thought to exclusively feed through osmotrophy of dissolved organic manner. While lacking the ability to photosynthesize, Ornithocercus has ectosymbiotic (extracellular) cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterial symbionts known as phaeosomes are located between the upper and lower lists of the horizontal groove of the cells. One study of these cyanobacteria symbiotes found that the cell size ranged from 3.5-10 ¬µm (thus approximately an order of magnitude larger than prevalent planktonic Synechococcus forms). A 2010 study found species to house both the described extracellular cyanobacteria as well as larger rod-shaped non- photosynthetic bacteria on their sulcal lists. The exact mechanism through which photosynthetic products of the bacteria are utilized by the host is still unclear. A 1994 study was conducted in the Gulf of Aqaba in which levels of colonial cyanobacteria were measured alongside oceanic nitrogen levels. Detection and peaking numbers of the consortia of heterotrophs (Ornithocercus) and autotrophs (cyanobacteria) at times of nitrogen limitation led the authors to propose that the hosts may be providing an anaerobic microenvironment in which the cyanobacteria can efficiently fix nitrogen. This hypothetically could allow the consortia to thrive in stratified oligotrophic nitrogen limited waters. Recent studies called into question this conjecture as the cyanobacteria on two species of Ornithocercus were not found to produce the necessary enzyme nitrogenase. The bacteria thus may provide fixed carbon for the host or may be used as a direct source of nutrients when they die. Another study found that Ornithocercus has a nitrogenase gene (nifH) which supports the idea of additional nitrogen fixing heterotrophic symbionts, allowing the possibility that the bacterial garden hosted by Ornithocercus provides fixed carbon and nitrogen for the host. Food vacuoles have been observed inside O. magnificus with remnants of cyanobacterial symbionts enclosed. In one study, some of the numerous food vacuoles observed inside Ornithocercus species strongly resembled the ectosymbionts in size and colour but were too degraded by section preparation to confirm via transmission electron microscopy. The authors nonetheless concluded that it seemed likely the Ornithocercus were in effect growing their own ‚Äúvegetables‚Äù and likely consuming the bacteria via a peduncle. They also found evidence that Ornithocercus may ingest ciliates, thus engaging in a multi-resource strategy to survive oligotrophic waters. An analysis of the genome of cyanobacteria associated with O. magnificus found that it had a reduced genome when compared to free-living cyanobacteria. This indicates it had lost some genes as functions were provided for it by the host. However, its genome reduction was less severe than that seen in other cyanobacterial symbionts. Therefore it was proposed that the cyanobacteria is not dependent on the host for critical functions such as metabolism, thus supporting the theory that Ornithocercus feeds on its ‚Äúgarden‚Äù of bacteria.  Life cycle  Ornithocercus grows by increasing the size of the individual cell wall elements slowly over time. It also undergoes a period of rapid expansion laterally during cell division (binary fission). The cell division growth is preceded by the formation of a band of material known as the megacytic zone which allows the mother cell wall to maintain integrity during cytokinesis as new cell wall pieces are duplicated. This zone grows between the left and right sides of the theca. The genus‚Äô characteristic lists are reformed only after dissolution of the megacytic zone. The last attachment between daughter cells is dorsally located and some species maintain attachment during early list development. It has been suggested that the hydrodynamic properties of lists are a reason that cells maintain contact after cell division. As division leads to initially underdeveloped lists, by remaining together, the potential negative effects of lacking lists on stability and nutrition (assuming that is their normal function) could be reduced as they develop. Like other dinoflagellate genera, Ornithocercus has been found to show phased cell division (specific dividing times for species throughout the day). By analyzing the states of the megacytic zones and bridges between daughter cells, a study off the coast of Brazil in the South Atlantic Ocean found that while cell division in O. steinii required high light intensity, O. magnificus and O. thumii utilized the days first light. Sexual reproduction and cyst formation are not known in Ornithocercus.M.D. Guiry in Guiry, M.D. & Guiry, G.M. 2019. AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway. http://www.algaebase.org; searched on 14 March 2019.  Phylogeny  In the early 20th century, radiation schemes based on morphologies in cell structure were created for the order Dinophysiales (Dinophyceae) and were followed up with subsequent attempts utilizing more ecological and morphological data. Recently, molecular phylogenetic studies have been undertaken which provide more accurate hypothetical frameworks for dinophysoid character evolution. A 2009 paper placed Ornithocercus in a group with Citharistes sharing a common ancestor but had insufficient data to label Ornithocercus as a monophyletic group (concluding however that it was a reasonable assumption that it is a monophyletic genus based on morphological similarities and sequence divergence estimates). Another contemporary investigation including representative data for the genus Ornithocercus determined that it was in fact monophyletic. A 2013 study summarized the state of potential Ornithocercus phylogeny and placed them in clade with Citharistes and Histioneis with which the ectosymbiontic feature is shared. This indicates that a common ancestor of these genera likely gained this relationship with cyanobacteria. Both Ornithocercus and Histioneis have cyanobacteria living between cingular lists whereas Citharistes have their ectosymbionts in a dorsal girdle-chamber.  Practical importance  In 2008 a study was published in which temporal changes in dinoflagellate composition in coastal waters off the Korean Peninsula were analyzed. They found tropical oceanic species of Ornithocercus which were previously rare or unrecorded around the Peninsula.Kim, Hyeung-Sin & Jung, Min-Min & Lee, Joon-Baek. (2008). The Korean Peninsula Warming Based on Appearance Trend of Tropical Dinoflagellate Species, Genus Ornithocercus. The Sea. Vol. 13. No. 4, pp 303-307. A follow up study in 2013 confirmed the presence of numerous tropical dinoflagellate species including several species of Ornithocercus. Together, the studies confirmed changes in phytoplankton communities in Korean waters by identifying dinoflagellate species changes, with the second paper both verifying the first and widening the scope of the changes. The authors suggest that these trends could be a result of increasing sea surface temperatures due to global warming. As such, Ornithocercus species could be used as indicator species and evidence for climate change and specifically marine ecosystem change if coupled with other environmental data. The Indian oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps) is one of the most important commercial fishes in India.Balan, V (1963). \\"Studies on the age and growth of the Oil Sardine Sardinella longiceps by means of scales\\" (PDF). Indian Journal of Fisheries: 663‚Äì686. These fish are known to occasionally feed heavily on Ornithocercus, specifically in the demersal zone (the study was performed off Mangalore).Dhulkhed, M H (1972) Food of the oil sardine taken by bottom nets And surface gill net in the mangalore area. Indian Journal of Fisheries, 19 (1&2). pp. 163-166. As such, the welfare of Ornithocercus as a food chain link has commercial implications.

The genus was first described in 1839 by Ehrenberg, which is why the holotype species of this genus is Dinophysis acuta Ehrenberg. It has been found that what were considered different Dinophysis species might just be different life stages. Severe diarrheic shellfish poisoning breakouts in northeast Japan led to the identification of a Dinophysis species that produces toxins, Dinophysis fortii in 1976-77. This genus is difficult to maintain in culture leading to challenges in gaining knowledge of these organisms. Some Dinophysis spp. have kleptoplastids of cryptomonad origin, specifically from the cryptomonad Teleaulax amphioexia.Kim, J. I., Yoon, H. S., Yi, G., Kim, H. S., Yih, W., & Shin, W. 2015: The plastid genome of the cryptomonad teleaulax amphioxeia. PLoS One, 10(6). Dinophysis caudata have acquired these kleptoplastids by engulfing the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum which has engulfed T. amphioexia plastids. Cryptomonad plastids have four membranes and a nucleomorph and are a product of secondary endosymbiosis. For years it was believed that Dinophysis did not have a sexual cycle. However, it is now apparent that gamete cells can form in Dinophysis acuminata and D. acuta; this was found when small, spherical cells seemed to form inside larger ones. Habitat and ecology The common habitat of Dinophysis is in tropical, temperate, coastal and oceanic waters. Although most Dinophysis are marine and planktonic, some have been found in coastal lagoons Dinophysis caudata feed on ciliates, specifically Mesodinium rubrum through myzocytosis. Picophytoplankton, bacteria, and cryptomonads are also likely part of the diet of Dinophysis. For culture, Dinophysis are maintained on mixotrophic nutrition. Although they are mixotrophic, they are mainly phagotrophic and photosynthesis is linked to kleptoplastids. Description of the organism Morphology The typical cell size of Dinophysis ranges from 30 to 120 ¬µm, they are medium-sized cells. It is possible for the cell size of Dinophysis to vary from large, vegetative cells to small, gamete-like cells. Dinophysis have hypothecae that consist of two large plates, which take up most of the space of the theca, as well as some small platelets. The genus is characterized by having 18 plates: four epithecal plates, two small apical plates, four sulcal plates, four cingular plates, and four hypothecal plates. They have a cingulum, which is anteriorly positioned, and the cells are laterally compressed. The structural plan and plate tabulation are conserved within the genus. Dinophysis thecae are divided in halves by a sagittal fission suture. Thecal ornamentation is a useful character for species identification. There are five types of thecae ornamentation in this genus. Type A is a smooth theca or a theca with shallow depressions, a single row of pores lines the anterior and posterior cingular lists and the margins of the large epithecal and hypothecal plates. Type B has a more pitted thecal surface but has fewer pores; Type C is characterized by shallow hexagonal reticulation in the theca and a pore in the middle of each areola. Type D exhibits large, spherical areolation in the thecal surface with pores in the center of every 3-5 areolae; type E is characteristic of laterally flattened Dinophysis and consists of a circular areolation thecal surface and a central pore in nearly all areolae. Plastids and kleptoplastids Minute, usually rod-shaped or granular and yellow or brown colored chloroplasts are characteristic of Dinophysis. The chloroplasts have stacks of three thylakoids and an internal pyrenoid. In senescent cells, chloroplasts tend to aggregate in the middle and form orange patches. Some Dinophysis spp. likely possess plastids from cryptomonad origin, since the plastids are identical to those of the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia.Janson, S. & Gran√©li, E. 2003: Genetic Analysis of The psbA gene from Single Cells Indicates a Cryptomonad Origin of the Plastid in Dinophysis (Dinophyceae).‚Äù Phycologia, 42(5): 473‚Äì477. doi:10.2216/i0031-8884-42-5-473.1. In this case, the process consisted in the engulfment (incomplete phagocytosis) of the ciliate M. rubrum which in turn engulfed a whole cryptomonad and now only the plastids remain. There has been debate surrounding whether the plastids of D. caudata are permanent or kleptoplastids.Kim, M., Nam, S. W., Shin, W., Coats, D. W. and Park, M. G. 2012: Dinophysis caudata (Dinophyceae) sequesters and retains plastids from the mixotrophic ciliate prey Mesodinium Rubrum. Journal of Phycology, 48: 569-579. doi:10.1111/j.1529-8817.2012.01150.x It is now known that the plastids of D. caudata are kleptoplastids and the explanation for the discrepancy among molecular and ultrastructural data is due to structural modification during the acquisition of plastids through feeding. When D. caudata was fed M. rubrum reddish-brown plastids, these were not digested in a food vacuole, rather they were transported to the periphery of the cell to join the rest of the plastids. The plastids that were ingested are surrounded by membrane vesicles and transferred to the cytoplasm. During plastid sequestration, the plastids see a change in morphology, the thylakoids of M. rubrum plastids become irregular and distended. The change in pigment of the plastids is due to photoactivity, the change of low light to high light causes the plastids to turn green when there is no prey. The cryptophyte nucleomorph found in M. rubrum is lost in D. caudata. The final plastids of D. caudata appeared stellate and had clustered pyrenoids terminally positioned, their thylakoid membranes are placed in pairs. Life cycle Dinophysis mainly divides asexually by binary fission. For years it was believed that Dinophysis did not have a sexual cycle. However, it is now apparent that gamete cells can form in D. acuminata and D. acuta; this was found when small, spherical cells seemed to form inside larger ones. While the role of a sexual cycle in Dinophysis is not fully understood yet, there is a proposed model for how this works. In the proposed model, vegetative cells give rise to small motile cells (the smaller cells previously observed within the larger cells). The smaller cells then also become vegetative and act like gametes and after conjugation the cells divide and encyst.Berland, Br, et al., 1995. Observations on possible life cycle stages of the dinoflagellates Dinophysis cf. acuminata, Dinophysis acuta and Dinophysis pavillardi. Aquatic Microbial Ecology, 9: 183‚Äì189. The smaller cells that give rise to gametes tend to have thinner thecae and less developed cingular and sulcal lists. They also are flagellated and swim, they use their flagella and lists to wrap around another gamete cell for conjugation. Although the gametes are part of a dimorphic sexual cycle, sex cysts do not play an active role in the seeding of Dinophysis populations. Pseudogenes While toxic species of Dinophysis such as D. acuminata have a single gene for LSU rRNA, non-toxic species seem to have two distinct classes of LSU rRNA.Rehnstam-Holm, A.-S., Godhe, A. & Anderson, D.M., 2002. Molecular studies of Dinophysis (Dinophyceae) species from Sweden and North America. Phycologia, 41: 348‚Äì357.10.2216/i0031-8884-41-4-348.1 The difference between these two classes was a 70 bp deletion, indicating the shorter product might be a pseudogene. The pseudogene can be used as a marker of D. acuminata and might conveniently serve as a marker of toxic and non-toxic strains and bring more insight to the genetics of toxicity of Dinophysis. Phylogenetics Dinoflagellates are algae and according to recent phylogeny they are sister groups to ciliates and apicomplexans. Most phylogenetic studies are done with sequences of both large and small ribosomal subunits and do not always agree with morphological studies based on thecal plates. Sequencing of the small subunit of the ribosome of Dinophysis revealed very similar sequences in three species of Dinophysis (D. acuminata, D. norvegica and D. acuta), suggesting that photosynthetic Dinophysis have evolved recently. Practical importance Dinophysis are a threat to shellfish aquaculture due to toxic lipophilic shellfish toxins that they produce. Dinophysis have cryptophyte-like pigments and at least seven species of Dinophysis contain diarrheic shellfish toxins. Toxic Dinophysis produce okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, and pectenotoxins, which inhibit protein phosphatase and produce diarrhea. The more dominant the okadates are, the higher the impact on public health. Toxins are secondary metabolites, and, in some cases, a single species can produce multiple types of toxins. The production of these is controlled by both genetic factors and the environment. The enzymes produced vary due to the environment in which Dinophysis grow. The boreal seas, temperate seas and tropical seas are where most assemblages of Dinophysis that cause diarrheic shellfish poisoning occur. Common features associated with toxic Dinophysis include: large sizes, highly developed cingular and sulcal lists and hypothecal processes.

Gonyaulax is a genus of dinoflagellates with the type species Gonyaulax spinifera (Clapar√®de et Lachmann) Diesing. Gonyaulax belongs to red dinoflagellates and commonly causes red tides.  Structure  Gonyaulax is a genus of dinoflagellates that are aquatic organisms with two separate flagella: one extends backward and the other wraps around the cell in a lateral groove helping to keep the organism afloat by rotational motility. The plate formula in the genus Gonyaulax Diesing was redefined as Po, 3', 2a, 6\\", 6c, 4-8s, 5'\\", 1p, 1\\"\\".  Classification  All species are marine, except for one freshwater species, Gonyaulax apiculata. It previously included several species, which are now considered to belong to a separate genus, e.g.: *Gonyaulax tamarensis (now: Alexandrium tamarense) *Gonyaulax grindleyi (now: Protoceratium reticulatum) *Gonyaulax polyedra (now: Lingulodinium polyedra)  Adaptations  Gonyaulax dinoflagellates have evolved a type of resting spore (or resting cyst), to enable it to survive harsh weather conditions. Resting cysts can be formed when temperature or salinity changes in the surrounding water. These cysts are round mucous covered bodies that appear reddish in color. Gonyaulax catenella has been recorded forming vegetative cysts in response to cold water.  Reproduction  Gonyaulax are protists that may grow in long chains, especially when faced with turbulent water conditions. These chains allow for clustering of organisms for increased mating, and protection of weakly swimming organisms that could otherwise be washed away.  Effect on humans  Although Gonyaulax is predominantly found in seawater, it can also have a detrimental effect on humans. Filter feeding organisms e.g. mussels, clams etc. can accumulate these dinoflagellates in their bodies. When humans eat these shellfish after dinoflagellate accumulation during Red Tide season, usually during the warmer months of the year, it can poison the person who eats it.  Red tide  Red tide is a discoloration of the sea water by pigmented cells like Gonyaulax spp., some of which may produce toxins. Gonyaulax spinifera has been connected to the production of yessotoxins (YTXs), a group of structurally related polyether toxins, which can accumulate in shellfish and produce symptoms similar to those produced by paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins.

Raceland went on to compete successfully for another six years during which time he would affectionately be called \\"Old Bones\\" by his fans. In 1889, he won the Suburban Handicap, at the time the most important race for older horses in the United States. In October he again beat Firenze to win his second straight edition of the Grand National Handicap at Jerome Park Racetrack.

He was the commanding officer of Pakistani forces at the Battle of Hilli during the Indo- Pakistani war of 1971, and headed a failed coup attempt against the regime of Zia-ul-Haq in 1980 which resulted in a court-martial held by Judge Advocate General Branch of Pakistan Defence Forces headed by General Zia-ul-Haq. Career Uniform of General Tajammal Hussain Malik Tajammul Hussain Malik, from the Awan tribe, was born on June 13, 1924 in the Chakwal District in the Punjab province and became a career officer in the British Indian Army, 7 Rajput Regiment, later joining the army of the new state of Pakistan in 1947. He had participated in Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the 1965 War-Battle of Batapur. In 1969, he was promoted as Brigadier and in October 1971 he was posted as Director of Staff Duties (DSD) in GHQ, from where at his personal request to volunteer to fight in East Pakistan, he was posted to 205 Brigade deployed on the Hilli-Bogra Front. He joined the Brigade on November 20, 1971 deployed at Hilli in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). During the war, he was cited for a live award of Nishan e Haider (the highest award for valour in the Pakistani Armed Forces); Malik's unit continued fighting even after Pakistani forces formally surrendered to Indian forces in Dhaka. He was the Commander of the Pakistani Forces in the Battle of Hilli. He was the only red tape Pakistani officer who did not surrender even as his GOC 16 Division had surrendered. He had been taken from the battle field unconscious, and refused to undergo the surrender ceremony and it was his GOC, Major General Nazar Hussain Shah, who went through the surrender ceremony of 205 Brigade to the opposing commander Major General Lachhman Singh. He became a well known war hero in West Pakistan. War Achievements Malik was the commanding officer of the 3rd Baloch Regiment which had defended Lahore in the 1965 war. He was at the time a Lt Col and had destroyed the Batapur Bridge and defended a vital opening of the grand trunk road to save Lahore on 6 September 1965. A monument has been laid at the site and the day is celebrated in Pakistan as 'Defence Day' to remind the nation of General Tajammul's war efforts and those of the other vital commanding officers. He was a brigadier during the 1971 Pakistan- India War at the Bangladesh scene. He had volunteered to go and fight while he was director of staff duties at the GHQ (General Headquarters), a coveted position. He took over command of 203 Infantry Brigade and defended Hilli while he was up against an Indian division and a brigade of Bengali insurgents on the then Pakistani soil next to the Indian border. Bogra was surrounded from all sides by the greater numbers of the Indian army and the Mukti Bahini. Brig. Malik (who retired as Maj. Gen.) continued to resist even after the Pakistani Eastern Command surrendered in Dhaka on 16 December. He, in his staff car with flags and stars uncovered, went around the streets of Bogra motivating his soldiers to keep fighting. The Indian army had, by then, surrounded the city of Bogra. The brigade major (B.M.) along with some 50 other ranks surrendered but Malik, still full of vigour, refused to give up. He ordered the rest of his brigade to break out in small groups to Naogong, where one of his units was still fighting on. However, en route, his jeep was ambushed, severely injuring him and his orderly. Muktis captured both of them and subjected them to torture. They broke his arms and split his head, after which he was taken semi-conscious to an Indian Army hospital. Major General Nazar Hussain Shah was especially flown in from Natore for the surrender of this brigade on 18 December 1971, due to the refusal of Malik to surrender. Upon return from captivity, he was the only brigadier, who fought the 1971 War in East Pakistan to have been promoted to the rank of major general. Coup attempt After his release and repatriation to Pakistan and having undergone the Hamoodur Rehman Commission inquiry, he held the command of 23rd Division in Jhelum as a major general. However, he was retired by a military tribunal of the Judge Advocate General Branch headed by Army Chief General Zia-ul-Haq over accusations of attempting to overthrow the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and install a government headed by General Tajammul in its place. Malik organized two coups, first of the two on June 26, 1977 (which was aborted later). In 1980, he organized yet another coup attempt against the military regime of Zia-ul-Haq, with many other senior army officers, including his son Naveed Tajammul. The plan was to assassinate Zia-ul-Haq during the Pakistan Day parade on March 23, 1980. However the plot was exposed and Malik, his son (Naveed Tajammal) and the other conspirators were arrested and sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment. Though offered chances of exile, even when the risk of being executed was high, General Malik and his son (Naveed Tajammal) never took the offer to be exiled and preferred their homeland. Later life Malik was released from imprisonment in 1988 following the death of Zia-ul-Haq in a plane crash. He published his autobiography, The Story Of My Struggle, in 1991. He joined the field of politics, and twice contested elections for the National Assembly of Pakistan as an independent candidate from Chakwal district. He formed his own Islamic political party in 1977. His two children Naveed Tajammal and Waseem Pasha Tajammal became politicians, and after retiring from politics entered the business world in the energy and defense sectors.

It is based on the lectures Chomsky gave at the GLOW conference and workshop held at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy in 1979. In this book, Chomsky presented his government and binding theory of syntax. It had great influence on the syntactic research in early 1980s, especially among the linguists working within the transformational grammar framework. Background From its inception in the 1950s, the Chomskyan brand of linguistics has been concerned with a person's knowledge of language, the unconscious mental knowledge that makes him a native speaker of some language. This innate, unobservable knowledge of language is called the speaker's linguistic competence, whereas his outward linguistic behavior which provides the linguist with observable data is called his linguistic performance. Generative grammar tries to provide an adequate model of linguistic competence. When such a grammar can generate (i.e. provide an explicit structural description for) all the grammatical (i.e. syntactically well-formed) sentences of a language and successfully detect all the ungrammatical sentences, it is called observationally adequate. But this kind of adequacy does not provide a sufficiently adequate model of linguistic competence. If the grammar can systematically and accurately describe the adult speaker's linguistic competence, it is called descriptively adequate. If a grammar can describe the acquisition of this linguistic competence in a human child from its initial state to the final state, then it is said to have explanatory adequacy. In Government and Binding theory, Chomsky is interested in the initial state of linguistic competence in a child, which is called a human's biological endowment for language. Since every normal human child is capable of acquiring any language, this endowment is also called by the name of universal grammar. With his book Syntactic Structures (1957), Chomsky established the concept of transformational generative grammar (TGG), a formal approach to linguistic theorizing, and revolutionized the discipline of linguistics. In Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), the TGG model went through a revision, which included the inclusion of a lexical component, the separation of deep from surface structures, and the introduction of some technical innovations such as syntactic features and recursive phrase structure rules. This Aspects model came to be known as the \\"Standard Theory\\". During the early 1970s, some of the rules in the Standard Theory got refined and led to the \\"Extended Standard Theory\\", where different syntactic levels contained information relevant to the meaning. Further revisions and technical innovations such as introduction of \\"empty categories\\", \\"X-bar theory\\", \\"D- and S-structures\\", and conditions on representations such as \\"Case filter\\", etc. led to the \\"Revised Extended Standard Theory\\", in which the grammatical model was greatly simplified. Lectures on Government and Binding contains the next step in Chomskyan linguistic thought where Universal Grammar and the investigation of its characteristics assume central importance. Universal grammar ‚Äî principles and parameters In LGB, Chomsky hypothesizes the following: universal grammar (UG) is the essential set of linguistic universals that every human child is born with. The UG contains a number of fixed \\"principles\\" that are true for all languages. Also embedded in the UG are flexible \\"parameters\\" that have to be fixed by experience. As the human child gains linguistic experience, its brain uses the limited linguistic evidence (see Poverty of the stimulus) at its disposal to fix the parameters of UG and give rise to, in a non-inductive manner, the core grammar of the child's first language.Chomsky 1981 : 3-4 References External links * Google Books preview of Lectures on Government and Binding Category:Books by Noam Chomsky Category:Linguistics books Category:1981 non-fiction books ","title":"Lectures on Government and Binding"},{"id":"24412762","text":"Bronze stater from Crenides, featuring Heracles with a club and bow, 360-356 BCE Crenides or Krenides () was an ancient GreekAn Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen,2005,page 855,\\"The Thasians ...they founded Krenides and Daton\\" city located in Thrace, and later in ancient Macedonia located in the region between the river Strymon and the river Nestos.

Pre-War Robert Archelaus Hardaway was a native of Georgia ‚Äì born there Feb. 2, 1829; but he was raised in Alabama. His parents were Robert Stanfield Hardaway and his second wife, Martha Bibb Jarratt. Hardaway was educated at St. Joseph's College (Alabama), and Emory College, later Emory University, in Georgia. Hardaway served with the United States Army during the Mexican War, but the war ended before he could see combat. After that war, he was the superintendent of the Mobile and Girard Railroad. He resided in Macon County, Alabama before the outbreak of war. Hardaway purchased his father‚Äôs plantation in 1857, becoming owner of its 60 slaves. On June 27 of the same year, he married Rebecca Elizabeth Hurt. They had three sons. Civil War Hardway began the war as commander of an Alabama battery. It was recruited mostly in three counties, Macon, Russell and Tallapoosa. The battery was sent East, where it was mustered into the Confederate service on June 21, 1861. The battery was posted at Manassas, Virginia until March, 1862. Hardaway‚Äôs command moved to the Virginia Peninsula, where it fought at the Battle of Seven Pines in the division of Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill. The battery took part in the Seven Days Battles. Hill‚Äôs division remained near Richmond, Virginia until it departed to participate in the Maryland Campaign. Hardaway was commended by Confederate commanders for the conduct of his battery in the campaign. Later in the year, serving near Fredericksburg, Virginia, Hardaway‚Äôs gunners, using a Whitworth gun (designed by Joseph Whitworth, drove federal gunboats away from Port Royal, Virginia on December 4, 1862. Both Hill and Stonewall Jackson commended Hardaway for his actions at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Shortly afterward, he was assigned command of an artillery battalion, and Captain William B. Hurt took command of the battery. Apparently Hardaway was promoted to the rank of major on December 2, 1862, And to lieutenant colonel on Feb. 27, 1864. Col. Stapleton Crutchfield, Jackson‚Äôs chief of artillery, objected to the promotion, claiming that Hardaway was a fine gunner but hard on both men and horses. Nonetheless, the promotion of Hardaway went through.Wise, p. 423. As a major, Hardaway became second in command of Lt. Col. John J. Garnett‚Äôs artillery battalion, attached to the division of Maj. Gen. Robert H. Anderson. The division fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville directly under the command of General Robert E. Lee. General Lee had Hardaway assemble a group of rifled guns to bombard the federal camps on morning of May 4, 1863.Sears, p. 390. Hardaway became ill with dysentery, missing the Gettysburg Campaign. He returned to active duty in time for the Mine Run Campaign in the fall of 1863. In the Battle of the Wilderness, Hardaway commanded his battalion in the corps of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell in the portion of the artillery contingent led by Col. J. Thompson Brown. The battalion continued in that corps throughout the Overland Campaign. Hardaway‚Äôs guns were in the second line of Ewell‚Äôs corps at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, but some of them were moved up to the line of a gorge to contain the federal breakthrough on May 11.Wise, p. 792. When the corps, led by Jubal Early left to defend Lynchburg, Virginia, Hardaway‚Äôs battalion remained behind. It was assigned to the defenses of Richmond, Virginia, reporting to Brig. Gen. Edward Porter Alexander.Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, vol. 4, p. 593; Wise, p. 917. The battalion played a role in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm and spent much of late 1864 assigned to the defenses of Chaffin's Bluff.Wise, pp. 900, 919. When the corps formerly led by Ewell and Early returned to the defenses of Petersburg, Virginia with Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon as its commander, Hardaway‚Äôs battalion returned to that corps. Hardaway‚Äôs gunners served under Gordon in the Appomattox Campaign, firing one of the last shots before Lee‚Äôs surrender. Hardaway was paroled on May 10, 1865. Post war After the war, returned to his plantation in Georgia. Then he went into railroad work, including as general manager of the East Alabama Railroad, 1869-1872. Hardway was an engineering professor at Auburn University from 1873 to 1881, and at the University of Alabama from 1882 to 1897. In between, he was an engineer for the Central Railroad in Mexico in 1881 and 1882. Hardaway died on April 27, 1899 in Columbus, Georgia.

The story is set in London, England over a week in December 2007. Plot The book begins with the elaborate seating plan of a dinner party. It ends once that dinner party has taken place. Sophie, the wife of a newly elected Member of Parliament, must decide whom to place where. Several of the protagonists are present at the dinner, and the storylines are, to a large extent, tied up as a result of what occurs there. In the course of the book the reader is introduced to John Veals, a hedge fund trader who is arguably the most important character. He is a ruthless businessman, whose immense fortune seems to have become meaningless. He is more interested in the chase, the challenge of acquiring more and more capital. As he embarks on one of the riskiest deals of his life, his family is about to be torn apart. But does he even care? An unsuccessful barrister is assigned to represent a young female tube driver; a Scottish Muslim is drawn into a radical group, while a postgraduate literature student looks on; a Polish footballer tries hard to adapt to life in a Premier League team, while his Russian model girlfriend adjusts to life in London. A pickle millionaire enlists the help of R. Tranter, novelist and critic, to prepare for his meeting with the Queen when he receives his OBE. Themes The book's peripheral characters play an important part in the general theme of the book. Life for John's wife, in particular, is lonely and boring. John can't engage with her at any level, her children are mysterious teenagers and she feels isolated. She and her circle of friends measure each other on how rich or how thin they are. Radley Graves, a secondary school teacher, becomes dangerously entangled in the fantasy world of \\"Parallax\\" the virtual reality game where his character is a sexually aggressive bully. Amanda can't let go of the past, when she used to rule the roost in London now stuck in the country with her alcoholic husband Roger, she can't wait to get back at the least opportunity. The novel touches on themes that are issues that we face every day: mental illness, terrorism, the recession, and a sense of trying to survive in a world of madness, consumerism and greed. Although the novel explores grim reality, there is hope, and love, a thin seam, but nonetheless, still there.

Instead, they are allowed to explore the world at their own pace. It is a response to concerted cultivation and the widespread trend for parents to schedule activities and classes after school; to solve problems on behalf of the children, and to buy services from commercial suppliers rather than letting nature take its course. The philosophy, stemming at least partially from the Slow Movement, makes recommendations in play, toys, access to nature and scheduled activities. The opposing view is that such children are disadvantaged because their parents do not provide as many learning opportunities. Goals Slow parenting aims for the goal of allowing children to be happy and satisfied with their own achievements, even though this may not make them the wealthiest or most famous. These parents suggest that children of other parents are unable to cope with the unpredictability of the real world, either expecting their helicopter parents to intervene, or complaining about unfairness. They may not even understand who they are themselves until much later in adulthood. Play Play is a natural part of childhood, which allows young people to explore and discover at their own pace. Children invest 15% of their energy in playing demonstrating their natural inclination and the evolutionary benefit. Children have a natural skill for playing and exploring in a way that is appropriate. Other mammals also play in developing their own skills in a realistic but less dangerous environment. However, formal learning is more beneficial from the age of six. Toys, technology and an adult-imposed educational curriculum are not required, according to the philosophy. Television In general, slow parenting does not advocate watching television. Television is not interactive; a person can watch it with little thinking and no action. It can occupy an enormous amount of time, and some programs are even inappropriate for children. At the same time, it is often created by commercial interests with minimal investment in the program content and a maximum of advertising. The social aspects of television are widely discussed and often considered to be negative. Introducing children to television (including families watching it together) is a recommendation to continue this lifestyle, and a discouragement to any other play or activity. It is believed that television advertisements often encourage people further into consumerism by promoting expensive objects which are often unnecessary and ultimately unsatisfying (a satisfied customer may not need to make further purchases). The presentation of these to people who are tired or not concentrating is a further risk to their behavioural development. However, it is recognised that television is a convenient baby-sitter, and that some programs are enjoyable (The Idle Parent contains a list of the author's favourites). Choices might include watching only ten-year-old pre-recorded video tapes, or watching broadcast television with children and giving a real- time commentary on the content and its message. Safety Everyday life does contain risk. Slow parenting advocates would argue that in order to develop a healthy understanding of that, children must be allowed to face risks. Because many parents have themselves been raised in a risk-averse way, Slow Parenting advocates would maintain that they are often unable to judge which risks are significant. For example, stranger danger, a cornerstone of child \\"safety\\", has been criticized for allegedly assuming that all strangers are dangerous, and by negative inference that all familiar people are safe. An open letter by more than one hundred leading pediatricians, academics, and authors, published in The Daily Telegraph, highlighted how a fast-paced and consumerist lifestyle has emphasized the fear of physical harm and the subsequent emotional and social damage to children. The newspaper then invited responses from the public and received nearly 120 pro-slow parenting responses within days. These highlighted frequent assessment, political interference, junk food, television, compulsory schooling, distrust of teachers, and many other areas. Some suggested Forest schools and other adventure activities, while many proposed less political interference with schools. Family Spending time with children is always recommended for parents. The book The Price of Privilege finds that eating dinner together as a family is an indicator of good psychological health. Tom Hodgkinson's ideal scenario is to be near his children, although not too near. Synonyms and variations The idea of slow parenting has been repeated by many authors and commentators, many of whom have attached their own names. A few are briefly reviewed below: Slow movement In his book Under Pressure: Rescuing Our Children From the Culture of Hyper-parenting, Carl Honor√© describes a measured and caring way of stepping back and letting our children face the world themselves. Parts of UP have been serialised in the Daily Telegraph. The author has previously written about the Slow Movement in his book In Praise of Slowness. Honor√© steps through the stages of adult intervention in childhood, arguing that many adults drive their children towards goals they have chosen but which are often not suitable. The freedom to play is repeatedly endorsed, with Honor√© providing examples that he believes shows that interfering in this often makes less effective use of their time, and damages their development. He highlights some particular educational techniques, such as the Reggio Emilia approach and Forest kindergartens, notably the Secret Garden in Scotland, where the mature attitude to risk is contrasted with the health-and-safety mentality that is more generally taken. Within school, testing and homework are singled out for criticism, while after-school activities are thought to take time away from more enjoyable times. Even sports, which are basically enjoyable and healthy, become detrimental when adults impose their focus on winning. Consumerism, in particular the pester-power of toy advertising is said to push children and adults apart, converting their enthusiasm into a lust for costly and often useless goods. Risk aversion in helicopter parents is said to leave children unable to handle risks. In her book Conscious Parenting: Mindful Living Course for Parents, Natasa Nuit Pantovic describes the negative social aspects of modern technologies that discourage any other play or activity. Within her Conscious Parenting Book explaining the importance of Free Play Nuit says: ‚ÄúChildren learn intuitively, perceiving the subtle inner relationships observing nature. Free creative play is an invaluable gift that children need to start properly relating to the outside world. Exploring, experiencing and imitating the world of grown-us through free play, children are given a chance to unconsciously learn and emotionally mature through their own games. Too much of today‚Äôs learning is structured, children are ‚Äòdirected‚Äô, ‚Äòinstructed‚Äô and carefully ‚Äòfollowed‚Äô at all times, so they do not have a chance to experience learning through unobstructed observation. Children have deep devotion to life and this devotion is beautifully expressed through the free play.‚Äù. The author has previously published 5 Mindfulness Books within Serial called: Alchemy of Love Mindfulness Training. Nuit researches and supports the Finish educational model where schools testing and homework are discouraged and where competition is not emphasized. In her article ‚ÄòCreate Freedom in the Learning Environment‚Äô: Nuit says: ‚ÄúChildren need to feel our love at all times; our love gives them confidence that they are heard, that they are present, and that they matter. A warm, loving and gentle environment is absorbed unconsciously and it gives children a wonderful start to life.‚Äù The idle parent The Idle Parent by Tom Hodgkinson in 2009 is an alternative to over-parenting. It has also been serialised in a newspaper column in the Daily Telegraph. The central premise is that children can take care of themselves most of the time, and that the parents would be happier if they spent more time taking care of themselves too. Hodgkinson's idle parenting \\"does not refer to slobbing out or giving up, but rather to letting go, going with the flow, a wise and merry detachment. It is, in Aldous Huxley's phrase, an 'active resignation'.\\" IP does not have to be costly: Many activities are free, such as lighting a fire; while others are cheap, such as buying 10-year-old video tapes from charity shops. Alongside the jests about how much children like to work, and so should be returned to Victorian workhouses, are points about letting children try to make their own breakfast (while the parents sleep), or camping in a field instead of going to an \\"antiseptic children's fun palace\\". The Idle Parent constantly moderates its zeal, for example in how completely to ban the use of television, against the excess of the Puritans.

Earlier life He was born in the village Bangra in the Siwan district of Bihar. By profession he was a lawyer before he became a con man. Modus operandi He duped hundreds of people of crores of rupees and used more than 50 aliases to disguise himself. He was a master of disguises and used novel ideas to cheat people. He was also a master in forging signatures of famous personalities. He is also said to have cheated a number of industrialists including the Tatas, the Birlas and also Dhirubhai Ambani taking from them huge sums of money in cash, posing as a social worker or needy person.Chitralekha, Feb 2007 He also duped many shop-owners of lakhs of rupees, paying them by cheque and demand draft. Natwarlal was arrested nine times but every time he was able to break out of jail and escape. He was convicted for 14 cases of forgery and was sentenced for 113 years, but he hardly spent 20 years in prison. The last time he was arrested was in 1996 and was 84 years old at that time. But he managed again to give the police the slip and was last seen by authorities on June 24, 1996; when the wheelchair-using octogenarian vanished while being transported from prison to a hospital for treatment. He disappeared at New Delhi railway station, when he was being taken to AIIMS, under police escort from Kanpur jail for his treatment, after which he was never seen again. Death and mystery In 2009, his lawyer requested that more than 100 charges pending against Natwarlal be dropped claiming that Natwarlal died on Saturday July 25, 2009. However, Natwarlal's brother, Ganga Prasad, subsequently claimed to have cremated him earlier at Ranchi. So the actual time and year of death is yet uncertain.

In testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services in September 2009, he said that \\"the current foreclosure relief efforts have largely been unsuccessful because they have misidentified the underlying causes of mortgage default. It is not exploding ARMs or predatory lending that drives the current wave of foreclosures, but negative equity driven by house prices declines coupled with adverse income shocks that are the main driver of defaults on primary residences.\\"09/09/09 Testimony of Calabria before the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity Calabria has been noted by the media for his pro-free market views Calabria is currently under scrutiny for nearly $900 million in loans to the Kushner Companies. The 18 mortgages were secured by Jared Kuskner's sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer personally pitching the deal to Freddie Mac. The loans come with unusually lenient terms, including lower APRs than normal, interest only payments for the entire ten year term. followed by the full principals due in a single ballon payment. If the Kushner Companies default on these loans, Freddie Mac will be out approximately $850 million in 2019 dollars. The taxpayers have previously had to bail out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mac for $190 billion after the 2008 crisis (this money has been recouped in full plus some from the two federal lenders). On top of the eschewing of standard practices above, Freddie Mac also greatly overvalued the properties in the mortgage and even more so, their yearly profitability. These deviations from the norm and overvaluations came at the time that Calabria assumed the helm at Freddie Mac which led to the inquiries into impropriety and influence. https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-freddie-mac- kushner-loans References * Testimony of Calabria before the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity ‚Äì September 9, 2009 * Testimony of Calabria before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law ‚Äì July 9, 2009 Notes External links * FHFA biography * Mark Calabria Discusses the Credit Card Bill on CNBC, 5-20-09  The Cato Institute website ‚Äì Washington, D.C.

The city must have belonged to the Delian League since it appears in an Athenian decree of the year 422/1 BCE. According to an account by Polyaenus, the Spartan army commanded by Ischolaus was besieged by the Athenian army under Chabrias in the city of Drys. When the Athenians approached with battering rams to try to knock down the city wall, Ischolaus' defense consisted in getting ahead of him and demolishing part of the wall so that his soldiers fought with more courage for not having the protection of the wall and also to show the Athenians their contempt for siege engines. The Athenians, frightened at the voluntary demolition of the walls, did not dare to attack the city.Polyaenus, Stratagems II.22. The town is also mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium and in the Suda.Suda, s.v.

He became a member of the Nigerian Senate in 2007. Background Abubakar Umar Gada was born on 16 January, 1966. He has a master's degree in public administration, a master's degree in business administration, a post graduate diploma in public administration and a Bachelor Of Science. Before engaging in politics, he was a Crude Oil marketer for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. He first entered politics in 2003, in a failed attempt to become a deputy governor of Sokoto state. Senate career Abubakar Umar Gada was elected senator for Sokoto East in 2007. He was appointed to committees on Integration and Cooperation, Establishment & Public Service, Downstream Petroleum, Communications, Commerce, Water Resources and Women and Youth. In July 2007, speaking on the failure of Bode Agusto from Lagos to secure senate confirmation, Gada said the former director-general of the Budget Office performed very poorly during Obasanjo's regime, and showed contempt for the National Assembly. In April 2008, the Senate established a twelve-man ad-hoc committee chaired by Senator Heineken Lokpobiri to investigate the management of funds appropriated for the transport sector since 1999. Senator Gada was named to the committee. In May 2008, Gada was one of the senators appointed to the National Assembly Joint Committee on Constitution Review. Speaking about the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) in April 2009, Senator Gada, who is Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Downstream Petroleum, said that the bill had to be subjected to thorough scrutiny to ensure that it achieved its objectives. In July 2009, violence erupted in Maiduguri, Borno State in which the army attacked a compound and mosque used by the militant Islamist Boko Haram group, killing their deputy leader and 200 followers. Commenting on the incident, Abubakar Umar Gada said the Boko Haram had taken advantage of the large number of people without jobs or opportunities to better themselves. In a press interview, Gada condemned the rating of senators through the numbers of sponsored Bills, stating that their contribution as the bill was processed was also of great importance. Ibrahim Gada competed at the PDP primaries in January 2011 to again be the Sokoto East Senatorial candidate. However, he was beaten by Abdullahi Ibrahim Gobir, who polled 1,547 votes to Gada's 60 votes. Gobir went on to be elected.

Life expectancy Russian male and female life expectancy since 1950.Life expectancy of the Russian Federation since 1950 Life Expectancy of the Russian Federation since 1992 Retrieved on May 29, 2008 Pre-soviet era Before the revolution annual mortality was 29.4 per 1000 and infant mortality 260 per 1000 births. In 1913 life expectancy was 32 years. The cholera epidemic of 1910 killed 100,000 people. A typhus epidemic between 1918 and 1922 caused 2.5 million deaths, and doctors were particularly affected. There was an outbreak of malaria in 1920. The Institute of Tropical Medicine in Moscow instituted a programme of registration of cases and free distribution of quinine. The famine of 1921/2 caused widespread starvation. As many as 27 million people were affected. Another cholera outbreak between 1921 and 1923 caused an estimated 13 million deaths. By 1926 life expectancy had reached 44 years. Post-soviet era As of 2013, the average life expectancy in Russia was 65.1 years for males and 76.5 years for females.http://ria.ru/society/20140418/1004478479.html The average Russian life expectancy of 71.6http://itar-tass.com/obschestvo/1614450 years at birth is nearly 5 years shorter than the overall average figure for the European Union, or the United States. The biggest factor contributing to this relatively low life expectancy for males is a high mortality rate among working-age males from preventable causes (e.g., alcohol poisoning, stress, smoking, traffic accidents, violent crimes). Mortality among Russian men rose by 60% since 1991, four to five times higher than European average. As a result of the large difference in life expectancy between men and women, (the greatest in the world) the gender imbalance remains to this day and there are 0.859 males to every female. Major health issues Common causes of death In 2008, 1,185,993, or 57% of all deaths in Russia were caused by cardiovascular disease. The second leading cause of death was cancer which claimed 289,257 lives (14%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.8%), road accidents (1.7%), murders (1.1%), accidental alcohol poisoning (1.1%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 244,463 lives in total (11%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.3%), respiratory disease (3.8%), infectious and parasitic diseases (1.6%), and tuberculosis (1.2%).Rosstat demographics report for the year 2008 Federal State Statistics Service, Retrieved on June 3, 2009 The infant mortality rate in 2008 was 8.5 deaths per 1,000, down from 9.6 in 2007. Since the Soviet collapse, there has been a dramatic rise in both cases of and deaths from tuberculosis, with the disease being particularly widespread amongst prison inmates. Smoking Until 2007 Russia was the world leader in smoking. According to a survey reported in 2010 by Russia‚Äôs Health and Social Development Ministry, 43.9 million adults in Russia are smokers. Among Russians aged 19 to 44 years, 7 in 10 men smoke and 4 in 10 women smoke.http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15664613&PageNum;=0 It is estimated that 330,000-400,000 people die in Russia each year due to smoking-related diseases. A smoking ban was introduced in 2014. Alcohol consumption Alcohol consumption and alcoholism are major problems in Russia. It is estimated that Russians drink 15 litres (26 pints) of pure alcohol each year. This number is nearly 3 times as much as it was in 1990. In Moscow on September 24 of 2009, Russia's interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev cited the average intake at an estimated 18 liters a year; \\"In Russia, each person, including babies, accounts for about 18 liters of spirits per year. In the opinion of WHO experts, consumption of more than 8 liters per year poses a real threat to the health of the nation. Russia has long exceeded this level\\".http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090924/156238102.html It has even been reported that excessive alcohol consumption is to blame for nearly half of all premature deaths in Russia. A recent study blamed alcohol for more than half the deaths (52%) among Russians aged 15 to 54 from 1990 to 2001.See, e.g., Korotayev A., Khaltourina D.

According to a 2008 report by UNAIDS, the HIV epidemic in Russia continues to grow, but at a slower pace than in the late 1990s. At the end of December 2007 the number of registered HIV cases in Russia was 416,113, with 42,770 new registered cases that year.

A new Federal AIDS Program for 2007 - 2011 was also developed and adopted. Federal funding for the national AIDS response in 2006 had increased more than twentyfold compared to 2005, and the 2007 budget doubled that of 2006, adding to the already substantial funds provided by the main donor organizations. Coordination of activities in responding to AIDS remains a challenge for Russia, despite increased efforts. In 2006, treatment for some patients was interrupted due to delays in tender procedures and unexpected difficulties with customs. Additionally, lack of full commitment to an in-depth program for education on sex and drugs in schools hinders effective prevention programs for children.

This is evidenced by the fact that Russia's suicide rate since the mid-90s has declined alongside per capita alcohol consumption, despite the economic crises since then; alcohol consumption is more of a factor than economic conditions.Demoscope - Demographic, social and economic consequences of alcohol abuse in Russia Demoscope Retrieved on July 6, 2010 Tuberculosis The pulmonary TB death rate in Russia around 1900 was 4 per 1000, more than double the rate in London. The All Russia League for the Struggle Against TB was set up in 1909. In 1919 the Commissariat of Public Health established a TB Commission. The incidence of tuberculosis in Moscow was about three times that in London in 1922. The director of the Institute of Control of Serums and Vaccines in Russia, Tarasevich, brought a serum of the BCG vaccine from the Pasteur Institute in 1925 and a vaccination programme started shortly afterwards, starting with children in homes with an active TB patient, but there was initially very low take up.

The community is in the Cumberland Mountains near Cookeville, Tennessee. Population The community reached a population of 2,350 in 1924 as a coal-mining town with over 10,000 people living in the general area, but had declined to about 400 by 1957, and an estimated population of 249 in 2013. History Early development Wilder was a planned company town, intended to provide housing for employees of the Fentress Coal and Coke Company. Town planning began in 1901, and the first coal mine opened in 1902. The town was named for the company owner, John T. Wilder. It was well established by 1903, including the first school in the area. The town church, Boyer's Chapel, was built in 1922. In 1923, the school began adding high school classes, and the first high school graduates were the class of 1932. Killing of union leader Barney Graham left Wilder was the site of a violent coal-miners strike from July 1932 to April 1933, after wages had been cut by twenty percent. The strike ended shortly after the killing of United Mine Workers union leader Barney Graham in front of the company store on April 30, 1933. His funeral was attended by almost a thousand people. Company mine guard Jack \\"Shorty\\" Green was acquitted of a murder charge. The mine never recovered from the destructive events of the strike, and the seam still contains tens of millions of tons of recoverable coal. Hedy West's 1965 album Old Times and Hard Times included the song The Davidson-Wilder Blues about the coal-miners strike, and the song Lament For Barney Graham specifically about the killing of Graham.

Life Milles was born in Kent about 1550, the son of Richard Milles of Ashford, by his first wife Joan, daughter of Thomas Glover of Ashford, and sister of Robert Glover. Educated at a free school, he entered public service about 1570, and during the next sixteen years was frequently employed in France, Flanders, and Scotland. He is said to have received a chapeau winged as an augmentation to his armorial bearings for his celerity on a mission to Henry IV of France. In 1579 he was appointed bailiff of Sandwich, Kent. He was employed by Francis Walsingham as an agent between England and Scotland in 1585, and in the following year he accompanied Thomas Randolph to Edinburgh, during the negotiations on the treaty of Berwick. He then obtained the lucrative post of customer of Sandwich. This position gave him opportunities for the interception of foreign agents and correspondence, and the government employed him in unravelling the plots of the period. In 1591 he was recommended to be sent to Brittany to view and report on the forces there, and after the expedition to Cadiz (1596) he was appointed a prize commissioner at Plymouth. In 1598 he acted as secretary to Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and in the same year (15 June) he obtained, in reversion after Sir Ralph Bourchier, the keepership of Rochester Castle. On the death of George Gilpin in 1602 he applied, without success, for the post of councillor to the council of estate in the Low Countries. He devoted the rest of his life to the defence of the staple system. On his resignation in 1623 of the post of bailiff of Sandwich, he was succeeded (10 July) by John Philipot. His will was proved in 1627. Works on economics Milles's economical works show the relation of the doctrines of the mercantilist writers to those of the later canonists. An advocate of the staple system on the ground that, while it made possible exchange without usury, it was favourable to freedom of enterprise and the development of commerce, he denounced the usurious practices of the new school, and argued that the monopoly of the Merchant Adventurers led to the growth of London at the expense of the outports, deprived merchants of free traffic, and diminished the revenue. Two years' experience as customer of Sandwich convinced him of the desirability of reviving the staple system, and after consultation with Thomas Fanshawe, remembrancer of the exchequer, he prepared a statement of his views, which was brought to the notice of Lord Burghley. Failing in this attempt to influence the government, he published The Custumers Apology: that is to say, A generall Answere to Informers of all Sortes (London, 1599). Only fifty copies of this work were printed, and they were circulated among the members of the privy council. To meet the attacks made upon the Apology by John Wheeler, secretary to the Merchant Adventurers' Company, Milles published a reply.The Customers Replie, or Second Apologie: that is to say, An Aunswer to a confused Treatise of Publicke Commerce . . . in favour of the . . . Merchants Adventurers (London, 1604). With the exception of the epistle dedicatory, the preface, and the conclusion, this work consists of A Treatise of Exchange in Merchandise and Merchandising Exchange, written about the time of the conference at Bruges (1564‚Äì65), by a merchant adventurer. Of two other of Milles's books, A Caution against Extreamity by Farmers (1606), and The True Vse of Port-Bandes (1606), there is apparently no copy in existence. The Caution was directed against the practice of farming out the customs, and Milles was reprimanded by the lords of the Privy Council for it. About 1608 Milles prepared an Answere to the critics of the True Use of Port-Bandes, but its publication was stopped by the Exchequer. Later publications on cognate topics were: * (London, 1608) * (London, 1608) * (London, 1609). This work came through the king's order by Sir Alexander Hay, on his reading the preface to the Acroamata. In it Christian \\"exchange\\" is contrasted with Jewish \\"usury\\". * (London, 1610) Other works Milles also published: * Nobilitas Politica et Civilis (London, 1608): edited from the manuscripts of Robert Glover, with notes and additions by Milles * The Catalogue of Honor, or Treasury of True Nobility, Peculiar and Proper to the Isle of Great Britaine . . . Translated out of Latyne (London, 1610).

His wife died in 1624 at Davington Hall, and was buried by the side of her younger daughter in St. George's Church, Canterbury, where a monument was erected to her memory. His daughter Anne inherited Norton, purchased by him in the reign of Elizabeth, and Davington, purchased early in the reign of James I, and married in 1627 John Milles, afterwards knighted.

After Stesagoras' death, the Peisistratids of Athens sent Militiades the Younger, Stesagoras' brother, to mourn and honor him. After grieving for a period of time, Militiades the Younger restrained all the powerful men of Chersonesos and seized control of the area. He later abandoned the area when Darius I invaded in 493 BCE.

The city became a World Heritage Site in 1987, largely because of its architectural history and the way in which the city landscape draws together public and private buildings and spaces. The many examples of Palladian architecture are purposefully integrated with the urban spaces to provide \\"picturesque aestheticism\\". It is the only entire city in Britain to achieve World Heritage status, and is a popular tourist destination. Important buildings include the Roman Baths; neoclassical architect Robert Adam's Pulteney Bridge, based on an unused design for the Rialto Bridge in Venice; and Bath Abbey in the city centre, founded in 1499 on the site of an 8th- century church.John Britton, Of equal importance are the residential buildings designed and built into boulevards and crescents by the Georgian architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger ‚Äì well- known examples being the Royal Crescent, built around 1770, and The Circus, built around 1760, where each of the three curved segments faces one of the entrances, ensuring that there is always a classical facade facing the entering visitor. Most of Bath's buildings are made from the local, golden- coloured, Bath Stone. The dominant architectural style is Georgian, which evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. The city became a fashionable and popular spa and social centre during the 18th century. Based initially around its hot springs, this led to a demand for substantial homes and guest houses. The key architects, John Wood and his son, laid out many of the city's present-day squares and crescents within a green valley and the surrounding hills. According to UNESCO this provided... \\"an integration of architecture, urban design, and landscape setting, and the deliberate creation of a beautiful city\\". Development during modern eras, including the development of the transport infrastructure and rebuilding after bomb damage during World War II, has mostly been in keeping with earlier styles to maintain the integrated cityscape.  Celtic, Roman and Saxon  The Great Bath at the Roman Baths. The entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is a later construction. Buildings from Bath's pre- Norman period either no longer exist, or their remains are below street level. Archaeological sites in the central area of the city have supplied some details about how they may have looked, while the lower areas of the Roman Baths reveal significant remains from the Roman period. The Baths were built around hot springs, the only ones naturally occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological evidence suggests that the main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool in the corner of the temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years.Barry Cunliffe, City of Bath (1986), pp. 21‚Äì24. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner. A head of \\"Sulis-Minerva\\" found in the ruins of the Roman baths Beside the baths, a temple, in classical style with four large, fluted Corinthian columns and dedicated to Minerva The temple remained in use for worship until around the 4th century, but the site is now occupied by the Grand Pump Room. The city was given defensive walls, probably in the 3rd century, but they disappeared during subsequent redevelopments. The line of then formed the basis of the medieval walls enclosing , some which survived until the 18th century. The Anglo-Saxons called the town Ba√∞um, Ba√∞an or Ba√∞on, meaning \\"at the baths,\\" the source of the present name. In 675, Osric, King of the Hwicce, set up a monastic house at Bath, probably using the walled area as its precinct. The Anglo-Saxon poem known as The Ruin may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. King Offa of Mercia gained control of this monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter. By the 9th century the old Roman street pattern had been lost, and Bath had become a royal possession; King Alfred laid out the town afresh, leaving its south- eastern quadrant as the abbey precinct.  Norman, Medieval, Tudor, and Stuart  Bath Abbey from the Roman Baths Gallery Bath Abbey was founded in 1499 on the site of an 8th-century church. The original Anglo-Saxon church was pulled down after 1066, and a grand cathedral dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul was begun on the site by John of Tours, Bishop of Bath and Wells, around 1090; however, only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. The half-finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137, but work continued until about 1156; the completed building was approximately long. By the 15th century, Bath's abbey church was badly dilapidated and in need of repairs. Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided in 1500 to rebuild it on a smaller scale. It is in a late Perpendicular style with flying buttresses and crocketed pinnacles decorating a crenellated and pierced parapet. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. Major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The choir and transepts have a fan vault by Robert and William Vertue, in the 1860s, completing the original roof from 1608. The nave was given a matching vault in the 19th century. The building is lit by 52 windows. Fan vaulting over the nave at Bath Abbey. A Victorian restoration of the original roof from 1608 The medieval era is represented by the remains of the city walls in Upper Borough Walls. There are no other surviving buildings from this period. Several areas of the city underwent development during the Stuart period, in response to the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The St Thomas √† Becket Church was built between 1490 and 1498 by John Cantlow, Prior of Bath Abbey and took the place of an older Norman church. The church was commonly called Old Widcombe Church and used to be the principal church of the parishes of Widcombe and Lyncombe. The Domesday survey of 1086 shows a small settlement around the church although no trace of it remains. In 1847 a much larger church, St Matthews, was built in Widcombe parish. On 22 April 1847, it was announced that the church bells, which had for centuries been in the tower of St. Thomas √† Becket, were to be removed and installed in the new St. Matthew's. Widcombe Manor was originally built in 1656 and then rebuilt in 1727 for Philip Bennet the local MP. Thomas Guidott, moved to Bath and set up practice in 1668. He became interested in the curative properties of the waters and he wrote A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676. This brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters to the attention of the country and soon the aristocracy started to arrive to partake in them. alt=Distance photograph showing rows and crescents of yellow stone buildings. Several trees and hills in the background. The early 18th century the central area around the Abbey was expanded including the Abbey Church Yard which contained Marshal Wade's House, and Trim Street, which was named after George Trim who owned the land. Number 5, which is also known as General Wolfe's house, is a 2-storey building with a parapet and rusticated quoins, built by Thomas Greenway. The doorway has Ionic pilasters and a tympanum decorated with the implements of war. In 1716 the architect William Killigrew was commissioned to rebuild St John's Hospital which was founded around 1180, by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin and is among the oldest almshouses in England. The 2 storey Bath stone building has a heavy ground floor arcade of round- headed arches on pillars, and retains its original window mouldings and sashes. Building work continued after 1727 under the 23-year-old John Wood, the Elder, his first commission in Bath.  Georgian  The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood. The dominant style of architecture in central Bath is Georgian; this evolved from the Palladian revival style which became popular in the early 18th century. The original purpose of much of Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey- coloured classical fa√ßades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants. The architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical fa√ßades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone which was used for construction throughout the city, was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694‚Äì1764). Allen, in order to advertise the quality of his quarried limestone, commissioned the elder John Wood to build him a country house on his Prior Park estate between the city and the mines, replacing his Town House. Queen Square was the first speculative development by John Wood, the Elder who lived in one of the houses. Queen Square was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"one of the finest Palladian compositions in England before 1730\\". The west side (numbers 14‚Äì18 and 18A, 19 and 20) was designed by John Pinch the younger in 1830 and differs from Wood's original design as the central block is in Neo-Grecian style. The Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) now occupies 16‚Äì18. The south side (numbers 5‚Äì13) was originally left open, but is now occupied by a hotel. The obelisk in the centre of the square was erected by Beau Nash in 1738. The neoclassical architect Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, based on an unused design for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. The Circus is seen as the pinnacle of Wood's work. It consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. Like the Colosseum, the three fa√ßades have a different order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic on the piano nobile and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, the style of the building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises. Gay Street links Queen Square to The Circus. It was designed by John Wood, the Elder in 1735 and completed by his son John Wood, the Younger. The houses are of 3 storeys with Mansard roofs, with many also having Ionic columns. Hester Thrale, who was also known as Mrs Piozzi, lived at number 8, with its 4 Corinthian pilasters on the ground and 1st floors in 1781. Number 41 is on the corner between Gay Street and Queen Square. It was the home of John Wood, the Younger. One of the main shopping streets is now Milsom Street, which was built in 1762 by Thomas Lightholder. The buildings were originally grand town houses with mansard roofs and Corinthian columns. The bank at number 24 was built by Wilson and Willcox and includes baroque detail not seen on the other buildings. Numbers 37 to 42 which are known as Somersetshire Buildings have been designated as Grade I listed buildings. The Octagon Chapel was a place of worship when it was built in 1767, then a furniture shop by Mallett Antiques, and is now a restaurant. Milsom street leads up hill, from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, which was founded in 1738 as The Mineral Water Hospital, to The Paragon which overlooks the Walcot area. The Paragon was designed by Thomas Warr Attwood. Each building has matching doors and windows with central pediments and flat entablatures either side of the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and pediments to the doorways. Numbers 22 to 37 continue the theme from numbers 1 to 21 and were completed in 1775 by Joseph Axford, a local mason. Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored. St Swithin's Church was built between 1779 and 1790 by John Palmer. The church house which forms number 38 The Paragon was built in the early 18th century. The adjoining cemetery has gates with a rusticated base and panels with inverted torches between pilasters. There is an entablature with metopes and triglyphs. The Ha- ha in front of the Royal Crescent gives an uninterrupted view of the crescent from Royal Victoria Park. The best known of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. But all is not what it seems; while Wood designed the great curved fa√ßade of what appears to be about 30 houses with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor, that was the extent of his input. Each purchaser bought a certain length of the fa√ßade, and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it; hence what appears to be two houses is sometimes one. This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear of the crescent: while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. This \\"Queen Anne fronts and Mary-Anne backs\\" architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath. In front of the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, a trench on which the inner side of which is vertical and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a sunken fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by. The other crescents which give Bath its architectural identity include: Camden Crescent which was built by John Eveleigh in 1788, and damaged by a landslide in 1889, Lansdown Crescent, designed by John Palmer and constructed by a variety of builders between 1789 and 1793, and Somerset Place for which the facades were designed by the architect John Eveleigh who went bankrupt during the building, which started in 1790 but was not completed until the 1820s. Some of Somerset Crescent was destroyed during the Second World War and rebuilt as student accommodation in the 1950s and 1960s. It used to form part of the campus of Bath Spa University, but has since been sold. Engraving of The Pump Room and Baths from a book published in 1864 The area of North Parade, South Parade, Pierrepont and Duke Streets was part of a wider scheme to build a Royal Forum, similar to Queen Square, which was never completed. Wood designed the facade, of Bath stone, after which a variety of builders completed the work with different interiors and rear elevations. Many of the buildings are now hotels and shops whilst some remain as private residences. North Parade Bridge was built almost 100 years later in 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His original bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park. On the southern side of the road is the Roman Catholic St John's Church, which was designed and built between 1861 and 1863 by Charles Francis Hansom who added the spire in 1867. The heart of the Georgian city were Wood's Assembly Rooms, and the Pump Room, which, together with its associated Lower Assembly Rooms, was designed by Thomas Baldwin, a local builder responsible for many other buildings in the city, including the terraces in Argyle Street, the Guildhall, The Cross Bath, Widcombe Crescent and Royal Baths Treatment Centre in Bath Street. The Grand Pump Room itself includes a North Colonnade of 9 bays, with unfluted Ionic columns. The South Colonnade is similar but had an upper floor added in the late 19th century. The colonnades and side wall of the Pump Room have a facade on Stall Street. Baldwin rose rapidly, becoming a leader in Bath's architectural history. Great Pulteney Street, where Baldwin eventually lived, is another of his works: this wide boulevard, constructed and over long and wide, leading from Laura Place is lined on both sides by Georgian terraces. Around 1770 the neoclassical architect Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became not just a means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, is one of the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. A view down Great Pulteney Street, which was commissioned by Sir William Pulteney, towards the Holburne Museum of Art. At the end of Great Pulteney Street is the Holburne Museum of Art, which was originally designed as the Sydney Hotel and was built by Charles Harcourt Masters in 1795‚Äì6. It stands on Sydney Place and within the Sydney Pleasure Gardens which stretch from the road to the Kennet and Avon Canal. Next to the church of St Mary the Virgin is Bathwick Hill which leads up to Claverton Down, including Claverton Manor which was built in the 1820s and is now home to the American Museum in Britain and the University of Bath. The early 18th century saw Bath acquire its first purpose-built theatre, the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of Ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. The population of the city had reached 40,020 by the time of the 1801 census, making it one of the largest cities in Britain, which was expanding up the surrounding hills. William Thomas Beckford bought a house in Lansdown Crescent in 1822, eventually buying a further two houses in the crescent to form his residence. Having acquired all the land between his home and the top of Lansdown Hill, north of the city centre, he created a garden over half a mile in length and built Beckford's Tower at the top. To the west Partis College was built in the Newbridge area as a large block of almshouses between 1825 and 1827. It was founded by Ann and Fletcher Partis for women \\"who had been left in reduced circumstances\\", and still provides accommodation, in 30 terraced houses set around three sides of a quadrangle, for women, aged over 50 in membership of the Church of England. In 1862, George Gilbert Scott redesigned the original chapel, which had been built by Goodrich.  Victorian  Cleveland House and the cast iron bridges of Sydney Gardens In the early 19th century the romantic Gothic Revival style appeared as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism, which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. Many of the new churches, for example, were built in the Gothic style as were a number of new villas. Most of the new civic and retail buildings however continued to be designed in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elaborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have a cohesive look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component. In 1810 the Kennet and Avon Canal opened linking the River Avon at Bath to Reading. Bath Locks mark the divergence of the River Avon and the canal, south of Pulteney Bridge. Alongside the bottom lock are a side pound and a pumping station that pumps water up the locks to replace that used each time the lock is opened. The next stage of Bath Deep Lock is numbered 8/9 as two locks were combined when the canal was restored in 1976. The new chamber has a depth of , making it Britain's deepest canal lock. Just above the 'deep lock' is an area of water enabling the lock to refill and above this is Wash House Lock, followed by Abbey View Lock, by which there is another pumping station and, in quick succession, Pultney Lock and Bath Top Lock. Above the top lock the canal passes through Sydney Gardens including two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800. Cleveland tunnel is long and runs under Cleveland House, the former headquarters of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. A trap-door in the tunnel roof was used to pass paperwork between clerks above and bargees below. Many of the bridges over the canal are also listed buildings. Victoria Bridge which was built in 1836 across the River Avon, was an important early example of a cable-stayed bridge. As the size of the city and numbers of visitors grew new facilities opened. Cleveland Pools in Hampton Row, is a semi-circular lido built, by John Pinch the elder, around 1814. It is believed to be the oldest surviving public outdoor swimming pools in England. The Corridor is one of the world's earliest retail arcades, designed by architect Henry Goodridge and built in 1825, with a glass roof. The High Street end has a Doric colonnade. Each end has marble columns. A musicians gallery, with a wrought iron balustrade and gilt lions heads and garlands, is in the centre of the arcade. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine with Henry Goodridge as the architect. St Michael's Church was rebuilt between 1835 and 1837 and St. Stephen's Church built in Walcot. by James Wilson, between 1840 and 1845. The Bear Flat area south of the city centre was started by the Georgians but the main estate of Poets' Corner is late Victorian and Edwardian. \\"The New Bridge at Bathwick\\" (1830 engraving by FP Hay) The opening of the Great Western Railway in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, and in 1852 the railway company took over its running. Bath Spa railway station is the principal railway station in Bath. It was built in 1840 by Brunel. It is in an asymmetrical Tudor style with curving gables, and lies on the north bank of the Avon, with the line swerving elegantly across from the southern bank to the station and then back again. Green Park railway station opened in 1870 as the terminus of Midland Railway's Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line. For some of its life, it was known as Bath Queen Square. It includes a vaulted glass roof in a single-span wrought iron arch structure. Parts of the distinctive glass roof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the glazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the Beeching Report, passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself is used as a pedestrian passageway to and from the city; there are a number of small shop units in the former station buildings. The Victoria Art Gallery, a free public art museum and library was built between the Guildhall and Pulteney Bridge. It was designed by John McKean Brydon. The exterior of the building includes a statue of Queen Victoria, by A. C. Lucchesi, and friezes of classical figures by George Anderson Lawson.  Twentieth century  The Forum which opened as a cinema in 1934, and has since been converted into a church and concert venue The Empire Hotel was built in 1901 on Orange Grove close to both Bath Abbey and Pulteney Bridge. In the 1920s and 1930s Bath's architectural traditions combined with an art deco style in buildings such as The Forum which opened as a 2,000-seat cinema in 1934, and has since been converted into a church and concert venue. The Royal United Hospital opened in the Weston suburb, about from the city centre in 1932. During World War II, between the evening of 25 April and the early morning of 27 April 1942, Bath suffered three air raids in reprisal for RAF raids on the German cities of L√ºbeck and Rostock, part of the Luftwaffe campaign popularly known as the Baedeker Blitz. Over 400 people were killed, and more than 19,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Houses in the Royal Crescent, Circus and Paragon were burnt out along with the Assembly Rooms, while part of the south side of Queen Square was destroyed. A postwar review of inadequate housing led to the clearance and redevelopment of large areas of the city in a postwar style, often at variance with the Georgian style of the city. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into Bath to enable the development of further housing, much of it council housing such as the Whiteway estate. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance. Thermae Bath Spa: the main building by Grimshaw Architects In the 1960s and early 1970s the way in which some parts of Bath were redeveloped, resulting in the loss of some 18th- and 19th-century buildings, led to a popular campaign to change the way the city was developing, which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson's The Sack of Bath. Since 2000, developments have included the Bath Spa, SouthGate, and the Bath Western Riverside project. Twenty-first century Controversy has continued in recent years with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a mock-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, to make way for the new Bath Bus Station. This was part of the Southgate redevelopment begun in 2007 in which the central 1960s shopping precinct, bus station, and multi-story carpark were demolished and replaced with a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO has asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also says that Bath must do more to attract world-class architecture to any new developments.

Exorcist Darrell was a sizar of Queens' College, Cambridge. In 1586 he exorcised a girl in Derbyshire, and published an account of his work. In 1596‚Äì1597 he conducted further exorcisms, mainly at St Mary's Church, Nottingham, where he was appointed curate by Robert Aldridge, but also in Lancashire, where with others he exorcised demons from seven members of the household of Nicholas Starkey in Tyldesley on 17 and 18 March 1597, and in Staffordshire. Many were sceptical about these cases, especially when Darrell claimed he knew of 13 witches in the town. Prosecution Because of the intense public interest and the fierce arguments in Nottingham, John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury, ordered an investigation. As a result, Darrell was accused of fraudulent exorcism. The prosecutor was Samuel Harsnett, who was to end his career as Archbishop of York. Harsnett's views about Darrell were published in A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures in 1603. Shakespeare read it, and King Lear contains the names of devils, like Flibbertigibbet and Smulkin, taken from Darrell's book. Darrell himself maintained that there was no fraud in his activities. What he wanted to prove was that Puritans were as capable as Roman Catholics in the matter of dispossessing evil spirits. Darrell was deprived of holy orders and sent to prison, but released in 1599.

He disappeared on his way to work, July 5, 1949, and his body was found the next day. Following the discovery of his body, the media offered conflicting explanations involving suicide and murder, while the police did not publicly report the results of their investigation, which was then ended. The Mitaka incident, the Matsukawa derailment, and the Shimoyama incident occurred within one month of one another, and together are known as JNR's Three Big Mysteries. Background Sadanori Shimoyama, bureaucrat of Ministry of Transport (former Ministry of Railways), was appointed the first president of JNR when it was established on June 1, 1949. Under the Dodge Line policy of the government, Shimoyama was responsible for drastic personnel cutbacks of JNR, as a part of which on July 4, 1949 he released a list of about 30,000 employees to be fired. Sadanori Shimoyama On the morning of next day, July 5, Shimoyama left his home in ≈åta, Tokyo around 8:20. On his way to work, he instructed the driver to stop at the Mitsukoshi Department Store in Nihonbashi. Having arrived at the store before its opening, they returned to a Chiyoda Bank office (now The Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ) in front of Tokyo Station. They then followed a circuitous route back to the Mitsukoshi store. Around 9:37 AM, Shimoyama again got out of the official car, telling the driver to wait for five minutes. He quickly entered the Mitsukoshi. This was the last he was heard from. Normally, Shimoyama arrived at JNR headquarters before 9 AM and was greeted by his secretary. On the day of his disappearance, in the tense atmosphere of impending personnel cutbacks, there was an important meeting scheduled at 9 AM. His failure to arrive, after confirming from home that he would be there, caused a great stir at JNR headquarters, and the police were contacted. The investigation began as a missing persons case. On July 6, past 12:30 AM, Shimoyama's dismembered body was found on the J≈çban Line between Kita-Senju Station and Ayase Station. He had been hit by a train. After the disappearance After the disappearance, an individual fitting Shimoyama's description was reported seen first in the Mitsukoshi department store in Nihombashi, then riding on a Ginza Line subway train bound for Asakusa. In the Mitsukoshi store, many people reported having seen him. After 1:40 PM, the individual spoke with a station attendant at Tobu Railway's Gotanno Station, close to where the body was discovered. Following that, from 2 PM until some time past 5 PM, he stopped at Matsuhiro Ryokan, close to the station. There were many reports of a man with Shimoyama's height and clothing walking south along the T≈çbu Isesaki Line from 6 PM until after 8 PM from Gotanno toward the spot in which the body was found. Pre- or postmortem dismemberment Inspection of locomotive D51 651, which hit Shimoyama Found on the outbound track of the J≈çban Line, it was determined that Shimoyama's body had been severed around 20 minutes after midnight by outbound freight train No. 869, pulled by locomotive D51 651. The official autopsy was led by Tokyo University professor of forensic medicine Tanemoto Furuhata. Based on the injuries to the body, it was determined that Shimoyama died prior to being hit by the train. The autopsy itself was performed by Furuhata's colleague Naoki Kuwashima. Although a specific cause of death was not established, blood loss (at another location) was possible due to the lack of blood on the body and at the scene. Additionally, in some parts of the body life-threatening internal bleeding was found which could have been caused only by considerable force, such as kicking. On the other hand, a Tokyo municipal coroner who had examined the body at the scene believed that Shimoyama's death was suicide. However, the internal bleeding observed in the remains of Shimoyama was also consistent with being hit by a train, and investigators would not have been able to observe blood at the scene because it was raining. As such, these as facts are not useful to support a murder theory. Keio University professor Nakadate Ky≈´hei believed that Shimoyama was alive when hit by the train, although he never saw the body. These theories stand in opposition to one another. On August 30, 1949, Furuhata, Nakadate, and Ky≈çsuke Komiya of Nagoya Medical School were called to testify before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Diet's House of Representatives, and in doing so brought the Diet and the world of forensic medicine into the controversy. In response to the committee's questions, Furuhata stated that \\"Kuwashima still cannot officially declare this a murder or suicide. He has stated only that the body was dismembered after death. The investigation is still underway, and those who know nothing of it but make deductions anyway are unscientific and taking liberties.\\" In art and media *The character of Noriyuki Shimokawa in Osamu Tezuka's manga Ayako is modeled on Sadanori Shimoyama. *The Shimoyama incident is one of the central mysteries in Naoki Urasawa's seinen manga Billy Bat.

His position eventually came under scrutiny after he ordered the massacre of 20 people in Courcelles as a reprisal against resistance activity. The move was roundly condemned as being too heavy-handed and Matthys gave up the leadership of the Rexists in favour of Louis Collard.

Isaac, or \\"Ike\\" as he was commonly known, was born in Charleston, Illinois to Stephen Baldwin Smith and Mary Elizabeth Smith (n√©e Sobey). His parents were residents of Port Washington, but had traveled to Illinois in 1856, returning to Long Island when Isaac was two years old. His father was a boat builder and owned the business where Isaac Smith spent his apprenticeship upon the conclusion of the American Civil War, in which his father had served as a pilot aboard the steamship \\"T.V. Arrowsmith\\". After completing his apprenticeship, Isaac Smith opened his own boat building business on Shore Road in Port Washington. It was there that he was to build the first 22 Star Class sailboats during the winter of 1910-11\\\\. The Star Class was designed by Francis Sweisguth from an earlier design by William Gardner, at the prompting of George Arthur \\"Pop\\" Corry ‚Äì known today as the \\"Father of the Stars.\\" The boats originally sold for $240 plus $20 for sails, but due to their high quality they were fetching two-three times that more than 10 years later. Of the original 22 stars, half were purchased by the American Yacht Club of Rye and the rest sold to various clubs on the western end of the sound. Francis Sweisguth (#6) and George Corry (#17) were among the initial owners. Smith continued to build Stars and went on to build over 100 boats during his life. His work continued both through his own business and later through the Sands Point Shipyard, in conjunction with Carl H. Shultz, Martyn Baker, and James P. Ford, until his retirement in 1930. After retiring he continued to make rowboats as a hobby. By the time of his death, Smith's boats were found on both American coasts, in England, Mexico, and Pacific coast of Asia. Isaac Smith was married to Mary Jane Fearon (April 28, 1893-March 25, 1924) on February 16, 1881, with whom he had one son, William Edgar Smith (September 20, 1882-September 23, 1925) and a daughter Helen E. Smith (July 1888-March 3, 1954). Later he married Ida Baxter, former Postmistress of Port Washington and they were still together when he died at his summer home in North Creek, New York on September 27, 1940, of a heart attack. Surprisingly, Smith himself never set sail despite his long career as a boat builder. In 2004 a dedication was made to the first 22 Star boats at the site of Smith's original shipyard. The mayor of Port Washington and other local celebrities attended the dedication which saw the mounting of a Starboat keel on the spot, which is now a public park.

It is based on his extensive lectures on visual form at Bauhaus Staatliche Art School where he was a teacher in between 1921-1931. Originally handwritten ‚Äì as a pile of working notes he used in his lectures ‚Äì it was eventually edited by Walter Gropius, designed by L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy and published in 1925 as a Bauhaus student manual (Bauhausbucher No.2, as the second in the series of the fourteen Bauhaus books) under the original title: P√§dagogisches Skizzenbuch. It was translated into English by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy (in 1953), who also wrote an introduction for it. Along with other Bauhaus books such as Theory of Color (by Johannes Itten) and Point and Line to Plane (by Wassily Kandinsky), Pedagogical Sketchbook is a legacy of teaching methods on art theory and practice at Bauhaus Staatliche Art School. The book is still in print.  Background  During his teaching career at Bauhaus, Klee reflected on his own working methods and techniques. ‚ÄúWhen I came to be teacher‚Äù, he wrote, ‚ÄúI had to account explicitly for what I had been used to doing unconsciously.‚Äù Giedion-Welcker: page 158. He left over 3000 handwritten pages developed as a theoretical basis for his lectures, some of which are still unpublished. From the same period comes another one of his books: The thinking Eye, dealing with the same issues as Pedagogical Sketchbook, but much more extensive in scope. However, this book was published and translated later, after his death (1956; trans. 1961).  Teaching concept  Pedagogical Sketchbook is an intuitive art investigation of dynamic principles in visual arts. Klee takes his students on an ‚Äòadventure in seeing‚ÄôMoholy-Nagy: concluding note. guiding them step-by-step through a challenging conceptual framework. Objects are rendered in a complex relation to physical and intellectual space concepts. It is an exercise in modern art thinking. In her introduction, Sibyl Moholy-Nagy divides the book into 4 different parts corresponding to the 4 conceptual frameworks. Each framework is illustrated by intricate drawings (mixture of what looks like creative arithmetic or geometry sketches, scribbles and mental notes). Starting chapter concerns ‚ÄòLine and Structure‚Äô. A dot goes for a walk‚Ä¶ freely and without a goal.Moholy-Nagy: page 16. Dot is a ‚Äúpoint of progression‚Äù and by shifting its position forward becomes a line. Line variations lead to even more complex structures. It can move freely in a calligraphic stroke, or circumscribe, act as a planar definition, as a mathematical structural element (as in Golden Section) or as a path in motion (when it coordinates kinetic movements such as in muscle contraction). Artist's world is dynamic ‚Äì in the state of becoming ‚Äì rather than static. In ‚ÄòDimension and Balance‚Äô, the line is related to psychological and social concepts of space. Klee explains subjectivity of our perception by comparing examples of optical illusion with horizon and perspective. We use them as orientation points within the space. As an illustration, Klee uses a stylized drawing representing a tightrope walker with a bamboo stick as a ‚Äòhorizon‚Äô point, keeping his balance. These examples evoke our reality as constructed and arbitrary. ‚ÄúDimension is in itself nothing but an arbitrary expansion of form into height, width, depth and time‚Äù.Moholy-Nagy: page 10. By challenging conventional perception of his students, Klee shows them a way ‚Äòbeyond‚Äô physical realm, into the world of metaphysical and spiritual. It is an invitation to approach art intuitively, since outer perception can be deceptive (socially constructed). The third part is about ‚ÄúGravitational Curve‚Äù. A very first drawing of a strong black arrow pointing downwards postulates man as a tragic figure always brought down by a plummet (a black arrow) of a gravitational force. However, Klee also points that water and atmosphere are transitional regions, where spirit gets lighter and breaks free. This is a spiritual space open to dynamic positions, new symbols and imaginative co-relations of visual elements (mechanical law of nature versus imaginative vision rendering of an object in art). Continuing further into the final part of the manual ‚ÄòKinetic and Chromatic Energy‚Äô, Klee gives examples of ‚Äòcreative kinetics‚Äô defying gravitational force such as centripetal force in pendulum and spinning top, or a ‚Äòfeathered arrow‚Äô.Moholy-Nagy: page 54. He continues with a ‚Äòsymbolic‚Äô arrow illustrating similar efforts of a man to move ‚Äòa bit further than customary ‚Äì further than possible‚Äô. Last drawings in the book are related to chromatic and thermo-dynamic field where a color is put in relation to motion: ‚ÄúMotion that may be called infinitive‚Ä¶exists only in the activation of color moving between the fervid contrasts of utter black and utter white‚Äù.Moholy-Nagy: page 11.
