Development The Avro Baby was a single-bay biplane of conventional configuration with a wire-braced wooden structure covered in canvas. It had equal-span, unstaggered wings which each carried two pairs of ailerons. Initially, the aircraft was finless and had a rudder of almost circular shape. There were later variations of this. The main undercarriage was a single-axle arrangement and with a tailskid.Taylor 1989, p. 93. The first Babies were powered by a water-cooled inline Green C.4 engine of pre-1914 design that had previously been installed in the Avro Type D, though thoroughly remodelled postwar by the Green Engine Co. Ltd.Jackson 1990, p. 165. It produced 35 hp (26 kW). Most of the later Babies also used this engine design, new-built from original Green drawings by Peter Brotherhood Limited of Peterborough, though some variants used either a 60 hp (45 kW) ADC Cirrus 1 or an 80 hp (60 kW) le Rhone. These new-build Greens were about 6 lb (3 kg) lighter. The prototype first flew on 30 April 1919 from Avro's Hamble airfield. It crashed on the nearby foreshore two minutes into the flight due to pilot error. The second prototype flew successfully on 31 May 1919. The type 534A Water Baby was a floatplane version with an altered rudder and large fin. The fourth (counting the short-lived prototype) Baby was designated Type 534B, distinguished by its plywood-covered fuselage and reduced-span lower wing. The Type 534C had both wings clipped for racing in the 1921 Aerial Derby. The 534D was a Baby modified for hot climates and was used by a businessman in India. All 534s were Green-engined single-seaters.Jackson 1990, p. 167. The Type 543 Baby was a two-seater with a 2 ft 6 in (76 cm) fuselage extension. It too was initially Green-powered, but in 1926, this was replaced by an 80 hp (60 kW) ADC Cirrus 1 air-cooled upright inline engine.Jackson 1990, p. 166. Avro 554 Antarctic Baby photo from L'Aerophile February,1922 The final version of the Baby was the type 554 Antarctic Baby, built as photographic aircraft for the 1921‚Äì1922 Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to Antarctica. This had an 80 hp (60 kW) le Rhone engine, raised tailplanes, rounded wingtips and tubular steel struts replacing rigging wires to avoid the problems of tensioning rigging wires with gloved hands. Like the Water Baby, it was a floatplane.Jackson 1990, pp. 169‚Äì170. By far the strangest Baby was one modified by H.G. Leigh in 1920.Jackson 1990, pp. 170, 172. The original wings were removed and instead the aircraft had a short, conventional, shoulder-mounted wing, bearing projecting, full-span ailerons. Above it was a strongly forward-staggered stack of six very narrow- chord wings of about the same span as the lower wing, hence each of very high aspect ratio and therefore with low induced drag. This complicated structure added about 60 lb (30 kg) to the weight. This \\"Venetian blind\\" wing design was proposed and previously explored by Horatio Phillips in the last decade of the 19th century.Taylor 1955, image 49. Operational history The Babies were raced in the early 1920s by a variety of pilots but are best remembered for the flights of G-EACQ in the hands of Bert Hinkler. On 31 May 1920 he made a non-stop flight from Croydon to Turin in 9 hours 30 minutes ‚Äì a flight of 655 mi (1,050 km) and celebrated at the time as \\"the most meritorious flight on record\\". On 24 July, he won second place in the handicap category of the Aerial Derby at Hendon, and on 11 April 1921 set a new distance record in Australia when he flew the Baby non-stop from Sydney to his home town of Bundaberg 800 mi (1,288 km) away, making the flight in 8 hours 40 minutes. Hinkler's Baby is preserved at the Hinkler Hall of Aviation in Bundaberg. In June 1922, another Baby made the first flight between London and Moscow when the Russian Gwaiter collected his machine from Hamble and flew it home. The Antarctic Baby (or most of it) accompanied Ernest Shackleton on his final expedition to the Antarctic. Unfortunately, their ship, the Quest, delayed by engine trouble was not able to pick up the missing parts previously transported to Rio de Janeiro and the Avro was not used at the Pole.

It was founded in 1952 by Panagiotis Pagoulatos from Cephalonia, who had left war-torn Greece during WWII, and his wife Flora, who was from the community of the Greeks in Egypt, specifically from Alexandria. Since there was a sizeable community of Greeks in Sudan at the time as well, the couple settled in the Anglo-Egyptian colony. The Washington Post writes: > \\"During the day, he was employed by the British government. After hours, he > worked as a private accountant, soon amassing enough capital to open a night > club just opposite the governor's palace\\". \\"Love + Thanks\\" from Bob Geldof to the Acropole Historical sticker on vintage suitcase When the governor had the \\"Great Britain Bar\\" closed because of the noise, the couple took over a liquor dealership, opened a wine store, a confectionery shop, and then the Acropole, which soon expanded. The confectionery shop closed in 1967, when it was damaged in an anti-government protest. The same year, Panagiotis died and the three sons - Thanasis, George, and Gerasimos (\\"Mike\\") - took over the business: > ‚ÄúWith their mother‚Äôs guidance and their hard work, they managed to turn the > hotel into an actual treasure of the city‚Äôs cultural and touristic life.‚Äù Unlike many other Greek-Sudanese enterprises, the Acropole was spared from the policies of nationalisation following the 1969 coup d'√©tat, since it was housed in a rented building. It suffered from the worsening economic crisis, but profited from the pro-Western swing after the failed 1971 coup d'√©tat by parts of the Sudanese Communist Party. Yet in 1983 again, the Acropole lost part of its business, when dictator Gaafar Nimeiry introduced the draconic \\"September Laws\\" under the label of Sharia and had all beverages dumped into the Blue Nile. Until then, the Acropole had been the distributor of Amstel beer in the country.leftFollowing the devastating 1984/85 famines in Darfur and Ethiopia, the Acropole became the base for many international non- governmental organisations, since it was the only hotel with reliable telephone, telex and fax lines. A framed letter from the Band Aid founder Bob Geldof on the wall of the hotel office gives evidence of his appreciation for the support by the Pagoulatos family and their staff, and Sudanese network. They also scrounged up goods for Oxfam and Save the Children to get to the camps. The author Edward Girardet described the hotel in 1985 as follows: The management office (2016) > \\"From the outside the Acropole is totally unassuming: just another one of > the drab, mustard-colored buildings that line the dusty, potholed streets in > the heart of the Sudanese capital. Yet the Acropole's halls, rooms, and > streetside balconies are spotlessly clean, simply but tastefully decorated > in an airy, almost graceful 1930s Art Deco style.\\" Gallery of historical photographs in the hotel restaurant (2015) On 15 May 1988, the Acropole was shocked by tragedy, when a terrorist commando of the Abu Nidal group bombed the restaurant, killing a British couple with their two children, another Briton, and two Sudanese workers, leaving 21 people injured. According to The Economist, the attack on the soft target, which was well known for hosting many Westerners, was \\"in apparent revenge for the Israeli assassination in Tunisia of the PLO military leader Khalil al-Wazir.\\" Five members of the group were arrested and convicted. Their death-sentences were turned into prison-time, when the relatives of the Sudanese victims agreed to the payment of \\"blood money\\". In January 1991, shortly before the Gulf War started, the new regime of the Islamist leader Hassan Al Turabi released the five. The lobby (2016) Nevertheless, the Pagoulatos brothers managed to restore the hotel in a building just opposite the ruins of the old one. It has remained since then one of the most popular places for Western visitors, particularly journalists, archaeologists, and NGO workers. For this reason, the Acropole appears frequently in travel books.The Honorary Consulate of Greece at the AcropoleWhen notorious filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl's helicopter crashed in the Nuba mountains in early 2000 at the age of 97, the Pagoulatos brothers found her a Sudan Airways captain and plane to rescue her and the crew, and had an ambulance waiting at the airport. An added attraction is the OHM electronics shop next door, which is owned by the brother of Sheikh Musa Hilal, previously the leader of Darfur's notorious Janjaweed militia. Several journalists and members of human rights organizations have managed to interview Hilal in that shop. Bidoun online magazine Paper-set After the embassy of the Hellenic Republic was closed in September 2015, Greece's new diplomatic representative as Honorary Consul became Gerasimos Pagoulatos, with the Honorary Consulate based at the Acropole Hotel. At the 2016 Venice Biennale of Architecture, George Pagoulatos was featured in the presentation of Sir David Chipperfield's design for a museum at the UNESCO world heritage site of Naga along with portrays of other people who are related to the archeological project, photographed by German photographer Heinrich Voelkel of the Berlin-based Ostkreuz photo agency. The caption of the image read: > ‚ÄúI have been getting up at 5:30 a.m. for the last 50 years. My wife looks > after me very well, she is my right hand, my left hand ‚Äì an inspiration to > me.

He played in the majors from 1902 to 1912 for the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and St. Louis Cardinals. Early life Ewing was born on April 24, 1873, in New Hampshire, Ohio. He grew up on a farm in Auglaize County where as a young boy, he pitched potatoes against a target on a barn. The nickname Long Bob came about due to him being . Later he would be given the moniker of 'Old Wapak', in reference to the town he called home. Bob started his baseball career at a relatively late age, 24, before signing his first contract. Long Bob played his first game away from New Hampshire in 1895 at the Wapakoneta fairgrounds. He then played for Wapakoneta from 1896 to 1897. Ewing's first semi-pro experience was in August 1897, when he joined the Toledo Mud Hens team in the Interstate League. His professional debut with a 9‚Äì4 victory over Springfield, Ohio. He was consistently the best pitcher in the league, going 21‚Äì9 and 25‚Äì13 in consecutive seasons. Over the next three seasons, Ewing pitched nearly 900 innings and won more than 20 games annually for Toledo. In 1901, he next went out to Kansas City in the Western League where he went 21‚Äì5 and led the Western League in winning percentage. With Ewing, the Blues won the pennant by 10 games. Ewing later recalled that Kansas City was \\"...the only pennant winning team I ever played on.\\" The Cincinnati Reds While at home from Kansas City, Bob played ball with a local club in Sidney, Ohio. On October 10, 1901, the Cincinnati Reds arrived in Sidney after going through local Ohio teams looking to find some competition with the Sidney semi-pro team. As the Reds warmed up, they could not have anticipated what they were about to see. The visitors were up to bat first. On the mound stood all 6-feet-6-inches of Long Bob Ewing. Ewing dueled Schwab, his Reds counterpart, to a 3‚Äì3 tie when the game was called because of darkness after eight innings. Ewing struck out many more batters than Schwab. Within two weeks he was under contract to the Cincinnati Reds. Long Bob Ewing made his major league game debut on April 19, 1902. He walked ten batters, seven of them in one inning, in a 9‚Äì5 loss to Chicago. It was nearly a month before he gained his first victory; then he missed the second half of the season with a sore arm. Bob fought for a place on the roster the next two seasons before establishing himself as one of the Reds' top pitchers. Ewing finished with a 6 and 6 won-lost record. He pitched ten complete games in 12 starts and compiled a fine 2.98 earned run average. A sore arm limited his playing time toward the end of the season. In 1903, Long Bob developed into the workhorse of the staff. Completing 27 of the 28 games he started, Ewing posted 14 wins and lowered his ERA to 2.73. He delivered at the plate as well. That season, Ewing hit .253. The season's highlight came on August 18, 1903. The headline in the \\"Cincinnati Post\\" told the story: \\"Kelley Claims Ewing Pitched a No-Hitter\\" He blanked the New York Giants 7-0, giving up one infield hit by Jack Dunn in the eighth inning. The official scorer recorded the play as an out, but was ordered to score it as a hit. A dispatch from New York after the game stated: \\"Long Bob Ewing, fed on raw meat and clams for a week, was taken out of his cage and sent against the Giants...Old Wapak fired the leather down the alley so fast that the haze in its wake looked like the smoke in a shooting gallery.\\" A seasoned and confident Bob Ewing barnstormed with the Reds after the season concluded. On September 30, 1903, the Cincinnati Reds came to Sidney for a rematch. Long Bob was on the mound for Reds, which had just pummeled Lima 9-1 the day before. After the game, the \\"Journal's\\" editor, William Binkley, wryly observed that the Reds came to town to show \\"...what a difference there is between a professional team and pumpkin puller aggregations in smaller towns...and to prick what bubbles of vanity they entertain.\\" After Long Bob took his seat at the end of the first inning, Sidney led 5-1. Binkley chortled: \\"The Reds were amazed, and in a figurative sense, more blue than red.\\" The Reds outfielders were \\"as busy as a cow's tail in fly time\\", according to Binkley, while Sidney's infielders \\"guarded the infield like watch dogs fed on electricity.\\" In the end, Long Bob and the Reds absorbed a 14-2 beating. Mr. Binkley appropriately summed up the event: \\"In short, the Reds were outclassed, the spectators were given a treat of rare sport, and the visitors gracefully acknowledged the corn.\\" The Cincinnati Reds returned to Sidney the next year for what the Wapakoneta newspaper described as \\"Ewing Day in Sidney.\\" Fifty wagons circled the court square, and banners proclaiming 'Ewing Day' were hung everywhere. A local baker sold 'Ewing pies' and bartenders served 'Ewing highballs.' Two thousand fans jammed the ball field. As the first Sidney batter whiffed, the crowd screamed: \\"Don't throw so hard, you'll kill the catcher!\\" Ewing and the Reds prevailed, 6-1. In professional baseball after the turn of the century, the spitball was a legal pitch and Ewing was known as having one of the best in the majors. By late 1904 Ewing became one of the National League's first notable exponents of the wet one. A newspaper writer of the era described him as also having \\"great speed and a puzzling drop curve.\\" With that new weapon he enjoyed his best year in 1905, securing his 20th victory in the last game of the season. Long Bob won 20 games in 34 starts with only 11 losses during the 1905 season. He still batted over .250. On September 11, 1906, Ewing dueled Deacon Phillippe and Vic Willis to a scoreless tie in Pittsburgh, scattering eight hits over 15 innings. He ended 1906 with an ERA of 2.38 and almost 300 innings pitched. The highlight of the 1907 season came early when he was handed the ball for opening day on April 11, 1907. The opponent was the Pittsburgh Pirates, led by the immortal future hall-of-famer Honus Wagner. Ewing pitched a complete game, four hit, 4-3 victory. In what he always viewed as the highlight of his career, Ewing fanned the first six Pirate batters he faced, including such outstanding hitters as Wagner, Fred Clarke and Ginger Beaumont. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that \\"He used the spitball when he found himself in a tight place and it was very effective in his hands.\\" The Reds come from behind with two runs in the ninth inning. Long Bob did his best to ensure his own success in 1907. Pitching over 330 innings, he compiled a career-best ERA of 1.73 and averaged almost twice as many strikeouts as bases on balls. Although he won 17 games, little offensive help from his teammates resulted in 19 losses. Ewing accomplished all this at the age of 34 that year. Bob Ewing concluded his career with the Reds after the 1909 season. In his eight-year stint with the Cincinnati club, he compiled an overall earned run average of 2.37. His ERA currently stands as the best Reds' career ERA record ever compiled. Philadelphia On January 20, 1910, the Reds traded Ewing to the Philadelphia Phillies in a two-for-two swap of pitchers-Ewing and Ad Brennan for Harry Coveleski and Frank Corridon. In Philadelphia, Long Bob was an afterthought in manager Red Dooin's plans. But when other pitchers faltered, Ewing stepped up. The oldest regular starting pitcher in the league, he went 16‚Äì14 for a fourth-place team which led the Phillies in complete games and pitching three games in which he allowed three hits or fewer. Philadelphia dropped him in September 1911.Lackey, p. 249 St. Louis & Minneapolis Roger Bresnahan gave Ewing a brief look in St. Louis in 1912, the aging spitballer returned to the minor leagues. Now 39 years old, Long Bob appeared in just one game. He reached the end of the line in 1913, failing in a trial with minor- league Minneapolis and drawing his release two weeks after his 40th birthday without appearing in a single game. Married Life On November 5, 1905, Bob married Nelle Hunter, the daughter of a prominent Auglaize County physician. The society pages of a Cincinnati paper described as being a \\"handsome and clever society girl.\\" She was an avid baseball fan in her own right. Beginning in the 1890s, she attended what was at the time a major league record of more than 60 straight opening day games of the Reds. She had equal measures of loyalty and superstition, however. Nelle watched several games in 1905 that her husband lost. After that, she refused to go to the park when Ewing pitched, claiming her presence would 'hoodoo' him, according to the newspaper accounts. Bob and Nelle had a son Robert, who married Sylvia Metzger. They had nine children: Christine, Coleen, Charles, Carol, Chris, Charlotte, Cliff, Cindy and Connie. Life After Baseball Ewing returned home and agreed to pitch two games for his hometown team, the Wapakoneta Reds. He had just turned 40 years old when he took the mound to face the Findlay semi-pro team on May 17, 1913. Five hundred paying fans saw Ewing strike out 12 batters while strolling to a 10-0 win. The most important game was to follow, for next up was Wapak's dreaded arch rival, the Botkins Reds. To turn the pressure up a notch on Botkins, Wapak declared game day to be 'Ewing Day'. As he stepped in for his first at bat, time was called and Ewing was presented with a horn- grip, gold-mounted umbrella engraved \\"Bob, 1913.\\" The crowd cheered lustily. Ewing struck out. Wapak eked out a 4-3 win. It was Long Bob's last local pitching appearance. After hanging up his baseball spikes, Ewing returned to his off-season occupation of farming. He was an expert horseman as well, raising trotters which competed in races throughout the Midwest. Bob Ewing was elected to two terms as the Auglaize County Sheriff and later ran the Brunswick Cigar Store in Wapak. Long Bob Ewing died of cancer on June 20, 1947, at age 74. Nelle, his wife of 42 years, survived him by a quarter- century, becoming something of a celebrity in Wapakoneta. She also remained an avid Reds fan, living to meet Pete Rose and Johnny Bench and to see the dawn of the Big Red Machine dynasty of the 1970s. She attended more than 60 consecutive opening day games before her own death on February 15, 1972, at age 91. Bob and Nelle Ewing are buried in Walnut Hill Cemetery near New Hampshire, Ohio under a common headstone decorated with a baseball and bat.Lackey, p. 293 Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame On August 12, 2001, all eight of Ewing's surviving grandchildren were present at Cinergy Field for his induction into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame along with Mario Soto.

During World War II, he and his brother Robert, worked as naval architects at the Charlestown Navy Yard. In 1946, he and his brother, co-founded Beacon Construction Company; they began with the remodeling of stores but soon expanded into larger projects including 40 toll booths on the New York State Thruway, the construction of post offices nationwide and then into the construction of public and military housing including at Fort Devens. In 1972, his brother Robert died at the age of 58 and his sons, Alan and Mark, and son-in-law Bill Sidman (who died in 2005) joined the firm renamed The Beacon Companies. At Beacon, Leventhal helped direct several major civic improvement projects in Boston, including Rowes Wharf, Center Plaza, One Post Office Square, and 5,100 units of affordable housing. Beacon's conversion of Post Office Square from a -story parking garage to a lush park, with parking underground, in 1992 is considered emblematic of Leventhal's vision: to enliven and make hospitable Boston's public spaces. \\"We must constantly work to find ways to make the riches of Boston available to all her citizens, not just the most fortunate among us,\\" he was quoted in a 1997 Boston Globe article. Post Office Square Park was dedicated and named Norman B. Leventhal Park the same year. As chairman of the Trust for City Hall Plaza, Leventhal led the effort to revitalize that center.

It concentrated on increasing the heavy industry sector. By 1950 the Polish government was dominated by Stalinist hardliners, such as Hilary Minc, and liberal economists responsible for creation of the Three-Year Plan were no longer influencing government policy. The Six-Year Plan, designed to bring the economy of Poland in line with the Soviet economy, concentrated on heavy industrialization, with projects such as Nowa Huta. The plan was accepted by the Sejm on July 21, 1950. Later on, it was modified several times, and never fully completed. Polish society paid a heavy price for badly thought-out and quick industrialization. Living standards were reduced, since investments in other fields, such as construction, were cut. In agriculture, the idea of collectivization was promoted, to the protests of Polish farmers. The plan was fashioned after similar Soviet plans, and was based on certain Soviet-style principles, such as central planning of economy, limiting the so-called Capitalist elements, and close cooperation with other Eastern Bloc nations. New urban districts were built in big cities, attracting residents of overpopulated villages. At the same time, however, the balance between supply and demand deepened, and shortages of basic products were common. As a result, rationing was re-introduced in the early 1950s. The only real achievement of the Six-Year Plan was quick development of heavy industry. At the same time, however, other fields of Polish economy, such as services and food industry, remained underdeveloped, as all state funds were directed at construction of shipyards, steel plants, chemical plants and car factories. Among major investments of the plan are: * Skawina Aluminum Factory, * development of Oswiecim Chemical Works (formerly Buna Werke), * development of Zaklady Azotowe Kedzierzyn (formerly IG Farben Heydebreck), * development of Synthetic Fibres Plant Stilon Gorzow Wielkopolski (formerly IG Farben-Werks Landsberg (Warthe)), * Shoe Factory at Nowy Targ, * Lenin Steelworks at Nowa Huta, * Warsaw Steelworks, * FSO Warszawa, * FSC Lublin, * FSC Star at Starachowice, * Wierzbica Cement Plant, * development of Jaworzno Power Station, * development of Czestochowa Steelworks, * development of Gdansk Shipyard (formerly Schichau-Werft and Danziger Werft), * development of Szczecin Shipyard (formerly AG Vulcan Stettin).

Career Griffin was selected in the 1st round (4th overall) in the 1966 January Regular Baseball Draft by the Houston Astros out of Grant High School (Los Angeles) California. Griffin made his debut on April 10, 1969 against the San Diego Padres. He pitched seven innings while striking out eight and walking five and allowing two runs on three hits, but the Padres prevailed 2-0. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SDN/SDN196904100.shtml In that season, he would go 11-10 with a 3.54 ERA in 31 games, pitching 188.1 innings while striking out 200 batters and walking 93, with the latter two being highs for Griffin. Two additional pitchers in Larry Dierker and Don Wilson joined him in having at least 200 strikeouts, the second team to ever have three 200+ strikeout pitchers. It took the final start of the year for Griffin to reach the 200 plateau, which he did with his sixth strikeout of the September 28th game against the Cincinnati Reds, doing so against Woody Woodward in the sixth in a 4-1 loss. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN196909280.shtml He led the league in strikeouts per nine innings with 9.6. He would regress significantly in the next few seasons. In 1970, he pitched in 23 games while having a 3-13 record with a 5.74 ERA in 111.1 innings, having 72 walks and strikeouts and 13 wild pitches (6th in the National League).

He went 14-10 with a 3.54 ERA in 34 games (all starts) in 211 innings with a career-high eight complete games. He struck out 110 batters and walked 89 (both peaks that would never be that high in his remaining eight years). He was 8th in shutouts with three while 5th in wild pitches with 11 and 3rd in errors with 8th. On May 7, 1974, Griffin threw a one-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates.Griffins's one hitter makes Astros smile.

In 20 games for the Astros (two starts), he went 5-3 with a 6.05 ERA in 41.2 innings, striking out 33 with 37 walks. Griffin was taken on waivers by the Padres on August 3, 1976.

He was released by the team after the end of the 1978 season. He signed on with the San Francisco Giants on April 4, 1979. He went 5-6 that year, having a 3.91 ERA in 59 games (3 starts) as he garnered two saves in 94.1 innings, striking out 82 with 46 walks. The following year, he went 5-1 with a 2.76 ERA in 42 games (four starts) in 107.2 innings as he struck out 79 with 49 walks, although he led the league in hit batsmen with eight. In 1981, he went 8-8 with a 3.76 ERA in 22 games (all starts) in 129.1 innings while striking out 83 and walking 57 and leading the league in hit batsmen with seven.

He pitched for the Washington Senators (1909‚Äì1913), St. Louis Terriers (Federal League, 1914‚Äì1915), St. Louis Browns (1916‚Äì1917), and Cleveland Indians (1918). Biography Groom as a member of the Cleveland Indians in 1918. On May 6, 1917, while with the Browns, Groom no-hit the eventual World Champion Chicago White Sox 3‚Äì0. The no-hitter came in the second game of Sunday double-header, after Groom preserved the win in the first game, pitching the last two innings without allowing a hit. It also came the day after teammate Ernie Koob's 1‚Äì0 no-hitter against the White Sox; to date, Koob and Groom are the only teammates to pitch no-hitters on consecutive days. His best major league season was with the 1912 Senators, when he won 24 games and Washington finished second in the American League. During his debut season, Groom became the first pitcher to achieve 19 consecutive losses in a season, a record which was equalled in 1916 by Jack Nabors. After the 1918 season, Bob Groom returned to Belleville, where he managed his family's coal mining operation and, in the summers, pitched for and managed local teams into the 1920s, most notably Belleville's White Rose team. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was involved with the St. Louis Trolley League as a mentor, and in 1938, he was asked by the George E.

Due to the influence and domination of the Inca Empire, Yanesha' has many loanwords from Quechua, including some core vocabulary. Yanesha' may also have been influenced by Quechua's vowel system so that, today, it has a three-vowel system rather than a four-vowel one that is typical of related Arawakan languages. There are also many loanwords from Kampa languages.Ramirez, Henri (2019). Enciclop√©dia das l√≠nguas arawak: acrescida de seis novas l√≠nguas e dois bancos de dados. (in press) Phonology Yanesha' has 22 consonants and 9 vowel phonemes. The consonants have a certain degree of allophonic variation while that of the vowels is more considerable. =Consonants= { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Bilabial ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Alveolar ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Retroflex ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Palatal ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Velar - ! plain ! palatalized - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Nasal  m  mÃÉ  n  √±  2 - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Stop  p  pÃÉ  t  tÃÉ / cÃÉ 1 c/qu - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Affricate 1  ts  cÃàh  ch - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Fricative ! voiceless  s  sh  j - ! voiced  b  bÃÉ  rr  gu√´  g - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Flap  r - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Approximant ! central  y  hu/u - ! lateral  ll } #The affricates and are phonetically aspirated # is an allophone of before Yanesha', similar to languages like Russian, Irish, and Marshallese, makes contrasts between certain pairs of palatalized and plain consonants: * anapÃÉ ('he answered him') vs. anap ('he answered') * esho'ta netsorramÃÉo ('entered my saw') vs. esho'ta nenamo ('entered my mouth') * √±a ('he') vs. na ('I') The remaining two palatalized consonants, and , don‚Äôt offer a one-to-one contrast with plain consonants; the former because it is the only lateral consonant and so contrasts with no other phoneme on the basis of just palatalization; , while contrasting with , also contrasts with , , and . The bilabial palatalized consonants have a more perceptible palatal offglide than the alveolar ones. Word-finally, this offglide is voiceless for and while being absent for . Another general feature of Yanesha' is devoicing in certain contexts. In addition to the devoicing of palatal offglides above, the retroflex fricative is voiceless when word final (final devoicing) or before a voiceless consonant (regressive assimilation): arrpa ('here it is') ‚Üí . The approximants and are voiceless before voiceless stops, as in huautena ('barks') and neytarr ('my door'); is also voiceless before affricates and word-finally: ahuey ('let's go'). Similarly, the stops , , and are aspirated word-finally ellap ('shotgun') ‚Üí ; preceding another stop or an affricate, a stop may be aspirated or unreleased so that etqu√´ll ('a fish') is realized as or . The velar fricative is debuccalized to before another consonant. =Vowels= Yanesha' has three basic vowel qualities, , , and . Each contrasts phonemically between short, long, and \\"laryngeal\\" or glottalized forms. Laryngealization generally consists of glottalization of the vowel in question, creating a kind of creaky voice. In pre-final contexts, a variation occurs‚Äîespecially before voiced consonants‚Äîranging from creaky phonation throughout the vowel to a sequence of a vowel, glottal stop, and a slightly rearticulated vowel: ma'√±orr ('deer') ‚Üí . Before a word-final nasal, this rearticulated vowel may be realized as a syllabic quality of said nasal. Also, although not as long as a phonemically long vowel, laryngeal vowels are generally longer than short ones. When absolutely word-final, laryngealized vowels differ from short ones only by the presence of a following glottal stop. Each vowel varies in its phonetic qualities, having contextual allophones as well as phones in free variation with each other: is the short phoneme consisting of phones that are front and close to close-mid. Generally, it is realized as close when following bilabial consonants. Otherwise, the phones and are in free variation with each other so that ('my brother') may be realized as either or . is the long counterpart to . It differs almost solely in its length, although when it follows it becomes a sort of diphthong with the first element being identical in vowel height while being more retracted so that qu√´' ('large kind of parrot') is realized as . Laryngeal consists of the same variation and allophony of the short phoneme with the minor exception that it is more likely to be realized as close following as in pe'sherr ('parakeet') ‚Üí 'parakeet' is the short phoneme consisting of phones that are central. Its most frequent realization is that of an open central unrounded vowel (represented hereafter without the centralizing diacritic). Before , there is free variation between this and so that nanac ('exceedingly') may be realized as or . While the laryngeal counterpart is qualitatively identical to the short, the long counterpart, , differs only in that is not a potential realization. is the short phoneme consisting of phones that are back as well as rounded. Generally, and are in free variation so that oyua ('wild pig') may be realized as or . The phone is another potential realization, although it most frequently occurs before stops so that not ('my hand') may be realized as . is not a potential realization of long but both the long and laryngeal counterparts are otherwise qualitatively identical to short . =Phonotactics= All consonants appear initially, medially, and finally with the exception that and do not occur word-finally. With two exceptions ( and ), initial clusters include at least one stop. The other possible initial clusters are: * , , , * , , , Word final clusters consist of either a nasal or followed by a plosive or affricate: * , , , , , Medial clusters may be of two or three consonants. =Stress= Although apparently phonemic, stress tends to occur on the penultimate syllable but also in the ultimate. Less frequently, it is antepenultimate. Some words, like ocÃàhen ('comb'), have stress in free variation.

A jailed prostitute had her blood drawn without consent and to prevent a public outcry BAYSWAN and COYOTE brokered a deal with the SFDPH. Presenting Priscilla Alexander's paper on sex worker occupational health and safety they reached an agreement that the SFDPH would \\"have access to information about the occupational hazards and health status of sex industry workers but only if that research was developed by and with the input of sex industry workers themselves. There would be no more non-consensual blood draws in jail; sex workers would have the opportunity to run their own occupational health and safety clinic.\\" \\"The St. James Infirmary is a peer-based Occupational Safety & Health Clinic for sex workers, and was founded in 1999 by COYOTE as a joint project between Exotic Dancers Alliance (EDA) and the STD Prevention and Control Services of the City and County of San Francisco Department of Public Health.

In an op-ed essay Leigh pointed out previous police efforts and mistakes while educating about how mislabeling and forcing the women to either testify that they were prostitutes or illegal aliens. She stated, \\"Before we buy into the \\"sex slave\\" melodrama, we should consider the complexities of sex work, migration and trafficking. Framing the range of abuses in the sex industry as a moralistic concern about \\"sex slaves\\" obscures the real violations (and advantages) of this industry. Until we can begin to support rights for migrant workers and craft policies to support their needs to work, we are stuck in a quagmire that attracts, then rescues \\"innocent victims.\\" =Proposed federal legislation to tax sex workers= Leigh, cofounder and director of BAYSWAN, who is also a bisexual feminist author and artist, criticized 2006 proposed legislation introduced by U.S. Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee as being shortsighted.

Hamilton, a right back, was signed for Dundee by manager Willie Thornton and made his league debut in a 7‚Äì1 win over Airdrieonians in 1957. He remained with Dundee for ten years, winning the League title in 1961‚Äì62 and reaching the Scottish Cup final in 1963‚Äì64.They Wore The Dark Blue For Club and Country ‚Äì Alex Hamilton Dundee FC, 15 November 2015 During his time at Dens Park, Hamilton won 24 caps for the Scotland national team. He made his international debut in a 2-1 win over Wales in November 1961. In his 24 appearances for Scotland, Hamilton finished on the winning side on 13 occasions. His final appearance for Scotland was in a 2-1 defeat to Poland in October 1965. He also represented the Scottish League XI. Hamilton was also a noted singer and was the frontman of a band comprising several of his Dundee teammates, including future Scotland manager Craig Brown. \\"Hammy and the Hamsters\\" success was restricted to the local Dundee area however, and they only released one record. Hamilton left Dundee in 1967 to join Durban United in the South African soccer league. When Durban Spurs merged with Durban United to become Durban Spurs United, Hamilton - together with a number of other players that were surplus to the merged entity's requirements - joined the then newly-promoted East London Celtic. He played with distinction for East London Celtic which later became East London United. Always colourful and controversial, one of his more memorable games was when East London Celtic thrashed Cape Town City 6-3. Towards the end of the game, with Cape Town City players back-pedalling furiously in fear of conceding a seventh goal, Alex Hamilton - with the ball at his feet - decided to show his disdain for the opposition by sitting down on the ball. He later apologised for these actions. East London Celtic, and later as East London United, were something of a bogey side for Cape Town City. In one memorable game at the Border Rugby Union stadium in East London, despite being packed with stars such as George Eastham, Cape Town City lost once again. Alex Hamilton later managed junior side Dundee Violet before returning to South Africa briefly during which time he managed East London United. He returned to Dundee in 1988 and was back at Dens Park for a spell running the club's lottery. Hamilton died at his home in Broughty Ferry in 1990 aged 54.

This site is one of the volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which extends from the southern Portugal into Spain. It was the first place in Portugal to have electric lighting. History The Romans mined in the S√£o Domingos area for gold and silver for about 400 years. Mining stopped here when the Romans left. In 1854 Nicolau Biava, an Italian miner from Piedmont, Italy, staked a claim to the mine; ownership then passed to a French syndicate. In 1855 mining was resumed, as the international demand for copper grew during the Industrial Revolution. In 1859 the mining concession was leased for 50 years to an English mining company, Mason and Barry, run by Sir Francis Barry, 1st Baronet and his brother-in-law James Mason, because of their industrial mining expertise. The nearby port of Pomar√£o was inaugurated the same year. Known as Pomaron in England, this inland port was specially constructed on the River Guadiana, which here forms the border with Spain, to serve the mine. In 1862 an railway, of three foot-six inch gauge, was opened connecting the mine to Pomar√£o. From Pomar√£o ore was exported, mostly to England, by ship. Pomar√£o was destroyed in a disastrous flood on 6‚Äì8 December 1876, and subsequently rebuilt. Mason and Barry switched from tunnel mining to open-pit mining in 1867. Copper ore was initially the main product of the mine; but at the end of World War I, sulphuric acid became much more important, so pyrite was mined as a source of sulfur, and this proved to eventually be the downfall of the entire region. Because of the large quantities of water required for the smelting and purification of the sulfur, the water was turned into a sulfuric acid solution, which then leached into the ground, contaminating a large area around the mine.Mysteries of the Abandoned episode 'Escobar's Castle' As well as this, many of the miners were experiencing the effects of acidosis from breathing the sulfur dioxide fumes in the air, which also settled on any exposed surfaces and caused them to become acidic with the application of moisture of any sort, like dew, rain, or just humidity in the air. This added another level of misery to the miners as anything they touched had the potential of causing chemical burns. About 25 megatons of ore had been extracted when the mine was closed in 1966 due to the Portuguese government threatening to bring in legislation making companies, especially mining companies, financially responsible for cleaning up their mistakes. This added another level of devastation in the region, as there was now an excess of people out of work due to the mine closure. Tourism Since closure the mine has attracted tourists. Many old mine buildings and the open- cast pit remain. The old mining company headquarters has been converted into a hotel. A small museum and archive, the casa do mineiro, in an old miner's cottage, depicts the life of the Portuguese miner. There is also an exhibition in an old cinema. There is an English cemetery, where mine managers and their families, many from Cornwall, are buried. The railway line has been removed but one can still see the trackbed for much of the route.

He was working burning garbage at the island's incinerator during duty hours when he suddenly ran and began scaling a chain link fence at the edge of the island in an apparent attempt to make for the shore. When he was caught in this act and refused orders of the correctional officer located at the West Road guard tower to come down, he was shot. He was seriously injured in the fall from over 15 m (50 ft) and consequently died. The incident termed Bowers' \\"Desperate Escape\\" was variously deemed by inmates to have been an actual escape attempt, a deliberate suicide (Bowers had made multiple suicide attempts, and was deemed by some prisoners to be criminally insane), an attempt to climb up to grab garbage wedged in the chain link fence (Bowers was assigned to the garbage incinerator detail), or an attempt to climb the fence to feed a seagull. However, regardless of Bowers' initial motive, it is indisputable that Bowers ignored the guards' forceful signals to halt and he kept climbing even after the guards began firing, such that he fell on the outside of the fence. = December 16, 1937= Theodore Cole and Ralph Roe had gradually filed through iron bars in the prison's mat shop in the industries building and escaped on a very foggy day, preventing them from being spotted by guards in the watch towers. The two jumped into the water and were never seen again, but the severe weather conditions at the time have led to a consensus that they drowned in the bay and their bodies were swept out to sea by the strong current in San Francisco Bay. However, they were listed as #1 and #2 on the FBI Most Wanted List. = May 23, 1938= Rufus Franklin, Thomas R. Limerick, and James C. Lucas attacked and killed a guard with a claw hammer in the woodwork shop in the industries building and then proceeded to the roof, where an armed guard shot Franklin and Limerick. Other guards arrived at the scene. Lucas was cornered and surrendered to the guards. The officer Cline died of his injuries the next day. Thomas Limerick also died. = January 13, 1939 = Arthur 'Doc' Barker, William Martin, Rufus McCain, Henri Young, and Dale Stamphill were inmates of the prison's supposedly most-secure unit, D-Block, when they managed to escape the cell house and reach the Alcatraz shore on the night of January 13, 1939 (Friday). As they were putting a makeshift raft together, they were spotted and fired on by a guard in a watch tower. Barker was killed, Stamphill was wounded, and the others were sent to solitary confinement. = May 21, 1941= Joe Cretzer, Sam Shockley, Arnold Kyle, and Lloyd Barkdoll were working in the industries area when they jumped the guards on duty and attempted to saw through window bars to reach the shore. The tool- proof bars foiled the attempt and they surrendered when this became apparent. Both Cretzer and Shockley would try to escape again in the Battle of Alcatraz. = September 15, 1941 = John Richard Bayless (May 16, 1915 - July 30, 1981) was working on the garbage detail and managed to elude the guards and reach the Alcatraz shore. He jumped into the water and tried swimming to San Francisco, but quickly gave up the attempt. = April 14, 1943 = James Boarman (January 1, 1919 ‚Äì April 14, 1943), Harold Martin Brest (January 2, 1914 - May 31, 1979), Floyd Garland Hamilton (June 13, 1908 ‚Äì July 24, 1984), and Fred John Hunter (October 13, 1899 - November 30, 1982), managed to cut window bars in the industries building's mat shop without being noticed and assemble four cans that contained army uniforms and could serve as flotation devices. They then overpowered two guards and bound and gagged them, then escaped out the window, leaving behind two of the four cans. One of the overpowered guards managed to get his whistle loose and the other managed to slip his gag and blow the first guard's whistle, alerting the tower guards who opened fire on the prisoners. Boarman was hit by gunfire and floated in the water unconscious, supported by Brest. As a prison launch picked up Brest, he let go of Boarman, who sank beneath the surface. Boarman's body was never recovered. Hunter, who had injured his back and hands in the escape attempt, gave up on swimming and sought refuge in a nearby cave, but was discovered by the guards two hours later and surrendered. Hamilton was wrongly assumed by the guards to have been hit by gunfire along with Boarman and his body to have similarly sunk, but had actually been hiding in the same cave as Hunter. Two days later he climbed back up the cliff and through the same window from which he had jumped, then hid under a pile of material in the storeroom. He was found there the next morning. = August 7, 1943 = Huron Ted Walters, who was serving a sentence of 30 years for robbery, assault, and auto theft, noticed that on weekends, fewer guards were on duty, and their attention tended to be focused on the recreation yard. On Saturday, August 7, he took advantage of the situation to slip out of the New Industries building, where he was working in the laundry. His plan was to cut through the two security fences that separated him from freedom, make his way to the water, and swim the 1.4 miles to San Francisco.Alcatraz Escape Files: From the Official Records. San Francisco: Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, 2014. pp. 93-99. His plan went sideways early. The contraband wire cutters failed him, so he had to climb both fences, which cost him valuable time. Then, he fell from the second fence onto the rocks and injured his back. Although he made it to the island's shoreline, he could go no farther, and was picked up by Captain of the Guards Henry Weinhold and Associate Warden E. J. Miller. He was returned to the cell house, where he spent some time in the prison hospital, then in solitary.Alcatraz Escape Files: From the Official Records. San Francisco: Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, 2014. pp. 93-99. = July 31, 1945 = John K. Giles, a prisoner working at the Alcatraz wharf, managed to assemble a U.S. Army technical sergeant's uniform (probably from pieces stolen from bags of army laundry sent to the island to be cleaned) and board a ferry that provided service between government facilities around San Francisco Bay. Shortly after the ferry's departure for Angel Island, headcounts on the Alcatraz wharf and aboard the ferry revealed the discrepancy, and Giles was apprehended at Angel Island and returned to Alcatraz. = May 2-4, 1946 = Bernard Coy, Marvin Hubbard and Joseph Cretzer were killed in the Battle of Alcatraz. Carnes, Shockley and Thompson on way to court for trial in the Battle of Alcatraz The most violent escape attempt occurred on May 2‚Äì4, 1946, when a failed attempt by six prisoners led to the Battle of Alcatraz, also known as the \\"Alcatraz Blastout\\". It was carried out by six prisoners: Bernard Coy, Joseph Cretzer, Sam Shockley, Clarence Carnes, Marvin Hubbard and Miran Thompson. They daringly took control of the cell house by overpowering correctional officers, and were able to enter the weapons room and obtain the keys to the recreation yard door. Their aim was to escape by boat from the dock, but when they failed to obtain the keys to the outside door, they decided to battle it out. In the fight that ensued, they managed to hold two correctional officers hostage whom they eventually killed after two days. Prompted by Shockley and Thompson, Cretzer shot the hostages at very close range. One of the guards, William Miller, succumbed to his injuries while the second guard, Harold Stites, was also killed at the cellhouse. Although Shockley, Thompson, and Carnes returned to their cells, the other three, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, persisted with their fight. The U.S. Marines intervened to help the correctional officers and killed the three prisoners. In this battle, apart from the guards and prisoners killed, 17 other guards and one prisoner were also injured. Shockley, Thompson, and Carnes were tried for the killing of the correctional officers. Shockley and Thompson were sentenced to death through the gas chamber, an action which was carried out at San Quentin in December 1948.Two Alcatraz convicts die in gas chamber. Los Angeles Times, December 4, 1948. Carnes, who was only 19 years old, was given a second life sentence. = July 23, 1956 = Floyd Wilson disappeared from his job at the dock but was discovered after hiding for 12 hours among large rocks along the shoreline after giving up on his plan to make a raft out of driftwood. = September 29, 1958 = Aaron Burgett and Clyde Johnson were working on the garbage detail when they overpowered a guard. Both jumped into the water, trying to swim off the island. A police launch intercepted Johnson, but Burgett disappeared. He perished in the attempt and his body was found floating in the bay near Alcatraz, two weeks later. = June 11, 1962 = Frank Morris, John Anglin and Clarence Anglin successfully carried out one of the most intricate escapes ever devised, on June 11, 1962. Behind the prisoners' cells in Cell Block B (where the escapees were interned) was an unguarded wide utility corridor. The prisoners chiseled away the moisture- damaged concrete from around an air vent leading to this corridor, using tools such as metal spoons and forks soldered with silver from a dime and an electric drill improvised from a stolen vacuum cleaner motor. The noise was disguised by accordions, played during music hour (about 1 hour and a half), and their progress was concealed by false walls, which, in the dark recesses of the cells, fooled the guards. The side view of a model head found in Frank Morris's cell The escape route then led up through an air vent, a shaft large enough for a man to climb through. Stealing a carborundum cord from the prison workshop, the prisoners had removed the rivets from the grille and substituted dummy rivets made of soap. The escapees were given over 50 rubber raincoats from other inmates to use as a raft for the trip to the mainland, which they prepared on the top of the cellblock, concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides. Leaving papier-m√¢ch√© heads in their cell bunks, they escaped through a vent in the roof and departed Alcatraz. The official investigation by the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, who also was part of the escapees' group but was left behind. West couldn't fit through his hole so he had to keep chipping to break through. When Morris and the Anglin brothers (John & Clarence) accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall; however, by the time he made it through the wall, his companions were gone. Hundreds of leads and theories have been pursued by the FBI and local law enforcement officials in the ensuing years, but no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced favoring the success or failure of the attempt. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between . The U.S. Marshals Service case file remains open and active, however. Morris and the Anglin brothers remain on its wanted list. Circumstantial evidence uncovered in the early-2010s seemed to suggest that the men had survived, and that contrary to the official FBI report of the escapee's raft never being recovered and no car thefts being reported, a raft was discovered on nearby Angel Island with footprints leading away, and a car had been stolen on the night of the escape by three men, who could have been Morris and the Anglins, and that officials then engaged in a cover-up. Relatives of the Anglin brothers presented further circumstantial evidence in the mid-2010s in support of a longstanding rumor that the Anglin brothers had fled to Brazil following the escape; a facial recognition analyst concluded that the one piece of physical evidence, a 1975 photograph of two men alleged to be John and Clarence Anglin, did support that conclusion. = December 16, 1962 = John Paul Scott and Darl Lee Parker were the last two prisoners to attempt to escape from Alcatraz. Scott and Parker used a makeshift saw to cut through the bars on a kitchen window in the cell house, then ran to the edge of the island and jumped into the water. Parker was found alive 81 yards from the main island on the rock formation Little Alcatraz. Scott reached Fort Point beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, where he was found by teenagers, suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion. After recovering in Letterman General Hospital, he was immediately returned to Alcatraz. It is the only proven case of an Alcatraz inmate reaching the shore by swimming.San Francisco Genealogy Escape from Alcatraz (triathlon) The Alcatraz-Fort Point route, which was swam by the inmate John Paul Scott in 1962, is today part of one of two annual triathlon events.Escape From Alcatraz Triathlon , retrieved November 9, 2015.San Francisco Triathlon at Alcatraz , retrieved November 9, 2015.

It is managed by the publicly owned Voies navigables de France and by-passes a series of five locks. The slope is used for larger vessels up to 40 metres in length, while smaller boats continue to use the locks. The slope has been out of service since an engine failure in 2009, and was scheduled to reopen in the summer of 2020. Operating principles The principle of the water slope is based on a sloping channel up or down which a wedge of water retained by an (almost) watertight gate is moved. This technique was invented in the 19th century by the German engineer Julius Greve and described by the French engineer Jean Aubert in 1961. The Montech water slope was inaugurated in July 1974. An evenly sloping concrete channel is fitted with a gate at the top, round which a continuous trickle of water is allowed to flow, to compensate for any leakage. The lower gate, which can be lifted, is mounted on a yoke between two ex-railway locomotives, which run on concrete tracks ether side of the channel. To allow a boat to ascend, the lower gate is lifted, the boat enters the channel, and then the gate is lowered behind it, leaving it floating on an isolated a wedge of water. The locomotives ascend the slope, pushing the water wedge in front of the lower gate. When the water level in the wedge matches that of the upper canal, the upper gate is opened and the boat is allowed to float free. To descend the process is reversed. Details of the machinery Montech water slope railway locomotives By virtue of its power and ingenuity the slope's mobile barrier is the key to the system. It consists of: * Two locomotives, rigidly connected together by a cross-piece which spans the channel, with the locomotives travelling on the channel's banks. * The gate, which acts as a big slide-valve, connected to the rigid cross-member by an arm. * A horizontal beam serving as a shock absorber between the boats and the gate. Each diesel electric locomotive has a power of distributed to drive motors on each of the four axles, each with two large pneumatic tyres. The three contact faces of the gate with the channel are equipped with seals to keep the wedge of water in place. The gate is raised or lowered using a hydraulic ram. The shock absorber is a hydraulically levelled hinged metal frame. It allows boats to be connected to the gate during ascents and descents. An electronic system keeps motion gentle and smooth. Finally triple brakes slow the system without jerks. Design features * Weight of the engines: 200 tonnes * Pushing effort: 60 tonnes * Speed: 4.5 km/h * Volume of water moved: 1,500 m * Slope of the channel: 3% * Height of the slope: 13.30 m * Depth of water wedge moved: 3.75 m * Length of the water wedge: 125 metres * Power of the locomotives: 2 √ó * Length of the channel: 443 m * Width of the channel: 6 m * Duration of passage: about 6 minutes * Length, width and capacity of the boats: 38.5 m, 5.5 m and 250 tonnes.

He was originally from Taiyuan in Shanxi, but lived in the West Lake area in Zhejiang province. His courtesy name was Mengfu (Ê¢¶Á¨¶) and his pen name was Shenghao Weng (Á¨ôÈπ§ÁøÅ). The Record of Ghosts (ÂΩïÈ¨ºÁ∞ø) describes Qiao as having an aloof and intimidating demeanor, to the point people were in awe of him. Eleven of his plays survive. Two of his plays, Jinqian Ji (ÈáëÈí±ËÆ∞) and Yangzhou Meng (Êâ¨Â∑ûÊ¢¶), were particularly celebrated in his day and are now considered part of the classical canon.  Poetry  Much of his sanqu lyric poetry has survived, including 209 xiaoling lyrics and 11 taoshu suites. All were collected in the Complete Sanqu Poems. His collected works, Qiao Ji Ji, appeared in 1986. Qiao's lyrics combine literary language with the language of the street. One of his methods was referred to as the \\"six character prescription\\", which he explained as a lyric poem with a \\"phoenix head, pig's belly and a leopard tail\\". Qiao wrote that he had \\"wandered for forty years\\", travelling around many of the central and southern areas of China. In Looking for Plums, he described an episode of his wanders in the countryside, visiting villages during winter until he came across a village in a wooded mountain where a beautiful woman lived. Social criticism is also a recurring theme in Qiao Ji's literary works. This often manifested in his poetry, where he constructed imaginary worlds so that they could be rejected. For instance, in the poem On Myself, the poetic persona enjoying his retirement from service described being included in a bureaucracy only to reject its manifestations such as the civil service examination system. Experts compare Qiao Ji's style with the work of Zhang Kejiu, in terms of its elegance and lucidity as well as the style and the use of pleasing sounds. The poem Sky-Clear Sand involved the combination of topic and comment construction, while his contemporaries wrote their poetry in a structure that began with a topic and followed with the comment.

The treaty was signed in London on 26 May 1942 by British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov.  Background  The first meeting to discuss the treaty took place on 15 December 1941, a week after the United States had joined the British Empire and the Soviet Union to oppose the Axis powers. One of the goals of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union's head of government, was to establish a territorial agreement for a postwar Europe that would be largely divided between Britain and the Soviet Union. Stalin hoped to regain the territories that had been held by the Soviet Union, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Ukraine and Belarus before its losses during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941. In exchange, Britain would receive land and permission to have naval bases and maritime passage through the English Channel, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Absence of most Allies Absent from the discussions were the other Allies, including Australia, New Zealand, India and China, despite all of them having declared war on the Axis powers before 1941. Also not represented were the Allies that had governments-in-exile, such as Czechoslovakia and France, whose countries were being occupied by Germany, despite the Soviets' initial aim being to direct those countries' postwar structure. Significance The treaty represented a transition for Britain, which sacrificed some of its superpower status because of its weakened military state but still exerted diplomatic power during the negotiations.

Playing career =Heart of Midlothian= Thomson started his career with local side Prestonpans F.C., from where he moved to Hearts in 1898. Initially considered a centre-forward at Tynecastle, Thomson also occasionally played centre-half, and he took on that role permanently when Albert Buick left the Edinburgh club for Portsmouth in 1903. He played in the former role in the 1901 Scottish Cup final, when he scored the third goal in Hearts' 4‚Äì3 defeat of Celtic. Two years later he was deployed in defense but could not prevent Hearts losing the 1903 Scottish Cup final to Rangers, in a 2nd replay. As well as the centre-half berth, Thomson inherited the club captaincy upon Buick's departure south. Within a year he was also a Scotland international, making his debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Ireland at Dalymount Park in Dublin. A tenacious and inspiring figure, Thomson was a \\"natural skipper\\" and during his ten-year international career 13 of his 21 caps were earned as captain. He was also renowned for his stamina, athletic physique and fitness and his penalty-taking technique. Most of his goals (including three of the four he scored for Scotland) came from the penalty spot and he missed only one penalty-kick in his career. Further research has shown that Charlie missed at least 6 penalties for Hearts.All Hearts Penalties, London Hearts Supporters Club Thomson captained Hearts to a 1‚Äì0 victory over Third Lanark in the 1906 Scottish Cup Final,Association Football. The Scottish Final., The Glasgow Herald, 30 April 1906 but injury prevented him from leading the side in the 1907 final that was lost to Celtic. There was some behind the scenes unrest at Tynecastle during the close-season however which resulted in him relinquishing the captaincy. His total of appearances in the league and Scottish Cup was 218, with 48 goals scored.(Hearts player) Charlie Thomson, London Hearts Supporters Club =Sunderland= Thomson moved to Sunderland in 1908 in a joint transfer with goalkeeper Thomas Allan for ¬£700. At the time a transfer fee limit of ¬£350 existed in the Football League and it has been speculated that the joint fee was a means to circumvent these restrictions, with more than 50% of the fee being liable for Thomson's signature. These suggestions are supported by two facts: firstly, Thomson was at that point Scotland captain while Allan was not recognised internationally; secondly Allan returned to Hearts two seasons later for a fee much less than ¬£350. Thomson's time with Sunderland was no less successful than his time with Hearts. Quickly appointed club captain, he led the team through a remarkably consistent period: during his time with the club they finished no lower than eighth in the First Division. He made over 264 major appearances for Sunderland (7 goals)Charlie B. Thomson, The StatCat and helped them to the 1912‚Äì13 League title. The Black Cats narrowly missed out on a double that season when beaten 1‚Äì0 by Aston Villa in the 1913 FA Cup Final, with Thomson and the Villa centre-forward Harry Hampton both later suspended for a month for their conduct in what was a bruising occasion. During World War One, The Haddingtonshire Advertiser reported that Thomson was \\"again following his trade as a baker, being presently attached to the Italian Army in that capacity.\\"2 November 1917 Thomson retired from playing in 1919, at the age of 41, and became a publican back in his native Scotland.

It currently consists of , his wife , twins Myles and Beckett and the main character of the , . The family motto of the Fowl family is Aurum Potestas Est (Gold is Power), or sometimes known as Aurum Est Potestas.  Members  = Artemis Fowl I = Artemis Fowl I is the patriarch of the Irish Fowl family, the husband of Angeline Fowl and the father of Artemis Fowl II. He is a former crime lord, but some time before the start of the first book, he decided to move all of the family's assets into legitimate enterprises. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he attempts to create trade connections with Russia. He takes the family ship, the Fowl Star, loaded with 250 thousand cans of cola from Ireland to Russia, but he is intercepted and kidnapped by the Russian Mafiya near Murmansk, Russia. When the Mafiya find him after the explosion, his leg is missing. After over a year of not being found, he is declared legally dead by the courts. The fact that the family lost much money over his death motivated his son Artemis Fowl II to take on the exploits that occur in the first book. Much of the money accumulated in this and other ventures is spent directly on financing unsuccessful rescue expeditions in the Arctic. In the second book, The Arctic Incident, Artemis Fowl receives a message from the Russian mafia that they have his father, and sets out to rescue the man while helping save \\"The People\\" from the Goblin Revolution by defeating the masterminds. = Artemis Fowl II = Artemis Fowl II is the main character of the Artemis Fowl series. He is the son of Artemis Fowl I and Angeline Fowl. He is commonly referred to as simply \\"Artemis\\". Artemis is often called by his mother's pet name Arty. He is extremely intelligent, having contributed to the fictional scientific journal The Psychologist's Journal under a pseudonym,Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident pg. 11 Dr. F. Roy Dean Schlippe, and having the \\"highest tested IQ in Europe\\".Eoin Colfer (2001). Artemiƒô Fowl. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 1. . He thinks puberty is somewhat a pain. After the fifth book, it is known that he now has a hazel eye (courtesy of Captain Holly Short) and his index and middle fingers have switched places during a little time travel. He is possibly the only person who understands Foaly's little gizmos. Artemis is known now to also have a bit of magic in him, although his theft leads him to develop Atlantis Complex. He later has it treated. = Angeline Fowl = Angeline Fowl is the wife of Artemis Fowl I and the mother of Artemis Fowl II. After the disappearance of her husband, she goes into a state of insanity and depression. She is described by a school counselor as having no control over Artemis's behavior, allowing Artemis to engage in the illegitimate money-making enterprises in and before the first book. She calls Artemis \\"Arty\\", as his father does. Her name is also often used for Artemis' faux letters, emails and phone calls. = Beckett Fowl = Beckett Fowl is mentioned briefly in the Artemis Fowl books Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox and Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex. He is the younger of the pair of twins. He seems to have average intelligence and is fond of pointing at himself and speaking of himself in the third person, but is also quite resourceful. Beckett doesn't seem to realise what certain words mean, as he refers to himself more than once as a 'simple-toon'. He has a taste for odd foods, which includes a mix of espresso and treacle, and hamsters. After getting a taste of Artemis's hamster, Artemis put a lock on his lab. While Beckett's twin Myles cracked the code after several days, Beckett dug a bear trap for Myles and swapped the code for a ladder. In Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian, Beckett is shown to be unique amongst the Fowl brothers in being as co-ordinated as his brothers are not, as he attacks a gnome serving Opal Koboi. This strength and resilience in the face of danger attracts the attention of Oro, leader of the Berzerkers, who chooses to possess Beckett. Beckett only surfaces briefly when Koboi has allows him to regain control, expecting intelligent conversation from a Fowl, and is therefore surprised when Beckett reacts with enough speed to punch her. At the end of the novel, Oro is partly freed from the thrall so the spirit of warlock Bruin Fadda, the final seal on a spell that could destroy humanity, can converse freely regarding Koboi's plan. This act ultimately causes Opal's death, as when she orders Oro to kill her clone following her failure, Oro uses Beckett's body to stab Koboi. = Myles Fowl = Myles Fowl is the elder and more obviously intelligent of the Fowl twins, Myles is much like Artemis. He potty trained himself at fourteen months, building a ladder of encyclopedias to reach the toilet. In Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian it is mentioned he is a decade above his age. In Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex it is mentioned that Myles contaminated one of Artemis's Petri dishes when he wanted a sample for his own experiments. After Artemis put a lock on his lab door, Myles stayed at the door for three days trying to crack the combination, he used several rolls of toilet paper writing down the possibilities. The combination was given to Beckett when Myles fell in a hole Beckett dug in the Fowl garden and swapped the combination in return for a ladder. In Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian Myles is taken over by the Berserkers, spirits that are sworn to kill humans. Myles resists and is freed by Artemis. He gives Artemis all the information that he knows about the Berserkers but thinks that Artemis can not lose, even though Artemis was having doubts himself. = Lord Hugh Fowl = Lord Hugh Fowl (n√© Hugo de Fol√©) was the original owner of Fowl Manor and the principal of Virgil Butler, being the first Fowl to have a Butler apprenticed to him during the Norman conquest of England. = Peg O'Connor Fowl = Peg O'Connor Fowl, often and quite rudely referred to as Pirate Peg, and by her great-grandson Myles Fowl as Peg the Information Corsair, was a Fowl who during a period in which the Fowl family in its entirety had been briefly outlawed by the governments of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, had paid the Compagnie Internationale de Wagons-Lits an extortionate amount of gold to engineer a secret cabin in the rear car of the Orient Express that would be made available exclusively and in perpetuity to the Fowl family to allow them access to the entirety of Continental Europe.  History  In the Artemis Fowl series, the members of the Fowl family are infamous in the criminal underworld, also having an Interpol file the size of a small library. Over the years, various Fowls attempted to gain enough money to become legitimate, then decided such business wasn't to their liking and almost immediately returned to crime.Artemis Fowl pg. 124 The Fowl's billionaire status was put into jeopardy after the latest legitimate venture by Artemis Fowl I. Having previously controlled a criminal empire extending from the Dublin dockyards to Tokyo, he was partly influenced by his wife Angeline to move out of crime, and attempted to export cola to Russia aboard the Fowl Star, just after the Soviet Union had collapsed. However, the Russian Mafiya sunk the Fowl Star, wiping out a large chunk of the family finances. This prompted the 12-year-old prodigy Artemis Fowl II to start a two-year crime spree to secure the family fortune, which eventually led him to discover the People, becoming the first human in history to extort fairy gold from the LEP, surviving the deadly combination of a bio- bomb and a time-stop along the way.

This software would monitor a computer user's behavior while he or she uses the application program, and then provide optimized and personalized instruction to help the user become more skilled with the application. This form of instruction could be performed by a stand-alone tutoring application, or it could be carried out by special routines built into the application program itself (as with the Microsoft Office Assistant discussed below). Note that the history of adaptive learning approaches to education in general, some of which is summarized in the Wikipedia articles on spaced repetition and electronic learning, lies beyond the scope of this entry. Chronology of developments in the field A variety of different strategies for automated instruction in computer applications have been discussed and tried over a period of at least 25 years, although at present the technology does not appear to enjoy very wide application. Some of the notable developments in this field are listed here: *1956. Gordon Pask and Robin McKinnon-Wood develop SAKI, the first adaptive instruction system to go into commercial production. SAKI taught keyboard skills and it optimized the rate by which a trainee keyboard operator learned by making the difficulty level of the tasks contingent on the learner's performance. As the learner's performance improved the rate of teaching increased and instructional support was delayed. *1992. C. Thomas and M. Krogsaeter describe an adaptable extension to Microsoft Excel called Flexcel. Flexcel records and studies the user's command history using Excel and \\"analyzes the user's interaction style and presents adaptation suggestions.\\" (p. 123) For example, the program notes when a user repeatedly fails to utilize an available shortcut and reminds the user about the existence of the shortcut. *1996. S. Bhavnani and colleagues describe an Active Assistant for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) programs, for which they constructed a prototype versione. The Active Assistant records the history of a CAD user's usage of the program, and monitors for \\"symptoms of suboptimal and incorrect CAD usage\\" (p. 253). Upon discovering such cases, it might provide \\"textual notification that there is a better way to perform a task executed by the user\\" (p. 251) or it might provide \\"graphic remediation\\" utilizing a tutorial window. *1996. Microsoft introduces the Office Assistant‚Äîoften referred to as \\"Clippy\\"‚Äîto provide personalized assistance in the use of Office 97 products. Depending upon user-set options governing Clippy's behavior, the animated agent can provide a variety of forms of advice to users, based on inspection of the user history and comparison with optimal prototypes. Clippy becomes relatively notorious among some Office users, who complain that the agent is intrusive and annoying. *1996. Oppermann & Thomas describe an approach for Supporting Learning as an Iterative Process where users of an application to be learned can acquire usage knowledge iteratively by experience, annotations and individual or cooperative recourses to prior knowledge. *1999. F. Linton describes the OWL (Organization Wide Learning) Project undertaken at The MITRE Corporation in Massachusetts, USA. In OWL, all of the computer users within an organization run software that keeps track of the Microsoft Office commands they issue. By pooling and comparing the command histories of different users, OWL can \\"recommend to each user individual selected Word features that their peers have already found useful.\\" (p. 2). The prototype of OWL was constructed using Visual Basic and records all Office commands given by the user, including with the mouse. *2001. Oppermann & Specht describe a Context-sensitive Nomadic Information System that supports learning by adaptive information about museum exhibits while roaming through a museum. *2001. Microsoft demotes the Office Assistant to a subordinate, non- default status within the Office XP applications *2006. Fujitsu Corporation files a US patent application (#20070092857) on a \\"Method and apparatus for supporting training, and computer product.\\" The application claims that Fujitsu invented the idea of \\"An apparatus for supporting training for using an application program, comprising: an analyzing unit configured to analyze a record of usage of functions in the application program based on an operation history of the application program; and a generating unit configured to generate data relating to the training based on a result of analysis by the analyzing unit.\\" (Independent Claim 7)  Journals covering this field  User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction (Springer, Netherlands)  References  *Bhavnani, S.

Its public premi√®re occurred on 1 February 1827, with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra performing under the leadership of its then-Kapellmeister Johann Philipp Christian Schulz. =London premi√®re= The symphony was dedicated to the Philharmonic Society, who performed the London premi√®re on May 25, 1829, with Mendelssohn conducting.Mercer-Taylor, P. J. The Cambridge Companion to Mendelssohn, CUP (2004) For this performance Mendelssohn orchestrated the scherzo from his Octet Op. 20 as an alternative third movement for the symphony. The London premi√®re was reviewed in The Harmonicon: > ... though only about one or two-and-twenty years of age, he has already > produced several works of magnitude, which, if at all to be compared with > the present, ought, without such additional claim, to rank him among the > first composers of the age.... Fertility of invention and novelty of effect, > are what first strike the hearers of M.

The author conducted > it in person, and it was received with acclamations.... Instrumentation The work is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B, two bassoons, two horns in E and/or C, two trumpets in C, timpani in C, G, and strings. Movements The symphony is in four movements: # Allegro di molto (C minor, , sonata form. ) # Andante (E major, , sonata form.) # Menuetto: Allegro molto (C minor, , compound ternary form, with a trio firstly in A major and later in C minor. Compared to the standard minuet & trio form, it is slightly different as there is an extra link to the main minuet after the binary form trio section.) # Allegro con fuoco (C minor, , sonata form, ending in C major. The primary theme of which bears a striking resemblance to the final movement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Symphony No. 40.) A typical performance lasts half an hour. Arrangements An arrangement by Mendelssohn himself for piano four hands, violin and cello exists, and has been recorded by the Duo Tal & Groethuysen with Oliver Wille (violin) and Mikayel Hakhnazaryan (cello).

He served as the cabinet minister when Keshubhai Patel formed the government in the 1995 assembly elections. Patel resigned in October 1995 following revolt of his colleague Shankersinh Vaghela and consequently, Mehta was sworn in as the Chief Minister in October 1995 and he served till September 1996. However, BJP was split as the Rashtriya Janata Party which was formed by Vaghela. Mehta resigned from post of the CM and the President's rule was imposed. He again served as the industry cabinet minister under Patel when the BJP returned to the power in the 1998 assembly elections. Patel resigned in 2001 following allegations of mismanagement in relief works during the aftermath of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake and a loss of BJP seats in by-elections. Narendra Modi succeeded Patel under whom Mehta had reservations to serve as the cabinet minister but he served until 2002. He opposed leadership of Narendra Modi and quit BJP on 8 December 2007, just before the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election. Later he joined the Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) founded by the former chief minister Keshubhai Patel in 2012. He opposed the GPP's merger with the BJP in February 2014 and left the party.

It was the first fully consecrated Hindu temple in Europe (1981).http://www.ghanapathy.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=73&Itemid;=280 During the temple's early years, the realisation came that there was an urgent need to educate the younger generation about Hinduism. Furthermore, the temple wanted the children to fully understand the faith at a deeper level than previously. Therefore, the Sai Mandir has been running classes for many years, teaching the children spiritual education, Sanskrit prayers, how to sing Bhajans (devotional hymns) in addition to learning about other religions too. Voluntary activities take place in affiliation with local authorities and Age Link groups. The temple provides classes dwelling on teachings of Hinduism, music and dance classes, and yoga to name a few.  Community  Shelter for Refugees Refugees from Sri Lanka have been given temporary shelter at the Temple in 1986. The BBC recorded this info as part of their DomesDay Project in 1986.

The development of fishes is unique in some specific aspects compared to the development of other animals. Cleavage Most bony fish eggs are referred to as telolecithal which means that most of the egg cell cytoplasm is yolk. The yolky end of the egg (the vegetal pole) remains homogenous while the other end (the animal pole) undergoes cell division. Cleavage, or initial cell division, can only occur in a region called the blastodisc, a yolk free region located at the animal pole of the egg. The fish zygote is meroblastic, meaning the early cell divisions are not complete. This type of meroblastic cleavage is called discoidal because only the blastodisc becomes the embryo. In fish, waves of calcium released direct the process of cell division by coordinating the mitotic apparatus with the actin cytoskeleton, propagating cell division along the surface, assists in deepening the cleavage furrow, and finally heals the membrane after separation of blastomeres. The fate of the first cells, called blastomeres, is determined by its location. This contrasts with the situation in some other animals, such as mammals, in which each blastomere can develop into any part of the organism. Fish embryos go through a process called mid-blastula transition which is observed around the tenth cell division in some fish species. Once zygotic gene transcription starts, slow cell division begins and cell movements are observable. During this time three cell populations become distinguished. The first population is the yolk syncytial layer. This layer forms when the cells at the vegetal pole of the blastoderm combine with the yolk cell underneath it. Later in development the yolk syncytial layer will be important in directing cell movements of gastrulation. The second cell population is the enveloping layer which is made of superficial cells from the blastoderm that eventually form a single epithelial cell layer. This layer functions in protection by allowing the embryo to develop in a hypotonic solution so the cell will not burst. Finally, the third set of blastomeres are the deep cells. These deep cells are located between the enveloping layer and the yolk syncytial layer and eventually give rise to the embryo proper. Germ layer formation Once blastoderm cells have covered almost half of the yolk cell, thickening throughout the margin of deep cells occurs. The thickening is referred to as the germ ring and is made up of a superficial layer, the epiblast which will become ectoderm, and an inner layer called the hypoblast which will become endoderm and mesoderm. As the blastoderm cells undergo epiboly around the yolk the internalization of cells at the blastoderm margin start to form hypoblast. Presumptive ectoderm or epiblast cells do not internalize but the deep cells (inner layer of cells) do and they become the mesoderm and endoderm. As the hypoblast cells move inward future mesoderm (hypoblast cells) start to move vegetally and proliferate but later in development these cells alter their direction and start moving towards the animal pole. However, endodermal precursors seem to lack a pattern and move randomly over the yolk. Axis formation Once the egg has become multicellular and positioned its germ layers with ectoderm on the outside, mesoderm in the middle, and endoderm on the inside body axes have to be determined for proper development. A dorsal-ventral axis has to form and major proteins involved are BMP and Wnts. Both proteins are made in the ventral and lateral portions of the developing embryo. BMP2B induces cells to have ventral and lateral fates while factors such as chordin can block BMPs to dorsalize the tissue. Wnt8 induces ventral, lateral, and posterior regions of embryonic tissue. Wnt also has inhibitors like noggin to allow for the formation of dorsal tissue. In order to aid in proper development fish have an organizer center called the Nieuwkoop center. Anterior and posterior axis formation seems to be the result of interplay of FGFs, Wnt, and retinoic acid. FGFs, retinoic acid, and Wnts are required to turn on posterior genes. Neurulation Neurulation, the formation of the central nervous system, is different in fishes than in most other chordates. Convergence and extension in the epiblast recruits presumptive neural cells from the epiblast towards the midline where they form a neural keel. A neural keel is a band of neural precursors that develops a slit like lumen to eventually become the neural tube. The neural tube begins as a solid cord formed from the ectoderm. This cord then sinks into the embryo and becomes hollow, forming the neural tube. This process contrasts with the process in other chordates, which occurs by an infolding of the ectoderm to form a hollow tube. Throughout the years advances in research have shown that neural formation relies on interactions between extrinsic signaling factors and intrinsic transcription factors. Extrinsic signals involved are BMP, Wnt, and FGF and intrinsic transcription factors like SoxB1 related genes. Secreted proteins such as BMP and its antagonist Noggin and chordin act permissively to establish the fate of neural tissue in the dorsal ectoderm and enables the formation of the neural plate. Sex determination Sex determination is variable in fish from environmental factors like temperature to genetic mechanisms. Some fish have XX/XY chromosomes and others have ZZ/ZW. So far one gene in specific, DMRT1bY, has been described as a sex determining gene. This gene is expressed before gonads develop and differentiate. Mutations in this gene lead to sex reversal from male to female. While this gene plays a major role in sex determination in some fish species other species have variations of this gene as well as some versions of the Sox gene as seen in zebrafish. Many species of fishes are hermaphrodites. Some, such as the painted comber (Serranus scriba), are synchronous hermaphrodites. These fish have both ovaries and testes and can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites. These fishes start life as one sex and undergo a genetically programmed sex change at some point during development. Their gonads have both ovarian and testicular tissues, with one type of tissue predominant while the fish belongs to the corresponding gender.

History =Background= Pagan Prussians rose against their conquerors, who tried to convert them to Christianity, after Lithuanians and Samogitians soundly defeated the joint forces of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order in the Battle of Durbe in 1260. The first years of the uprising were successful for the Prussians, who defeated the Knights in open battles and besieged Teutonic castles. However, the Prussians faced great difficulties attacking and capturing the castles. =Battle of Kalgen= The Prussians had built small forts around K√∂nigsberg so that they could block any contact with the outside. Anno von Sangershausen, the Grand Master of the Knights, was working to provide relief to the starving garrison in K√∂nigsberg Castle. In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by William IV, Count of J√ºlich, and Engelbert I, Count of the Mark.Gause, p. 34 The crusading army arrived in the afternoon of 21 January 1262Ewald, p. 30 and desired to attack the pagans right away, but decided to wait for the next morning. During the nighttime, the Prussians abandoned their forts and hid in a nearby forest. On the morning of 22 January, the crusaders thought that the Prussians had gone home to Sambia and Warmia.Ewald, p. 31 Stanteke, a Prussian scout loyal to the Knights, was wounded by Prussians after finding them hidden, but was able to escape to warn the Knights. Heavy fighting ensued southwest of K√∂nigsberg and the Prussians were driven into the village Kalgen. With the arrival of the K√∂nigsberg garrison as reinforcements, the Battle of Kalgen was won, with the Knights counting some 3,000 dead of their enemy. The Knights considered it revenge for the Prussians' victory in the Battle of Pokarben in Natangia, which occurred on the same day the previous year.Ewald, 32 The Rhinelanders soon returned home, however, and the Sambians renewed the siege. =Control of the Pregel= A Sambian leader, Nalube of Quednau, destroyed the initial settlement of K√∂nigsberg, later known as Steindamm, in 1262. Townspeople unable to reach safety in K√∂nigsberg Castle were slain or taken prisoner. The Knights had enough food and supply to last until Summer 1262 when they expected relief delivered via the Pregel River. However, the Sambian leader Glande transformed a few of his ships to war vessels to block the river.Armstedt, p. 12 A sea captain from L√ºbeck, along with a crew of loyal Prussians, was able to infiltrate the Sambian blockade at night and sink some vessels. The besiegers then built a bridge of boats and wooden towers to protect it. The Knights, against the odds, succeeded in burning down both the bridge and fort. Reinforcements for the Sambians came from Herkus Monte of the Natangians. =End of the siege= The conclusion of the siege is disputed. K√∂nigsberg historian Richard ArmstedtArmstedt, p. 13 wrote that the starving Knights decided to fight a final open battle, from which the Prussians retreated in defeat. Andreas Johan Sj√∂gren writes that Herkus Monte was wounded in the battle and most of his forces were captured while fleeing.M√©moires, p. 285 The K√∂nigsberg archivist Fritz Gause states that little is known of how the siege actually ended, that neither Armstedt nor historian Walther Franz provided a source for the final battle, and that the Teutonic chronicler Peter of Dusburg does not provide detail about it. Gause states the Prussians abandoned the siege in 1265, possibly having heard that K√∂nigsberg was to receive crusading reinforcements. The Sambians withdrew because they could neither stop supplies and reinforcement from reaching the castle via the Pregel nor capture it. The siege proved the weakness of the Prussians and the strength of the Knights. The reliance upon fortified castles allowed the Knights to regroup and eventually subdue the uprising. K√∂nigsberg became a key staging ground for future crusading campaigns.Gause, p. 24 Notes References   * Category:1262 in Europe Category:1263 in Europe Category:1264 in Europe Category:1265 in Europe Category:K√∂nigsberg Category:Conflicts in 1262 Category:Conflicts in 1263 Category:Conflicts in 1264 Category:Conflicts in 1265 Konigsberg ","title":"Siege of K√∂nigsberg"},{"id":"11562976","text":"Joaqu√≠n Anselmo Mar√≠a Albareda y Ramoneda, OSB (February 16, 1892 ‚Äì July 19, 1966) was a Spanish Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church who served as Prefect of the Vatican Library from 1936 to 1962, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1962.

Stories in Chinese literature describe Magu as a beautiful young woman with long birdlike fingernails, while early myths associate her with caves. Magu xian shou () is a popular motif in Chinese art. Name The ancient bronze script for ma () depicted plants hanging in a shed. Yangshao culture (ca. 4800 BCE) amphora with hemp cord design Magu's name compounds two common Chinese words: ma \\"cannabis; hemp\\" and gu \\"aunt; maid\\". Ma‚Äîthe modern Chinese character for which is , deriving from a Zhou Dynasty bronze script ideograph that shows drying in a ‚Äîoriginally meant \\"hemp, Cannabis sativa\\". Cannabis has been continuously cultivated in China since Neolithic times; for example, hemp cords were used to create the characteristic line designs on Yangshao culture pottery and the fibres were used to produce cloth prior to the introduction of cotton. Ma has extended meanings of \\"numbed; tingling\\" (e.g., ), \\"pockmarked; pitted\\" (), \\"sesame\\" (), and an uncommon Chinese surname. Gu (, combining the \\"woman\\" radical and a gu \\"old\\" phonetic) is primarily used in female Chinese kinship terms for \\"father's sister\\" (e.g., gugu ), \\"husband's sister\\" (dagu \\"elder sister-in-law\\"), and \\"husband's mother\\" (wenggu \\"husband's parents\\"). Gu can also mean \\"young woman, maiden, maid\\" (guniang \\"girl; daughter; prostitute\\"), and religious titles (daogu \\"Daoist priestess\\", nigu \\"Buddhist nun\\"). Translating Magu into English is problematic, depending upon whether her name is interpreted as a \\"maid\\", \\"priestess\\", or \\"goddess\\" of \\"hemp\\", \\"marijuana\\", or something else. Victor H. Mair proposed that Chinese wu ( \\"shaman\\"), pronounced *myag in Old Chinese, was a loanword from Old Persian *magu≈° \\"magician; magi\\", which is hypothetically comparable with Magu. Chinese Magu () is called Mago in Korean and Mako in Japanese. Mago () is a cosmogonic goddess in Korean creation myths. calls her \\"the Great Goddess\\" and proposes \\"Magoism, the archaic gynocentric cultural matrix of East Asia, which derives from the worship of Mago as creatress, progenitress, and sovereign.\\" According to the Budoji, Korean mytho-history began with the \\"Era of Mago.\\" Japanese Mako () is usually a literary reference to the Chinese story (below) about Magu's long fingernails, for instance, Mako s≈çy≈ç ( \\"Magu scratches the itch\\") metaphorically means \\"things going like one imagined\\". Cultic origins Porcelain dish with overglaze decoration depicting Magu, deity of longevity, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, Qing dynasty, c. 18th century, Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. While Magu folktales are familiar in East Asia, the sociologist Wolfram Eberhard was the first Western scholar to analyze them. He categorized Magu under a cultural chain of Yao love songs and festivals. Based on references in Chinese texts, Eberhard proposed two centers for the Magu cult, in the present-day provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei. Evidence for an \\"original cultic center\\" near Nancheng () county in southwestern Jiangxi includes several place names, including two mountains. The famous Magu Shan ( \\"Magu Mountain\\") is located in Nancheng, and Taoists regard its Danxia Dong ( \\"Cinnabar Cloud Grotto\\"), as the 28th of 36 sacred dongtian \\"Grotto-heavens, heaven-reaching grottos\\")) The famous Tang Dynasty Daoist calligrapher Yan Zhenqing visited Mt Magu and inscribed the Magu Shan Xiantan Ji ( \\"Record of the Mountain Platform where Magu Ascended to Immortality\\"). A second Magu Mountain is located in Jianchang county (, near Nanfeng ). Magu Wine () is made in Jianchang and nearby Linchuan. In addition, Magu is an alternate name for Huagu ( \\"flower maid\\") Mountain in Xuancheng county of Anhui. Evidence for a secondary area for the Magu cult in Hubei includes the Song dynasty temple near Hankou, along with the Magu Temple on Mount Heng. Several early folktales from Sichuan province associate Magu with caves and one describes a shaman who invoked her. Regarding the traditions that she was born in Jiangxi and became an immortal xian in Shandong, says, \\"This ascent to heaven, typical of Taoists, connects her with the immortal saints, and indeed she is regarded as a symbol of long life and rebirth, and therefore in the Chinese drama, appears a good omen during birthday celebrations.\\" Early descriptions Portrait of the Immortal Magu (National Palace Museum, Taipei) \\"Magu Presents Longevity\\", late 19th-century mural in the Summer Palace's Long Corridor. provides details of Magu mythology in his annotated translation of Ge Hong's Shenxian zhuan ( \\"Biographies of Divine immortals\\", ca. 317 CE). He compares four Chinese textual variations of Magu stories. The Shenxian Zhuan Daoist hagiography of Wang Yuan (, or Wang Fangping ) and Magu has the longest early descriptions of her. Wang was supposedly a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146-168 CE) of Emperor Huan of Han and went into the mountains to become a Daoist xian. Later, while traveling in Wu (modern Zhejiang), Wang met Cai Jing , whose physiognomy indicated he was destined to become an immortal, and taught him the basic techniques. After Cai had been gone for \\"over a decade\\", he suddenly returned home, looking like a young man, announced that Lord Wang would visit on the \\"seventh day of the seventh month\\" (later associated with the Cowherd and Weaver Girl lovers' festival), and ordered preparations for a feast. After Wang and his celestial entourage arrived on the auspicious \\"double-seven\\" day, he invited Magu to join their celebration because \\"It has been a long time since you were in the human realm.\\" She replied by invisible messenger. \\"Maid Ma bows and says: 'Without our realizing it, more than five hundred years have passed since our last meeting!'\\" After apologizing that she would be delayed owing to an appointment at Penglai Mountain (a legendary island in the Eastern Sea, where the elixir of immortality grows), Ma arrived four hours later. > She appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was > done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist. Her gown had a > pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, > and was indescribable ‚Äì it was not of this world. She approached and bowed > to Wang, who bade her rise. When they were both seated, they called for the > travelling canteen. The servings were piled up on gold platters and in jade > cups without limit. There were rare delicacies, many of them made from > flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's > home] and out. When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled > broiled mo, and was announced as kirin meat. > Maid Ma declared: \\"Since I entered your service, I have seen the Eastern > Sea turn to mulberry fields three times. As one proceeded across to Penglai, > the water came only up to one's waist. I wonder whether it will turn to dry > land once again.\\" Wang answered with a sigh, \\"Oh, the sages all say that the > Eastern Sea will once again become blowing dust.\\" This \\"traveling canteen\\" is the xingchu (), an exotic banquet that xian transcendents have the ability to summon at will. Magu legends frequently mention these mulberry fields in the East Sea. When Magu was introduced to the women in Cai's family, she transformed some rice into pearls as a trick to avoid the unclean influences of a recent childbirth. Then Wang presented Cai's family with a strong liquor from \\"the celestial kitchens\\", and warned that it was \\"unfit for drinking by ordinary people\\". Even after diluting the liquor with water, everyone became intoxicated and wanted more. > Maid Ma's fingernails resembled bird claws. When Cai Jing noticed them, he > thought to himself, \\"My back itches. Wouldn't it be great if I could get her > to scratch my back with those nails?\\" Now, Wang Yuan knew what Cai was > saying in his heart, so he ordered him bound and whipped, chiding, \\"Maid Ma > is a divine personage. How dare you think that her nails could scratch your > back!\\" The whip lashing Cai's back was the only thing visible; no one was > seen wielding it. Wang added, \\"My whippings are not given without cause.\\" Some later versions of this legend say Ma was Wang's sister. The poet Li Bai immortalized two Classical Chinese expressions from this story. Magu saobei ( \\"Magu scratches [my] back\\") refers to her extraordinary fingernails. Canghai sangtian ( \\"blue ocean [turns to] mulberry fields\\") means \\"great changes over the course of time\\"; says early Daoists observed seashells in mountainous rocks and recognized the vast scale of geologic transformations. The Lieyi zhuan ( \\"Arrayed Marvels\\", late 2nd or early 3rd century), attributed to Cao Pi (187-226 CE) has three stories about Wang Fangping. > The third gives a version of the incident of Cai Jing's inappropriate > fantasy concerning Maid Ma and her luxuriant four-inch nails.

The Yiyuan ( \\"Garden of Marvels\\", early 5th century), by Liu Jingshu (), records a story about Meigu ( \\"Plum Maid\\") or Magu, and suggests her cult originated during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE). > During Qin times, there was a Temple to Maid Mei ‚Äì or, as one version has > it, Maid Ma ‚Äì beside a lake. When alive, she had possessed arts of the Dao. > She could walk on water in her shoes. Later she violated the laws of the > Dao, and her husband, out of anger, murdered her and dumped her body in the > lake. Following the current, it floated on the waves until it reached the > [present site of] the temple. A subordinate shaman directed that she be > encoffined but not immediately buried. Very soon a square, lacquered coffin > appeared in the shrine hall. [From then on], at the end and beginning of > each lunar month, people there could make out through the fog an indistinct > figure, wearing shoes. Fishing and hunting were prohibited in the area of > the temple, and violators would always become lost or drown. Shamans said > that it was because the Maid had suffered a painful death and hates to see > other beings cruelly killed. Campany reads this legend to describe founding a temple, probably on Lake Gongting, and translates these \\"shaman\\" and \\"shrine\\" references in the future tense. Compare the present tense translation of who interprets her body floating to an existing temple. The Qi Xie ji (, 6th century) associates Magu with snakes. It describes her as a commoner from Fuyang, Zhejiang, rather than a Daoist transcendent, who loved raw meat hash. She captured a strange beast resembling a sea turtle and a serpent, and ate it with her companion Hua Ben ( \\"Flower Root\\"). When Ma started choking, Hua could see a snake flicking its tongue inside her mouth. She later enjoyed a meal at Hua's house, but upon learning that they had eaten snake meat, she vomited blood and died. Campany concludes: > This story hints at an even older stratum of legend behind the Maid Ma cult: > like other territorial gods known to Chinese religious history, she may have > begun as a theriomorphic deity (perhaps snake-headed) who gradually > metamorphosed into a human being and finally ‚Äì the process culminating in Ge > Hong's Traditions narrative ‚Äì into a full-fledged transcendent.

Hemp goddess \\"Maiden Magu Selling Wine\\" from Album of Famous Women Famous Women, 1799 Hellmut Wilhelm's book review of Eberhard's original German book suggested that Magu was associated with cannabis. Eberhard dismissed this hypothesis in the English version. > I have no indication that the goddess ever was a goddess of the hemp plant > (ma) as H. Wilhelm surmised (Monumenta Serica vol. 9, p. 213 note 9).

I know of no attempt to explain the name Ma gu (literally, \\"the Hemp Maiden\\").\\" The historian and sinologist Joseph Needham connected myths about Magu \\"the Hemp Damsel\\" with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis. Cannabis sativa is described by the oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, the (ca. 100 CE) Shennong Bencaojing (\\"Shennong's Materia Medica Classic\\"). \\"The flowers when they burst (when the pollen is scattered) are called [mafen] or [mabo].

Positive train control (PTC) is a system of functional requirements for monitoring and controlling train movements and is a type of train protection system. The term stems from control engineering. The train is only allowed to move in case of positive movement allowance. It generally improves the safety of railway traffic. Train protection systems are used to control traffic movement by technical means. They are especially needed in cases of high speed transportation, dense traffic with short succession of trains and mixed type traffic at widely differing speeds. Train protection systems were in practical testing at least since the beginning of the 1930s in Europe. Stopping a running train is the main goal of any train protection system. This is most easily done with stop order, and without a special order the vehicle is allowed to run. A typical representative for this \\"negative train control\\" is Indusi. In contrast to this 'easy moving', a PTC restricts the train movement to an explicit allowance; movement is halted upon invalidation. The main concept of PTC (as defined for North American freight railroads) is that the train receives information about its location and where it is allowed to safely travel, also known as movement authorities. Equipment on board the train then enforces this, preventing unsafe movement. PTC systems may work in either dark territory or signaled territory, and may use GPS navigation to track train movements. Various other benefits are sometimes associated with PTC such as increased fuel efficiency or locomotive diagnostics; these are benefits that can be achieved by having a wireless data system to transmit the information, whether it be for PTC or other applications. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has listed among its goals, \\"To deploy the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) as a nationwide, uniform, and continuous positioning system, suitable for train control.\\"Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Washington, DC (2002). \\"Railroad Research and Development Program: Train Control.\\" Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development, and Demonstrations. Document no. FRA/RDV-02/02. pp. 4‚Äì47. The U.S. freight rail industry had said that at the end of 2018, the nation's largest freight railroads were operating PTC across 83.2 percent of the required route miles. The American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) describes Positive Train Control as having these primary characteristics:American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA), Lanham, MD (2009). \\"Meeting the Communication Challenges for Positive Train Control.\\" AREMA 2009 Annual Conference & Exposition, Chicago, IL. * Train separation or collision avoidance * Line speed enforcement * Temporary speed restrictions * Rail worker wayside safety  History  =Background= With a decline in railway transit in the US after WWII, there was also less impetus for investment in train security. Near the end of the 1980s, a search for solutions re-emerged along with an inventory of technical possibilities. Starting in 1990 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US counted PTC (then known as positive train separation) among its \\"Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements.\\"National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Washington, DC (2010). \\"Modifications to NTSB Most Wanted List; List of Transportation Safety Improvements after September 1990.\\" NTSB (2010). \\"NTSB Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements ‚Äì Implement Positive Train Control Systems.\\" At the time, the vast majority of rail lines in US relied on the human crew for complying with all safety rules, and a significant fraction of accidents were attributable to human error, as evidenced in several years of official reports from the FRA.FRA. \\"Office of Safety Analysis Reports on Rail Accidents.\\" In September 2008, the US Congress considered a new rail safety law that set a deadline of December 15, 2015, for implementation of PTC technology across most of the US rail network. The bill, ushered through the legislative process by the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, was developed in response to the collision of a Metrolink passenger train and a Union Pacific freight train September 12, 2008, in California, which resulted in the deaths of 25 and injuries to more than 135 passengers. As the bill neared final passage by Congress, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) issued a statement in support of the bill.Association of American Railroads, Washington, DC (2008-09-24). \\"Statement by Edward R. Hamberger, President and CEO Association of American Railroads on Passage of the Comprehensive Rail Safety Bill.\\" Press release. President George W. Bush signed the 315-page Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 into law on October 16, 2008.U.S. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, , , . Approved 2008-10-16. =Provisions of the law= Among its provisions, the law provides funding to help pay for the development of PTC technology, limits the number of hours freight rail crews can work each month, and requires the Department of Transportation to determine work hour limits for passenger train crews. =Implementation= To implement the law, the FRA published final regulations for PTC systems on January 15, 2010.FRA (2010-01-15). \\"Positive Train Control Systems; Final rule.\\" Federal Register. The agency proposed amendments to its rules on December 11, 2012.FRA (2012-12-11). \\"Positive Train Control Systems (RRR); Notice of proposed rulemaking\\". Federal Register. In December 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that Amtrak and the major railroads have taken steps to install PTC systems under the law, but commuter rail operators were not on track for the 2015 deadline.U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC (December 2010). \\"Federal Railroad Administration Should Report on Risks to the Successful Implementation of Mandated Safety Technology.\\" Report No. GAO-11-133. As of June 2015, only seven commuter systems (29 percent of those represented by APTA) were expecting to make the deadline. Several factors have delayed implementation, including the need to obtain funding (which was not provided by Congress); the time it has taken to design, test, make interoperable, and manufacture the technology; and the need to obtain radio spectrum along the entire rail network, which involves FCC permission and in some cases negotiating with an existing owner for purchase or lease. The Metrolink commuter rail system in Southern California is planning to be the first US passenger carrier to install the technology on its entire system. After some delays,Weikel, Dan (January 24, 2014) \\"Metrolink to replace contractor to avoid train control project delays\\" Los Angeles Times demonstration PTC in revenue service began in February 2014; the system is expected to be completed in late summer 2015. In the Chicago metropolitan area, the Metra system expected it will not be fully compliant with the PTC mandate until 2019. In October 2015 Congress passed a bill extending the compliance deadline by three years, to December 31, 2018. President Barack Obama signed the bill on October 29, 2015. Only four railroads met the December 2018 deadline; the other 37 got extensions to December 2020, which was allowed under the law for railroads that demonstrated implementation progress.Most US rail systems miss safety deadline =Controversy= There is some controversy as to whether PTC makes sense in the form mandated by Congress. Not only is the cost of nationwide PTC installation expected to be as much as , most all of it borne by U.S. freight railroads, there are questions as to the reliability and maturity of the technology for all forms of mainline freight trains and high density environments.FRA (2009-07-21). \\"Positive Train Control Systems; Notice of proposed rulemaking.\\" Federal Register. The PTC requirement could also impose startup barriers to new passenger rail or freight services that would trigger millions of dollars in additional PTC costs. The unfunded mandate also ties the hands of the FRA to adopt a more nuanced or flexible approach to the adoption of PTC technology where it makes the most sense or where it is technically most feasible. While the FRA Rail Safety Advisory Committee identified several thousand \\"PPAs\\" (PTC preventable accidents) on US railroads over a 12-year period, cost analysis determined that the accumulated savings to be realized from all of the accidents was not sufficient to cover the cost of PTC across the railroads. Therefore, PTC was not economically justified at that time.Resor, Randolph R. (2004). \\"The Business Benefits of PTC.\\" {doubtful} Northwestern University Transportation Center, Evanston, IL. The FRA concurred with this cost assessment in its 2009 PTC rulemaking document. The reason behind the lack of economic justification is that the majority of accidents are minor and FRA crash worthiness standards help mitigate the potential loss of life or release of hazardous chemicals. For example, in the 20 years between 1987 and 2007, there were only two PTC-preventable accidents with major loss of life in the United States (16 deaths in the Chase, Maryland wreck (1987) and 11 in the Silver Spring, Maryland wreck (1996)), and in each case, the causes of the accidents were addressed through changes to operating rules. The cost of implementing PTC on up to 25 commuter rail services in the United States has been estimated at over $2 billion and because of these costs, several services are having to cancel or reduce repairs, capital improvements, and service. Other services simply do not have the funds available for PTC and have deferred action assuming some change from Congress. Railroads that operate lines equipped with cab signalling and existing Automatic Train Control systems have argued that their proven track record of safety, which goes back decades, is being discounted because ATC is not as aggressive as PTC in all cases. Basic operation A typical PTC system involves two basic components: * Speed display and control unit on the locomotive * A method to dynamically inform the speed control unit of changing track or signal conditions.Olson, R.T., Jr. (2007). \\"Incremental Train Control System On Amtrak's Michigan Line.\\" Presentation at AREMA Annual Conference, September 9‚Äì12, 2007, Chicago, IL. Optionally, three additional components may exist: * An on-board navigation system and track profile database to enforce fixed speed limits * A bi-directional data link to inform signaling equipment of the train's presence * Centralized systems to directly issue movement authorities to trains =PTC infrastructure= There are two main PTC implementation methods currently being developed. The first makes use of fixed signaling infrastructure such as coded track circuits and wireless transponders to communicate with the onboard speed control unit. The other makes use of wireless data radios spread out along the line to transmit the dynamic information. The wireless implementation also allows for the train to transmit its location to the signaling system which could enable the use of moving or \\"virtual\\" blocks. The wireless implementation is generally cheaper in terms of equipment costs, but is considered to be much less reliable than using \\"harder\\" communications channels. For example, the wireless ITCS system on Amtrak's Michigan Line was still not functioning reliably in 2007 after 13 years of development, while the fixed ACSES system has been in daily service on the Northeast Corridor since 2002 (see Amtrak, below). The fixed infrastructure method is proving popular on high-density passenger lines where pulse code cab signaling has already been installed. In some cases, the lack of a reliance on wireless communications is being touted as a benefit.Vogler, John (2005). Symposium on Positive Train Control Systems The wireless method has proven most successful on low density, unsignaled dark territory normally controlled via track warrants, where speeds are already low and interruptions in the wireless connection to the train do not tend to compromise safety or train operations. Some systems, like Amtrak's ACSES, operate with a hybrid technology that uses wireless links to update temporary speed restrictions or pass certain signals, with neither of these systems being critical for train operations. =Locomotive speed control unit= The equipment on board the locomotive must continually calculate the trains' current speed relative to a speed target some distance away governed by a braking curve. If the train risks not being able to slow to the speed target given the braking curve, the brakes are automatically applied and the train is immediately slowed. The speed targets are updated by information regarding fixed and dynamic speed limits determined by the track profile and signaling system. Most current PTC implementations also use the speed control unit to store a database of track profiles attached to some sort of navigation system. The unit keeps track of the train's position along the rail line and automatically enforces any speed restrictions as well as the maximum authorized speed. Temporary speed restrictions can be updated before the train departs its terminal or via wireless data links. The track data can also be used to calculate braking curves based on the grade profile. The navigation system can use fixed track beacons or differential GPS stations combined with wheel rotation to accurately determine the train's location on the line within a few feet. =Centralized control= While some PTC systems interface directly with the existing signal system, others may maintain a set of vital computer systems at a central location that can keep track of trains and issue movement authorities to them directly via a wireless data network. This is often considered to be a form of Communications Based Train Control and is not a necessary part of PTC. =Trackside device interface= The train may be able to detect the status of (and sometimes control) wayside devices, for example switch positions. This information is sent to the control center to further define the train's safe movements. Text messages and alarm conditions may also be automatically and manually exchanged between the train and the control center. Another capability would allow the employee-in-charge (EIC) to give trains permission to pass through their work zones via a wireless device instead of verbal communications. =Technical limitations= Even where safety systems such as cab signaling have been present for many decades, the freight railroad industry has been reluctant to fit speed control devices because the often heavy-handed nature of such devices can have an adverse effect on otherwise safe train operation. The advanced processor-based speed control algorithms found in PTC systems claim to be able to properly regulate the speed of freight trains over in length and weighing over , but concerns remain about taking the final decision out of the hands of skilled railroad engineers. Improper use of the air brake can lead to a train running away, derailment or to an unexpected separation. Furthermore, an overly conservative PTC system runs the risk of slowing trains below the level at which they had previously been safely operated by human engineers. Railway speeds are calculated with a safety factor such that slight excesses in speed will not result in an accident. If a PTC system applies its own safety margin, then the end result will be an inefficient double safety factor. Moreover, a PTC system might be unable to account for variations in weather conditions or train handling, and might have to assume a worst-case scenario, further decreasing performance.Amtrak Employee Timetable #3, Northeast Region, Jan, 18th, 2010, p.351 In its 2009 regulatory filing, the FRA stated that PTC was in fact likely to decrease the capacity of freight railroads on many main lines. The European LOCOPROL/LOCOLOC project had shown that EGNOS-enhanced satellite navigation alone was unable to meet the SIL4 safety integrity required for train signaling.Rousseau, Michel, et al. (2004).\\"LOCOLOC Project: Final Presentation.\\" Noordwijk, December 2004. From a purely technical standpoint, PTC will not prevent certain low-speed collisions caused by permissive block operation, accidents caused by trains \\"shoving\\" in reverse, derailments caused by track or train defect, grade crossing collisions, or collisions with previously derailed trains. Where PTC is installed in the absence of track circuit blocks, it will not detect broken rails, flooded tracks, or dangerous debris fouling the line. Wireless implementations =Radio spectrum availability= The wireless infrastructure planned for use by all US freights, most small freight railroads, and many commuter railroads is based on data radios operating in a single frequency band near . A consortium created by two freight railroads called PTC 220 LLC has purchased significant spectrum around , from previous licensees for use in deploying PTC. Some of this spectrum is in the form of nationwide licenses and some is not. The consortium plans to make this spectrum available for use by the US freights, but has indicated as recently as 2011 that they are unsure if they have enough spectrum to meet their needs. Several commuter railroads have begun purchasing spectrum in their geographic areas, but there is widespread concern that the acquisition of enough spectrum may be difficult to accomplish because of a lack of availability, difficulties in negotiating complex multi-party deals to gain enough adjacent spectrum, and because the financial cost of the acquisitions may make the task impossible for some state agencies. However, research suggests that dynamic spectrum allocation can solve the spectrum allocation problem at 220 MHz bandwidth. Many of the railroads have requested that the FCC reallocate parts of the spectrum to them. They argue that they must have spectrum to be interoperable with each other. The FCC has stated that there is no reallocation forthcoming, that the railroads are not justified in requesting spectrum reallocation because they have not quantified how much spectrum they need, and that the railroads should seek spectrum in the secondary markets or in other bands. =Radio band= There are no regulatory or technical requirements that demand that be used to implement PTC (if a PTC implementation is to use wireless components at all). If wireless data transmission is necessary, there are a few advantages to the spectrum, provided it can be acquired at a reasonable cost. The first reason to consider using spectrum is PTC interoperability for freights and for some, but not all, commuter rail operations. Freight operations in the US often include the sharing of railroad tracks where one railroad's rail vehicles operate as a guest on another railroad's host tracks. Implementing PTC in such an environment is most easily achieved by using the same PTC equipment, and this includes radios and the associated radio spectrum. When a commuter railroad operation must operate on a freight railroad territory, the commuter will most likely be required to install PTC equipment (including a radio) on their rail vehicle that is compliant with the freight railroad's PTC system, and this generally means the use of radios and spectrum. If the commuter uses the same PTC equipment, radios, and spectrum on their own property, they will be able to use it when their vehicles travel onto a freight's territory. From a practical standpoint, if the commuter instead elects to use another type of PTC on their own property, they will need to install a second set of onboard equipment so they can operate PTC on their own property while also operating PTC on a freight's property. If a multi-band radio (such as the current generation software defined radios) is not available, then separate radios and separate antennas will be necessary. With the complexity of track geometries, PTC requires a variable amount of the spectrum in a time critical manner. One way to achieve this is to extend the PTC software defined radios, such that it has the intelligence to allocate the spectrum dynamically. Adding the intelligence to the radio also helps to improve the security of the PTC communication medium. If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using in Michigan for their ITCS implementation. When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \\"operates\\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.) One other perceived reason to consider for PTC may be PTC-compatible radio equipment availability. Radio equipment specifically targeted toward PTC is currently only available from a limited number of vendors, and they are focused only on . One radio vendor in particular, Meteorcomm LLC, is able to support the I-ETMS PTC protocol with a radio. Meteorcomm is jointly owned by several of the freights, and some in the industry have indicated that using their radio and associated equipment will be done on a per-site licensing basis. Recurring fees may be associated with this process too. There is further concern that the 'buy in' and licensing fees will be significant, and this has led some to speculate that the owners of Meteorcomm (the freights) may have legal exposure to anti-trust violations. For many railroads, there is no other practical option to meet the federal mandate than to install PTC at using I-ETMS with the Meteorcomm radios. On the northeast corridor, another radio vendor, GE MDS, is able to support the Amtrak ACSES protocol with a radio. It should be stressed that the main concern among the freights regarding the PTC deadline is the availability of PTC equipment. With an eye to anti-trust issues and ready radio availability, Meteorcomm radio designs have been second-sourced to CalAmp radios. This all may mean that there is not enough PTC radio equipment available for all of the railroads that must implement PTC. There are also issues with the use of these frequencies outside the US; in Canada, remains part of the radioamateur 1.25-metre band. Other bands besides will support PTC, and have been used to win approvals from the FRA for PTC. When Amtrak received their initial approval, they planned to use frequencies for ACSES. BNSF Railway won its first PTC approvals from the FRA for an early version of ETMS using a multi- band radio that included frequencies, frequencies, frequencies and WiFi. A small freight or commuter that selects one or more of these bands or another one such as might find it easier to acquire spectrum. They will need to research spectrum issues, radio equipment, antennas, and protocol compatibility issues to successfully deploy PTC. =Interoperability requirements= There is no single defined standard for \\"interoperable PTC systems\\". Several examples of interoperable systems illustrate this point. First, the UP and BNSF are interoperable across their systems. They are both implementing I-ETMS and will use different radio frequencies in different locations. In the second example, Amtrak is interoperable with Norfolk Southern in Michigan. Amtrak uses ITCS, while Norfolk Southern uses I-ETMS. To interoperate, two radios are installed in each wayside location and they both interface with a common PTC system through an interface device (similar to a network gateway or protocol converter) at each wayside location. One radio talks to freight trains using I-ETMS and one radio talks to passenger trains using ITCS. In this case interoperability stops at the wayside and does not include the wireless segment out to the rail vehicles or the onboard systems. In the third example, similar to the first, Metrolink, the commuter rail agency in Los Angeles, is implementing I-ETMS and will use the same PTC equipment as both the UP and BNSF. Metrolink is procuring their own spectrum so that trains on Metrolink territory (commuter and freight) will use other channels than those used by the UP and BNSF. Interoperability is achieved by directing the onboard radio to change channels depending on location. For SEPTA, the commuter operation in and around Philadelphia, Ansaldo is implementing ACSES, the Amtrak northeast corridor PTC protocol. For CSX all the ACSES PTC transactions will be handed to CSX at the SEPTA back office, and CSX will be responsible for deploying I-ETMS infrastructure that they will use to communicate with their freight trains. The SEPTA interoperability model is very similar to that of the public safety radio community wherein different radio systems that use different frequencies and protocols are cross-connected only in the back office to support system to system communications. =Multi- band solutions= For the major freight railroads and Amtrak the answer seems to be that one frequency band is sufficient. These rail operations measure on- time performance on a much more coarse scale than commuters do so their tolerance for delay is greater and has less impact on train schedules. In addition, the PTC implementations deployed by commuter operations will be running much closer to the performance envelope than that of either Amtrak or the freights. For commuters in particular there is therefore some concern that implementing PTC with a single frequency band may not be sufficient. The single frequency-band approach to supporting real-time train control has a history of being difficult to use for such applications. This difficulty is not unique to train control. Interference, both man-made and natural, can at times affect the operation of any wireless system that relies on one frequency band. When such wireless systems are employed for real-time control networks it is very difficult to ensure that network performance will not sometimes be impacted. CSX encountered this problem when it experienced propagation ducting problems in its Advanced Train Control System (ATCS) network in the 1990s. AREMA. The ATCS protocol, which the AAR had recommended the FCC consider as PTC in 2000 (when AAR sought a nationwide \\"ribbon\\" license),A \\"ribbon\\" license authorizes use of radio frequency spectrum in a specified geographic area, e.g. along a railroad right-of-way. Federal Communications Commission, can support train control operation at both and . The latter frequency band is only used for ATCS on a few subdivisions and shortlines. More recently, the industry had been moving toward a more robust multi-band radio solution for data applications such as PTC. In 2007, BNSF first won FRA approval for their original ETMS PTC system using a multi frequency-band radio. In addition, in mid-2008, an FRA sponsored effort by the AAR to develop a Higher Performance Data Radio (HPDR) for use at actually resulted in a contract being awarded to Meteorcomm for a 4-band radio to be used for voice and data. These more recent multi-band radio efforts were shelved in late 2008, after the Rail Safety Improvements Act became law, and the freights decided to pursue PTC using alone, in a single frequency-band configuration. Amtrak and most commuter operations quickly followed suit, selecting . =Suitability of wireless PTC for commuter rail= Soon after the Rail Safety Improvements Act was passed, many commuter railroads chose not to develop their own PTC protocol and instead decided to save time and money by using a protocol developed for either freight or long haul passenger (Amtrak) operations. Deploying such a protocol for urban commuter operation, where it will be necessary to support numerous, small, fast-moving trains, will be a challenge. It remains to be seen whether the performance envelope of PTC protocols developed and optimized for less numerous, slower and/or larger trains can support a more complex operational scenario, such as that of a commuter rail operation, without impacting on-time performance. Detailed and exhaustive protocol simulation testing can ease the risk of problems, however, there are too many variables, especially when the wireless component is considered, to guarantee beforehand that under certain worst-case operational profiles in certain locations, train operations will not be impacted. In fact, during system acceptance testing, such worst-case operational profiles may not even be tested because of the effort involved. One need only consider what it would take to identify the PTC protocol train capacity limitations at each interlocking of a large commuter rail operation when a train is broken down at the interlocking and 10‚Äì20 other trains are within communications range of a single wayside location. Such a what-if scenario may be tested at a few interlockings but not at the 30 or more interlockings on a large commuter property. =Open standards= A large group of industry experts from the federal government, manufacturers, railroads, and consultants are participating in a study group sponsored by the IEEE 802.15 working group, to look at using lessons learned in protocol development in the IEEE 802 suite to propose a comprehensive solution to the wireless component of PTC. While this effort may not significantly change the current United States PTC efforts already underway, an open standard could possibly provide a way forward for all of the railroads to eventually deploy a more interoperable, robust, reliable, future-proof, and scalable solution for the wireless component of PTC. =Upgrade costs= The railroad industry, like the process industry and the power utility industry, has always demanded that the return on investment for large capital investments associated with infrastructure improvements be fully realized before the asset is decommissioned and replaced. This paradigm will be applied to PTC as well. It is highly unlikely that there will be any major upgrades to initial PTC deployments within even the first 10 years. The calculation for return on investment is not a simple one and some railroads may determine, for instance after five years, that an upgrade of certain components of PTC may be justified. An example could be the radio component of PTC. If an open standard creates a less expensive radio product that is backwards compatible to existing systems and that perhaps improves PTC system performance and also includes improvements that save on operational costs, then a railroad would be prudent to consider a plan for replacing their PTC radios. Deployment Various types of Collision Avoidance Systems have been implemented across the globe. Most if not all of these operate differently from PTC in North America, as described above. =Brazil= In Brazil, VLI and ALL deployed a technology based on an onboard computer that uses satellite communication (Autotrac or Iridium satellite constellation), GPS positioning system and, when possible, GPRS or Radio communication. The control center sends licenses to the train and its computer supervises the train avoiding it to overspeed or to occupy an unauthorized block. It is simple and effective. Also is a relatively cheap solution since it doesn't need any signaling system implemented on the railway. =Canada=  Canadian Pacific  As of October 2018, CP has rolled out PTC to 50% of its railway network in the United States. As of July 2020, CP Rail is preparing to upgrade the Winchester Subdivision to PTC, at the same time that it reduces most of that subdivision from a double-track main to a single-track main with passing sidings. = Europe (ETCS) = Forms of Train Protection System, such as the Great Western Railway ATC system, have been operational in Europe for over one hundred years. Since 1930 in Germany was introduced InDuSI for Automatic Train Protection (ATP), but it is not \\"positive\\" in control sense. The Automatic Warning System (AWS) was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1956, and the rail network is being upgraded with Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS). Some of the first systems implementing full ATP functionality were designed for the dedicated high speed rail lines such as the French TVM, German LZB and Italian SCMT. Continuing with the success of ATP systems, Europe is today transitioning to one ATP standard, the European Train Control System (ETCS). It is well evolved as a result of many years of European ATP experience and development. Although a major driver for the implementation of ETCS is European interoperability, many non-European countries such as Australia, China, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and even US are introducing ETCS or very similar systems as the ATP system of choice. ETCS is together with GSM-R one of the foundations of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). It is a comprehensive standard for in-cab train control. GSM-R is the bundled mobile communications standard for railway operations according to the standard. Some deployments are using other communication components like TETRA. The equipment consists of on-board and infrastructure equipment. In an early cost sensitive application the variant ERTMS Regional has been developed by Banverket and the UIC. Meanwhile, this development was caught up in new baseline revision 3 as part of ETCS Level 3. The ITARUS-ATC is a hybrid of the Russian KLUB-U in-cab signalling and the Italian ETCS Level 2 GSM-R block control and in accreditation process by UIC. The system authority for ERTMS is the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA). =India= Indian Railways started working on the selection of a train control system in the late '90s. They installed ETCS Level 2 in a test section between Palwal and Mathura on the Delhi‚ÄìMumbai trunk route which is already equipped with multi-aspect color light automatic signals and is electrified with 25 kV AC 50 Hz system that is standard in India. Since then other sections have been equipped with ETCS L2, including the expansion of the original test section to cover all of Delhi to Agra. The first commercial service scheduled for 160 km/h maximum speed on the Delhi to Agra segment named Gatimaan Express using the ETCS L2 system started operation in 2016. =Mozambique= ;Nacala Railway Starting in 2013, the first PTC system in Africa began to be installed. Siemens' Trainguard Sentinel PTC system, Westrace interlockings, and Tetra radios are provided on the Nacala Corridor in Mozambique. The work was planned for completion in 2015; as of 2016, it was not yet completed, although it did receive $300 million from the African Development Bank to complete the project. =Russia= ;KLUB-U The Russian KLUB-U train control system is similar to Positive Train Control for its integration of GLONASS satellite-based train location, electronic track map distribution and digital radio (GSM-R or TETRA) usage for track-releases as well as remote initiation of train stops. GE Rail has cooperated with the Russian VNIIAS manufacturer on this system. The KLUB-U system is used widely in the Russian Federation including high-speed rail for the Sapsan. =United States= Alaska Railroad (ARRC) Wabtec Corporation is working with the ARRC to develop a collision-avoidance, Vital PTC system, for use on their locomotives. The system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, enforce speed limits, and protect roadway workers and equipment. Wabtec's Electronic Train Management System, (ETMS) is also designed to work with the Wabtec TMDS dispatching system to provide train control and dispatching operations from Anchorage. Data between locomotive and dispatcher is transmitted over a digital radio system provided by Meteor Communications Corp (Meteorcomm). An onboard computer alerts workers to approaching restrictions and to stop the train if needed. Amtrak Alstom's and PHW's Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) system is installed on parts of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston. ACSES enhances the cab signaling systems provided by PHW Inc. It uses passive transponders to enforce permanent civil speed restrictions. The system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions (PTS), protection against overspeed and protect work crews with temporary speed restrictions. GE Transportation Systems' Incremental Train Control System (ITCS) is installed on Amtrak's Michigan line, allowing trains to travel at . The 2015 Philadelphia train derailment could have been prevented had positive train control been implemented correctly on the section of track that train was travelling. The overspeed warning/penalty commands were not set up on that particular section of track although it was set up elsewhere. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) Wabtec's Electronic Train Management System, (ETMS) is installed on a segment of the BNSF Railway. It is an overlay technology that augments existing train control methods. ETMS uses GPS for positioning and a digital radio system to monitor train location and speed. It is designed to prevent certain types of accidents, including train collisions. The system includes an in-cab display screen that warns of a problem and then automatically stops the train if appropriate action is not taken. CSXT CSX Transportation is developing a Communications-Based Train Management (CBTM) system to improve the safety of its rail operations. CBTM is the predecessor to ETMS. Kansas City Southern (KCS) Wabtec's Electronic Train Management System, (ETMS) will provide PTC solutions in conjunction with Wabtec's Train Management and Dispatch System (TMDS), which has served as KCS's dispatch solution since 2007, for all U.S. based rail operations along the KCS line. In January 2015, KCS began training personnel on PTC at its TEaM Training Center in Shreveport, La., with an initial class of 160 people. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Most MBTA Commuter Rail locomotives and cab cars, except for the 1625‚Äì1652 series Bombardier control cars and the (now retired) 1000‚Äì1017 series F40PH locomotives, are equipped with the PTC compliant ACSES technology which is installed on the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. All MBTA trains traveling on any segment of the Northeast Corridor must be equipped with functioning ACSES onboard apparatus, which affects trains on Providence/Stoughton Line, Franklin Line and Needham Line routings. The MBTA will shut down some lines on weekends in 2017 and 2018 to meet a December 2020 federal deadline for full-system PTC. Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) In November 2013 the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority signed a contract of value up to $428 million to install Positive Train Control on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad, the two largest commuter railroads in the US, to a consortium of Bombardier Transportation Rail Control Solutions and Siemens Rail Automation. The LIRR and Metro-North installations will include modifications and upgrades of the existing signal systems and the addition of ACSES II equipment. Siemens stated that the PTC installation will be completed by December 2015. However an August 2016 Federal Railroad Administration study concluded Metro-North has done little to implement federally mandated safety technology and made almost no progress on positive train control. New Jersey Transit (NJT) Ansaldo STS USA Inc's Advanced Speed Enforcement System (ASES) is being installed on New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It is coordinated with Alstom's ACSES so that trains can operate on the Northeast Corridor. Norfolk Southern (NS) Norfolk Southern Railway began work on the system in 2008 with Wabtec Railway electronics to start developing a plan implement Positive Train Control on NS rails. NS has already implemented PTC on 6,310 miles of track with plans to achieve it on 8,000 miles of track. NS has requested an extension on the time to have PTC active on its miles of track due to the need to work more on areas with no track signals, as well as making provisions for smaller railroads that the company does business with to be PTC capable. NS keeps experiencing issues with the system and wants to take the proper time to fix the system to ensure the safety of its employees and all others using their tracks. NS has been adding and updating its locomotives with PTC capable computers to allow those locomotives for use on mainlines. 2,900 locomotives out of the almost 4,000 the company has have been fitted with the PTC capable computers. NS plans to put at least 500 locomotives into storage using precision NS has been updating it trackside equipment such as radio towers and control point lighting to assist in PTC operations on the railroad. With the new computers on the locomotives it allows the locomotives to interact with each other and trackside systems. Norfolk Southern's General Electric Transportation locomotives are equipped with GPS to aid in the use of PTC. All of NS's locomotives are equipped with Energy Management a computer system that provides real time data on the locomotive. The system can also control train speed and brake systems on board. The EM system allows the locatives to use less fuel and be more efficient. NS's final goal is completely autonomous operations of their trains. This system will be used alongside Auto-router used to route train movements with little to no human interactions. With these two systems integrated with PTC it allows for more precise movement and train control across the railroad. NS, Union Pacific, CSXT, BNSF, and Virginia Railway Express have been testing interoperation to make sure each companies PTC systems work with each other to ensure safe railroad travel. For this a NS train on CSXT tracks has to act like a CSXT train would or vice versa. That requires the railroads to use the same communications and radio frequencies for everything to operate smoothly. Nearly 3,000 locomotives have been fitted with the PTC capable computers. Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain) Caltrain's Communications Based Overlay Signal System (CBOSS) has been installed but not fully tested along the Peninsula Corridor between San Francisco, San Jose and Gilroy, California. Caltrain had selected Parsons Transportation Group (PTG), who had been working on a similar system for Metrolink in Southern California, to implement, install, and test CBOSS in November 2011. In February 2017, Caltrain's board canceled the contract with PTG for failure to meet the scheduled 2015 deadline. PTG and Caltrain would go on to file lawsuits for breach of contract. At its board of directors meeting on March 1, 2018, Caltrain announced that it will be awarding a contract to Wabtec for implementation of I-EMTS. Regional Transportation District (RTD) Positive Train Control (PTC) and vehicle monitoring system technologies have been developed for the Denver Metro Area's new commuter train lines that began opening in 2016. After the University of Colorado A Line opened on April 22, 2016 between Denver Union Station and Denver International Airport, it experienced a series of issues related to having to adjust the length of unpowered gaps between different overhead power sections, direct lightning strikes, snagging wires, and crossing signals behaving unexpectedly. In response to the crossing issues, Denver Transit Partners, the contractor building and operating the A Line, stationed crossing guards at each place where the A line crosses local streets at grade, while it continues to explore software revisions and other fixes to address the underlying issues. The FRA is requiring frequent progress reports, but allowed RTD to open its B Line as originally scheduled on July 25, 2016, because the B Line only has one at- grade crossing along its current route. However, FRA halted testing on the longer G Line to Wheat Ridge ‚Äì originally scheduled to open in Fall 2016 ‚Äì until more progress could be shown resolving the A Line crossing issues. G Line testing resumed in January 2018, though the A Line continues to operate under a waiver and no date has been set to open the G Line to passenger service. Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) Positive train control has been implemented at Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit's 63 crossings for the length of the initial passenger corridor which began regular service on August 25, 2017 after the FRA gave its final approval for SMART's PTC system. SMART uses the E-ATC system for its PTC implementation. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) SEPTA received approval from the FRA on February 28, 2016 to launch PTC on its Regional Rail lines. On April 18, 2016, SEPTA launched PTC on the Warminster Line, the first line to use the system. Over the course of 2016 and into 2017, PTC was rolled out onto different Regional Rail lines. On May 1, 2017, the Paoli/Thorndale Line, Trenton Line, and Wilmington/Newark Line (all of which run on Amtrak tracks) received PTC, the last of the Regional Rail lines to receive the system. Southern California Regional Rail Authority (Metrolink) Metrolink, the Southern California commuter rail system involved in the 2008 Chatsworth train collision that provided the impetus for the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, was the first passenger rail system to fully implement positive train control. In October 2010, Metrolink awarded a $120 million contract to PTG to design, procure, and install PTC. PTG designed a PTC system that used GPS technology informing position to on-board train computers, which communicate wirelessly with wayside signals and a central office. Metrolink anticipated placing PTC in revenue service by summer 2013. However, Parsons announced the FRA had authorized Metrolink to operate PTC RSD using Wabtec's I-ETMS in revenue service on the San Bernardino line in March 2015. Metrolink announced PTC had been installed on all owned right-of-way miles by June 2015, and was working to install the system on tracks shared with Amtrak, freight, and other passenger rail partners. Union Pacific (UP) In the 1990s, Union Pacific Railroad (UP) had a partnership project with General Electric to implement a similar system known as \\"Precision Train Control.\\" This system would have involved moving block operation, which adjusts a \\"safe zone\\" around a train based on its speed and location. The similar abbreviations have sometimes caused confusion over the definition of the technology. GE later abandoned the Precision Train Control platform.Lindsey, Ron (2010-12-07). \\"Really! You Gotta Let It Go.\\" Strategic Railroading. In 2008, a team of Lockheed Martin, Wabtec, and Ansaldo STS USA Inc installed an ITCS subsystem on a 120-mile segment of UP track between Chicago and St. Louis. Other major software companies, such as PROKARMA, Tech Mahindra, are also some of the strategic IT partners in development of PTC systems. Through December 31, 2017, Union Pacific Installed 99 percent, or more than 17,000 miles, of total route miles with PTC signal hardware. Union Pacific has partially installed PTC hardware on about 98 percent of its 5,515 locomotives earmarked for the same technology and have equipped and commissioned 4,220 locomotives with PTC hardware and software. Union Pacific has also installed 100 percent of the wayside antennas needed to support PTC along the company's right of way. = Zambia = In 2014 a consortium of Bombardier Transportation, Huawei and local company GMC Technologies got a contract for delivering of ERTMS Regional on Zambia Railways 980 km Chingola‚ÄìLivingstone line. Bombardier is supplying its Interflo 550 signalling and train protection technology and Huawei is responsible for GSM-R communication equipment. The backhaul between the GSM-R base stations will be realised with microwave technology.

Euphoria () is the experience (or affect) of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Euphoria is also a symptom of certain neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders, such as mania. Romantic love and components of the human sexual response cycle are also associated with the induction of euphoria. Certain drugs, many of which are addictive, can cause euphoria, which at least partially motivates their recreational use. Hedonic hotspots ‚Äì i.e., the pleasure centers of the brain ‚Äì are functionally linked. Activation of one hotspot results in the recruitment of the others. Inhibition of one hotspot results in the blunting of the effects of activating another hotspot. Therefore, the simultaneous activation of every hedonic hotspot within the reward system is believed to be necessary for generating the sensation of an intense euphoria. History of the term  The word \\"euphoria\\" is derived from the Ancient Greek terms : Œµ·Ωñ eu meaning \\"well\\" and œÜŒ≠œÅœâ pher≈ç meaning \\"to bear\\".Euphoria, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus It is semantically opposite to dysphoria. A 1706 English dictionary defines euphoria as \\"the well bearing of the Operation of a Medicine, i.e., when the patient finds himself eas'd or reliev'd by it\\". In the 1860s, the English physician Thomas Laycock described euphoria as the feeling of bodily well-being and hopefulness; he noted its misplaced presentation in the final stage of some terminal illnesses and attributed such euphoria to neurological dysfunction. ‚Ä¢ Sigmund Freud's 1884 monograph √úber Coca described (his own) consumption of cocaine producing \\"the normal euphoria of a healthy person\\",, cited in, NIDA Research Monograph #13 while about 1890 the German neuropsychiatrist Carl Wernicke lectured about the \\"abnormal euphoria\\" in patients with mania. A 1903 article in The Boston Daily Globe refers to euphoria as \\"pleasant excitement\\" and \\"the sense of ease and well-being\\". reprinted in The Boston Daily Globe, 13 May 1903. p. 6 In 1920 Popular Science magazine described euphoria as \\"a high sounding name\\" meaning \\"feeling fit\\": normally making life worth living, motivating drug use, and ill formed in certain mental illnesses. Robert S. Woodworth's 1921 textbook Psychology: A study of mental life, describes euphoria as an organic state which is the opposite of fatigue, and \\"means about the same as feeling good.\\" In 1940, The Journal of Psychology defined euphoria as a \\"state of general well being ... and pleasantly toned feeling.\\" A decade later, finding ordinary feelings of well being difficult to evaluate, American addiction researcher Harris Isbell redefined euphoria as behavioral changes and objective signs typical of morphine. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ However, in 1957 British pharmacologist D. A. Cahal did not regard opioid euphoria as medically undesirable but an effect which \\"enhance[s] the value of a major analgesic.\\" The 1977 edition of A Concise Encyclopaedia of Psychiatry called euphoria \\"a mood of contentment and well-being,\\" with pathologic associations when used in a psychiatric context. As a sign of cerebral disease, it was described as bland and out of context, representing an inability to experience negative emotion. In the 21st century, euphoria is generally defined as a state of great happiness, well-being and excitement, which may be normal, or abnormal and inappropriate when associated with psychoactive drugs, manic states, or brain disease or injury. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Neural substrates Hedonic hotspots ‚Äì i.e., the pleasure centers of the brain ‚Äì are functionally linked. Activation of one hotspot results in the recruitment of the others. Inhibition of one hotspot results in the blunting of the effects of activating another hotspot. Therefore, the simultaneous activation of every hedonic hotspot within the reward system is believed to be necessary for generating the sensation of euphoria. Types Many different types of stimuli can induce euphoria, including psychoactive drugs, natural rewards, and social activities. Affective disorders such as unipolar mania or bipolar disorder can involve euphoria as a symptom. =Exercise-induced= Runners can experience a euphoric state often called a \\"runner's high\\". Continuous physical exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, can induce a state of euphoria; for example, distance running is often associated with a \\"runner's high\\", which is a pronounced state of exercise-induced euphoria. Exercise is known to affect dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens, producing euphoria as a result, through increased biosynthesis of three particular neurochemicals: anandamide (an endocannabinoid), Œ≤-endorphin (an endogenous opioid), and phenethylamine (a trace amine and amphetamine analog). =Music-induced = Euphoria can occur as a result of dancing to music, music-making, and listening to emotionally arousing music. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the reward system plays a central role in mediating music-induced pleasure. Pleasurable emotionally arousing music strongly increases dopamine neurotransmission in the dopaminergic pathways that project to the striatum (i.e., the mesolimbic pathway and nigrostriatal pathway). Approximately 5% of the population experiences a phenomenon termed \\"musical anhedonia\\", in which individuals do not experience pleasure from listening to emotionally arousing music despite having the ability to perceive the intended emotion that is conveyed in passages of music. A clinical study from January 2019 that assessed the effect of a dopamine precursor (levodopa), dopamine antagonist (risperidone), and a placebo on reward responses to music ‚Äì including the degree of pleasure experienced during musical chills, as measured by changes in electrodermal activity as well as subjective ratings ‚Äì found that the manipulation of dopamine neurotransmission bidirectionally regulates pleasure cognition (specifically, the hedonic impact of music) in human subjects. This research suggests that increased dopamine neurotransmission acts as a sine qua non condition for pleasurable hedonic reactions to music in humans. =Copulation-induced= The various stages of copulation may also be described as inducing euphoria in some people. Various analysts have described either the entire act of copulation, the moments leading to orgasm, or the orgasm itself as the pinnacle of human pleasure or euphoria. =Drug-induced= A large dose of methamphetamine causes a drug- induced euphoria. A euphoriant is a type of psychoactive drug which tends to induce euphoria. Most euphoriants are addictive drugs due to their reinforcing properties and ability to activate the brain's reward system. Stimulants Dopaminergic stimulants like amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, and methylphenidate are euphoriants. Nicotine is a parasympathetic stimulant that acts as a mild euphoriant in some people. Chewing areca nut (seeds from the Areca catechu palm) with slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) ‚Äì a common practice in South- and Southeast Asia ‚Äì produces stimulant effects and euphoria. The major psychoactive ingredients ‚Äì arecoline (a muscarinic receptor partial agonist) and arecaidine (a GABA reuptake inhibitor) ‚Äì are responsible for the euphoric effect. Depressants Certain depressants can produce euphoria; some of the euphoriant drugs in this class include alcohol in moderate doses, , and ketamine. Some barbiturates and benzodiazepines may cause euphoria. Euphoriant effects are determined by the drug's speed of onset, increasing dose, and with intravenous administration. Barbiturates more likely to cause euphoria include amobarbital, secobarbital and pentobarbital. Benzodiazepines more likely to cause euphoria are flunitrazepam, alprazolam and clonazepam. Benzodiazepines also tend to enhance opioid-induced euphoria. Pregabalin induces dose- dependent euphoria. Occurring in a small percentage of individuals at recommended doses, euphoria is increasingly frequent at supratherapeutic doses (or with intravenous- or nasal administration). At doses five times the maximum recommended, intense euphoria is reported. Another GABA analogue, gabapentin, may induce euphoria. Characterized as opioid-like but less intense, it may occur at supratherapeutic doses, or in combination with other drugs, such as opioids or alcohol. Ethosuximide and perampanel can also produce euphoria at therapeutic doses. Opioids ¬µ-Opioid receptor agonists are a set of euphoriants that include drugs such as heroin, morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. By contrast, Œ∫-opioid receptor agonists, like the endogenous neuropeptide dynorphin, are known to cause dysphoria, a mood state opposite to euphoria that involves feelings of profound discontent. Cannabinoids Cannabinoid receptor 1 agonists are a group of euphoriants that includes certain plant-based cannabinoids (e.g., THC from the cannabis plant), endogenous cannabinoids (e.g., anandamide), and synthetic cannabinoids. Inhalants Certain gases, like nitrous oxide (N2O, aka \\"laughing gas\\"), can induce euphoria when inhaled. Glucocorticoids Acute exogenous glucocorticoid administration is known to produce euphoria, but this effect is not observed with long-term exposure. = Fasting‚Äìinduced = Fasting has been associated with improved mood, well-being, and sometimes euphoria. Various mechanisms have been proposed and possible applications in treating depression considered. = Neuropsychiatric = Mania Euphoria is also strongly associated with both hypomania and mania, mental states characterized by a pathological heightening of mood, which may be either euphoric or irritable, in addition to other symptoms, such as pressured speech, flight of ideas, and grandiosity. Although hypomania and mania are syndromes with multiple etiologies (that is, ones that may arise from any number of conditions), they are most commonly seen in bipolar disorder, a psychiatric illness characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression.  Epilepsy  Euphoria may occur during auras of seizures [emphasis added] typically originating in the temporal lobe, but affecting the anterior insular cortex. This euphoria is symptomatic of a rare syndrome called ecstatic seizures, In a table listing cases of ecstatic seizures reported in the literature, descriptions include: \\"Euphoric and talkative\\", \\"calm euphoria\\", \\"Pleasant feeling, euphoria\\", \\"Pleasant feeling, and feels euphoria\\", \\"short euphoric states\\"; others are within the definition of euphoria: \\"Sudden feeling of extreme well-being\\", \\"Ineffable joy. Intense pleasure without match in reality (perhaps music)\\", \\"Extreme happiness\\", \\"intense (non-sexual) pleasure\\", \\"Intense happy feeling\\", \\"Sudden indescribably pleasant and joyous feeling\\", \\"Sensation of intense well-being\\", \\"Intense pleasant feeling\\", \\"Intense feelings of bliss and well-being\\". often also involving mystical experiences. Euphoria (or more commonly dysphoria) may also occur in periods between epileptic seizures. This condition, interictal dysphoric disorder, is considered an atypical affective disorder. Persons who experience feelings of depression or anxiety between or before seizures occasionally experience euphoria afterwards.  Migraine  Some persons experience euphoria in the prodrome ‚Äì hours to days before the onset ‚Äì of a migraine headache. [emphasis added] [emphasis added] [emphasis added] Similarly, a euphoric state occurs in some persons following the migraine episode.  Multiple sclerosis  Euphoria sometimes occurs in persons with multiple sclerosis as the illness progresses. This euphoria is part of a syndrome originally called euphoria sclerotica, which typically includes disinhibition and other symptoms of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction.

Modern symmetric-key ciphers are specifically designed to be immune to such an attack. In other words, modern encryption schemes are pseudorandom permutations and are designed to have ciphertext indistinguishability. If an algorithm is found that can distinguish the output from random faster than a brute force search, then that is considered a break of the cipher. A similar concept is the known-key distinguishing attack, whereby an attacker knows the key and can find a structural property in cipher, where the transformation from plaintext to ciphertext is not random. Overview To prove that a cryptographic function is safe, it is often compared to a random oracle. If a function would be a random oracle, then an attacker is not able to predict any of the output of the function. If a function is distinguishable from a random oracle, it has non-random properties. That is, there exists a relation between different outputs, or between input and output, which can be used by an attacker for example to find (a part of) the input. Example Let T be a sequence of random bits, generated by a random oracle and S be a sequence generated by a pseudo-random bit generator. Two parties use one encryption system to encrypt a message M of length n as the bitwise XOR of M and the next n bits of T or S respectively. The output of the encryption using T is truly random. Now if the sequence S cannot be distinguished from T, the output of the encryption with S will appear random as well. If the sequence S is distinguishable, then the encryption of M with S may reveal information of M. Two systems S and T are said to be indistinguishable if there exists no algorithm D, connected to either S or T, able to decide whether it is connected to S or T. A distinguishing attack is given by such an algorithm D. It is broadly an attack in which the attacker is given a black box containing either an instance of the system under attack with an unknown key, or a random object in the domain that the system aims to emulate, then if the algorithm is able to tell whether the system or the random object is in the black box, one has an attack. For example, a distinguishing attack on a stream cipher such as RC4 might be one that determines whether a given stream of bytes is random or generated by RC4 with an unknown key. Examples Classic examples of distinguishing attack on a popular stream cipher was by Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir who showed that the 2nd output byte of RC4 was heavily biased toward zero.Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir, A Practical Attack on Broadcast RC4. FSE 2001, pp152 - 164 (PS) . In another example, Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel of COSIC have shown that the XOR value of the 1st and 2nd outputs of RC4 is also non-uniform. Significantly, both the above theoretical biases can be demonstrable through computer simulation.Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel, Analysis of Non- fortuitous Predictive States of the RC4 Keystream Generator.

As a Confederate brigadier general, he led a daring cavalry raid into Kentucky in December 1864, in which his troops burned seven county courthouses which were being used as barracks by the Union Army. Early life Lyon was born in what is now Lyon County, Kentucky, to a wealthy plantation family. He was a grandson of Congressman Matthew Lyon. Both of his parents died when was very young, and he inherited the estate. Lyon's guardian secured a good education for him, and he attended the Masonic University of Kentucky and Cumberland College. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at the age of sixteen, graduating in 1856 as placing nineteenth in a class of forty-eight. He was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery Regiment and was assigned to duty at Fort Myers during the Third Seminole War. After hostilities with the Seminoles waned, Lyon was promoted to the permanent rank of second lieutenant in 3rd Artillery and sent to Fort Yuma in California. The following year, he was ordered to the Washington Territory, where he took part in two battles with local Indians. Assigned to Fort Vancouver, he secured a leave of absence and returned home to Kentucky. Civil War When the Civil War began in April 1861, Lyon was promoted to first lieutenant. However, his sympathies were with the Confederacy and he resigned from the United States Army. He raised Company F, 3rd Kentucky Infantry, which soon became part of the 1st Kentucky Artillery. Lyon equipped the unit, which initially was known as Lyon's Battery, later Cobb's Battery. In January 1862 Lyon was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 8th Kentucky Infantry and exercised command in the absence of the colonel. Lyon's regiment was part of the garrison of Fort Donelson, Tennessee. After fighting off three attacks by the Union Army, the fort finally surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant. Lyon was sent as a prisoner of war. first to Camp Morton, at Indianapolis and then to Camp Chase, Ohio. He and other captured officers were sent taken to Fort Warren, where he was finally exchanged in September. His regiment was soon reorganized as the 8th Kentucky, now re-enlisted for three years, with Lyon appointed as its colonel. He fought in the forces of Earl Van Dorn and then John C. Pemberton during the Vicksburg Campaign. He and 250 of his men managed to avoid surrendering to Grant, and Lyon led them to Jackson, Mississippi, where they joined the Confederate forces there. Later, Braxton Bragg appointed Lyon as commander of two regiments of cavalry under Joseph Wheeler, and he served under James Longstreet during the Siege of Knoxville. Following the Third Battle of Chattanooga, Lyon was placed in charge of Bragg's artillery, saving them from capture during his subsequent retreat. Lyon returned to commanding cavalry in 1864, this time in Mississippi as a brigadier general under Nathan B. Forrest. In December 1864, he led 800 Kentucky cavalrymen on a raid into Tennessee and western Kentucky both to enforce Confederate draft laws and to draw Union troops away from General John Bell Hood's Nashville campaign. His men burned seven county courthouses that were being used to house Union troops, including those at Princeton, Marion and Hopkinsville. He retreated south after the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Nashville to rejoin Forrest in Mississippi. In January 1865, Lyon was surprised while sleeping in a private home in Red Hill, Alabama, by a detachment of the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry. After he was captured, he shot and killed the Union sergeant who captured him, Arthur Lyon (no apparent relation), by asking to retrieve his clothes and grabbing a hidden pistol, then escaped in his nightgown. Postbellum When the war ended, Lyon accompanied Governor Isham G. Harris of Tennessee into Mexico, intending to offer his services to King Maximilian. He was a civil engineer in Mexico for nearly a year before finally returning to his home in Eddyville, Kentucky, where he resumed farming and opened a prosperous mercantile business. He also served as state prison commissioner, primarily responsible for what is now the Kentucky State Penitentiary being located in his hometown of Eddyville. His initials are still inscribed over the Kentucky State Penitentiary's front gate. Lyon was married three timesfirst in 1861 to Laura O'Hara who died in 1865, with whom he had a son; second in 1869 to Grace Machen, who died in 1873, with whom he had four children; and third in 1887 to Ruth Wolf, who died in 1952, with whom he had two children.

As part of Operation Fortitude, a series of deception operations had been used to divert attention from the Allied landings by suggesting that a second invasion force was still waiting to land. This caused the defenders to divert their forces from the fighting in Normandy, holding them in reserve for an invasion in the Pas de Calais, to the east. Some days after the initial landings, it was decided to mount a smaller operation to simulate a follow-up landing force heading for Granville, at the western side of the Cotentin Peninsula. The desired effect would be to force the German command to pull units from the front line and redeploy them to protect the western coast. The plan was for two Royal Canadian Navy destroyers, Haida and Huron, to make a series of fake radio transmissions, which would be intercepted. The beginning of the operation went smoothly, with the two ships signalling that the invasion fleet had been delayed by engine problems, and giving a revised plan. However, the radios on the Haida broke down, forcing the Huron to continue alone; the two ships were also spotted by an Allied reconnaissance plane, which radioed back that it had found \\"unidentified warships\\". The operation was a failure; whilst the signals were made, there was no reaction from the German force. This may have been helped by the Allied air report - the pilot would have been informed - and by a lack of any corroborating evidence; for example, there was no attempt at spoofing radar signals, as had been carried out for the main invasion by Operation Glimmer and Operation Taxable.

Its purpose was to link Highway 3 and Highway 401 with the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel and downtown Windsor. The portion of the route between Howard Avenue and Highway 401 is a short divided highway known as the Dougall Parkway.  Route description  The former route of Highway 3B begins at an interchange with Highway 401 as the Dougall Parkway, proceeding westward as a four-lane divided highway, and encountering interchanges with Concession Road 6 and with Howard Avenue (formerly Highway 3). It turns northwestward at that point and intersects Essex County Road 42 (Cabana Road). At E.C. Row Expressway, the road gains a central divider, but has traffic lights for full access to and from the freeway. It then travels under the CN Rail tracks (still with a central reservation), and along the curve to Ouellette Avenue. It continues north before terminating at the intersection with Wyandotte Street in downtown Windsor, just two blocks from the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel.  History  Highway 3B was originally named Highway 3A, when its parent road (Highway 3) was re-routed to meet the newly finished Ambassador Bridge. The original alignment was then named Highway 3A. In 1935, the road was renamed Highway 3B. This road originally travelled along Howard Avenue and Dougall Avenue, before making a short 3-block jog east along Tecumseh Road to Ouellette Avenue, continuing to downtown Windsor's ferry docks. When the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel was completed in 1930, the Highway was truncated about one kilometre from the ferry docks, at the intersection of Ouellette Avenue and London Street (now University Avenue), just two blocks from the tunnel entrance at Goyeau Street. When the Ouellette Avenue curve was constructed in 1963, the portion north of the curve along Dougall Avenue and Tecumseh Road was reverted to municipal control, and the designation of Highway 3B was placed on the re-aligned curve leading along Dougall Avenue and Ouellette Avenue. In 1966, the road was also designated as a connecting link. This meant that while Windsor would have more responsibility in maintaining and repairing the road, the Ministry of Transportation would still contribute and help. The road's status as a provincial highway was repealed in 1975, but the connecting link agreement was kept, allowing the road to still be signed as Highway 3B, to reduce confusion among motorists. The connecting link was repealed in 1998. Today, the road is simply known as Howard Avenue, Dougall Avenue, and Ouellette Avenue. In 2008 and 2009, as part of the reconstruction of the section of Highway 401 from Dougall Parkway to Province Road, the Dougall Parkway interchange with Highway 401 was reconfigured, replacing a one-lane 1950s-era underpass tunnel with a modern high-speed flyover ramp. The old Dougall Parkway junction reduced eastbound Highway 401 traffic to one lane as it merged with Dougall Parkway, whereas the new one allows three lanes per direction of Highway 401 to pass through the interchange. = Confusion = During the 1980s and 1990s, many maps listed Dougall Parkway as Highway 401 (resulting in two branches of Highway 401) even though it was technically incorrect, as the actual Highway 401 continued on westward past the junction with Dougall Parkway towards Highway 3. Dougall Parkway was less-commonly listed as Highway 3B on some correct maps. This is no longer the case, however, since Highway 3B no longer technically exists as a provincial highway, and Dougall Parkway is now maintained by the City of Windsor. = Highway 3B Maidstone = This road existed from 1931 to 1938 in Maidstone, Ontario, between Windsor and Essex, Ontario. This road became Highway 98A in 1938, which was later re-designated as Highway 114, and ultimately decommissioned.

It was located in the Old Sacramento State Historic Park at 1119 Second Street. A new site is under development and the museum is expected to reopen by 2019. The Museum begun in 1991 during the administration of California Governor Pete Wilson. 11 years later Governor Gray Davis made it a permanent Museum under the California State Military Department, providing it permanent funding. On 13 July 2004, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made it the State's official Military Museum. The Museum highlights contributions of individuals and units from California in the US military, and its various military operations and wars. The museum in 2011, through a collaborated effort with the California Department of Veteran Affairs and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, represented by guest curator Natalia Visante, created themed exhibitions showcasing various military units. In addition to its main location in Sacramento, the Museum has five satellite Museums located at Camp Roberts in southern Monterey County, Camp San Luis Obispo, Fresno Air National Guard Base, the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base in Orange County and the National Guard Armory in San Diego. To honor Californians who have laid down their lives in the Global War on Terrorism, the California State Military Museum built a \\"Global War on Terrorism Wall of Honor\\". Constructed of black granite, this memorial is located in the entrance of the museum. The names of the service members who have died September 11, 2001, in the attack on the Pentagon, as well as casualties of the Afghanistan and Iraq Campaigns are listed chronologically. The memorial includes their rank, branch of service, and age. Currently, the annual wreath laying ceremony has ended, due to the Museum's closure. The Major General Walter P. Story Memorial Library is one of the finest collections of military history writings in the western United States. With over 10,000 volumes and growing rapidly, the library is one of the State's hidden educational and historical treasures. Topics range from general military history to very specific and one of a kind documents, such as original unit rosters of early California Militia units. As of March 2014, the California State Military Museum was closed amid disputes between the non-profit foundation operating it and the California Military Department which oversees its operation. This conflict, in addition to state of California budget constraints, forced indefinite closure of the museum.

In 1980 he was inducted into the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame. Seibert, a Massachusetts native, graduated from the New Hampton School in New Hampshire and served in the 10th Mountain Division during World War II, training as an elite ski trooper at Camp Hale in Colorado. Wounded in the leg by a mortar shell blast in the Battle of Riva Ridge in Italy, he returned to the United States to begin recuperation. Like other ski soldiers who had trained at Camp Hale, Seibert returned to Colorado, where he became a ski patrolman at the Aspen Mountain Ski Resort. In 1950 he qualified for the 1950 U.S. Ski Team, which hosted the 1950 World Championships at Aspen, although his injury prevented him from competing. In 1957, Seibert and rancher Earl Eaton climbed Vail Mountain where, as trainees from Camp Hale (Earl did not train at Camp Hale but he did help build it), they had learned winter bivouacking, and decided to build \\"the most beautiful ski resort in the world\\". They raised funds from a group of Denver investors, bought a ranch at the base of Vail mountain and, to distract competitors, called it the \\"Trans Montane Rod and Gun Club\\". The resort was built in 1962 at the base of Vail mountain, opening on December 15, 1962 with two chairlifts, one gondola. A lift ticket cost $5. In seven years, Vail grew to become the most popular ski resort in Colorado. Seibert hoped that Vail and (the future) Beaver Creek would host the skiing portions of the 1976 Winter Olympics, which had been awarded to Denver in 1970. However the proposition was voted down, funding rejected in November 1972, and the games returned to Innsbruck, Austria, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Olympics. Seibert led a partnership which bought Snow Basin, near Ogden, Utah, in 1978, but ran into financial difficulty in 1984. The area was sold that October to Earl Holding, owner of Sun Valley in Idaho. Snowbasin was the venue for the alpine speed events of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Pete's Bowl in Vail's Blue Sky Basin, and the Pete's Express lift, was named for Seibert when the second phase of the expansion area opened in December 2000. Seibert died at age 77 on July 15, 2002, following a nine-month battle with esophageal cancer. A small plaza, built in the 1970s, at the top of Bridge Street in Vail is named Seibert Circle in his honor. While Pete was best known for founding Vail, Pete's life was dedicated to the passion that skiing should be accessible to everyone.

College career After playing football, basketball and track at Tappan Zee High School, Winter took a tour of colleges in the Northeast United States after his senior year of high school, looking for an opportunity to play college football. Syracuse was the only school to offer Winter a scholarship, and that was only after a previous commit decommitted. Winter was named a team captain and most valuable player during his senior season with the Orange. Professional career =Indianapolis Colts= Winter was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the second round (35th overall) of the 1984 NFL Draft. He started all but one game during his rookie season, and was named to some all-rookie teams. A shoulder injury landed him on injured reserve during his sophomore season; the Colts released him at the end of the year. =San Diego Chargers (first stint)= Winter played with the San Diego Chargers during the 1987 season, which was shortened by a players strike. =Green Bay Packers= Winter was traded to the Green Bay Packers in early 1988 in exchange for past considerations. He started most of the 1988 and 1989 seasons, but played in a limited role in 1990 and was cut by the Packers early in the 1991 calendar year. Following his release from the team, Winter made telephone calls to every NFL team and also made a highlight reel which was shipped to every team. He started driving to team facilities in an effort to get signed, but did not draw any interest until the offseason, when the San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota Vikings and Los Angeles Rams showed interest, and Winter participated in workouts for the Vikings and 49ers. =San Diego Chargers (second stint)= Winter was signed by the San Diego Chargers in the time period preceding the 1992 NFL Draft. He originally sat third-string on the depth chart, but later started during the season after Joe Phillips refused to agree to a contract and George Thornton did not play well. He played the 1993 season before being cut by the team. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= Winter was a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a brief time in the 1994 offseason. =San Diego Chargers (third stint)= The Chargers brought Winter back for the 1994 season, but a cut block by Dave Cadigan of the Cincinnati Bengals tore Winter's anterior cruciate ligament in September, ending his season. =Buffalo Bills= Winter signed with the Buffalo Bills in spring 1995 after an onslaught of injuries to the team's defensive line, but he himself spent the year on the injured reserve list. After playing Winter, his wife and children moved to Appleton, Wisconsin after his playing career ended. He wrote an autobiography, entitled \\"A Reason to Believe\\". The University of Central Florida hired Winter as a defensive line coach for the 2012 season. Winter spent one season on the coaching staff and then departed, citing a lack of family time. After coaching, Winter became a motivational speaker. Personal life Winter was born with a cleft palate and he later grew tumors in both of his ears. He dabbled in martial arts in high school. Winter was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016.

Bartenstein and R√∂√üel were the two major Teutonic strongholds in Barta, one of the Prussian lands. The castle endured years of siege until 1264 and was one of the last to fall into the hands of the Prussians. The garrison in Bartenstein numbered 400 against 1,300 Bartians who lived in three forts surrounding the city. Such tactics were very common in Prussia: build your own forts so that any communication with the outside world would be cut off. However, at Bartenstein the forts were far enough away to allow the castle to send out men on raids of the surrounding area. Local noble Miligedo, who showed the Knights secret ways in the area, was killed by the Prussians. The Knights managed to burn down all three forts when Bartians were celebrating a religious holiday. However, they soon returned and rebuilt the forts. Bartenstein was running out of supplies and no help was coming from the headquarters of the Teutonic Knights. They had already eaten their horses, so the only way to escape was on foot. Therefore they decided to trick the Prussians in order to gain a lead. The Knights remained silent inside the castle and did not ring the bell for church service. Such silence tricked the Bartians to believe that the soldiers had fled and they came to examine the castle. Once they were close enough the Knights attacked them with arrows and stones. This was repeated three times, and when the Knights actually fled, they left one old blind man behind to ring the church bell. This allowed them to gain several days and safely reach K√∂nigsberg and Elbing. Other castles at Wistotempil, Schippenbeil, and Kreuzburg fell sometime in 1263. The castles presented a definite threat to the Bartians and Warmians, who had to keep their armies at home and could not participate in the wider uprising.

It is a suburban subdivision, consisting mostly of low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2007, the area is home to 2,748 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $66,555, an average dwelling value of $257,789 and a home ownership rate of 85.1%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $356,116. History L'√âcole canadienne-fran√ßaise (former St. James School) The most of the land for the Nutana Park neighbourhood was annexed by the city between 1910 and 1919, with the remaining southern piece annexed between 1960 and 1969. According to a 1913 map of registered subdivisions, the name \\"Nutana Park\\" was one of many developments in the area, the rest of which went unbuilt. Some of the other subdivisions included University Park, Nutana View, Sterling Park, Alta Vista and Hampton Park. Home building began in the area after World War II, with the greatest activity between 1961 and 1970. The majority of residential units are single-family detached houses, with a small number of semi-detached and apartment units. Prince Philip School began construction in 1959 and opened in 1960. Another public elementary school, Lorne Haselton School, opened in 1961 but closed in the mid-1980s. The school was named in honour of Dr. L. D. Haselton, a longtime school dentist and board member. St. James School served the neighbourhood until 2005, when it was closed due to declining enrolment. One notable alumnus of the school is Mike Babcock, current NHL head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. After St. James' closure, the francophone √âcole canadienne-fran√ßaise took over the building; it is Saskatoon's only francophone high school. Extensive renovations to the building were completed in 2008. Government and politics Nutana Park exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîGrasswood.

Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, he played the major leagues for the Washington Senators (1926‚Äì31 and 1935), Chicago White Sox (1932), St. Louis Browns (1932‚Äì34), New York Yankees (1936‚Äì40), New York Giants (1941), and Philadelphia Athletics (1941). Early life Hadley was born on July 5, 1904 to Irving A. and Effie B. Hadley in Lynn, Massachusetts. Irving A. Hadley was a successful Boston lawyer and it was expected that his son would follow him in the profession. Hadley attended Lynn English High School, where earned letters in baseball, basketball, track, rowing, and football. He set an interscholastic shot-put record and excelled as a punter on the school's football team. As a member of the school's baseball team, Hadley threw a no-hitter against Chelsea High School. On May 3, 1923 he struck out a North Shore League record 21 batters in a one-hit shutout against Chelsea. He went on to attend Mercersburg Academy. Hadley started out as Mercersburg's third baseman, but moved to the mound after the team's pitcher dropped out of school. On June 4, 1924, Hadley threw a perfect game against the State Forestry School in which he struck out 26 of 27 batters he retired. After Mercersburg, Hadley attended Brown University. He left the school during his sophomore year after being ruled academically ineligible for the upcoming baseball season and signed with East Douglas in the independent Blackstone Valley League, where he went 17‚Äì2. Professional career =Washington Senators= Hadley made his major league debut on April 30, 1926 against the New York Yankees. In 3 innings of relief, Hadley gave up 6 hits, 2 walks, and 4 earned runs. Hadley was demoted to the Birmingham Barons, where he posted a 14‚Äì7 record with a 3.83 earned-run average. In the spring of 1927, Hadley contracted mumps, which led him receiving the nickname \\"Bumps\\" (later shortened to \\"Bump\\"). He became the team's #3 starter that year and compiled a 14‚Äì6 record with a 2.85 ERA. In 1928, Hadley missed several weeks due to appendicitis. He finished the season with a 12‚Äì13 record and a 3.54 ERA. On September 3, 1928, he surrendered Ty Cobb's final career hit. Hadley struggled in 1929, going 6‚Äì16 with a 5.62 ERA. He improved the following year with a 15‚Äì11 record. In 1931, Senators Manager Walter Johnson elected to use Hadley as a starter for home games only, as he felt that Hadley did not do well on the road. Hadley made a league leading 55 appearances that season (11 starts and 44 relief appearances). He went 11‚Äì10, with an improved ERA of 3.06. He also tallied seven saves. That season, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy offered Tony Lazzeri to the Senators for Hadley and infielder Jackie Hayes. The trade did not take place, however, as Clark Griffith wanted Buddy Myer instead of Hayes. Instead, Hadley was traded to the Chicago White Sox after the season with Hayes and Sad Sam Jones for John Kerr and Carl Reynolds. =St. Louis Browns= After making three appearances for the White Sox, Hadley was traded to the St. Louis Browns for Red Kress. Hadley finished the 1932 season and the American League leader in losses (21), earned runs allowed (149), walks (171), and hit batters (8). In 1933, Hadley went 15‚Äì20 with a 3.92 ERA while pitching a league-leading 316 innings. He finished the following season with a 10‚Äì16 record. =Return to Senators= On January 19, 1935, Hadley was traded to the Senators for catcher Luke Sewell and cash. He posted a 10‚Äì15 record with a 4.92 ERA in his return to Washington. =New York Yankees= On January 17, 1936, Washington traded Hadley and Roy Johnson to the Yankees for Jimmie DeShong and Jess Hill. Hadley was given a spot in the starting rotation by Manager Joe McCarthy. He went 14‚Äì4 for the Yankees en route to the team's first AL pennant since 1932. In Game 3 of the 1936 World Series, Hadley gave up 11 hits, but only one run in a 2 to 1 victory over the New York Giants. The Yankees went on to win the series in six games. On May 25, 1937, Hadley hit Detroit Tigers catcher Mickey Cochrane in the head with a pitch. The pitch fractured Cochrane's skull, which ended his playing career. Hadley insisted that he had not hit Cochrane on purpose. Cochrane and his teammates also absolved Hadley from blame. The Yankees returned to the World Series that year and Hadley started (and lost) game four, but the Yankees won the series four games to one. Hadley was moved to the bullpen early on in 1938, but eventually returned to the stating rotation. He finished the year with a 9‚Äì8 record and a 3.60 ERA. The Yankees won their third consecutive championship by sweeping the Chicago Cubs in the 1938 World Series, however Hadley was not included on the World Series roster. Hadley finished the 1939 season 12‚Äì6, with a 2.98 ERA. He won game three of the 1939 World Series after pitching eight innings out of the bullpen. The Yankees went on to win the series the following game. Hadley faltered in 1940, going 3‚Äì5, with a 5.74 ERA. The team slipped as well, falling to third place in the American League. =Giants and Athletics= On December 31, 1940, Hadley was sold to the New York Giants. It was the first transaction between the two rival clubs. After making only one appearance with the Giants, Hadley's contract was purchased by the Yankees. However, a day later his contract was sold to the Philadelphia Athletics. According to Shirley Povich of the Washington Post the move was made because \\"Hadley is on the payroll of the American League publicity department as exhibiting for its official movie film, and the National League would scarcely permit one of its pitchers to promote good-will for the AL\\". Personal life On November 2, 1927, Hadley married Jessie Gibbs at The First Baptist Church of the City of Washington, D.C. The two first met when they attended Lynn English High School. The couple had two children and by the 1940s were residing in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Retirement Hadley retired after the 1941 season and returned to Massachusetts. In 1942, he played for a Lynn semipro team and pitched a four-hit shutout against the Boston Braves in an exhibition game benefiting the war-effort. In 1942 he began hosting a sports show for WBZ radio. In 1948 he became the sports director for WBZ-TV, where he served as an announcer for the Boston Red Sox, Boston Braves, and Boston Bruins. He later worked as a paint salesman, represented a fuel oil company, and sold office equipment. He was also a New England scout for the New York Yankees. On February 15, 1963, Hadley died of heart attack at Lynn Hospital.

History This family-owned company was established as \\"Wallis Theatres\\" by its founder, Hugh Wallis, in 1956 with the opening of the Blueline drive-in theatre at West Beach in South Australia. The Blueline was the state's first drive-in theatre. Wallis Theatres expanded rapidly, opening drive-in theatres throughout South Australia over the next decade. The company operated the following drive-in theatres in Adelaide: * Blueline, West Beach * Oceanline, Christies Beach * Mainline, Gepps Cross * Parkline, Mitchell Park * Valleyline, St Agnes * Harbourline, Outer Harbour * Hi-line, Panorama * Hollywood, Salisbury Downs Wallis Theatres also catered for country South Australia, with drive-in theatres established in the Riverland, Barossa Valley and mid-north. Wallis' six country drive-ins were: * Bonneyline, Barmera * Murrayline, Berri * Northline, Clare * Riverline, Loxton * Groveline, Renmark * Barossaline, Tanunda The company opened South Australia's first multi-screen cinema in 1971 when the single-screen Glenelg Ozone was purchased and transformed into what is now the Glenelg Cinema Centre. In 1972, Wallis Theatres saved the Chelsea Cinema at Marryatville from demolition. This cinema is now heritage-listed. The company's growth continued when Wallis Theatres purchased a warehouse in Hindmarsh Square, Adelaide, and converted it into a twin cinema. A further three screens were built in 1980, and the complex was named Academy Cinema City. Wallis Theatres purchased the single-screen Forum Cinema at North Adelaide in 1983. This location was redeveloped into the Piccadilly Cinemas, although the company sought to maintain the heritage and architecture of the building. The company built and opened the five-screen Noarlunga Cinema Centre in 1991, the Mount Barker Cinemas in 2003, and the Mitcham Cinemas in 2007. Wallis Theatres had closed and sold most of their country and suburban drive- ins by the early 1990s. Of their remaining drive-in locations, the Blueline closed in 1998 and the Valleyline in 2003. However, Wallis continues to operate the Mainline drive-in. The company closed their single-screen Oxford Cinema at Unley in 2001. In 2007, faced with dwindling audience numbers, Wallis Theatres also closed down their five-screen Academy Cinema City complex, which has since been demolished. Competition from the Greater Union cinema complex (later rebranded as an \\"Event\\" cinema) at Marion resulted in falling numbers of patrons to the Glenelg Cinema Centre, which was closed in February 2009 and the building demolished in 2011. In 2005, Wallis Theatres changed their branding for all public advertising purposes to \\"Wallis Cinemas\\". Officially, however, the company was still known as Wallis Theatres. This changed in late 2007 when officially it was changed to the new name Wallis Cinemas. Locations * Piccadilly Cinemas, North Adelaide (3 screens) * Mount Barker Cinemas (7 screens) * Noarlunga Cinema Centre (5 screens) * Mitcham Cinemas at Mitcham Square Shopping Centre (7 screens) * Mainline Drive-in, Gepps Cross (1 screen) Other activities Besides operating their cinemas, Wallis Theatres works in conjunction with Big Screen Advertising. This company is involved in the distribution and screening of advertisements at cinemas. Big Screen Advertising has supplied pre-film advertising to all of Wallis' cinema locations since 2004, when Val Morgan Cinema Advertising (Wallis' previous advertising agent) was absorbed by rival cinema chain Hoyts. Wallis Theatres owns and operates Auchendarroch House and the Wallis Tavern, both located at Mount Barker adjacent to Wallis' cinema complex. Auchendarroch House is an 1800s mansion that has been restored by Wallis to serve as a function centre. Wallis also provides services to independent cinema operators in South Australia (including the Capri Theatre and Victor Harbor theatre), such as programming.

He batted and threw left- handed. Baseball career In 1905, Leifield was the ace of the Western League's Des Moines Underwriters, winning 26 games to help the Underwriters take the pennant. In September, Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss purchased his contract for $2,500. Leifield pitched a shutout in his major league debut. From 1906 to 1911, Leifield stayed in the Pittsburgh starting rotation, winning 15 or more games each season. In 1909, he went 19-8 to help the Pirates win the National League pennant. He was traded to the Chicago Cubs in 1912. On July 4, 1906, in the first game of a doubleheader at Exposition Park, Leifield lost a double one-hitter to Mordecai Brown and the Chicago Cubs, 1-0 (1 of only 5 double one-hitters in major league history, 4 since 1901). Leifield had a no-hitter going into the 9th inning but gave up a run on a hit and an error. Leifield's own single was the only hit for the Pirates. He would be the only pitcher in MLB history to lose a decision despite throwing at least nine innings with one or fewer hits and no walks allowed, until Rich Hill of the Los Angeles Dodgers gave up a walk-off home run to Josh Harrison of the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 23, 2017. Coincidentally, the game was held at PNC Park, which is located near where Exposition Park once stood. After being released in 1913, Leifield returned home, and then went to San Francisco, California to pitch in the Pacific Coast League. In 1915, he went to spring training with the Pirates but instead played for the St. Paul Saints of the American Association. On August 20, he struck out 15 in a game for the Saints. In 1918, Leifield returned to the majors as a player-coach for the St. Louis Browns, and then as a full-time coach for the Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers. He finished his major league career with 124 wins. Leifield died in Fairfax, Virginia at the age of 87. He was the last surviving member of the 1909 World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates.

Sliepcevich (July 29, 1919 - March 3, 2008) was one of the leading figures in the development of health education as an academic discipline and profession. Biography A 1939 graduate of the University of Idaho, Sliepcevich received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949 and her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. She was a professor of health education at the Ohio State University in 1961, when she was selected to direct the School Health Education Study (1961‚Äì1969). Most health education curricula developed since have been based on the 10 conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study: community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse. The Study‚Äôs model curriculum became known as the School Health Curriculum Project (later renamed Growing Healthy) The Study‚Äôs findings were also the major reason for President Nixon‚Äôs creation of the President's Committee on Health Education in 1971. When the National Center for Health Education (NCHE) was created in 1975 as a result of one of the recommendation of the Committee, Dr. Sliepcevich was one of the Center‚Äôs founders. She was one of the principal framers of the NCHE‚Äôs first major activity, the Health Education Role Delineation Project (1978‚Äì1981). Following the School Health Education Study, she joined the faculty of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC), where she was Professor in both the Department of Health Education and the School of Medicine, and team taught courses with David Duncan, Robert Gold, and Elaine Vitello. She continued to teach at SIUC until her retirement in 1993. She died in Norman, Oklahoma on March 3, 2008.Obituary of Dr. Elena M. Sliepcevich , SIUC website. Retrieved 10 June 2011.

Available in ., ., and . capacities and contain ABC Dry Chemical, Purple-K, or sodium bicarbonate. They are currently manufactured by Ansul in cartridge- operated form, along with Amerex, Badger and Buckeye stored pressure design.  UL rating differences for \\"Fast Flow\\"  These extinguishers have a higher dry chemical flow rate then conventional extinguishers. In other words, a fast flow extinguisher expels a higher volume of agent in less time than a standard compliance flow extinguisher. As a result, fast flow extinguishers have lower UL class A&B; ratings than compliance flow extinguishers (the class B numerical rating is the approximate square feet of burning fuel a novice operator could expect to extinguish). UL Class B tests are conducted on fuel in depth fires in what is known as a burn pan. Burn pans come in various sizes (square feet) in relation to what UL rating an extinguisher will receive for successfully extinguishing it. The larger the burn pan fire, the larger the rating and the longer the extinguisher must discharge to be able to handle the larger volume of fire before running out. For a given size extinguisher the resulting effect is a lower flow rate, resulting in a higher UL rating. Generally for same size extinguishers (agent capacity) *High UL rating = Low flow rate *Low UL rating = High flow rate =Examples= *A . ABC Compliance flow has a UL rating of 20A, 120 BC. *A . ABC Fast Flow has a UL rating of 4A, 60 BC. Fast Flows and the NFPA In the revised NFPA 10 section \\"5-5 \\"Application for Specific Hazards\\" requires \\"fast flow\\" extinguishers in locations containing pressurized flammable liquids and pressurized flammable gas and areas with three-dimensional class B hazards. Pressurized gas and three-dimensional fires require higher flow rates then standard extinguishers in order to be extinguished. The higher flow rate puts more agent onto the fire quicker and results in a faster \\"knock-down\\" of the fire. Higher flow rates also provide more operator protection by putting a \\"heavier\\" stream of dry chemical in between the operator and fire. This creates a temporary \\"heat shield\\" as long as the agent is being discharged because of the light color of the agent it reflects most of the radiant heat back away from the operator.

History The News-Heralds history dates back to the 1870s, when the Rev. George W. Owen established the Wyandotte Herald in Wyandotte, MI. After merging with the Wyandotte Daily News, from 1944 it was known as the Wyandotte News-Herald.Bacon Memorial District Library, Local history. Accessed 25 May 2017. The Mellus Newspapers started in the 1920s, subsequently flourished for decades under famous publisher/editor William Mellus. The current News-Herald format was established under the Heritage Newspapers brand in 1986, when the late industrialist Heinz Prechter brought the old News-Herald (based in Wyandotte, MI) and Mellus Newspapers (based in Lincoln Park, MI) from SEM Newspapers Inc. and combined them into a single Downriver publication each Wednesday. In 1988, The News-Herald relocated to their current offices at Interstate 75 and Northline Road in Southgate, MI and launched \\"Weekender\\" editions in select communities, which was later incorporated into Heritage Sunday and is now known as the Sunday News-Herald. A Friday edition of The News-Herald delivered exclusively via the United States Postal Service began publishing on March 3, 2006 and was discontinued after the April 20, 2012 edition. Following the 2013 merger of 21st Century Media and MediaNews Group to form Digital First Media, the current owner, the News-Herald was placed in 2014 into Digital First's newly formed Detroit region, which also includes longtime sister papers the Macomb Daily and the Detroit News. The other 21st Century-owned newspapers in Michigan were placed into Digital First's Michigan region, headquartered in Pontiac.

Hone Heke fells the flagstaff at Kororareka. Painting by Arthur David McCormick. Flagstaff Hill (Maiki Hill) overlooks the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. Directly north of the small historical village of Russell, the flagstaff on the hill played a significant role in early relations between the local MƒÅori of the NgƒÅpuhi iwi and early British colonials. History After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in February 1840 at Waitangi, across the bay, relations between the NgƒÅpuhi and PƒÅkehƒÅ (used by the NgƒÅpuhi to mean British European) began to deteriorate. Hone Heke, a local MƒÅori chief, identified the flagstaff flying the Union Jack above the bay at Kororareka as the symbolic representation of the loss of control by the NgƒÅpuhi in the years following the signing of the Treaty. There are a number of causes of Heke's anger, such the fact that the capital of New Zealand had been moved from Okiato (Old Russell) to Auckland in 1841, and the colonial government had imposed customs duties on ships entering the Bay of Islands, these and other actions of the colonial government were viewed by Heke as reducing the trade between the NgƒÅpuhi with the foreigners. Traders in the Bay of Island also ferment trouble by saying that flag-staff, flying the Queen's flag; showed that the country [whenua] was gone to the Queen, and that the NgƒÅpuhi were no longer their own masters, but taurekareka (slaves) to Queen Victoria. The flagstaff was cut down for the first time on 8 July 1844, by Te Haratua, an ally of Hone Heke. Heke had set out to cut down the flagstaff but had been persuaded by Archdeacon William Williams not to do so. The flagstaff was replaced and troops sent to guard the flagstaff. On 10 January 1845 the flagstaff was cut down a second time, on this occasion by Hone Heke. On 18 January 1845, a flagstaff sheathed in iron was erected. The next morning the flagstaff was cut down again by Hone Heke. The next attack on the flagstaff by Hone Heke was a much more serious incident, Hone Heke's warriors attacked the guard post, killing all the defenders and Heke cut down the flagstaff for the fourth time. At the same time, possibly as a diversion, Te Ruki Kawiti and his men attacked the town of Kororareka. This was the beginning of what would be called the 'Flagstaff War' or the 'Northern War'. In 1846 Hone Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti agreed peace terms with the government. The British colonial government did not re-erect the flagstaff again, fearing to provoke further conflict. The flagstaff that now stands at Kororareka was erected in January 1858 at the direction of Kawiti's son Maihi Paraone Kawiti; with the flag being named Whakakotahitanga, ‚Äúbeing at one with the Queen.‚Äù As a further symbolic act the 400 NgƒÅpuhi warriors involved in preparing and erecting the flagstaff were selected from the ‚Äòrebel‚Äô forces of Kawiti and Heke ‚Äì that is, NgƒÅpuhi from the hapu of TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene (who had fought as allies of the British forces during the Flagstaff War), observed, but did not participate in the erection of the fifth flagpole. The restoration of the flagpole was presented by Maihi Paraone Kawiti was a voluntary act on the part of the NgƒÅpuhi that had cut it down in 1845, and they would not allow any other to render any assistance in this work. The continuing symbolism of the fifth flagstaff at Kororareka is that it exists because of the goodwill of the NgƒÅpuhi.

The battle On March 20, 1995, some 35,000 Turkish troops launched an invasion into Northern Iraq.

On May 3, after the Kurdistan Democratic Party delegation to Turkey said that they would stop PKK activities in Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey withdrew its remaining forces on May 4.

Career McGinnis started his career with the St. Louis Brown Stockings (or Browns) of the American Association and was one of their top pitchers. From 1882 to 1884, he pitched over 300 innings and won over 20 games each year. After the team acquired Bob Caruthers and Dave Foutz, however, McGinnis's role on the Browns' pitching staff was greatly reduced.

The assault was scheduled for 9 September 1945, but was forestalled following the Surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945.Park, p. 2155, para 351. Once the lodgement was secure, the Allies would have initiated Operation Mailfist, during which ground forces were to advance south through Malaya and liberate Singapore.Chant (2013) It was expected that Operation Mailfist would begin in December 1945 and conclude in March 1946.Warren, p. 297 Operation Tiderace was planned soon after the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug 6 and 9.

While Operation Zipper was executed ahead of schedule, it did so on a much smaller scale, having quickly transferred a proportion of its original strength to Operation Tiderace. The convoy consisted of about 90 ships, which included two battleships, and the French battleship Richelieu. The heavy cruiser HMS Sussex served as the flagship. HMAS Hawkesbury was the sole Australian warship during the Japanese surrender, escorting the repatriation transport Duntroon. A smaller British naval force was given the task of liberating Penang under Operation Jurist, a component of the overall Operation Zipper. There were a total of seven escort carriers: , HMS Attacker, , HMS Empress, HMS Hunter, HMS Khedive and HMS Stalker. The Japanese naval fleet in Singapore consisted of the destroyer Kamikaze and two cruisers, My≈çk≈ç and Takao, both of which had been so badly damaged before that they were being used as floating anti- aircraft batteries. Two ex-German U-boats, I-501 and I-502 were also in Singapore. Both were moored at Singapore Naval Base. Air strength in both Malaya and Sumatra was estimated to be a little more than 170 aircraft.Park, p. 2156, para 371. Return to Singapore Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten signs the acceptance of surrender for Great Britain. Brigadier (later Gen.) Thimayya (future Chief of Staff of the Indian Army) is visible on the far left of the Allied table representing Indian forces. 12 September 1945 Operation Tiderace commenced when Mountbatten ordered Allied troops to set sail from Trincomalee and Rangoon on 31 August for Singapore. The fleet was not armed with offensive weapons as Mountbatten had good reason to believe that the Japanese in Malaya and Singapore would surrender without a fight: on 20 August General Itagaki Seishiro, the commander in Singapore, had signalled Mountbatten that he would abide by his emperor's decision and was ready to receive instructions for the Japanese surrender of Singapore. Japan's defeat had caught the Japanese Command in Singapore by surprise. Many were unwilling to surrender and had vowed to fight to the death. Itagaki had initially balked at the order to surrender and instead ordered the 25th Army (the component of the 7th Area Army defending Singapore) to resist when the Allies arrived. There was even a secret plan to massacre all Allied PoWs on the island. However, three days after the Emperor's announcement on 15 August, Itagaki flew from Singapore to Saigon to confer with his leader Field Marshal Count Terauchi, Commander of the Japanese Southern Army and all forces in South-east Asia. Terauchi prevailed over Itagaki who then sent his signal to Mountbatten. Newspapers in Singapore were finally allowed to carry the text of the Emperor's speech, confirming what many already knew from listening to All India Radio broadcasts from Delhi on forbidden shortwave radios. The Allies arrived in Malaya on 28 August, with a small portion of the fleet sent to recapture Penang as part of Operation Jurist. On 30 August 1945 a flight of 9 RAAF Catalinas landed in Singapore bearing medical supplies and personnel documents in preparation for the Japanese surrender and the liberation of the thousands of PoWs on the island.Agency, Digital Transformation. \\"Flying boats in the Second World War, 1939‚Äì45  australia.gov.au\\" . www.australia.gov.au.

The fleet arrived in Singapore on 4 September 1945, meeting no opposition. However, the French battleship Richelieu struck a magnetic mine at 07:44 on 9 September while passing down the Straits of Malacca. She eventually limped into Singapore at 12:00 on 11 September.Sarnet & Le Vaillant, pp. 331‚Äì334 General Itagaki, accompanied by Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome and his aides, were brought aboard HMS Sussex in Keppel Harbour to discuss the surrender. They were received by Lieutenant- General Sir Philip Christison and Major-General Robert Mansergh. A tense encounter began when a Japanese officer reportedly remarked, \\"You are two hours late,\\" only to be met with the reply, \\"We don't keep Tokyo time here.\\" By 18:00, the Japanese had surrendered their forces on the island. An estimated 77,000 Japanese troops from Singapore were captured, plus another 26,000 from Malaya. The formal surrender was finalised on 12 September at Singapore City Hall. Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia Command, came to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in South East Asia from General Itagaki on behalf of Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, commander of the Japanese Southern Army Group who had suffered a stroke earlier in the year. A British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Itagaki departed for Japan shortly afterwards to face trial and execution as a war criminal. Japanese reaction to the surrender Itagaki had met his generals and senior staff at his HQ at the former Raffles College in Bukit Timah and told his men that they would have to obey the surrender instructions and keep the peace. That night, more than 300 officers and men killed themselves by falling onto their swords in the Raffles Hotel after a farewell sake party, and later, an entire Japanese platoon killed themselves using grenades. About 200 Japanese soldiers decided to join the communist guerrillas whom they were fighting just days before in a bid to continue the fight against the British. But they soon returned to their units when they found out that the MPAJA, which was funded by the Malayan Communist Party, did not plan to fight the returning British. Nonetheless, some stayed hidden in the jungles with the communists, and when Chin Peng and remnants of the Malayan Communist Party ended their struggle in 1989, two former Japanese soldiers emerged from the jungle with the communists and surrendered.

The basement once housed an auxiliary generator system. Although the building was completed in 1931, it took three more years to complete the hookups to the alarm boxes that were dispersed throughout the city. The system went into service in 1934. Change to another use Advances in alarm system and dispatching technology made the Gamewell obsolete by 1958, although Tulsa maintained its system as a backup until 1966. The Fire Alarm Office moved to the newer Police & Municipal Courts Building at the Civic Center in 1981. The building was used by the Fire department until 1984. It was left vacant and fell into disrepair. In 1994, it was purchased by Martin Newman, chairman of the Tulsa Preservation Commission. During the hiatus, it was damaged by a flood in 1984 and by vandalism. In 2000, The American Lung Association of Oklahoma purchased the building as its new headquarters. After a $5 million fund-raising campaign, the renovation of the building was completed in 2005. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, under Criteria A and C. The NRIS number is 03000879. Conversion to a fire fighting museum The Tulsa Development Authority reached an agreement to sell the building to the Firefighters Union for a museum in 1986-1987, but the union was unable to raise the necessary funding for the project. In March 2015, the Tulsa World reported that the American Lung Association plans to sell the building soon. A group of fire history buffs and other interested people wish to buy the building and turn it into a museum that would display a large collection of fire fighting memorabilia.

Anthony Apesos (2007) Biography Apesos was born on 6 January 1953 in Newark, New Jersey, the son of John and Helen Apesos. Later that year, his family returned to Philadelphia, where his parents were restaurateurs. Apesos attended The Episcopal Academy from 1965 to 1972, after which he received his A.B. at Vassar College in Religion. Apesos studied painting under Morris Blackburn, Arthur de Costa, Ben Kamahira, and Sidney Goodman at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1975 to 1979, and received a M.F.A. in 1991 from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. In 1992, Apesos moved to Boston, and became chair of the Fine Arts department at the Art Institute of Boston (now part of Lesley University). Apesos founded AIB's M.F.A. program, and currently is professor of Fine Arts. Work Apesos's painting, while indebted to the American realist tradition, is informed by a fascination with mythology and archetypical themes; in this respect, his work exhibits striking parallels with the visual art of the Romantic poet and artist William Blake. Technically, Apesos draws upon the traditions of late Renaissance painting, in particular that of the Venetian masters; his work is characterized by the employment of opalescent scumbles (translucent layers of pigment placed over solid colors to produce effects of depth and texture for the viewer), and inventive, often unsettling modes of composition in which figures and background are juxtaposed in simultaneously traditional and unfamiliar ways. Representative paintings Snow and Milk: here, the binary opposition of white and black, cold and hot, is juxtaposed against the traditional artistic figure of the female nude, providing a symbolic matrix within which to consider the way that Western art has objectified as well as celebrated femininity and the body in general. Recipe: composed with a fundamental palette of red, black, and white, and evoking both ancient pictorial traditions (the unveiling of the Vestal Virgin) as well as archetypal symbolism (earth and water, dark and light) to reflect upon the fundamental and yet mysterious nature of human reproduction, focused here upon the powerful and compositionally-central figure of the mother.

It is situated between the villages of Ganeshpuri and Vajreshwari, north-east of Mumbai. On the Siddha Yoga path it is known as the \\"mother ashram\\" because it is where Siddha Yoga really began. History The ashram's origins date back to the guru known as Bhagavan Nityananda, who had been in the nearby village of Ganeshpuri since 1936. Before he died in 1961, Nityananda is said to have told his devotee, Swami Muktananda, to build an ashram near Ganeshpuri on land that Nityananda gave him. Nityananda prophesied that the ashram would become \\"very big and beautiful\\" and would attract people from all over the world.Brooks 1997, p.42 Swami Muktananda established the ashram and called it Sri Gurudev Ashram, in honour of Nityananda. In 1978, Muktananda changed the name to Gurudev Siddha Peeth. The ashram has since grown as Nityananda predicted and is the site of shrines to both Nityananda and Muktananda (who died in 1982). It functions as a full-time spiritual retreat for people who want to pursue their Siddha Yoga practices. The ashram also runs short-term retreats, for example a seven-day \\"Pilgrimage to the Heart Retreat.\\" In addition to spiritual practice, the ashram established significant charitable services for the benefit of the adivasis (tribal people) of the area. Medical services and housing were provided for these people and for other poor people in the valley. The PRASAD Project was set up to administer these projects.Brooks 1997, p.153 The PRASAD Project also organized several eye-camps in which those who were blind from cataracts received free corrective surgery that restored their eyesight.

On the completion of repairs, she departed England with others of the force; and, after stops at Brest and the Azores, set out to recross the Atlantic.

The New York Times. April 4, 2004. Retrieved December 2, 2018. \\"Another quote that has been attributed to me is, 'Home-run hitters drive Cadillacs and singles hitters drive Fords.' That was actually first said by my Pirates teammate, pitcher Fritz Ostermueller.\\" Career Ostermueller in 1934 Ostermueller made his major league debut on April 21, 1934 with the Boston Red Sox, pitching seven seasons for them, chiefly as a starter. On December 3, 1940, he was sold to the St. Louis Browns, along with Denny Galehouse. He was the ace of the Pirates staff in 1947 and 48 at the age of 41 and was called \\"Old Folks.\\" As a hitter, Ostermueller was better than average for a pitcher. He posted a .234 batting average (175-for-749) with 60 runs, 62 RBI and 35 bases on balls. He did not hit any home runs in his major league career. In popular culture Ostermueller was portrayed in the film 42 by Linc Hand. In the film, Ostermueller hits Jackie Robinson with a high pitch, but in a subsequent game Robinson hits a game winning home run off him. In reality Ostermueller's first inning pitch hit Robinson on the left wrist, not his head, and he claimed it was a routine brushback pitch without racist intent. His family denied that he was a racist, it was just \\"a movie ploy.\\" There was no fight on the mound afterwards. The climactic scene in which Robinson hit a home run to clinch the National League pennant for the Dodgers came in the top of the fourth inning of the game, did not clinch the victory (it made the score 2‚Äì0, and the Dodgers eventually won 4‚Äì2), and did not clinch the pennant; the Dodgers clinched at least a tie for the pennant on that day before clinching the pennant the next day. Also notable is that Ostermueller was portrayed as being right-handed. Later life and death He coached in college and built and became the owner-operator of the Diamond Motel in Quincy, Illinois. He died in December 1957, aged 50, of colon cancer.

At the time of the Battle of Alcatraz, Thompson was serving life plus 99 years for kidnapping and for the murder of Amarillo Texas police officer Detective Lemuel Dodd Savage. He also pulled armed robberies in New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma. He had notoriously bad luck when getting caught, but extremely good luck at escaping from jail. He had been arrested eight times and held in small jails, and had escaped every time. Thompson had a record of eight escapes from custody by the time he was transferred to Alcatraz in October 1945. Detective Savage was shot and killed while transporting Thompson and Elber Day to jail. Savage had arrested the two when he found them burglarizing a store. He searched the two suspects before transporting, but missed a handgun hidden in Thompson's pants. During the transport, Thompson produced the gun and shot Savage. As Thompson fled, he kidnapped three other people before being apprehended. Thompson was convicted of federal kidnapping charges and sent to Alcatraz Prison. While in Alcatraz, Thompson was part of the Battle of Alcatraz, an escape attempt that ultimately left Correctional Officer Harold Stites and Correctional Officer William Miller, of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, dead from gunshot wounds. Battle of Alcatraz San Quentin gas chamber On May 2, 1946, Thompson, with five other inmates, participated in the unsuccessful attempt to escape Alcatraz by seizing the prison's gun gallery and then the prison launch to San Francisco. Although initially successful, the convicts failed to open the yard door and the failed escape turned into a bloody struggle that lasted almost two days before prison authorities regained control. Thompson survived the fighting, which left two corrections officers dead and thirteen wounded, and three convicts dead. Thompson was tried for his part in the violence, specifically accused of inciting Joe Cretzer to open fire on nine hostage guards in an effort to eliminate witnesses. Thompson was found guilty along with inmate Sam Shockley, and they were executed simultaneously in the gas chamber of San Quentin on December 3, 1948.

During World War II, Joseph Stalin was forced to move his biological warfare (BW) operations out of the path of advancing German forces and may have used tularemia against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. By 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union. Although the USSR also signed the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the Soviets subsequently augmented their biowarfare programs. Over the course of its history, the Soviet program is known to have weaponized and stockpiled the following eleven bio-agentsCook, Michelle Stem and Amy F.

(brucellosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, (VEE), Botulinum toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, Smallpox, and Marburg virus. These programs became immense and were conducted at 52 clandestine sites employing over 50,000 people. Annualized production capacity for weaponized smallpox, for example, was 90 to 100 tons. In the 1980s and 1990s, many of these agents were genetically altered to resist heat, cold, and antibiotics. In the 1990s, Boris Yeltsin admitted to an offensive bio-weapons program as well as to the true nature of the Sverdlovsk biological weapons accident of 1979, which had resulted in the deaths of at least 64 people. Defecting Soviet bioweaponeers such as Colonel Kanatjan Alibekov confirmed that the program had been massive and still existed. An agreement was signed with the US and UK promising to end bio-weapons programs and convert BW facilities to benevolent purposes, but compliance with the agreement ‚Äî and the fate of the former Soviet bio-agents and facilities ‚Äî is still mostly undocumented. History =Pre-World War II= The Soviet BW program began in the 1920s at the Leningrad Military Academy under the control of the state security apparatus, known as the GPU. This occurred despite the fact that the USSR was a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Convention, which banned both chemical and biological weapons.Martin, James W., George W. Christopher and Edward M. Eitzen (2007), ‚ÄúHistory of Biological Weapons: From Poisoned Darts to Intentional Epidemics‚Äù, In: Dembek, Zygmunt F. (2007), Medical Aspects of Biological Warfare, (Series: Textbooks of Military Medicine), Washington, DC: The Borden Institute, pg 11. 1928 - Revolutionary Military Council signed a decree about weaponization of typhus. The Leningrad Military academy began cultivating typhus in chicken embryos. Human experimentation occurred with typhus, glanders and melioidosis in the Solovetsky camp. A laboratory on vaccine and serum research was also established near Moscow in 1928, within the Military Chemical Agency. This laboratory was turned into the Red Army's Scientific Research Institute of Microbiology in 1933.Vadim J. Birstein. The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science.

Tularemia, Biological Warfare, and the Battle for Stalingrad (1942-1943) . Military Medicine 166.10 (October 2001) Tularemia was allegedly used against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. Around 10,000 cases of tularemia had been reported in the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1943. However, the number of cases jumped to more than 100,000 in the year of the Stalingrad outbreak. German Panzer troops fell ill in such significant numbers during the late summer of 1942 that the German military campaign came to a temporary halt. German soldiers became ill with the rare pulmonary form of tularemia, which may indicate the use of an aerosol biological weapon (the ordinary transmission pathway is through ticks and rodents). According to Kenneth Alibek, the used tularemia weapon had been developed in the Kirov military facility. It was suggested by some, however, that the outbreak might have been of natural origin, since a pulmonary form of tularemia has also been noted in natural outbreaks in Martha's Vineyard in 2000. In the Soviet Union, the outbreak at Stalingrad was described as a natural outbreak. Crops were left in the field during the German offensive and the rodent population swelled, putting many inhabitants into contact with infected rodents. In some parts of the Stalingrad Oblast, as many as 75% of the inhabitants became infected. It was also noted that before the war, there was a so-called \\"threshing tularemia\\", caused by people inhaling infected dusts soiled by rodents while threshing grain.Yelkin, I. I. (1980), \\"Military Epidemiological Doctrine (Based on Protection of Troops Against Epidemics During the 1941 - 1945 Great Patriotic War)\\" in Translation: Tularemia in the USSR JPRS 82072 (25 October 1982) [ADA357123] At the conclusion of the war, Soviet troops invading Manchuria captured many Unit 731 Japanese scientists and learned of their extensive human experimentation through captured documents and prisoner interrogations. Emboldened by these discoveries, Stalin put KGB chief Lavrenty Beria in charge of a new BW program. =The Cold War= 1946: A biological weapons facility was established in Sverdlovsk. The first smallpox weapons factory in the Soviet Union was established in 1947 in the city of Zagorsk, close to Moscow. It was produced by injecting small amounts of the virus into chicken eggs. An especially virulent strain (codenamed India-1967 or India-1) was brought from India in 1967 by a special Soviet medical team that was sent to India to help eradicate the virus. The pathogen was manufactured and stockpiled in large quantities throughout the 1970s and 1980s. 1953: The fifteenth directorate of the Red Army takes responsibility for the program. By 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union. Although the USSR also signed the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the Soviets subsequently augmented their biowarfare programs. They doubted the United States‚Äô claimed compliance with the BWC, which further motivated their program.Alibek, Op. cit. The Soviet BW effort became a huge program, comprising various institutions under different ministries along with commercial facilities and collectively known as Biopreparat after 1973. Biopreparat pursued offensive research, development, and production of biological agents under the guise of legitimate civil biotechnology research. It conducted its clandestine activities at 52 sites and employed over 50,000 people. Annualized production capacity for weaponized smallpox, rabies, and typhus, for example, was 90 to 100 tons.B. Beckett (1983), Weapons of Tomorrow, New York, NY: Plenum Press. 1973: A \\"civilian\\" main directorate Biopreparat was founded.

The development of genetically altered strains of smallpox was presumably conducted in the Institute under the leadership of Dr. Sergei Netyosov in the mid-1990s, according to Kenneth Alibek. (aka Kanatjan Alibekov). It has been reported that Russia made smallpox available to Iraq in the beginning of the 1990s. Post-BWC developments The Soviet Union continued the development and mass production of offensive biological weapons, despite having signed the 1972 BWC. The development and production were conducted by a main directorate (\\"Biopreparat\\") along with the Soviet Ministry of Defense, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of Health, the USSR Academy of Sciences, the KGB, and other state organizations. In the 1980s, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture successfully developed variants of foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest against cows, African swine fever for pigs, and psittacosis to kill chicken. These agents were prepared to be sprayed down from tanks attached to airplanes over hundreds of miles. The secret program was code-named \\"Ecology\\". =The post-Soviet era= In the 1990s, the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, admitted to an offensive bio-weapons program as well as to the true nature of the Sverdlovsk biological weapons accident of 1979, which had resulted in the deaths of at least 64 people.J Miller, S Engelberg, and W Broad (2001), Germs: Biological Weapons and America‚Äôs Secret War, New York, NY: Simon & Schuster. Soviet defectors, including Colonel Kanatjan Alibekov, the first deputy chief of Biopreparat from 1988 to 1992, confirmed that the program had been massive and that it still existed. In September 1992, Russia signed an agreement with the United States and Great Britain promising to end its bio-weapons program and to convert its facilities for benevolent scientific and medical purposes.M Leitenberg (2001), Working Paper: Biological Weapons in the 20th Century: A Review and Analysis, College Park, Md: Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland, University of Maryland; 2001.

General Professor Peter Burgasov, former Chief Sanitary Physician of the Soviet Army, and a senior researcher within the program of biological weapons described this incident: :‚ÄúOn Vozrozhdeniya Island in the Aral Sea, the strongest formulations of smallpox were tested. Suddenly, I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in Aralsk. A research ship of the Aral fleet had come within 15 km from the island (it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 km). The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck. The smallpox formulation‚Äî 400 gr. of which was exploded on the island‚Äî‚Äùgot her‚Äù, and she became infected. After returning home to Aralsk, she infected several people, including children. All of them died. I suspected the reason for this and called the General Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Defense and requested to forbid the Alma-Ata train from stopping in Aralsk. As a result, an epidemic throughout the country was prevented. I called Andropov, who at that time was the Chief of the KGB, and informed him of the unique formulation of smallpox obtained on Vozrozhdeniya Island.‚Äù =Anthrax= Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the city of Sverdlovsk in 1979. The death toll was at least 105, but no one knows the exact number, because all hospital records and other evidence were destroyed by the KGB, according to former Biopreparat deputy director Kenneth Alibek. =Marburg virus= The Soviet Union reportedly had a large biological weapons program enhancing the usefulness of the Marburg virus. The development was conducted in Vector Institute under the leadership of Dr. Ustinov who was accidentally killed by the virus. The samples of Marburg taken from Ustinov's organs were more powerful than the original strain.

Biography  Thomas Limerick was born on January 7, 1902 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He grew up in a middle-class family until his father died when he was 15. His family was soon thrown into poverty and left Thomas, the oldest of 5 children, to get a job. Originally a boxcar bandit, he joined a gang of bank robbers headed by Maurice Denning based in Gage County, Nebraska in 1934. On August 23, 1934 the gang robbed a National Guard Armory, and between October and November of that year, robbed large banks in Hawarden, Iowa, Dell Rapids, South Dakota and Superior, Nebraska. Limerick was arrested in a nightclub in St. Joseph, Missouri on May 25, 1935. Limerick was sentenced to life imprisonment at Leavenworth Penitentiary, but later transferred to Alcatraz. Alcatraz escape attempt In the spring of 1938, Limerick, James Lucas, and Rufus Franklin planned an escape from Alcatraz. Their escape plan began by incapacitating an unarmed guard supervising a work detail on the top floor. Once the supervisor was rendered unconscious, the convicts would escape through a window to the rooftop, where they would incapacitate an armed guard and leave the island via a seized police boat. They enacted their escape plan on May 23, 1938 in the prison's mat shop, where they assaulted Custodial Officer Royal Cline with hammer blows to his head. They proceeded to the roof, where an armed guard shot both Franklin and Limerick, although Lucas wasn't shot. Other guards arrived at the scene. Franklin, Limerick, and Lucas were cornered and surrendered to the guards. Cline died of his injuries the next day, as did Limerick. Lucas and the other surviving convict, Rufus Franklin, were tried for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Publication history The H'San Natall first appeared in Teen Titans Vol. 2 #1 and were created by Dan Jurgens and George P√©rez. Fictional species biography The H'San Natall are a dangerous and dominating alien race that had conquered planets that number to the thousands. The H'San Natall also employed bio-genetic tactics in their invasion plans. Years ago, the H'San Natall had enslaved a group of Psion scientists who performed a number of genetic experiments. One of these experiments resulted in the bio-engineering of elite warriors with one of them being the shapeshifting bounty hunter Jugular. The H'San Natall had also developed breeding experiments to help in their plans. They are primarily known for abducting and impregnating nine human females to further their plans. All but one female (who later became Queen) were released with the memories of their experiments wiped from their memories. Nine months later on June 21, the human/H'San Natall hybrids were born and were to serve as the H'San Natall's sleeper agents for their upcoming invasion. When it came to their 16th birthdays, the H'San Natall planned to abduct the children they created and bring them back to the planet Titan for mental conditioning and then take over the Earth. They only succeeded in capturing Isaiah Crockett, Toni Monetti, and Cody Driscoll. Just before Isaiah Crockett was abducted, Atom (who was reverted to a teenager at the time) was caught in the energy stream and was transported as well.Teen Titans Vol. 2 #1 Once on the alien ship, they met and rescued another human/H'San Natall hybrid named Prysm who had been raised in a virtual reality environment.Teen Titans Vol. 2 #2 Atom and the teenagers escaped from the H'San Natall ship while evading Jugular in the process. Each of the teenagers had developed superpowers and joined up with Atom to form the new incarnation of the Teen Titans.Teen Titans Vol. 2 #3 The H'San Natall used the anti-alien group known as the Veil as their front when it comes to discrediting the Teen Titans and capturing them. One of their goals involved killing Scorcher of Dark Nemesis (who was also a human/H'San Natall) and framing Risk. The Teen Titans were able to find evidence that cleared Risk of the murder charges.Teen Titans Vol 2. #21 The Teen Titans are hunted by Deathstroke who ended up capturing them and bring them to the H'San Natall.Teen Titans Vol. 2 #22 Once there, Prysm discovers her mother, known as Queen Miraset, is alive and living among the H‚ÄôSan Natall. Prysm also meets her father King Ch‚ÄôAh who has a glasslike appearance similar to Prysm. Pylon reveals the H‚ÄôSan Natall used a group called the Veil as a front for their objectives. On the outside, the Veil was an organization with one objective: Eliminate all alien influence from the Planet Earth. In actuality, its leader Pylon was a member of the H‚ÄôSan Natall.Teen Titans Vol. 2 #23 Before the H'San Natall can reprogram the human/H'San Natall hybrids to begin their invasion of Earth, the Teen Titans are then saved upon the arrival of Captain Marvel Jr., Changeling, and Superman. Although King Ch'Ah wanted to bring their children back to their homeworld, Superman threatened to bring their mothership down if they continued any further acts of aggression. King Ch'Ah stood down. The Teen Titans and Superman were able to talk the H'San Natall out of further acts of aggression.

It is based on the 1900 novel of the same title by Thomas Anstey Guthrie and later inspired the American fantasy sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. The film stars Tony Randall, Burl Ives and Barbara Eden. Plot Architect Harold Ventimore (Tony Randall) buys a large antique container that turns out to imprison a genie named Fakrash (Burl Ives), whom Harold inadvertently sets free. Fakrash is effusively grateful for his release, and persistently tries to do favors for Harold to show his gratitude. However he has been in the brass bottle for a long time, and Fakrash‚Äôs unfamiliarity with the modern world causes all sorts of problems when he tries to please his rescuer. Harold ends up in a great deal of trouble, including with his girlfriend, Sylvia Kenton (Barbara Eden).

H. Weiler found the film \\"about as funny as your own funeral\\", and dismissed it as \\"one of the duller fantasies dreamed up by Hollywood's necromancers.\\" Retrospective Tony Mastroianni says The Brass Bottle is 'not a bad little movie\\" for what it is: \\"well-made but rather unpretentious.\\" Lee Pfeiffer notes the \\"inspired cast\\" and finds the film \\"mildly amusing\\" Overall, he says the film \\"clearly belongs\\" to Burl Ives, who is \\"genuinely amusing\\" as a genie trying to learn how to live in the 20th century and \\"dominates every scene he is in\\". Craig Butler calls The Brass Bottle a \\"silly and fairly predictable comedy, the kind that Hollywood was making in the early 1960s before it figured out that people were more and more getting this kind of fluff on television, where it was more at home.\\" While not a great comedy, it is \\"pleasant, amiable and diverting\\".

Geography  Pytheas situated the Osismii at the end of the peninsula of Kaba√Øon, which is not clearly identifiable today. This could be related to large peninsula of Cap-Sizun, on the southern-western coast of Finist√®re, just before reaching the difficult maritime pass of Pointe du Raz where the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and of the English channel are joining; this peninsula offers to the south a natural safe harbour in the aber and bay of today's town of Audierne, as well as in the bay of today's Douarnenez, to the north of the peninsula. Other hypotheses situate it in the small peninsula of Kermorvan in today's commune of Ploumoguer and bordering the ria of Le Conquet, but the whole peninsula of Crozon with its large bays and safe harbors is not excluded, even if it does not extend to the westernmost point.

In 1908, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for President Pierre Nord Alexis. The country of Haiti was looked upon as a strategically vital location by the United States at the onset of World War I. The U.S. had extended its influence throughout the Caribbean and Latin America following the construction of the Panama Canal by invoking the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. In 1914, the United States under President Woodrow Wilson presented a project for the control of customs and finances of Haiti, which was having increasing problems in repaying debts to the US and France. Borno, then Foreign Minister of President Joseph Davilmar Th√©odore, refused to cede financial control. The United States responded by confiscating the reserves of the National Bank of Haiti. On 28 July 1915, a Haitian mob killed President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam in the legation of France, where he had taken refuge after having ordered the execution of nearly 200 political prisoners, most from the mixed-race elite. The same day, U.S. troops landed in the country, restoring order to Port-au-Prince. They organized the election of a new president, Philippe Sudr√© Dartiguenave, and immediately imposed a US protectorate. Borno, appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, negotiated a U.S. commitment to the economic development of the country and refused to transfer any territory. American racial contempt and brutality against the local population led to armed revolts in the countryside carried out by \\"cacos\\", farmers who had remained armed since the war of independence. The peasants had a strong culture of rebellion. U.S. troops claimed several thousand victims. Embarrassed by media coverage of the war and disappointed at the ineffectiveness of the occupation, U.S. President Warren G. Harding decided in 1922 to improve the level of American administrators; he appointed as High Commissioner Major General John H. Russell, Jr..  Cooperating President  When President Dartiguenave had served out his term, Louis Borno was elected by the State Council on 10 April 1922, to the surprise of the Americans. Borno, however, soon came to an agreement with Russell. He maintained a policy of \\"honest and frank cooperation\\", as Borno called it, and persuaded the Americans to help develop the country economically. The Haitian state was deeply in debt. The external debt alone was equivalent to 4 years of the government budget. Borno decided in June 1922 to take out a loan of 23 million dollars to clear all debts. He reduced export taxes and soon the trade deficit balanced. He achieved impressive infrastructure improvements: 1700 km of roads were made usable; 189 bridges were built; many irrigation canals were rehabilitated; hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed; and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first city of Latin America to have phone service available with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country. Borno relied on the Catholic Church, with congregations coming from France to develop low-cost quality education throughout the country. Aware that many Haitians did not speak French, he was the first president to authorize the use of Haitian Creole in the education system. He went to the United States in 1926, where he met President Calvin Coolidge. He mainly settled old border conflicts with Dominican President Horacio V√°squez in 1929. But Borno refused to organize free elections. He maintained a Council of State, whose 21 members he had appointed. He was re- elected by this body on 12 April 1926, which aroused opposition in the press. Borno tried to regulate it and imprisoned some journalists. The world economic crisis that began in 1929 with the Stock Market Crash in the United States changed American policy. President Herbert Hoover sought to disengage from Haiti. He appointed a commission for this purpose, chaired by Cameron Forbes, who arrived in December 1929. Because of the economic crisis, Haitian farmers became upset. On 6 December 1929, an excited group faced some U.S. Marines who fired on them and killed some. The Forbes Committee resolved to organize free elections and end the American administration, but remained pessimistic about the sustainability of democracy in Haiti. The opposition chose a provisional president, Louis Eug√®ne Roy.Staff report (20 January 1930), Honest Borno.

It was written by Lane and Crawford, and starred Crawford in the title role, alongside Dennis Christopher, Karen Kopins and John Hurt. Plot In Paris, a girl named Maureen Winston (Becca C. Ashley) is abducted by two evil-looking men. While her family prays for her safe return, Maureen's father heaps guilt on her sister Margaret (Karen Kopins), since she convinced her to go see the world. However, Margaret's grandfather (Leon Ames) has an idea: call for Jake Speed (Wayne Crawford) to go and rescue her. One problem exists: Jake Speed is a character in a series of 1940s-style pulp fiction novels. However, Jake Speed does exist, as Margaret finds out, when he leaves a note for her to meet him and his sidekick, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), in a tough Paris bar. The novels, as Margaret finds out, are based on Jake and Des's real-life adventures, and they work for nothing, seeing action and excitement (and another novel) as their reward. Jake reveals that Maureen was kidnapped by white slavers, and is being held in an African country. Jake, Des, and Margaret fly to the nation, which is in the middle of a civil war, to rescue her. Many twists and turns later, Jake's archenemy, the evil, perverted, murderous Englishman Sid (John Hurt), is revealed to be behind the ring, and soon, Margaret becomes a part of it. Jake and Des must now rescue both Maureen and Margaret, stop Sid, and help the girls get out in one piece, while dealing with warring factions, pits of lions, and machine gun-firing helicopters.

The Firestar was available in 9 mm Para (M-43), .40 S&W; (M-40), and .45 ACP (M-45) calibers, all having a single-stack magazine. A double-stack 9mm version (M-243) was also available and was commonly referred to by the unofficial name \\"Firestar Plus\\". The Firestar was produced by the now defunct Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. in Eibar, Spain until 1994. The Firestar was imported into the United States by Interarms of Alexandria, Virginia. Although its external appearance resembles a compact M1911, the Firestar is different in several respects. For example, the Firestar does not have the 1911's grip safety. The Firestar's safety features include an automatic safety at the firing pin (a feature not included in the 1911's original design but often found in more modern 1911 variants). The Firestar has operating procedures analogous to those of the Colt 1911: it is single action, and meant to be carried in Condition One (cocked and locked), with a cartridge in the chamber, cocked hammer and locked manual safety. The Firestar is a compact, reliable and accurate handgun well-suited for backup or concealed carry. Its single-stack design sacrifices the superior magazine capacity of a double-stack, but permits a slim profile prized by many for concealed carry. While heavier than more modern handguns of comparable size made with today's composite materials, many shooters find the added heft provides a more stable shooting platform that improves accuracy.

It is used by a Feng Shui practitioner to determine the precise direction of a structure, place or item. Luo Pan contains many informations and formulas regarding its functions. The needle points towards the south magnetic pole. Since the invention of the compass for use in Feng Shui, feng shui audit has required its use. Form and function Like a conventional compass, a luopan is a direction finder. However, a luopan differs from a compass in several important ways. The most obvious difference is the Feng Shui formulas embedded in up to 40 concentric rings on the surface. This is a metal or wooden plate known as the heaven dial. The circular metal or wooden plate typically sits on a wooden base known as the earth plate. The heaven dial rotates freely on the earth plate. A red wire or thread that crosses the earth plate and heaven dial at 90-degree angles is the Heaven Center Cross Line, or Red Cross Grid Line. This line is used to find the direction and note position on the rings. Small Feng Shui Compass, c. 1800-1894, from the Oxford College Archives of Emory University.A conventional compass has markings for four or eight directions, while a luopan typically contains markings for 24 directions. This translates to 15 degrees per direction. The Sun takes approximately 15.2 days to traverse a solar term, a series of 24 points on the ecliptic. Since there are 360 degrees on the luopan and approximately 365.25 days in a mean solar year, each degree on a luopan approximates a terrestrial day. Unlike a typical compass, a luopan does not point to the north magnetic pole of Earth. The needle of a luopan points to the south magnetic pole (it does not point to the geographic south pole). The Chinese word for compass translates to ‚Äúsouth-pointing needle.‚Äù Types Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, three types of luopan have been popular. They have some formula rings in common, such as the 24 directions and the early and later heaven arrangements. =San He= This luopan was said to have been used in the Tang dynasty. The San He contains three basic 24-direction rings. Each ring relates to a different method and formula. (The techniques grouped under the name \\"Three Harmonies\\" are San He methods.) =San Yuan= This luopan, also known as the jiang pan (after Jiang Da Hong) or the Yi Pan (because of the presence of Yijing hexagrams) incorporates many formulas used in San Yuan (Three Cycles). It contains one 24-direction ring, known as the Earth Plate Correct Needle, the ring for the 64 hexagrams, and others. (The techniques grouped under the name \\"Flying Stars\\" are an example of San Yuan methods.) =Zong He= This luopan combines rings from the San He and San Yuan. It contains three 24-direction-rings and the 64 trigrams ring. =Other types= Each Feng Shui master may design a luopan to suit preference and to offer students. Some designs incorporate the bagua (trigram) numbers, directions from the Eight Mansions () methods, and English equivalents. History and development Chinese geomantic compass c. 1760 from the National Maritime Museum in London The luopan is an image of the cosmos (a world model) based on tortoise plastrons used in divination. At its most basic level it serves as a means to assign proper positions in time and space, like the Ming Tang (Hall of Light). The markings are similar to those on a liubo board. The oldest precursors of the luopan are the or , meaning astrolabe or diviner's board‚Äîalso sometimes called liuren astrolabes‚Äîunearthed from tombs that date between 278 BCE and 209 BCE. These astrolabes consist of a lacquered, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. Along with divination for Da Liu Ren the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of Taiyi through the nine palaces. The markings are virtually unchanged from the shi to the first magnetic compasses. The schematic of earth plate, heaven plate, and grid lines is part of the \\"two cords and four hooks\\" () geometrical diagram in use since at least the Warring States period. The zhinan zhen or south- pointing needle, is the original magnetic compass, and was developed for Feng Shui. It featured the two cords and four hooks diagram, direction markers, and a magnetized spoon in the center.

The athletic field consisted of a cinder track with a dirt infield behind the junior high school which both the junior and senior high schools used. The football field, \\"Hans Peterson Memorial Field,\\" was located southwest of both schools on 2nd street. The old high school building has been torn down and, as of 2009, the lot is vacant. The current school was first occupied in September 1970, with the first graduating class being the class of 1971. In 1970, the location of the school was considered outside the city limits and students who lived in town had to be bussed to the school or, as many did, walked or drove. The area's student population comes from a large geographic region, with students coming from the north at Sea Lion Caves, east to Tiernan up the North Fork of the Siuslaw River, south to the county line and all points east of Woahink and Siltcoos lakes (Canary). The middle and high school still share a track and football field, located at the middle school. In the summer of 2019, the facility went under construction for resurfacing of the track. Academics In 2008, 72% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 144 students, 104 graduated, 27 dropped out, 1 received a modified diploma, and 12 are still in high school.

Stinging and venomous fish Image:Synanceia nana.JPGThe spines on the back of the Stonefish are venomous and can penetrate a rubber- soled shoe. The fish is extremely well camouflaged and care should be taken to avoid stepping on it. The venom can be fatal.

He studied modern history at university before serving in the British Army during World War II. Afterwards, he completed his studies, and then joined the British Civil Service. In 1974, two years after Watership Down was published, Adams became a full-time author. Early life Richard Adams was born on 9 May 1920 in Wash Common, near Newbury, Berkshire, England, the son of Lillian Rosa (Button) and Evelyn George Beadon Adams, a doctor. He attended Horris Hill School from 1926 to 1933, and then Bradfield College from 1933 to 1938. In 1938, he went to Worcester College, Oxford, to read Modern History. In July 1940, Adams was called up to join the British Army. He was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps and was selected for the Airborne Company, where he worked as a brigade liaison. He served in Palestine, Europe and the Far East but saw no direct action against either the Germans or the Japanese.Michael D Sharp, Popular Contemporary Writers, Marshall Cavendish Corporation 2006 (p.26) After leaving the army in 1946, Adams returned to Worcester College to continue his studies for a further two years. He received a bachelor's degree in 1948, proceeding MA in 1953.\\"Richard George Adams\\", Trevor Royle, Brief Biographies, Contemporary Novelists vol. 1. Retrieved 2 April 2008.\\"ADAMS, Richard George\\", Who's Who 2008, A & C Black, 2008; (online edition), Oxford University Press, December 2007. Retrieved 2 April 2008. After his graduation in 1948, Adams joined the British Civil Service, rising to the rank of Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, later part of the Department of the Environment. He began to write his own stories in his spare time, reading them to his children and later on, to his grandchildren. Career Adams originally began telling the story that would become Watership Down to his two daughters on a car trip. They eventually insisted that he publish it as a book. He began writing in 1966, taking two years to complete it. In 1972, after four publishers and three writers' agencies turned down the manuscript, Rex Collings agreed to publish the work. The book gained international acclaim almost immediately for reinvigorating anthropomorphic fiction with naturalism. Over the next few years Watership Down sold over a million copies worldwide. Adams won both of the most prestigious British children's book awards, one of six authors to do so: the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize. In 1974, following publication of his second novel, Shardik, he left the Civil Service to become a full-time author. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975. At one point, Adams served as writer-in-residence at the University of Florida and at Hollins University in Virginia. Adams was the recipient of the inaugural Whitchurch Arts Award for inspiration in January 2010, presented at the Watership Down pub in Freefolk, Hampshire.Water under the bridge Wiltshire Society. March 2010. Retrieved 2 April 2010. In 2015 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester. Public figure In 1982, Adams served one year as president of the RSPCA. Besides campaigning against furs, Adams wrote The Plague Dogs to satirize animal experimentation (as well as government and tabloid press). He also made a voyage through the Antarctic in the company of the ornithologist Ronald Lockley. Just before his 90th birthday, he wrote a new story for a charity book, Gentle Footprints, to raise funds for the Born Free Foundation. Personal life In 1949, Adams married Elizabeth (Barbara), daughter of R.A.F. Squadron-Leader Edward Fox Dyke Acland, son of the barrister and judge Sir Reginald Brodie Dyke Acland, whose father, the scientist Henry Wentworth Dyke Acland (himself created a baronet of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford) descended from the Acland baronets of Columb John.Burke's Peerage, 1999, vol. 1, pg 26.Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, vol. 2, R. Reginald, 1979, pg 790. Until his death, he lived with his wife in Whitchurch, within of his birthplace. Their daughters, to whom Adams originally related the tales that became Watership Down, are Juliet and Rosamond. Adams celebrated his 90th birthday in 2010 with a party at the White Hart in his hometown of Whitchurch, Hampshire, where Sir George Young presented him with a painting by a local artist. Adams wrote a poetic piece celebrating his home of the past 28 years. Adams was an Orthodox Christian. Adams died on 24 December 2016 at the age of 96 in Oxford, England from complications of a blood disorder.

F. G. BONFILS DEAD; VETERAN EDITOR; Built The Denver Post Into One of the Largest Newspapers in the Nation. HAD SPECTACULAR CAREER I Long a Circus Owner. Took Part in Rush Into Indian Territory. Important Teapot Dome Witness. New York Times Career Born in Troy, Missouri, he entered the United States Military Academy in 1878 but resigned in 1881 and went into land speculation in the Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas booms. He purchased the Post with Harry Heye Tammen in 1895. Bonfils had met Tammen at the Windsor Hotel in Denver, where Tammen was a bartender (and editor of the Great-Divide Weekly Newspaper, as well as a worker in a curio store). In December 1899 Tammen and Bonfils were shot in their Denver Post office by W.W. Anderson, an attorney representing \\"maneater\\" Alfred Packer after a Post article had accused Anderson of taking Packer's life savings as a retainer. In the scuffle in the office Bonfils was shot twice and Tammen three times. Anderson was tried three times but never convicted while Tammen and Bonfils were convicted for jury tampering in the third trial.Bonfils Building, 1200 Grand, National Register Application - July 1982 In 1900, both Bonfils and Tammen were horsewhipped and hospitalized by a lawyer who disliked their yellow journalism. Bonfils took $250,000 hush-money from Harry F. Sinclair in the Teapot Dome scandal. Bonfils and Tammen both justified their style of sensationalistic journalism (as well as crediting their success as newspapermen) with the quote \\"a dogfight on a Denver street is more important than a war in Europe.\\"The Continuing Task Of Updating America In 1902, Bonfils and Tammen founded the Floto Dog & Pony Show. The show was named after Otto Floto, the famous sports editor of the Denver Post, who was involved in the publicity work for the show. In 1906, when bareback rider Willie Sells joined the show, it was renamed the Sells-Floto Circus. Bonfils and Tammen owned the show until 1921, when it was one of a number of shows acquired by the American Circus Corporation. In 1909 Bonfils and Tammen bought the Kansas City Post and owned it until selling it to Walter S. Dickey in 1922. J. Ogden Armour was a silent partner in the endeavor. The Post with its tabloid format, red headlines and yellow journalism was closely tied to the rise of the Tom Pendergast political machine in Kansas City. The Post was to fold shortly after the collapse of the machine. Death Bonfils died of encephalitis at his home in Denver, Colorado in 1933 and was interred in the Fairmount Mausoleum at Fairmount Cemetery, Denver.

The 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. For convenience and clarity, in the timeline below, all landfalls are bolded. Where the exact time of an event is unclear, c. is used to denote the approximate time. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. Storms tracked by the JTWC are referred to numerically to avoid confusion, as the JTWC sometimes recognises a storm at a different intensity compared to the IMD. The graphical bar above gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and a storm's maximum intensity category in terms of wind speed is included as a colour bar. This is given by the IMD's values of maximum 10-minute sustained winds. The colour scheme is detailed to the right.

The Southwest Limited was a named passenger train operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the \\"Milwaukee Road\\") on an overnight schedule between Chicago, Illinois, and Kansas City, Missouri. The westbound train (to Kansas City) was Milwaukee Road train No. 25, and the eastbound train (to Chicago) was train No. 26. For much of the train's history, a section of the Southwest Limited also operated between Kansas City and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. History The Milwaukee Road completed its first Chicago-Kansas City route in 1887, and began operating through passenger service between those cities soon after. The Milwaukee's route became more competitive in 1903, with the completion of a cutoff line in Iowa that reduced Kansas City travel time by some three hours. In conjunction with this improvement, the railroad inaugurated the Southwest Limited passenger train on the Kansas City route, utilizing new equipment and a faster schedule. 1908 postcard for the train. The Southwest Limited prospered for the next three decades. The 1920s were reportedly the glory years for the train, when it featured a variety of sleeping car and coach accommodations, a dining car, and an observation- lounge. Service standards were high, and the Southwest Limited was considered one of the premier trains of the Milwaukee. About 1932, the Southwest Limited began offering through-car service between Kansas City and Milwaukee. The Milwaukee section connected with the main train at Savanna, IL. At the same time, due to traffic declines caused by the Great Depression, the Southwest Limited was combined with the Chicago-Omaha Arrow between Chicago and Savanna. The Milwaukee section of the Southwest Limited also carried through cars to and from the Arrow's western destinations. By the early 1950s, the Southwest Limited was clearly in decline. The train no longer carried sleeping or dining cars, and its 13-1/2 hour schedule was at least four hours slower than that of new Chicago-Kansas City streamliners then operated by the competing Burlington and Santa Fe railroads. The increasing popularity of air and automobile travel during the 1950s also negatively impacted the train. The final runs of the Southwest Limited took place on April 26, 1958, marking the end of Milwaukee Road passenger service to Kansas City. The Milwaukee-Savanna section of the train was retained until 1965, serving as a connection to the Arrow.

He called it correctly again at the Super Bowl itself, which the Raiders won. Retrieved September 14, 2009. He was very popular with the fans due to his practice of throwing the football into the stands when he scored. In college, Bankston played for the Tulane University Green Wave.

It operated from 1926 until 1967. The Arrow provided overnight service between the two cities and included through cars for other destinations in Iowa.  History  The Milwaukee Road introduced the Arrow in August 1926, replacing two previous services: the Omaha Limited (Chicago‚ÄìOmaha) and Sioux City Limited (Chicago‚ÄìSioux City). The new train served both Omaha and Sioux City (for Sioux Falls, South Dakota), splitting in Manilla, Iowa. Through connections with other trains the Arrow also carried Chicago‚ÄìDes Moines, Iowa and Milwaukee, Wisconsin‚ÄìOmaha sleeping cars (via the Southwest Limited). The train made the run between Chicago and Omaha in 13 hours and 20 minutes. In 1934 the Milwaukee Road extended the Arrow over the Big Sioux River to Sioux Falls. The Omaha sleeping car ended in early 1955, was reinstated later that year when the Milwaukee Road began handling the Union Pacific Railroad's Overland Route trains, and ended for good in 1958. Between 1956‚Äì1959 the Arrow carried a Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles coach which it exchanged in Omaha. The Sioux Falls section, including the train's last sleeping cars, ended on September 17, 1965. All that remained of the Arrow was a Chicago‚ÄìOmaha coach train, which the Milwaukee Road discontinued on October 5, 1967. Today, its route is being used by Metra as its Milwaukee District/West Line, shared by the Milwaukee Road's successor, Canadian Pacific through its Soo Line Railroad subsidiary.

The taxon was described by Gustaf Johan Billberg in 1820.  Systematics  The tribe was previously treated as a higher-level taxon, the subfamily Lithosiinae, within the lichen and tiger moth family, Arctiidae. The ranks of the family and its subdivisions were lowered in a recent reclassification while keeping the contents of the family and its subdivisions largely unchanged. These changes in rank triggered changes in the suffixes in the names. The family Arctiidae as a whole was reclassified as the subfamily Arctiinae within the family Erebidae. The original subfamily Lithosiinae was lowered to tribe status as Lithosiini, and its original tribes were lowered to subtribe status by changing the -ini suffix to -ina (e.g., Acsalini became Acsalina). Thus the present name \\"Lithosiini\\" used to refer to only a subgroup of the entire lichen moth group (Lithosiinae), but now it refers to the entire group. The systematics of the Lithosiini are in need of revision. For example, the proposed subtribes Afridina, Cisthenina, Endrosina and Eudesmina require validation and delimitation of content. The arrangement followed here is based on the preliminary consensus list of Savela (2007). The tribe currently contains about 2752 species.

He also became Abbot of Ellwangen in 874 and is reckoned the first Archchancellor of Germany. He was one of the major organisers ‚Äì along with Henry of Franconia ‚Äì of the vigorous and successful defence of East Francia against Viking attack during his last decade. In 870, Liutbert became the archchaplain of Louis the German until 876 and thereafter of Louis the Younger until the latter's death in 882. Under Charles the Fat, however, he did not retain this position, rather it was preserved for Liutward of Vercelli. Liutbert did not accept his lack of position at court initially; he had himself referred to as \\"archchaplain,\\" though he was not, in an 882 document of Weissenburg, another abbey of which he was abbot. The Annales Fuldenses, from about the 860s, was being written in the circle of Liutbert and after 882 until 887 (the so-called \\"Mainz continuation\\") under his supervision. Because of the demotion he had suffered after the accession of Charles the Fat to all East Francia in 882, Liubert was a partisan opponent of the emperor's. It has even been suggested that the Mainz Annales' depiction of Liutbert and Liutward bears resemblance to the figures of Mordecai and Haman in the Book of Esther., based on the work of Genevi√®ve B√ºhrer-Thierry. Liutbert was also an opponent of Charles' plan to make his heir his bastard son Bernard. In 871, the Moravians rebelled against Frankish overlordship and the Sorbs along the Elbe followed suit. An army under Liutbert's command defeated them at Waldaha (Vltava or Moldau). In 883, when Vikings sailed up the Rhine and took a great deal of plunder, Liutbert met them with a small force and retrieved their booty. He also rebuilt Cologne, which they had damaged. In late 884, the Vikings attacked West Francia and wintered in Hesbaye. Early in 885, in a campaign organised by Charles the Fat, Liutbert and Henry of Franconia surprised the Vikings and set them to flight. Early in 887, Charles the Fat was forced to dismiss his chaplain and chancellor Liutward and replace him with Liutbert at the behest of the Alemannians. After regaining his high post, Liutbert's attitude toward the emperor significantly improved and he was able to draw more imperial largesse to Franconia.

Made famous in Vera Lynn's 1942 version, it was one of Lynn's best-known recordings and among the most popular World War II tunes. Background The song was written about a year after the Royal Air Force and German Luftwaffe aircraft had been fighting over southern England, including the white cliffs of Dover, in the Battle of Britain. Nazi Germany had conquered much of Europe and in 1941 was still bombing Britain. With neither America nor the Soviet Union having yet joined the war, Britain was the only major power fighting the Axis powers in Europe (see The Darkest Hour). The American lyricist, Nat Burton, wrote his lyric (unaware that the bluebird is not indigenous to Britain) and asked Kent to set it to music. Notable phrases include \\"Thumbs Up!\\" which was an RAF and RCAF term for permission to go, and \\"flying in those angry skies\\" where the air war was taking place. The lyrics looked toward a time when the war would be over, and peace would rule over the iconic white cliffs, Britain's symbolic border with the European mainland. The full song includes two verses rarely found in recordings:  World War II performances The song was made most famous by Vera Lynn and sung to troops during the war. It was a top ten hit in America for Kate Smith in 1942, and Glenn Miller recorded a version in November 1941. Jimmie Baker frequently performed it in Europe during the war, and the song was sung by the vocal group The King's Men on a 3 February 1942 episode of the Fibber McGee and Molly Show. Ray Eberle and Tex Beneke also included it in their repertoires. In 1944, a version was recorded by Louis Prima and his Orchestra. This version reached number nine on the The Harlem Hit Parade chart. Later performances The song is the terrace anthem of the supporters of Dover Athletic F.C. The Checkers, an American group, released an R&B; version of the song in 1953 which became very popular. Other artists who have recorded the song include Connie Francis, Bing Crosby, Ray Conniff, Jim Reeves, Acker Bilk, The Righteous Brothers (a hit in the UK Singles Chart), Steeleye Span, Bert Kaempfert and The Hot Sardines on their debut album released in 2014. In the 1990s, British pop duo Robson & Jerome recorded the song as part of a double A-side release, coupled with \\"Unchained Melody\\"; the single stayed at No. 1 for seven weeks in the UK Singles Chart, selling over a million copies and also making it the number one song with the longest title, including brackets. The Jive Aces released a swing version in 2005 (similar to Acker Bilk's arrangement). On 18 February 2009, a story in The Daily Telegraph announced that Dame Vera Lynn was suing the British National Party (BNP) for using her version of \\"The White Cliffs of Dover\\" on an anti-immigration album without her permission. Lynn's lawyer claimed sales of the song would help boost the BNP's coffers and would link her name to the party's far-right views by association.Dame Vera Lynn takes on BNP over White Cliffs of Dover, The Daily Telegraph online, 18 February 2009.

History The Sahiwal originated in the dry Punjab region which lies along central Punjab. They were once kept in large herds by professional herdsmen called \\"Charwahas\\". With the introduction of irrigation systems to the region they began to be kept in smaller numbers by the farmers of the region, who used them as draught and dairy animals. Today the Sahiwal is one of the best dairy breeds in India and Pakistan. Sahiwal is calm when milking. Due to their heat tolerance and high milk production they have been exported to other Asian countries as well as Africa and the Caribbean. Distribution Due to its unique characteristics, Sahiwal breed is exported to wide list of countries and regions. The Sahiwal breed arrived in Australia via New Guinea in the early 1950s. In Australia, the Sahiwal breed was initially selected as a dual-purpose breed. It played a valuable role in the development of the two Australian tropical dairy breeds, the Australian Milking Zebu and the Australian Friesian Sahiwal. Sahiwal cattle are now predominantly used in Australia for beef production, as crossing high-grade Sahiwal sires with European breeds produced a carcass of lean quality with desirable fat cover. Sahiwal bulls have demonstrated the ability to sire small, fast-growing calves, noted for their hardiness under unfavorable climatic conditions. The contribution of the Sahiwal breed to adaptability is well documented in Kenya, Jamaica, Guyana, Burundi, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and several ecological zones of Africa where Sahiwals have been crossed with exotic Bos taurus breeds that have a high response capability for milk and beef production but lack adaptability to local conditions. The present Sahiwal cattle in Kenya are descendants of some 60 bulls and 12 cows imported between 1939 and 1963. The Sahiwal breed also is considered unequalled in transmitted effects for milk production among Bos indicus breeds. Kenya is the main country in Africa with major resources of Bos indicus Sahiwal cattle and serves as an important source of stock and semen for the continent. Similarly, this breed is also exported to many other regions of Asia including India. The cows are the heaviest milkers of all zebu breeds and display a well-developed udder.Handbook of Australian Livestock, Australian Meat & Livestock Corporation, 1989, 3rd EditionGenus Bos; Cattle Breeds of the World, 1985, MSO-AGVET (Merck & Co., Inc.), Rahway, N.J.Mason, I.L. 1996.

Flores is the 487th fugitive to be placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.  Background  Flores was born in Honduras in 1975, although he has used dates of birth ranging from 1975 to 1982. Flores has claimed he received a large surgical scar on his neck as a result of an injury sustained in Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998.  Kidnapping and murder charges  In the summer of 2000, an itinerant homeless drifter known as \\"Carlos\\" (or \\"Carlo\\") had been given shelter, clothing and work as a handyman by Hunting Park, Philadelphia, resident Jorge Contreras. On August 3, five days after she had been reported missing, the body of five-year-old Iriana DeJesus was found in the basement of an empty apartment building where \\"Carlos\\" is believed to have stayed. She had been sexually assaulted, strangled and wrapped in a trash bag. A T-shirt bearing a distinct political logo was found near Iriana's body with her blood on it. When police questioned Contreras about the shirt, he recognized it as one of the articles of clothing he had lent to \\"Carlos,\\" who had not been seen in the area since the girl was reported missing. \\"Carlos\\" then became wanted for questioning and a sketch of him was profiled on America's Most Wanted.  Arrests and Deportation  Alexis Flores, an illegal immigrant, was arrested for shoplifting in Arizona in 2002. Two years later, police came to Flores' residence in response to a noise complaint. After giving fraudulent identity documents to police, Flores was arrested for possession of a forgery device, a felony in Arizona. When he was arrested, Flores had a welcoming demeanor and was friendly. Upon entering his apartment for further investigation, officers noticed pornography spread out across the floors. Flores told immigration officials that he had lived in Schaumburg, Illinois, prior to living in Phoenix. He was incarcerated for 60 days and deported to Honduras after his release in June 2005.  DNA match and addition to FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives  In 2006, Flores' DNA sample taken in Arizona was added to the Combined DNA Index System. In March 2007, his DNA sample positively matched to the DNA found at the crime scene in Philadelphia. It has been determined that \\"Carlos\\" and Flores are the same person. On March 22, 2007, a local arrest warrant was obtained in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Flores was charged with murder and various other felonies. On the same date, a federal arrest warrant for Flores was obtained in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Flores was added to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on June 2, 2007. He replaced Shauntay Henderson on the list. There is a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading directly to Flores' capture offered by the FBI. He is also the subject of an Interpol Red Notice. He is considered armed and extremely dangerous. Flores is fluent in Spanish and English and is believed to be either in his native Honduras, or to have returned to the United States.

Early life and career Salmond was born to a family of professional musicians. His father Norman Salmond was a baritone, and his mother Adelaide Manzocchi was a pianist who had studied with Clara Schumann. At age twelve, Salmond started studying with the man who became his primary cello teacher, William Whitehouse. He won a scholarship to continue studies with Whitehouse four years later at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He continued on to the Brussels Conservatoire at age nineteen, where he studied for two years with √âdouard Jacobs. His concert debut was in 1908, playing Frank Bridge's Fantasy Trio in C minor and Johannes Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor. Salmond's mother was the pianist, with Bridge on viola and Maurice Sons playing the violin. The recital, which took place at the Bechstein Hall, was very successful, leading to many future engagements for Salmond. He gave recitals across Britain and appeared with the Queen's Hall Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Hall√© Orchestra, amongst others. He also toured America in a piano quartet with Harold Bauer, Bronis≈Çaw Huberman and Lionel Tertis. Salmond and Elgar Programme for the CBSO's first formal concert, on 10 November 1920, with Salmond as the soloist and Elgar conducting World War I prevented Salmond from developing his international career further at that time, but he resumed building a reputation in chamber music after the war. His performances in this period included the premieres, on 21 May 1919, of Edward Elgar's String Quartet in E minor and Piano Quintet in A minor at the Wigmore Hall (as the Bechstein Hall had now become). After Salmond's performance of his quartet, Elgar entrusted Salmond with the solo part for the debut of his most personal and heartfelt work, his Cello Concerto in E minor with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Queen's Hall. The premiere, on 26 October 1919, proved to be a disaster. The performance was scheduled such that Albert Coates, the conductor of the London Symphony, would conduct the rest of the programme and Elgar himself would conduct the concerto. Coates, a self-important man, was well known for using up to forty-five minutes of his hour of rehearsal time lecturing his players. After Coates consumed an hour of Elgar's rehearsal time, Elgar‚Äîwho was until that time waiting offstage for his chance to rehearse‚Äîuncharacteristically exploded with anger. The severely under-rehearsed performance which followed received scathing reviews, with Ernest Newman stating that \\"the orchestra made a public exhibition of its miserable self\\". Elgar later said that if it weren't for Salmond's diligent work in preparing the piece, he would have pulled it from the concert entirely. On 10 November 1920, the inaugural concert of the City of Birmingham Orchestra (later the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) was given at Birmingham Town Hall, with Elgar conducting a concert of his own works, including the first performance of his Cello Concerto in that city, with Salmond as the soloist. Career in America On 29 March 1922, he made his American solo debut in New York at the Aeolian Hall. He settled in America, although he returned to England and Europe for tours. He was appointed to the Juilliard School's faculty in 1924, and became head of the cello faculty at the Curtis Institute of Music a year later‚Äîa position which he kept until 1942. However, still bruised by the experience of the first performance of the Elgar concerto, he did not teach it or play it outside England. He was highly regarded in America as a teacher, with pupils including Robert LaMarchina, Orlando Cole, Suzette Forgues Halasz, Bernard Greenhouse, Leonard Rose, Daniel Saidenberg, and Alan Shulman. He also received great appreciation as a performer. In 1924, he appeared at Carnegie Hall in a well-reviewed piano trio with pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski and violinist Efrem Zimbalist. He had a broad taste in music for the cello, including works by contemporary composers such as Samuel Barber, Ernest Bloch and George Enescu (premiering two of his pieces). He last returned to England in 1947; he died in New York.

It was produced by Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, with the exception of the song \\"I'll Be There For You\\" which was written and produced by the Babys/Bad English/Journey rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Jonathan Cain. The title track is the basis of the Kiss song \\"Domino\\", and also contains the ending riff from \\"Only You\\", both Kiss songs credited to Simmons. Coincidentally, guitarist Tommy Thayer would join Kiss in 2002. Nasty Nasty saw the band move away from the more polished approach of Without Love as it did not appeal to their metal fans.

An outspoken and at times controversial figure, he was an influential voice in the left-wing political blogosphere. Life and career Born and raised in New York City, Gilliard attended Hunter College Elementary and Hunter College High School, laboratory schools for the gifted operated by Hunter College. He was a graduate of NYU, where he studied history and journalism. He worked as a freelance writer for various print publications from 1986 to 1992, after which he spent two years on the New Jersey Democratic State Committee campaign staff. From 1994 to 1996, Gilliard worked as a researcher, and then returned to writing‚Äîthis time for the on-line medium‚Äîas a freelancer on various projects for the next two years. In 1998, Gilliard joined the netslaves.com website as featured Web writer and \\"Media Operative\\"‚Äîa position he held through 2003.netslaves (mirror site): \\"author bios\\" The site chronicled poor business practices and employee conditions in dot-com companies, particularly the Silicon Alley tech companies of New York. Among his more influential columns for the site was the \\"How to Read a 10Q\\" series, which took a reader-friendly investigative approach to dissecting SEC- mandated corporate financial and governance reports. Steve also wrote more broadly on topics deemed to be of interest to the NY-based geek, from love issues to how to install a new motherboard. In 2003, Steve was tasked with contributing to and moderating netslaves.com's online bulletin board, which had grown in usership after instances of homophobia and racism alienated a large group of users from Philip Kaplan's FuckedCompany.com. These users flocked to netslaves, but two feuding users (who went by the names Cheopys and Uncle Meat, of left and right political persuasion, respectively) repeatedly created situations in which Steve would have to arbitrate discussions. In June 2004, Steve banned both users, causing a boycott, a massive defection of users, and eventually, the closure of netslaves.com. After the demise of Netslaves, Gilliard spent several months as a diarist and contributing editor to the Daily Kos site. In August 2003, in addition to occasional contributions to sites such as The Huffington Post, he began his own independent site. Gilliard was the primary writer and operator of The News Blog, which he maintained until his hospitalization and subsequent death in June 2007. Gilliard died on June 2, 2007 at age forty-two, following a series of heart and kidney problems.The New York Times: \\"BlogTalk: A Loss on the Left\\" June 4, 2007 Influence In a tribute posted on June 3, Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas wrote about Gilliard's influence on his own site: Steve Gillard, on his blog, brought frequent attention to the military history concerning previous military interventions in the Middle East, particularly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia in Iraq, and how the British experience was relevant to the current US occupation of Iraq. Controversy When Michael S. Steele announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate election of 2006, Gilliard mocked Steele's perceived subservience to the Republican Party by posting a photoshopped picture of Steele in minstrel makeupThe Washington Post: \\"Blog Attack on Steele Decried\\", October 28, 2005. (see Blackface). This was picked up by Jeff Jacoby, a columnist with the Boston Globe, who was so incensed by Gilliard's comments about Black Americans that he dedicated a column criticizing him in December 2005.Boston Globe: \\"Slurs fly from the left\\", by Jeff Jacoby, 28 December 2005 Gilliard reproduced the relevant portion of Jacoby's column on his own website, along with a copy of the response he had emailed to Jacoby, in which he said that he and most other blacks held black conservatives \\"in complete and utter contempt\\". Earlier in his career, Gilliard was threatened with legal action by representatives of Rosie O'Donnell when he \\"wrote something about Rosie leering at Peta Wilson, the tall, very blonde, very bosomy star of the La Femme Nikita series.\\" He responded that if sued, he would post the responses to his discovery on Usenet.My adventures with Rosie, Steve Gilliard, November 13, 2003 Gilliard also crossed swords with Pulitzer-prize winning author Sydney Schanberg in 2001 when he attacked APBNews.com, Schanberg's employer, for encouraging its writers and editors to work without pay after the site got into financial trouble. Schanberg's response was widely interpreted as an invitation to personal fisticuffs, but the offer was declined.

It contained what is now the northeastern portion of North Carolina. The county was named for George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, one of the eight Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina, for whom the Albemarle Sound is also named. It contained approximately 1,600 square miles of territory, though its boundaries were not precise.Baxley, Laura Young and William S. Powell. Albemarle County, ncpedia.org (2006) (State Library of North Carolina) Under the original divisions of the province, the county to the south of Albemarle was called Clarendon County and centered on the Cape Fear region, but was only briefly occupied in the 1660s. Bath County was organized in 1696 and lay more closely to the south. By 1670, four precincts of Albemarle County had been formed: Shaftesbury, Currituck, Pasquotank, and Berkeley. In 1681, Berkeley was renamed Perquimans, and by 1685 Shaftesbury became Chowan. By 1689 the county ceased to function as a governmental unit, replaced by the four \\"precincts\\" (which would later become counties themselves): Chowan County, Currituck County, Pasquotank County, and Perquimans County. From the original four precincts, Bertie Precinct was formed from part of Chowan in 1722, consisting of all territory west of the Chowan River. Tyrrell Precinct was created in 1729. Local residents asked that the western part of Bertie be divided into a new precinct as early as 1732, which led to the creation of Edgecombe Precinct (dates of the formation of Edgecombe vary from 1732 to 1741).

(2019): Floresmens - Het leven van Theo Verhoeven, missionaris en archeoloog. (Boekscout, Soest, The Netherlands) (= Verhoeven's biography, in Dutch) Verhoeven archive inventoryBirth certificate was a Dutch missionary and archaeologist who has become famous by his discovery of stone tools on the Indonesian island of Flores, in association with the c. 800,000-year-old fossils of stegodontids, or dwarf elephants, from which he concluded that islands in Wallacea had been reached by Homo erectus before modern humans appeared there. Life Born at the Markt in Uden, Verhoeven received his training as a priest/missionary in monasteries ('mission houses') of the Societas Verbi Divini (SVD) in Uden (where he was abused by the prefect), Helvoirt and Teteringen respectively. In the latter place he was ordained a priest in 1933 after which, much to his disappointment, he was not allowed to leave for a mission country. Instead he was ordered to become a teacher at his own secondary school, mission house St. Willibrordus in Uden. After that, Verhoeven studied classics at the University of Utrecht. In 1940 he spent some months in Italy to study Roman architecture at Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia Tiberina. During the war he played a crucial role in the Resistance movement by accommodating - contrary to the orders of his superiors - dozens of Jewish children in hiding places. Verhoeven received his doctorate under Hendrik Wagenvoort in 1948.Th. L. Verhoeven, Studi√´n over Tertullianus' Adversus Praxean, Noord-Hollandsche Uitgevers Maatschappij, 1948 He was subsequently sent to the island of Flores in Indonesia as a missionary, where he taught at the seminaries of Todabelu/Mataloko in Ngada Regency and in Ritapiret near Maumere and intermittently lived there for some 15 years. Mike Morwood's often quoted statement that Verhoeven \\"left the priesthood, married his secretary, and returned to Europe\\" is incorrect. Verhoeven stayed a priest until his death and never had a secretary. After an accident with his jeep in 1966 Verhoeven did return to Europe, only to come back to Flores the following year. In 1975 he married a former Belgian nun (after having received dispensation from the Vatican), Paula Hamerlinck, and went to live in Belgium. Paleontological work In 1950 Verhoeven commenced archaeological work on the island of Flores. He identified and explored many archeological sites, including the now famous Liang Bua cave. Verhoeven was the first to report on Stegodon remains in Wallacea, first on Flores and later on Timor. This was a major surprise, as larger land mammals like the rhinoceros and elephant were not expected to have crossed the deep waters of the Wallace Line.Robert G. Bednarik, Reviewing the Flores Hobbit Chronicles, Anthropos, 2008 In 1957 he discovered the first stegondontid fossils reported from Ola Bula in Flores, along with Lower Palaeolithic stone blades and flakes.Verhoeven T. 1958. Proto-Negrito in den Grotten auf Flores (Indonesie). Anthropos 53:229‚Äì232. In 1965 he found a similar concurrence of stone tools with remains of Stegodon- dominated megafauna at nearby Mata Menge. Verhoeven argued that Homo erectus apparently crossed the Wallace Line 750,000 years ago, but this went unnoticed by most and was discounted by others. Only in the late 1990s, after an Indonesian-Dutch effort confirmed his findings and fission track dating had been applied, did more scientists accept this hypothesis.'Hobbits' on Flores, Indonesia at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History website, March 2016 Also in 1965, he found much younger (neolithic) human graves, stone tools and Paulamys naso fossils in the Liang Bua cave. He did not publish these findings as he was unable to finish his excavations due to a sudden police intervention. Afterwards he contacted the Indonesian archaeologist Raden P. Soejono, who continued the digs in the 1970s and 1980s and estimated an age of 10,000 years. Deeper excavations starting in 2001 would reveal the c. 17,000-year-old Flores Man in this cave in 2003. Legacy According to Robert G. Bednarik, Verhoeven was \\"the greatest archaeological investigator of Wallacea, whose pioneer work was largely ignored in his lifetime.\\"Bednarik, Robert G. (2003). Seafaring in the Pleistocene, Cambridge Archaeological Journal, 13:1, 41‚Äì66 According to Dr. John De Vos, former curator of the Duboiscollection in the Natural Biodiversity Center, Leiden, The Netherlands, Verhoeven was 'simply brilliant'.Knepper (see note 1), cover Verhoeven's giant tree rat (Papagomys theodorverhoeveni) of Flores, declared extinct in 1996, is named after Verhoeven.Verhoeven in Bo Beolens, Michael Watkins, Michael Grayson, The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals, JHU Press, 2009, A fossil of an Anthracotherium (an Eocene mammal) found under Verhoeven's supervision on Timor was given the name Anthracotherium verhoeveni by Professor Ralph von Koenigswald.Koenigswald, G.H.R. von, 1967: An upper Eocene mammal of the family Anthracotheriidae from the Island of Timor, Indonesia.

It is a stiff, upright, compact and very sticky shrub with distinctive, dark bluish-green leaves and pale coloured flowers spotted purple. Description Eremophila abietina is a stiff, woody, compact and very sticky shrub which usually grows to a height of and often a similar width. Its leaves are densely clustered, sticky due to the presence of resin, linear in shape, long, wide and hairy, although the hairs are often obscured by resin. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a flattened stalk long. The sepals overlap and are cream to reddish in colour, long, growing to long after flowering and remain on the shrub long after flowering. The tube formed by the petals is long and is bluish green to pale purple with the lobes spotted purple. Flowering occurs between June and October and is followed by fruit which are dry, oval or cone-shaped and have a distinct prolonged tip. E. abietina habit (in the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan) Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Fritz Kraenzlin in 1925. The description was published in Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information. The type specimen was collected from \\"Laverton; North Coolgardie\\" by Frederick Arthur Rodway. The specific epithet (abietina) reflects the similarity of the foliage of this species with that of conifers in the genus Abies. In 2007 Robert Chinnock described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eremophila abietina Kraenzl. subsp. abietina has shorter, narrower almost cylindrical leaves and brighter flowers; * Eremophila abietina subsp. ciliata Chinnock has flattened leaves with hairs along the edges and a slightly more southerly distribution.  Distribution and habitat Spotted poverty bush occurs on gibber plains, calcareous flats and jasper outcrops in an area of the Great Victoria Desert near Laverton. Ecology Some native bee species collect wax from E. abietina flower buds and other parts in order to make propolis, causing damage to the plant and sometimes leading to a stunting of its growth. Use in horticulture Spotted poverty bush is sometimes a slow growing plant in the garden, but compensates by being long-lived. It grows best in well-drained soil in a sunny situation but tolerates partial shade. It will only tolerate light frosts but responds well to pruning when frost-damaged. The metallic colouring of the flowers and persistent sepals make this an attractive species. Propagation from seed and from cuttings is difficult and most garden plants are produced by grafting onto Myoporum. Conservation status Eremophila abietina is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The refuge is composed of which include Dungeness Spit, Graveyard Spit, and portions of Dungeness Bay and Harbor. Dungeness Spit is one of the world's longest natural sand spits, long and very narrow. A lighthouse, the New Dungeness Light, built in 1857, is located near the end of the spit. Access to Dungeness Spit is through a Clallam County Park which has hiking trails, picnic areas, and a campground. On January 20, 1915, it was designated as a National Wildlife Refuge by President Woodrow Wilson. Dungeness is one of six refuges in the Washington Maritime National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Wildlife and habitat The refuge provides habitat for a variety of wildlife species with more than 250 species of birds and 41 species of land mammals. The bay and estuary of the Dungeness River supports Waterfowl, Wader, Shellfish, and harbor seals. Anadromous fish like Chinook, Coho, pink salmon and chum salmon occur in the waters of Dungeness Bay and Harbor. A number of species of waterfowl stop briefly in the Dungeness area each fall on their way south for the winter and again when they head north in the spring. Many species of waterfowl winter in the area. Dungeness Bay and Harbor support black brant, present from late October through early May, with peak numbers of approximately 3,000-5,000 in April. Shorebirds and water waders feed and rest along the water‚Äôs edge. Harbor seals haul out to rest and give birth to pups on the end of Dungeness Spit. The tideflats support crabs, clams, and other shellfish. Dungeness NWR is recognized as an Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society. The Refuge is internationally significant because many of the birds that stop here breed as far north as Alaska and migrate as far south as South America. The Dungeness area is additionally important as a spring staging area (a place where large groups of birds stop to build up their fat reserves for migration) for black brant and other waterfowl. Recreation The main activities occurring on the refuge are wildlife observation and photography, and wildlife education and interpretation. To ensure that wildlife continue to have a place to rest and feed, some recreational activities such as jogging, swimming, and other beach activities are allowed only in selected areas during certain times of the year.

The collision and plunge into Big Sandy River involving a school bus near Prestonsburg, Kentucky, on February 28, 1958, resulted in the deaths of 26 students and the bus's driver. It was the third-deadliest bus crash in United States history, tied for fatalities with the Carrollton, Kentucky bus collision in 1988. The only deadlier crashes were a 1963 bus-train crash in Chualar, California and the 1976 Yuba City bus disaster, which claimed the lives of 29 people. Summary On a cold and cloudy morning, after a period of heavy rains and thaw, a Floyd County school bus loaded with 48 elementary and high school students bound for school in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, struck the rear of a wrecker truck on U.S. Route 23 and fell down an embankment into the swollen waters of the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, where it was swept downstream and submerged. Twenty-two children escaped the bus in the first few minutes as it became fully submerged in the raging flood stage waters and made it safely out of the river. However, 26 other children and the bus driver drowned. National Guard and other authorities and agencies responded. The bus was finally located by Navy divers, and removed from the river 53 hours later. Several months later, two American recording artists released songs about the crash: The Stanley Brothers, with \\"No School Bus in Heaven,\\" and Ralph Bowman, with \\"The Tragedy of Bus 27.\\" Neither made the national Billboard Hot 100 charts, but they did receive regional airplay in some parts of the country. The crash would become the impetus behind the formation of the Floyd County Emergency & Rescue Squad, founded by volunteers on April 27, 1958. To this day, the FCERS remains a 100% volunteer agency, and assists local police departments, volunteer fire departments, and EMS with auto extrication, search and rescue, fireground support, and EMS first response in addition to its original role as the primary water rescue agency for the area. The 27-person death toll is tied with the Carrollton bus disaster in 1988 for the third highest number of fatalities resulting from a bus crash. Both happened in Kentucky and in each, the victims were all thought to have survived the initial collisions, but were unable to safely evacuate the school-type buses afterwards. After the 1988 crash, Kentucky changed its public school bus equipment requirements and requires a higher number of emergency exits than any other state or Canadian province. In recent years the accident has been the subject of two documentary films, The Very Worst Thing and A Life of Its Own, and the site of the bus accident has been marked by a sign bearing a dark image of a school bus superimposed with the names of the children and driver that died. There is usually a wreath of plastic flowers on the guardrail in front of the sign, which is located on Route 1428 (old US 23) east of the intersection of Route 302.

As a playwright, he wrote: Pastor Ephraim Magnus (1917), which The Cambridge Guide to Theatre describes as a nihilistic, Expressionist play \\"stuffed with perversities and sado-masochistic motifs\\"; Coronation of Richard III (1922; \\"equally lurid\\");Banham (1998, 553). and a version of Medea (1926). Later works include the novel Perrudja, an unfinished trilogy of novels River without Banks (Fluss ohne Ufer), the drama Thomas Chatterton (1955; staged by Gustaf Gr√ºndgens in 1956), and the novella The Night of Lead. Erwin Piscator staged Jahnn's The Dusty Rainbow (Der staubige Regenbogen) in 1961. Jahnn was also a music publisher, focusing on 17th-century organ music. He was a contemporary of organ-builder Rudolf von Beckerath. Personal life Hans Henny Jahn was born in 1894 in Stellingen, one of Hamburg's suburbs, and was the son of a shipwright. Jahn met Gottlieb Friedrich Harms \\"Friedel\\" (1893-1931), with whom he was united in a \\"mystical wedding\\" in 1913, at a secondary school (the St. Pauli Realschule) which they both attended, and they fled from Germany to Norway to avoid enlistment into the army for World War I, where they lived together between 1914 and 1918, and after the war ended they returned to Hamburg.Jan B√ºrger, 2003.

In 1926, Jahnn married Ellinor, and Harms married Sybille Philips, Ellinor's sister, in 1928. When Harms died in 1931 Jahn designed his gravestone. Once the Nazi period began, he fled Germany once again to Zurich and then Bornholm to escape the hostility of the Nazis towards the gay community.

Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC versions were also released. Plot The evil wizard Zahgrim has turned the good wizard Aganar to stone, removed his six eyes, and placed them in different locations across the land so they may view the destruction being reaped. The player's objective is to find the six eyeballs. Gameplay The player moves through a large, vertically and horizontally scrolling world, picking-up food, arrows, and spells. Roaming enemies can be avoided or shot with arrows. The goal is to find the statue's six eyes scattered across the world, but always in the same locations. The game plays differently depending on the order the eyes are recovered. When one of eyes is collected, stronger types of monsters appear in the world making travel more difficult. Resources are limited. Food is always on the verge of running out and arrows are in short supply. A large bird can carry the player to a different part of the world, similar to the bat in Adventure for the Atari 2600. Shooting the bird with an arrow makes it go away temporarily. Spells provide alternate approaches to problems. For example, invisibility prevents damage from monsters. Casting Freeze on water immobilizes the creatures in it and allows the frozen surface to be walked across. Every 4000 points, a new rank is awarded: apprentice, wizard, sorcerer, and necromancer. New spells are unlocked with each rank. Once all six eyes have been found and placed in the Blind Statue's empty sockets, a message appears explaining how to end Zahgrim's rule over the land once and for all. The player is then able to enter Zahgrim's castle, a difficult maze of traps and monsters. Reception The game was reviewed in 1987 in Dragon #124 by Hartley and Patricia Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers stated the \\"Certainly, this is one of the better games in the current crop of arcade/adventure games, as the tasks required to complete the quest are quite varied.\\" References External links  Category:1987 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Apple II games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Metroidvania games Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Black Magic (video game)"},{"id":"11565801","text":"James Edward Lee (23 March 1838 - 2 April 1880) was an English first-class cricketer, who played two matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1867.

People's Mujahedin of Iran has adopted provocation for military action against Iran as its strategy since 2003. Rationale Especially with regards to the United States and Israel, the primary impetus for an invasion is to halt or at least delay Iran's nuclear program. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stated the threats a nuclear Iran could pose and expressed concern that too long of a delay would lead to a \\"point of no return\\", after which Iran would become far more dangerous and virtually immune to a future military intervention. To date, Israel has already launched raids against Syrian and Iraqi nuclear reactors, and some point to the success of these attacks and the lack of retaliation as encouragement for a similar strike against Iran. In 2006, the United States passed the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated millions of dollars for human rights Non- governmental organization (NGOs) working in Iran. Several politicians in both countries have claimed the Act is a \\"stepping stone to war\\", although the Act prohibits the use of force against Iran. Both Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu have repeatedly said that a military option should not be taken out of consideration if other means of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon fail. Polls In a TNS survey conducted in March 2007 among 17,443 people in 27 European Union member states, a majority of 52% agreed with the statement \\"We must stop countries like Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, even if that means taking military action\\". A majority agreed with the statement in 18 member states, while a majority were against in 9 member states. In 2009, a U.S. poll conducted Sep. 30 to Oct. 1 by the Pew Research Center, found 61% agreed it was more important to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, even if it means taking military action.Most Would Use Force to Stop Iranian Nukes http://people-press.org/report/550/ In 2010, a poll conducted Feb. 23-24 by Fox News and Opinion Dynamics found 60% of Americans believed military force will be necessary to stop Iran from working on nuclear weapons In March 2012, a Reuters/Ipsos poll revealed that a majority of Americans, 56%, would support military action against Iran, even if it led to increased gas prices, if there was evidence demonstrating that Tehran was building nuclear weapons . 39% said that they opposed a military strike, while 62% of Americans said that they'd support Israel striking Iran over its nuclear program. A poll conducted in July 2012 found that 80% of Americans view Iran's nuclear program as a threat to the United States and its NATO allies. 39% viewed it as a very big threat, 41% viewed it was a moderate threat, 12% viewed it as not much of a threat, and 6% viewed it as not being a threat. In regards to how much of a threat the nuclear program is to Israel, 60% viewed it as a very big threat to Israel while 27% viewed it as a moderate threat. 80% believe that Iran is building nuclear weapons, including 72% of Democrats, 81% of Independents, and 89% of Republicans. A poll conducted in September 2012 by Basswood Research for The Foreign Policy Initiative revealed that Iran was cited as the most dangerous threat to American national security interests, with 45.1% of respondents choosing Iran . In addition, 62% of Americans favored preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, even if this requires the use of military force, as opposed to avoiding a conflict and accepting the prospects of Iranian nuclear weapons. Support from politicians Former Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut stated that he believed an attack against Iran was necessary to prevent the production of nuclear weapons. \\"I think the only justifiable use of military power would be an attempt to deter the development of their nuclear program if we felt there was no other way to do it.\\" He stopped short of endorsing an all out invasion stating that this attack would be different from Iraq in that only air strikes would be necessary - \\"I don't think anyone is thinking of this as a massive ground invasion, as in Iraq, to topple the government.\\" Sen. Joseph Lieberman: I'd Support Iran Attack Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani stated that the United States and allies would do everything necessary to prevent Iran from going nuclear stating the \\"absolute assurance that we will - if they get to the point where they are going to become a nuclear power - we will prevent them or we'll set them back five or 10 years. And that is not said as a threat. That should be said as a promise.\\" Freedom's Watch, an NPO created by Dick Cheney, planned to sponsor a private conservative forum on radical Islam to prove that Iran was a threat to the security of the USA and to gather support for the war against Iran.Van Natta D, New Group Boasts Big War Chest and Rising Voice, The New York Times, September 30, 2007 Former Governor of Massachusetts and 2008 Presidential candidate Mitt Romney had stated his support for military action against the Iranian regime categorizing the possible bombardment of nuclear facilities as a way to prevent Iran from proliferating a nuclear weapon. He stated that he would support a \\"bombardment of some kind...if severe economic and diplomatic sanctions aren't enough\\". In July 2009, former ambassador of the US to the United Nations John Bolton wrote an article for the Washington Post, in which he said that a military attack against Iran's weapons facilities was the only way to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, and that the logic for an Israeli strike was \\"nearly inexorable.\\" He also said that a decision to launch a strike should be made soon.

Life and works  Bornemann studied architecture at the Technical University of Berlin. After graduating in 1936, he was Assistant Scenic Designer at the Berlin Municipal Opera and, starting in 1945, Construction Supervisor with the city of Berlin. Since 1950 he became an independent architect active in Berlin. The designs for the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek (America Commemoration Library) (1951‚Äì1955), the Deutsche Oper Berlin (1956‚Äì1961), the Freie Volksb√ºhne (1961‚Äì1963) and the Museumszentrum Berlin-Dahlem (1966‚Äì1970) were drawn up by him. He also designed the headquarters of the Commerzbank Berlin (1969‚Äì1974). The largely underground German Pavilion at Expo '70 (the spherical auditorium is out of view to the right)) He designed the German Pavilion for the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka (Japan). With this building Bornemann decisively renounced the large architectonic gesture by burying the exhibition area below ground; a spherical auditorium served for multimedia presentations of current trends in electronic music. University Library in Bonn Later there appeared, amongst others, the extension of the Rathaus of Berlin-Wedding and the University Library in Bonn. He never built residential houses. Less well known is his work in multimedia. He designed some exhibitions, amongst them Atom (1953) and Farmer Smith (1957). The Osaka Pavilion was his crowning achievement in this field. Bornemann's architecture was and is a subject of violent controversial opinions over the modern trends of the 1950s and 1960s. The critics speak of \\"cold\\" or \\"austere\\" architecture and belittle his buildings with expressions like \\"elegance in exposed-aggregate concrete.\\" His adherents see in his work a model for modern architecture, and especially for modern theatre architecture. For more than 16 years Fritz Bornemann was chairman of the Bund Deutscher Architekten (Association of German Architects).

Ciudad Bol√≠var is located in the south of the city at the southern border of the Bogot√° savanna. This district is mostly inhabited by underclass residents. While most Ciudad Bol√≠var's area is rural, its urban portion includes one of the world's largest mega-slums.Mike Davis, Planet of Slums, La D√©couverte, Paris, 2006 (), p. 31. Its urban area concentrates the poorest population in Bogot√° and is known for its rampant levels of violence due to a large activity of gangs, mafia, and at times FARC, the national ex-terrorist group of Colombia.  Geography  The locality of Ciudad Bol√≠var is 90% mountainous and has a total area of , of which is urban, making it the 7th largest locality of Bogota. The locality is located in the southwestern part of the urban area of Bogota, bordering to the north with the locality of Bosa, Kennedy and Tunjuelito by the Tunjuelito River and the Autopista Sur. To the west, it borders the municipalities of Soacha, Sibat√© and Pasca, to the south borders with the locality of Sumapaz, to the east with the localities of Tunjuelito and Usme. = Transport = There are very few neighborhoods with access to main roads besides the Avenida Ciudad de Villavicencio which crosses the locality from north to east in a diagonal sense. The Avenida Boyac√° is the main road for the neighborhoods located on the eastern side of the locality and the Avenida Jorge Gait√°n Cort√©s which serves the neighborhoods of the southeastern part. The mass transit system TransMilenio covers Ciudad Bol√≠var in some areas with stops over the Caracas Avenue in Perdomo and Madelena.  History  During the 1950s, the area was formed by haciendas which were fractioned as a process of urbanization due to its proximity to the exploding Bogot√°'s urban development. The first neighborhoods were Meissen, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Lucero Bajo and La Mar√≠a which were populated by low income people; mainly immigrants from the neighboring Departments of Tolima, Boyac√°. The rapid population growth in the area reached in the 1970s some 50,000 inhabitants. A second urbanization stage started in the 1980s with settlements on the higher parts of the southern hills with neighborhoods as Naciones Unidas, Cordillera, Alpes, Juan Jos√© Rond√≥n, Juan Pablo II and others. The Inter-American Development Bank also helped to develop the neighborhoods of Sierra Morena, Arborizadora Alta and Baja for low-income families which in less than 20 years generated areas of concentration. Since 1983 the Council of Bogot√° designed the Ciudad Bol√≠var Plan which was designed to planify the area's development. On September 14, 1983, the Minor City hall of Ciudad Bol√≠var was created. With the Colombian Constitution of 1991 Bogot√°'s Special District was changed to a Capital District and Ciudad Bol√≠var became a locality with its own Local City hall and Local Administrative Junta (Council) with 11 councilmen.  Neighborhoods and veredas  = Neighborhoods = Some of the better known neighborhoods are: La Estrella, El Para√≠so, Lucero Alto, San Joaqu√≠n, Sierra Morena, San Francisco, Perdomo, Madelena, La Isla, Alto de La Cruz, Minuto de Mar√≠a and Francisco Pizarro. = Veredas = Some of the veredas located in Ciudad Bol√≠var are El Mochuelo, located near the Do√±a Juana landfill and Pasquilla.

Its structure is written to accompany four poetic stanzas where the first two verses of each stanza serve as a refrain throughout the entire song. In popular culture It was used as a theme song in Akira Kurosawa's 1952 film Ikiru. The terminally ill protagonist, played by Takashi Shimura, initially sings this romantic ballad as an expression of loss, and at the end with great contentment. His final performance of the song has been described as \\"iconic.\\" The song is also referenced in the Japanese manga titled, Fushigi Y≈´gi Genbu Kaiden. This music is also used in a Japanese Drama titled \\"Haikei Chichiue sama\\". The song is sung in Clemens Klopfensteins's film, Macao (1988). The song was also used in the Japanese TV show titled, Otomen. The line \\"fall in love maidens\\" (Koi seyo otome) is used as the subtitle of the video game Sakura Wars 4. From the song, the phrase \\"Life is short, fall in love maidens...\\" (Inochi mijikashi, koi seyo otome...) gained some popularity during the 1990s in Japan. Especially the phrase \\"Koi Seyo Otome\\" has been used as the title for several songs and a Japanese television drama. In the anime series Kirby: Right Back At Ya!, Episode 42, King Dedede sings a version of the famous phrase \\"Life is short, fall in love maidens...\\" (Inochi mijikashi, koi seyo otome...) but replaces \\"otome\\" with his own name, \\"Dedede\\". He sings this song on a swing set he built similar to the one in the film. However, this was only in the original dub and was not translated into English. The lyrics of the song were used in the novel Boogiepop and Others, as the leitmotif of Kamikishiro Naoko, one of the characters.

Wm James Reid House is a historic frame vernacular home, located in Fort Meade, Florida and was built between 1899-1914. It was built over another structure sometime in the late 1880s, as the lot appears in an 1880s survey. The property which compromises of Orange Ave and Oak St were part of the Jack Robeson addition, which the house sits on today. One of the last two surviving carriage stones in Polk County was located in front of the home for more than 100 years. It was originally owned by Reverend William James Reid (1858‚Äì1931) and Stella C. Reid (1869‚Äì1954) from Hanceville, Alabama. Mr. Wm James Reid was a minister for the North Alabama Conference Methodist Church South. The home was later owned by his son Claude 'Cauntess' Reid (1894‚Äì1976), who lived in the house until his death in 1976. After Claude's death, the home was left in the possession of his sister Carrie B. Reid (1898‚Äì2001). The home was left vacant for many years and was then sold to the Harpe family sometime around 1985. The Reid House was used for the HBO motion picture film Judgment featuring Blythe Danner, Keith Carradine, Jack Warden and David Strathairn. HBO partially refurbished the upper level of the house by adding a doorway between the master bedroom and the room next door, for which they used to film some of the scenes in the movie. The home was restored sometime between 1995-2004 by the Harpe family and then was sold to a family who left it in disrepair. The Reid House was then purchased by the Wolpins who are in the process of restoring and placing it on the National Register of Historic Places.  Historic details The Wm. James Reid house is a three-story Colonial Revival, in it original form since its conception in the early 1900s. The home features four eloquent parlors with high ceilings, original plaster, original doors and transoms, wave lead glass, cedar frame and heartpine floors. All the original features from the sliding pocket doors to the lovely copper handles are well preserved and in magnificent shape.  Location  The Wm. James Reid House is located within the bounds of the Fort Meade Historic District which is a U.S. historic district (designated as such on July 29, 1994) located in Fort Meade, Florida. The district is bounded by North 3rd Street, Orange Avenue, South 3rd Street and Sand Mountain Road. It contains 151 historic buildings.

The Vikingland Band Festival parade marching championship is held annually in Alexandria, Minnesota on the last Sunday of June. The event was founded in 1985 and is widely regarded as the midwest's biggest and most prestigious summer marching band competition. It is often regarded as the unofficial state championship for parade marching in Minnesota. The parade features only marching bands. It does not include floats or other units commonly associated with parades. Bands march at a three-block interval to prevent their music from blending together. Alexandria's extra-wide main street provides an outstanding venue for the performances. A panel of six judges provides taped feedback and scores for each band. Placement awards are presented to every band, with the top band in each class earning the distinction of Class Champion. The overall high scoring band of the day is named the Grand Champion. Each champion band is awarded a traveling flag to carry for one year. If a band wins its champion title for three consecutive years, the band earns the right to keep the flag. Caption awards are presented for the top wind section, percussion section and color guard in each class. One band is named the \\"People's Choice\\" by a panel of non-professional judges. Participants The Vikingland Band Festival has drawn 93 different bands since its inception in 1985. Participants have come from seven different states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado, South Carolina, South Dakota, Michigan), three Canadian provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan), and Norway (five times). Although many of the performing bands are experienced competitors with long-standing traditions of excellence, the festival welcomes younger bands as well. Organizers believe the education, intensity, and sportsmanship can provide a valuable experience for any band. The tradition of including non-competing \\"honor bands\\" in the parade was started in 1989 as a way to showcase a variety of marching styles. Styles represented have included foreign bands, military bands, bagpipes, drum and bugle corps, and percussion lines. History Eight different bands have earned the title of Grand Champion: Long Prairie (1985) Henry Sibley High School (1986, 2018) Litchfield (1987,1988,1989,1990,1998) Irondale High School (1991,1992,1993,1994,1995,1996) Park Center High School (1997,1999,2001,2003,2007,2008,2011,2012) Mankato 77 Lancers (2000,2002,2010) Waconia Marching Band (2004,2005,2006,2009, 2016) 728 Cadets (2013,2014,2015,2017) Since 1989 the festival has presented traveling flags to the Grand Champion and Class Champion bands. A band can retire a flag in its honor by winning the title three consecutive years. Four bands have retired Grand Champion flags: Litchfield (1989), Irondale (1993, 1996), Waconia (2006), and the 728 Cadets (2015). Ten bands have retired Class Champion flags: Bertha-Hewitt (1990, 1997), Irondale (1993, 1996), Kerkhoven-Murdock- Sunburg (2011, 2014, 2017), Litchfield (1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2002), Long Prairie (1989, 1995, 1998), Park Center (1999, 2007), Sauk Rapids-Rice (2009), Winona Cotter (1994, 2006), Waconia (2015), and the 728 Cadets (2015). Participants and spectators have developed traditions surrounding the event, such as intense last-minute rehearsals, potluck meals along the parade route, and a spirited awards ceremony. The event has inspired other communities across the state to start similar parade competitions.

Presently, the most recent census count puts their population at over 7,000 distributed among 48 communities located in Puerto Inca Province (Hu√°nuco), Chanchamayo Province (Jun√≠n) and Oxapampa Province (Pasco). They are a relatively small group, making up barely 2.91% of indigenous inhabitants located in the Peruvian Amazon. Their communities are situated in altitudes ranging from 200 to 1600 meters above sea level and can also be found along the shores of various rivers including the Pichis, Palcazu, Pachitea, Huancabamba, Cacaz√∫, Chorobamba, and the Yurinaqui Rivers. Name The Yanesha' are also known as Amage, Amagues, Amaje, Amajo, Amoishe, Amueixa, Amuese, Amuesha, Amuetamo, Lorenzo, and Omage.\\"Yanesha.\\" Ethnologue. Retrieved 4 Feb 2012. Language The Yanesha people speak Yanesha', a language belonging to the Maipurean language family, that also includes Ash√°ninka, Yine, and others. A dictionary and grammar have been published in Yanesha', which is written in the Latin script.  History  The tribe's first contact with non-native people came through friars who, in the second half of the 16th century, made an incursion into the region. However, it was not until the 18th century that missionaries (this time Franciscans) managed to establish steady relations with the Yanesha' and other ethnic groups living nearby. Father Francisco de San Jos√© founded various missions around Cerro de la Sal (Villa Rica District) and Quimiri (La Merced, Junin) to convert the indigenous populations to Christianity. However, in 1742, indigenous people commanded by Juan Santos Atahualpa rebelled against the Spaniards and destroyed a number of missions, effectively cutting off outside contact for several decades. It‚Äôs not known for sure the population of the Yanesha' people at this time but they had certainly already begun to die off from European diseases. During the 19th century, the area inhabited by the Yanesha' and other groups was reexplored by expeditions looking to establish routes to the lower Amazon and to colonize the area. The arrival of westerners represented for the Yanesha' the loss of land and a dramatic change of living customs ensued; they were grouped into towns and their extensive territories became the property of colonists. With this situation, they were compelled to group together and became the first ethnic group to form a professional organization: the Amuesha Congress. This later became the Yanesha' Federation. The Law of Indigenous Communities (sp: La Ley de Comunidades Ind√≠genas), promulgated in 1974, partly repaired the situation of dispossession by granting some land to Yanesha' groups. The Yanesha' people once lived through hunting, fishing, and subsistence agriculture; in modern times, the emphasis is on agricultural diversification and cultivation of cash crops like coffee and annatto. Hunting became much rarer after the Yanesha' people began raising animals for consumption. In addition, groups have begun exploiting Cat‚Äôs claw. The marketing of ceramic crafts has also become a source of income. In 1988, a territory of over 34,774 hectares was set up in Palcazu District as the Yanesha' Communal Reservation (Reserva Communal Yanesha') with the purpose of protecting important fauna that serves as sustenance to Yanesha' communities in the area.

The Balmoral Hotel is now part of the Rocco Forte Hotel Group. Forte Group plc was a British hotel and restaurant company. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was acquired by Granada in 2001. Its head office was in the London Borough of Camden. History Charles Forte (26 November 1908 ‚Äì 28 February 2007) was a British/Italian caterer and hotelier who founded the leisure and hotels conglomerate that ultimately became Forte Group. Charles Forte, funded by his two business partners, Eric Hartwell and Sidney Hartwell, set up his first \\"milk bar\\" on Regent Street in London in 1935 as Strand Milk Bar Ltd when he was 26. Soon he began expanding into catering and hotel businesses. After the Second World War, his company became Forte Holdings Ltd, and bought The Caf√© Royal in 1954. Forte was a major caterer at the Festival of Britain sites in 1951 and also operated the restaurants and bars at London Airport, later known as London Heathrow airport. Forte opened the first full motorway service station for cars at Newport Pagnell in 1960. Trust Houses Group Ltd and Forte Holdings merged in 1970 to become Trust Houses Forte or THF. The name was simplified to Trusthouse Forte in 1979. Through mergers and expansion, the Forte Group expanded into a multibillion-pound business. As well as The Caf√© Royal, it also owned the Grosvenor House Hotel, Quaglino's and Talk of the Town in London. It also included the Little Chef roadside restaurants, Forte Grand, Travelodge, Posthouse and Crest hotels, Harvester restaurants, contract catering firm Gardner Merchant, the Summerland leisure complex on the Isle of Man, the wine merchant Grierson-Blumenthal, sporting goods retailer Lillywhites (which adjoined the group's Criterion Restaurant) and a majority (although non-controlling) stake in the Savoy Hotel. Internationally, it owned the Hotel George V and Plaza Ath√©n√©e in Paris and the Bermudiana in Bermuda. Happy Eater and the five Welcome Break service areas were bought from Hanson Trust on 1 August 1986. The group for a time started to resemble a conglomerate with interests spanning the Sidgwick & Jackson publishing house, the Terry's chocolate company, Puritan Maid and a stake in Thomas Cook travel agents. Charles Forte was the CEO from 1971 and chairman upon the retirement of Eric Hartwell from 1983 (when his son Rocco Forte took over as CEO). In the early 1990s, the company was rebranded as Forte and the crown logo was adopted at the same time. This rebranding also heralded the introduction of sub brand groups for almost all the hotels (Posthouse, Crest, Heritage, Grand etc.). Lord Forte passed full control to Rocco in 1993. In 1994, the company purchased the Le M√©ridien hotel chain. Soon after Rocco took over, the Forte Group was faced with a hostile takeover bid from Granada. Ultimately, Granada succeeded with a ¬£3.9 billion tender offer in January 1996, which left the family with around ¬£350 million in cash. In 2001, following the de-merger of Compass plc from Granada's media interests, the use of the Forte trademark was returned to Sir Rocco Forte in a gesture intended to dispel the bitter legacy of the takeover. Rocco now owns the Rocco Forte Hotels group. Operations Most of the hotels used the following brands: Travelodge The Forte group acquired this US budget hotel brand and rolled it out in the UK. The hotels were originally sited alongside the group's Little Chef roadside cafes. Travelodge used navy blue branding. The office building which was the former Forte Group corporate headquarters at 166 High Holborn, London, has many years after the Forte Group was taken over and broken up, been turned into a Travelodge (the chain having expanded to comprise a much larger number of urban hotels). Forte Posthouse Hotels were mostly three-star hotels for business travellers. They were usually located in city centres or near major trunk roads. Some of these were sold to Holiday Inn. These hotels used red branding. Forte Heritage Hotels ranged from smaller country house style hotels, e.g., The Old England Hotel in Windermere, the Berystede in Ascot and Leeming House in Ullswater, to former coaching inns such as the Burford Bridge Hotel at Box Hill, the Swan at Lavenham and the Bull at Long Melford. In addition, the brand included some larger resort type hotels such as the Grand Atlantic at Weston Super Mare, the Marine Hotel at North Berwick and the Imperial Hotel, Exmouth; and some smaller resort hotels such as the Dart Marina Hotel in Dartmouth and the Brudenell Hotel in Aldeburgh. Some of these were sold to Macdonald Hotels, others are now operated by Mercure Hotels, others are owned by small groups or independently. These hotels used dark green branding. Forte Crest Hotels were more upmarket business hotels than Forte Posthouse. They were mostly located in cities and were mostly four-star. The naming convention was Forte Crest + the name of the city or locality, e.g. Forte Crest Sheffield or Forte Crest Gatwick Airport. Perhaps the most high-profile hotel was the huge Forte Crest Heathrow, now a Holiday Inn. The signage and general get up colour of Crest hotels was light blue/aquamarine. Forte Grand Hotels were a collection of high-end international hotels including the Waldorf Hotel, Westbury Hotel and Hotel Russell in London, the Balmoral Hotel (formerly \\"The North British Hotel\\") in Edinburgh, the Bath Spa Hotel in Bath, Leeming House in Ullswater, the Randolph Hotel in Oxford, The Majestic Hotel in Harrogate, the Compleat Angler in Marlow, the Rusacks Hotel in St Andrews and the then famous Imperial Hotel at Torquay. There were also a number of hotels which used Forte Grand as their sole name, for example the Forte Grand, Abu Dhabi hotel. Following the acquisition of Le M√©ridien, the Forte Grand brand was dramatically cut back, with the urban hotels being transferred to the Le M√©ridien brand, and all the regional UK Forte Grand hotels being demoted to the Forte Heritage brand. The Balmoral Hotel was the first hotel reacquired by Rocco Forte following the takeover and after an extensive refurbishment it forms part of The Rocco Forte Collection. Forte Grand hotels used bronze signage, with general branding in dark red/burgundy. Le M√©ridien ‚Äì this international hotel chain was acquired from Air France in 1994 and would from then on form the cornerstone of the Group's international mid/upper market offering. These hotels used grey branding. The top tier of hotels were discreetly branded Exclusive Hotels by Forte, and included some of the world's most venerable 5 star hotels, for example, the H√¥tel George-V and Plaza Ath√©n√©e in Paris; Brown's, Grosvenor House and the Hyde Park Hotel in London; the Ritz in Madrid; the Westbury and Plaza Ath√©n√©e in New York; Hotel des Bergues in Geneva; Hotel Eden in Rome; Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados etc. The Savoy Group would have added to this collection and augmented its prestige, had overall control been secured, as the Forte Exclusive hotels suffered somewhat in terms of prestige by association with the rest of the group's hotels. At the time of the Granada takeover the Exclusive Hotels brand contained 21 hotels. Granada failed to find buyers for the hotels as a group and it took a significant time for them to divest itself of these hotels to numerous different owners/operators. Some examples of the current owners/operators include Mandarin Oriental which has the Hyde Park Hotel, London; Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts which has the Hotel des Bergues, Geneva; Marriott International which has the Grosvenor House Hotel; Orient-Express Hotels which has the Hotel Ritz, Madrid; and, notably, The Rocco Forte Collection which has Brown's Hotel in London. London Hotels From the very first move from catering into hotels (the purchase of The Waldorf), the group had a foothold in the London hotel market, which it significantly expanded over the years. On adoption of sub brands, some of the London hotels were moved to sub brands, others were not. For example, the Hotel Russell, Westbury Hotel and the Waldorf Hotel became Forte Grand. The top tier of London hotels were already part of the Exclusive group which had existed long before the early 90s reorganisation/rebranding. London also had Posthouse and Crest hotels. However, there remained a number of London hotels which were not part of sub brands and these were banded together under the umbrella London Hotels. These included the Cumberland Hotel, the Regent Palace and the Strand Palace (all acquired from the J. Lyons and Co hotels subsidiary in the late 60s/early 70s) and they were joined by most of the London Forte Grand hotels when the Forte Grand brand was axed, although The Cavendish was an exception as it joined the Crest brand. These hotels all used their own logos and standard Forte corporate branding (Forte plus crown device in white and navy blue).

Murdoch was an exceptionally tough defender who was at the forefront of an exceptional backline that held the formidable South Melbourne and Collingwood attacks numerous times in important matches during the 1930s. For his size Murdoch had exceptionally good ground skills and would always use his strength to advantage when the ball was loose.Main, Jim and Holmesby, Russell (editors); The Encyclopedia of League Footballers (1st edition); pp. 314-315. He was capable of playing in any position on the backline, for most of his career fitting in as required to accommodate other defenders such as Maurie Sheahan, Martin Bolger and Basil McCormack. He played in the losing 1928 Grand Final side and in the 1932 premiership side as a centre-half-back, whilst in the losing 1929 side Murdoch was on the half-back flank and in 1931 full-back. By the time of the 1934 premiership side Richmond were so well-equipped with top defenders that Murdoch was moved to the forward line where he kicked a goal - despite having between Rounds Nine and Fourteen of that season held the VFL record for most games without kicking a goal.See Lovett, Michael; AFL Record: Guide to Season 2005; p. 573.

The cemetery has 258 underground burial vaults constructed of Tuckahoe marble on the site. The New York City Marble Cemetery, which was the city's second non-sectarian burial place, should not be confused with the nearby New York Marble Cemetery one block west, which was the first, having been established one year earlier. Both cemeteries were designated New York City landmarks in 1969,, p.68 and in 1980 both were added to the National Register of Historic Places. History and description Unlike the nearby New York Marble Cemetery, the New York City Marble Cemetery has monuments and markers at the locations of the underground vaults. In 1830, recent outbreaks of yellow fever had led city residents to fear burying their dead in coffins just a few feet below ground, and public health legislation had outlawed earthen burials. The New York Marble Cemetery had met this circumstance by constructing and selling underground marble burial vaults. A year later, five partners - Evert Bancker, Henry Booraem, Thomas Addis Emmett, Garret Storm and Samuel Whittemore - organized a similar venture one block east. Land was purchased from Samuel Cowdrey, who was a vault owner in the earlier venture, and Perkins Nichols was engaged to construct the marble vaults, as he had done previously. The first of the vaults were ready by summer 1831, the cemetery was incorporated on April 26, 1832, and it continued to purchase land on either side of the original plot until 1835, when it reached its current dimensions. Unlike the earlier cemetery, in which no monuments or markers indicated the placement of the vaults, instead being indicated on marble tablet embedded in the surrounding wall, the new cemetery marked the position of each vault with a marble marker, or with monuments of various sizes, according to the vault owner's preference. At the time, the new cemetery was considered to be a fashionable place to be buried. Visiting According to the cemetery's website, it is open twice a year, on a Sunday in spring, and a weekend in the fall.

It is the third universe established by the My-HiME Project. Like the My-Otome universe that went before it, it uses many elements from the My-HiME anime and manga series, such as the same character names and designs (My-Otome changed parts of the names to reflect a more European setting) but with different lead characters and a different premise (HiME are absent and are instead replaced by MiKO and psychic characters). Currently twelve chapters have been released.  Story  The series follows Mayo Kagura and Shion Tenn≈çji and centers around MiKOs, girls with psychokinetic abilities. Many other characters from the My-HiME and My-Otome series make appearances.  Characters  =Main characters= ; : Mayo is a 15-year-old delinquent who transfers to Fuka Academy after being kicked out of seven different schools. She is an extremely powerful MiKO as well as a competent fighter. When in battle her personality becomes extremely dark; she also does not remember later on that she was in a fight, implying that she might have multiple personalities. She has the power of telekinesis. Mayo is kept in a pair of handcuffs that severely limit her hand movement. The handcuffs are gold in color and said to be shaped like dragons biting their own tails (much like an Ouroboros). The handcuffs appear to be unbreakable, as other characters have attempted to force them off but were unable to inflict even slight damage. The handcuffs do not seem to hinder her daily life, mostly because of her telekinetic abilities. The handcuffs, however, are often seen gone or separated on the cover of the light novels. In chapter 4 it is revealed that she puts her shirt on with a kind of teleportation accomplished with superfast telekinesis. In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Mayo is the host of the dragon priestess, Fuhao. Her telekinesis increases by a tenfold as it is said that she could easily lift a clocktower and throw it away. She also seems to have control over wind. ; : Shion is a MiKO with the power of retrocognition. Mayo insists that the two of them were good friends in the past, but Shion does not recall or believe this at all (despite Mayo knowing her name). = Returning My-HiME Characters = * Shizuru Fujino is the Student Council President of Fuuka Academy. She is first seen in chapter 1, and ends up defeating a group of Yakuza who attack the academy. She is also a MiKO; her abilities seem to enhance her abilities with a katana, enabling her to perform impossible feats - she even slices an armored car in half lengthwise. She too possess telekinesis, but it's unknown how powerful it is. * Natsuki Kuga is a student at Fuuka Academy. She is first seen in chapter 2 helping Mayo adjust to life at Fuuka. Her MiKO abilities allow her to summon two guns, similar to her element in My-HiME that fire psychic bullets. It's also stated that she has an addiction to mayonnaise, similar to the original My-HiME character who put mayonnaise on everything (in the manga), and as shown in the special 16 of the anime. * Nao Yuuki is a student at Fuuka Academy. Her MiKO ability appears to be identical to Mayo's telekinesis. She is first seen in chapter 2 tormenting Mayo * Haruka Suzushiro is the Secretary General of Fuuka Academy, and just like her My-HiME incarnation, she deals with all the discipline. It is not yet known if she has any MiKO powers, though it was stated that she is one of the most powerful telekinetic wielders of the Academy. * Yukino Kikukawa is the Student Council Treasurer, still Haruka's loyal sidekick and correcting her mistakes with her wording. She is a MiKO with great telepathic powers and is able to read minds even inside Fuuka Academy's grounds, where mind-reading should be greatly reduced by barrier-like devices. * Akane Higurashi is a student at Fuuka academy and was in Aoi's first year class. She is a MiKO who has the power to read memories. She is the leader of the Suzuka Alliance. * Midori Sugiura appears as a student at Fuka Academy as well. It is unknown if she is a MiKO or if she is undercover. * Chie Harada is very similar to her My-HiME incarnation in which she carries around a cell phone, always hangs around Aoi, and likes to listen to the gossip. It is unknown if she is a MiKO. * Aoi Senoh as with Chie, she is very similar to her My-HiME incarnation, and still hangs around Chie. She is also very friendly towards Mayo, and is friends with Akane. It is unknown if she has any MiKO powers. * Nagi Homura is a student at Fuuka Academy and seems to be able to read minds through touch. He shows an interest in Mayo and underestimated her abilities at first. He seems to be a highly suspicious character around the school. * Reito Kanzaki seems to still be the Vice President of the Student Council, with practically the same personality as his My-HiME incarnation. His brother, Rei Kanzaki is the principal of Fuuka Academy. * Masashi Takeda is the leader of the Athletics Club and seems to be the one to respark the wars on campus by attacking the Kuga Faction, consisting of Natsuki, Mayo, and Shion. Humorously, he is still madly in love with Natsuki. He also seems to have MiKO powers which enhances his kendo sword abilities. * Fumi Himeno is the Chairwoman of the academy next to the principal, Rei Kanzaki. It is unknown if she has MiKO powers yet. * Miya Suzuki is a classmate of Mayo who is a member of the Suzuka Alliance that leads Mayo into a trap set by Tomoe. She bears a closer resemblance to Miya Clochette from My-Otome than her namesake in the My-HiME anime. It is unknown if she has MIKO powers. * Kiyone Nonomiya is a classmate of Natsuki. She was first seen hung upside down in a tree by her ankles. She has the power of teleportation. = Returning My-Otome Characters = Tomoe Hinagiku seems to be associated with the Suzaku Alliance. = Other characters = Rei Kanzaki is the principal of Fuuka Academy, and seems intent on keeping the school peaceful. His most distinctive characteristic is that he is bald. It is unknown if he has MIKO powers. Negishi is a member of the Yakuza. He was once a member of the gang Bangachi which was destroyed by Shizuru Fujuno. He comes to the school to get revenge.

Although he authored at least 243 works in several fields, he is best known for the 1994 cultural history bestseller \\"Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society,\\" which was being pressed into publication when he died; and two seminal academic books - 1968's \\"A Critical Study of the Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History,\\" and 1974's\\"The Discovery of the Igorots: Spanish Contacts with the Pagans of Northern Luzon\\" Early life William Henry Scott was born on 10 July 1921, in Detroit, Michigan, where he was christened Henry King Ahrens.Peralta, Jesus T, editor (2001) p.15 His family, of Dutch-Lutheran descent, soon returned to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Scott spent his boyhood.Peralta, Jesus T, editor (2001) p.16 In 1936, Scott won a three-year scholarship to the Episcopalian- affiliated Cranbrook School in Michigan USA, where he excelled academically and became interested in pursuing a career as an archeologist. In 1939, after graduating, he changed his name to William Henry Scott. In 1942, Scott joined the US Navy, serving throughout World War II until 1946. Professional career St. Mary's School, the Episcopalian Church's only Training School in the Philippines when Scott came to Sagada in the 1950s, pictured 2007In 1946, Scott joined the Episcopal Church mission in China. He taught and studied in Shanghai, Yangchow and Beijing until 1949. With the general expulsion of foreigners from China in 1949, he followed some of his teachers to Yale University where he enrolled, graduating in 1951 with a BA in Chinese language and literature. Immediately upon graduation he was recalled to active duty and served in the navy for eighteen months during the Korean War. In 1953 he was appointed lay missionary in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Although he wanted to teach in Japan until he could return to China, he accepted an available post as teacher of English and history in the Philippines, and was assigned to St Mary's School in Sagada, Mountain Province, Philippines. After preparatory studies in the United States, he reached Sagada in January 1954. As the Episcopal Church became well established in the Cordillera mountain region of Northern Luzon during the US colonial period, it was here that Scott settled. He spent much of the remainder of his life in the Kankana-ey town of Sagada. Although some of his most influential academic works ‚Äî \\"Prehispanic Source Materials\\" and \\"Discovery of the Igorots\\" ‚Äî are of particular interest to anthropologists, he personally rejected the description anthropologist as applying to himself. Known to his friends as \\"Scotty\\", he became a focus for pilgrimage by numerous foreign and Filipino academics, entertaining them in his book-lined study while he puffed away on his trademark cigar.  Detention during Martial Law  Soon after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, Scott was arrested as a subversive and placed in military detention.Peralta, Jesus T, editor (2001) p.17 Because several of the boys Scott had taught and sponsored in the years he had lived in Sagada had joined the anti-Marcos opposition, Scott was accused of being a communist sympathiser. The government forces who had broken into his house and arrested him had also found copies of Mao‚Äôs writings in his bookshelf, and cited this as \\"evidence\\" of his communist leanings. Colleague Stuart Schlagel recounts Scott's response: \\"For heaven‚Äôs sake, I teach Asian history, and anyone who does that must be familiar with Mao‚Äôs work! It doesn‚Äôt mean I have abandoned Christianity and democratic politics; it just means I am a historian practicing his trade.\\" Scott saw his time in Marcos' prison as a validation of his Filipino nationalist beliefs. Schlagel recounts Scott saying that he \\"considered the time in jail behind bars to be one of the best of his life, because he was able to have long in- depth conversations with all the most prominent anti-Marcos activists.\\" As an American citizen Scott could have easily left the Philippines, but he declined, and so faced deportation proceedings. Marcos' outward commitment to legal formalities resulted in Scott being put on trial for subversion. In court, \\"resoundingly supported and defended by friends, students, and colleagues, and by Scott's own brilliant testimony\\", he was exonerated with the court dismissing the charges in 1973. Scott was given \\"a memorable and triumphant welcome back in Sagada\\" following his acquittal. He continued to be critical of the Marcos regime. The high level of esteem in which he was held protected him from further prosecution, although his situation remained precarious until the lifting of martial law. He criticized US colonial rule and continuing US involvement in Philippine politics after independence, especially US support for Marcos. In this he pursued a similar line to the Filipino nationalist historian Renato Constantino.p. 1 Foreword by Renato Costantino In: Scott, W.H. (1985). Cracks in the Parchment Curtain and other Essays in Philippine History. New Day Publishers, Manila. 315pp. Writer and lecturer Scott's house in Sagada, viewed from the former Training School in 2007Scott observed the Igorot people of the Cordillera region had preserved elements of pre-colonial culture to a greater degree, and over a wider area, than could be found elsewhere in the Philippines. He saw the resistance of Igorots to attempts by the Marcos government to develop projects in the region as a model for resistance elsewhere in the country. He did not support the view that the Igorot people are intrinsically different to other Filipinos, or the view that the Cordillera should become an ethnic preserve. Scott was scathing of views that divide Filipinos into ethnic groups, describing Henry Otley Beyer's wave migration theory as representing settlement by 'wave after better wave' until the last wave which was 'so advanced that it could appreciate the benefits of submitting to American rule'.Scott, William Henry (1987) Views like these resonated with the progressive nationalist opposition to Marcos. Scott held a bachelor's degree from Yale University, a Masters from Columbia University and a PhD from the University of Santo Tomas in 1968. Scott's dissertation was published that year by the University of Santo Tomas Press as Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History. A revised and expanded second edition was published in 1984.Scott, William Henry (1984) He debunked the Kalantiaw legend in this book. Datu Kalantiaw was the main character in a historical fabrication written in 1913 by Jose E. Marco. Through a series of failures by scholars to critically assess Marco's representation, the invented legend was adopted as actual history. Scott, William Henry (1984) pp132-134 As a result of Scott's work, Kalantiaw is no longer a part of the standard history texts in the Philippines.Kalantiaw, the Hoax Scott's first well known academic work is The Discovery of the Igorots.Scott, William Henry (1974) This is a history of the Cordillera mountain region over several centuries of Spanish contact, constructed from contemporary Spanish sources. Scott argues that the difficulties the Spaniards encountered extending their rule in the face of local resistance resulted in the inhabitants of the region being classified as a 'savage' race separate to the more tractable lowland Filipinos. Scott adopted a similar approach in Cracks in the Parchment Curtain Scott, William Henry (1982) in which he tries to glean a picture of pre-colonial Philippine society from early Spanish sources. This project was criticized by the Asianist Benedict Anderson who argued that it yielded a vision of Philippine society filtered through 'late medieval' Spanish understanding. Scott was aware of this limitation, but argued Spanish records provided glimpses of Filipino society and native reaction to colonial dominion, often incidental to the intention of the Spanish chronicler, which were the cracks in the Spanish parchment curtain.Scott, William Henry, (1982) (emended edition 1985) p1 One of Scott's last full scale books was Ilocano Responses to American Aggression.Scott, William Henry (1986) The foreword was written by Joma Sison, the head of the Philippine Communist Party. The EDSA revolution, which coincided with the publication of the book, obscured the fact that the foreword had been written while Sison was in jail. Harold C.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Bergamo. History The dome From no later than the 9th century there were two cathedrals in Bergamo: one was the basilica of Saint Alexander, which stood on the site believed to be that of his martyrdom, and the other was dedicated to Saint Vincent, construction of which apparently began in the Lombard era, on the site of the present cathedral. Bishop Giovanni Barozzi commissioned the re-building of the cathedral of St. Vincent in the mid-15th century, for the plans of which Filarete claimed credit. In 1561 the Venetians demolished the cathedral of St. Alexander for reasons of military expediency, leaving St. Vincent's as the sole survivor. At the beginning of the 17th century Bishop Giovanni Emo unified the canons of the two old cathedrals. Finally Bishop Gregorio Barbarigo succeeded in obtaining from Pope Innocent XI the bull Exponi nobis of 18 August 1697, which established for the diocese a single chapter and a single cathedral, changing the dedication of the surviving cathedral to Saint Alexander from Saint Vincent. In 1689, the structure was refurbished to designs by Carlo Fontana. Another major renovation was undertaken in the 19th century, culminating in the completion of the Neo-classical west front in 1889. Interior The cathedral has a Latin cross ground plan with a single nave. The first side-chapel to the right contains a St. Benedict and Saints by Andrea Previtali (1524), and the first side-chapel to the left, the Madonna and child with saints by Giovan Battista Moroni (1576). The church also contains a Madonna with child with two doves by Giovanni Cariani, as well as canvases attributed to Giambettino Cignaroli and Sebastiano Ricci, including a Saints Firmus, Rusticus, and Proculus (1704). In the apse is a Martyrdom of Bishop Saint John of Bergamo (1731-1743) by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and a Saint Alexander by Carlo Innocenzo Carloni. The main altar was designed by Filippo Juvarra. The choir area has wooden intaglio panels by Johann Karl Sanz. Baptistery Baptistery Nearby stands the octagonal baptistery, constructed in 1340 by Giovanni da Campione for the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. During major building works in 1650 the baptistery was dismantled, but was saved, and in 1856 reassembled in the canons' courtyard. It was moved to its present site in 1889. Inside are bas- reliefs of episodes of the Life of Christ, a statue of John the Baptist and a font of 1340 by Giovanni da Campione. Round the upper level runs a colonnade, and over it stand eight 14th-century statues representing the Virtues.

His eminence within the field of Philippine anthropology was widely recognized during his lifetime, with National Artist F. Sionil Jose dubbing him \\"the country‚Äôs first and foremost cultural anthropologist\\" Jocano served as Professor Emeritus at the Asian Center of the University of the Philippines and Executive Director of PUNLAD Research House, Inc. and a professor in University of the Philippines. He has authored numerous books on various aspects of Filipino Society and Culture.  Biography  = Early life and education = Jocano was born in Cabatuan, Iloilo in 1930 \\\\- the ninth of eleven children born to Eusebio Jocano, a persevere farmer, and Anastacia Landa.http://ilonggowriters.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/dr-felipe-landa-jocano/ He finished his elementary studies at a public school in Iloilo, and then ran away to Manila because his family could not afford to send him to high school. He eventually graduated from the Arellano High School in Manila, working his way through to graduation. After this, he tried to enroll in some college courses, but distractions and an illness forced him to return to his native Iloilo in 1954, where we eventually earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Central Philippine University in 1957. = Return to Iloilo, interest in folklore, and work at the National Museum = It was during Jocano's period of return to Iloilo that he first developed an interest in folklore. This interest brought him into contact with Robert Fox, then an anthropologist working for the National Museum of the Philippines, who got him a job as \\"research aid\\" at the museum - doing mostly janitorial work. Through his work ethic and by taking the initiative to draw the museum director's attention to his typing skills, Jocano was eventually moved to the museum's typing pool. Work at the National Museum inspired Jocano to write a series of articles discussing Philippine legends surrounding plant and animal life, which was published in the Manila Times. The Department of Education took note of the series and asked Jocano if it could be published in \\"Diwang Kayumanggi\\", a high school teaching supplement regularly issued by the Department of Education at the time. Jocano's condition for the reprinting was that the publication would also indicate his position as \\"janitor.\\" As a result, Jocano was promoted from \\"Research Aid\\" to \\"Scientist 1\\", although his job description remained the same. = University education and teaching career= Taking advantage of a study grant, Jocano went to the University of Chicago to earn a master's degree in Anthropology, graduating in 1962. He took up a teaching position there and later got his Ph.D. in Anthropology from the same university. Jocano eventually decided to come home to teach at the University of the Philippines, where he served until his retirement 31 years later. In that time, he served among other functions, as Chairman of the UP Department of Anthropology, director of Philippine Studies Program at the UP Asian Center, Dean of the UP Institute of Philippine Studies, and head of Asian Center Museum Laboratory. Jocano's association with the University of the Philippines continued after retirement, as he was named professor emeritus of the UP Asian Center. Jocano's work as a scholarly writer was prolific and wide-ranging. His study of ethnology expanded into numerous aspects of Filipino life - from folklore and pre-colonial history to international relations, to rural community and urban slum life. He was one of the first to even suggest the ethnological study of the development of the Philippines' corporate culture. In 1999, he was awarded a special citation for a lifetime of writing and publishing on various aspects of Philippine culture by the Manila Critics Circle.  Pioneering use of Participant Observation in Philippine settings  As one of the earliest Filipino-born researchers to receive proper scholarly training in anthropology, Jocano became a pioneer in the use of Participant Observation as a research methodology in Philippine ethnographic research, applying it in numerous places, including Capiz, Ilocos, and notably, the urban poor community of Looban, Sta Mesa in Manila.Panopio, I. and Rolda, R. S. (2000). Society and Culture: Introduction to Sociology and Anthropology. JMC Press, Inc. Quezon City. 12. Ritzer, G. (2000). Jocano's work in the Slum of Looban was seminal in its insistence on \\"living in the community and taking part, whenever possible in the activities of the members, observing what they do and checking the observed behaviour in terms of what they say and do.\\" Earlier research on slums mostly relied on the use of questionnaires, which Jocano dismissed as inappropriate for studying urban poor society: \\"One cannot possibly go up and paper and ask questions without arousing suspicions especially among street corner gang members.\\" National Artist F. Sionil Jose recounts that some of Jocano's adventures in Participant Observation resulted in memorably humorous episodes: :\\"At one time, he got himself hired as a motel boy while doing a study on sexuality among Filipinos. He confided that he surprised some of his colleagues who patronized these motels. From that study, Pepe gave me a chapter which I published in my journal, Solidarity. Right at the press, some 20 copies disappeared. The issue was sold out in a couple of months, I had to order a reprint. As one academic told me ‚Äî it was a landmark article ‚Äî the first \\"scholarly pornography.\\" :And at one time, a relative accosted him in Quiapo where he was actually begging at the church door to gather data on his study of the urban poor. The relative was so shocked to see him there in tatters, he had to drag away the protesting scholar with the promise to help him.'\\"  \\"Hinilawod: Tales From The Mouth of The Halawod River\\"  One of Jocano's earliest major contributions to the field of cultural anthropology and a significant contribution to recorded Filipino folk literature was the documentation of the epic poem Hinilawod (which means \\"Tales From The Mouth of The Halawod River\\"). The epic recounts the story of the exploits of three Sulodnon demigod brothers, Labaw Donggon, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap of ancient Panay. Jocano, assisted by a radio technician from the Central Philippine University, convinced Sulod folk chanters Ulang Udig and Hugan-an to recount the story, and allow them to record it on cassette. The process of acquiring this permission took years, from Jocano's first contact with Ulang Udig in 1955 to the recording of Hugan-an's 30-hour performance of the epic in 1957. Jocano eventually also published the text in his book \\"Hinilawod: Adventures of Humadapnon Tarangban I\\" (The epic was once again recorded in 1999, by researcher Alejo Zata, working among Sulod natives who still performed it and for whom the epic was still very much an active part of their culture.) There have been numerous stage performances of Hinilawod, all based mostly on Jocano's text. In response to a 2012 performance of a stage version of the epic at the Cultural Center of the Philippines by a theater group called Hiyas Kayumanggi, National Artist F.Sionil Jose noted: :\\"There is so much in our folk culture that can be used by our creative artists. All we have to do is turn to our cultural anthropologists like Felipe Landa Jocano.\\"  Core Population Theory Jocano was one of the first scholars to suggest alternatives to H. Otley Beyer's Wave Migration Theory of migration to the Philippines. His Core Population Theory proposed that there weren't clear discrete waves of migration, but a long process of cultural evolution and movement of people. The theory suggests that early inhabitants of Southeast Asia were once of the same ethnic group with similar culture, but eventually -through a gradual process driven by environmental factors - differentiated themselves from one another. Other prominent anthropologists like Robert Fox, Alfredo E. Evangelista, Jesus Peralta, Zeus A. Salazar, and Ponciano L. Bennagen agreed with Jocano. However some still preferred Beyer's theory as the more acceptable model, including anthropologist E. Arsenio Manuel.  Personal life  Jocano married Adria Payad and they had two children, Felipe Jr. and Lizabeth. He died in 2013 at the age of 83.

Biology The giant moray is carnivorous and nocturnal, hunting its prey within the reef. It is known to engage in cooperative hunting with the roving coral grouper (Plectropomus pessuliferus). These two fish species are complementary hunters: While the eel hunts in the reef, it may scare prey up and out of the reef, leaving them to be eaten by the grouper. Similarly, the grouper hunting above the reef may cause prey to attempt to seek refuge in the reef, where the moray may ambush them. The giant moray mainly feeds on fish and occasionally on crustaceans.Kuiter, R.H., 1998. Photo guide to fishes of the Maldives. Atoll Editions, Victoria, Australia. 257 p. This moray eel was recently identified as natural predator of the lionfish (Pterois miles) in its native habitat in the Red Sea. A mature giant moray has few natural predators, although it may compete for food with reef-dwelling sharks. Cleaner wrasses are commonly found in its presence, cleaning the interior of its mouth. Gymnothorax javanicus have been shown to have very small optic tectum volumes, indicating that they primarily hunt by smell rather than vision. Hazards This species may be hazardous to people. Being at the top of the food chain, it has been known to exhibit biomagnification of harmful ciguatera toxins. Eating a giant moray, especially the liver, can thus cause illness, coma, or even death . While this moray may bite if threatened, cornered or in the presence of food,Siliotti, A.

After the company folded in 1975, Meyers decided to pursue a writing career rather than return to college, hoping, like one of his idols, Donald E. Westlake, to create work in as many genres as he enjoyed reading. With the help of his Seaboard Peridicals/Atlas Comics superior, Jeff Rovin, Meyers authored such non-fiction books as TV Super Stars, The Illustrated Soap Opera Companion, Movies on Movies, The Great Science Fiction Films, and The World of Fantasy Films. After their publication, he moved on to film and television genres he enjoyed even more, creating award-winning works on TV detectives and exploitation films. At around the same time, he was hired to be the first ghostwriter for the best-selling paperback series The Destroyer, and shortly after went on to write more than two dozen paperbacks for several publishers in the police, martial arts, and war action genres. At the same time, he was pursuing genre work under variations of his own name, including two science fiction novels, three horror novels, and a fantasy mystery for the Forgotten Realms series of Dungeons and Dragons. At the same time he continued to ply the editing trade, serving on the staffs of such publications as Starlog, Famous Monsters of Filmland, The Armchair Detective, and Millimeter magazine, among others. He was also head writer for the first issue of Fangoria, as well as the official tie-in magazines for the movies Moonraker and Alien.  Enter the Film Dragon  Although Meyers had seen Enter the Dragon and Five Fingers of Death in 1973, martial art movies held no interest for him until ex-Atlas Comics artist/writer Larry Hama introduced him to samurai and kung-fu cinema in 1978. In short order, Meyers had secured his first contract to write a book on the subject, and was soon in Hong Kong meeting Jackie Chan, which led to his inspiring Jonathan Ross to make a documentary on the kung fu star as part of his Son of the Incredibly Strange Film Show series in the UK. Upon its broadcast on the Discovery Network in the U.S., the English-speaking interest in kung-fu films was refreshed. Meyers continued to promote the film genre in every medium he could, becoming a contributing editor for Inside Kung Fu magazine until it ceased publication in 2011, updating his book as Martial Arts Movies From Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan & More in 2001, appearing on Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan specials for A&E;'s Biography and Bravo Profiles, and contributing audio commentaries, liner notes, and cover copy for hundreds of DVDs in Asia and America. Meyers hosted his first San Diego Comic Con Superhero Kung Fu Extravaganza in 1997, and recently prepared its 20th Anniversary Celebration for 2017. An artist seeing the Extravaganza led to Meyers being asked to present kung fu seminars to the staff of the first Kung Fu Panda film, as well as its subsequent Nickelodeon TV series.  Stage Appearances  Although predominantly a writer, Meyers occasionally tires of typing, which has led to him playing the king at the Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for almost two years. Shortly after, he was approached to appear as a certain jolly old elf in malls, stores, churches, homes, and even a dozen children's hospitals via video.  Awards & Honors  Meyers has been inducted into The World Martial Arts Hall of Fame, the World Wide Martial Arts Hall of Fame, the Budo Magazine Hall of Fame, and the Action Martial Arts Magazine Hall of Fame, and received an Edgar Allan Poe Special Award by the Mystery Writers of America.

As a specialist in portraits, Herrera was popular among the high society of Montevideo. His portraits of women and children display his mastery of pastel, his favored medium. He also delved, like many of his contemporaries, into the genre of nativismo, painting scenes of gauchos and criollos. He also painted in the historical genre, his most popular works in this genre being Congreso de Abril de 1813 and Artigas en el Hervidero, which appears on the reverse of the $1000 note.

History  Toyota Supra being tested at Llandow, June 2009 Llandow Circuit began life as an airfield during World War II. RAF Llandow was home to Supermarine Spitfires and part of the Royal Canadian Air Force, but the Air Ministry decommissioned it in 1957. In 1961 Jack Evans, a local farmer, bought an 80-acre parcel which included air raid shelters, gun turrets and stretches of runway. With the help of the South Wales Automobile Club he linked the runways to form a 1-mile oval track which was opened by Graham Hill in 1963. Car and motorbike events during the 1960s and 1970s drew crowds of 3,000‚Äì4,000, and competitors included Roger Clark, Jody Scheckter and Andy Rouse. The circuit fell into disrepair, losing its track licence in 1977, thus in the 1980s, stock car racing, grass tracking and sheep grazing became more usual uses. A race and rally school, go-karting and general testing continued until the owners resurfaced and reshaped the track with a 9-metre-wide strip of tarmac, enabling the Motor Sports Association Sprint license to be regained in 2001. The circuit is now a popular venue for track days.http://www.llandow.com/?page_id=33http://www.motorsportcircuitguide.com/circuit- directory.php?id=118 The circuit remains privately owned by the descendants of Jack Evans.

Their songs are written primarily in German, supported by male and female vocalists. The band's name comes from Friedrich Nietzsche's most famous book: Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part II - Die Stillste Stunde. History Stillste Stund released a Demo-Version of Ein Mensch, ein Ding, Ein Traum in 2000. They signed a record contract with music label 'Alice In...' of the Dark Dimensions label group shortly after that. There were originally two supporting female vocalists: Birgit S. and Inanis Kurzweil. Inanis appeared on the band's first three releases. Ein Mensch, ein Ding, Ein Traum, the band's debut album, was released in mid-2000. In May 2002, Stillste Stund was nominated as Best Newcomer Band by German music magazine Orkus. The ever-popular \\"Der Untergang\\" from Ein Mensch, ein Ding, Ein Traum, was featured on four different compilations, all in two years. Some of the lyrical content is inspired by legends and fairy tales along with the thoughts of such notable German philosophers and novelists as Friedrich Nietzsche, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Joseph von Eichendorff, and Hermann Hesse. In 2001, the band released their second full-length album, Ursprung Paradoxon. Its release gained Stillste Stund much popularity throughout Europe and even parts of South America . The music consists of theatrical, classical, and industrial influences. The band's album artwork and sleeve design and website design is all made by Birgit S. This album featured the first part of the Alice Trilogy named \\"Alice (Der Spiegeltanz). The track was originally written for the anniversary of their label Alice In... and was inspired by Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Their next album Biestblut ‚Äì Zwei in Einem (Ein Gedankenkonstrukt in sieben Szenen) appeared in late 2003. The musical content of this concept album has a much more classical influence and \\"Nebelland\\", \\"Golem\\", \\"Weltwinternacht\\", \\"Sublunaris\\", and \\"Wo die Wirklichkeit schweigt\\" are among some of the notably popular tracks from Biestblut. This was also the last album featuring additional female vocal support from Inanis Kurzweil. In 2005, Stillste Stund presented their fourth album Blendwerk Antikunst as a worthy successor to Ursprung Paradoxon. The lyrics are written mostly in German except for three songs in English: \\"Apocalyptic Noon\\", \\"Darksomely\\", and \\"Obsessed with Purple\\". The most recent album Von Rosen und Neurosen - Eine erlesene Sammlung grausamster Albtr√§ume was released on March 14, 2008. The standard edition features twelve tracks all sung in German. The limited edition of this album includes a bonus disc named \\"Alice EP\\" with ten tracks that continue and end the very popular story that began on the second album Ursprung Paradoxon with the track \\"Alice (Der Spiegeltanz)\\" (amongst other titles, the EP features a remastered version of \\"Alice (Der Spiegeltanz)\\" and full-length versions of \\"Alice II\\" and \\"Alice III\\"). Ending Stillste Stund claimed to be a \\"project\\" instead of a band. It announced that the production of Alice III would complete the project, and that Stillste Stund would dissolve, having fulfilled its purpose. There was speculation about more music being released under a new name, but to date, there has been no further official information. Line-up =Current members= * Oliver Uckermann ‚Äì Since Oliver has been active as a musician for many years and worked with several other bands and projects, the band's debut album Ein Mensch, ein Ding, ein Traum consists of earlier material from the late 80s. The lyrical content, much of which is written by Uckermann himself, is inspired by legends and German fairy tales. \\"Ebenholz, Schnee & Blut\\" from Ursprung Paradoxon is based on the Brothers' Grimm fairy tale Snow White. Uckermann explained in an interview with Rock-E-Zine that the thoughts of people like Friedrich Nietzsche and Hermann Hesse are, in part, his inspiration for philosophical lyrics. \\"Furchtbare Herrin,\\" the prologue from Ein Mensch, ein Ding, ein Traum comes from Friedrich Nietzsche's novel: Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which is where the band's name came from. * Birgit Strunz ‚Äì Joined the band alongside Inanis Kurzweil when it was formed in 1998 and has been working with cohort Oliver Uckermann since then. At first, she only provided vocals to the project, but soon began to co-write the lyrics and contribute her song ideas. Together, she and Oliver wrote the lyrics for \\"Unter Kreuzen\\", on Ursprung Paradoxon and the two songs \\"Darwin\\" and \\"Nebelland\\" on Biestblut. Birgit is also the artist behind the visual concept for the Stillste Stund project. She independently wrote the lyrics for the songs \\"Apocalyptic Noon\\", \\"Ananke\\", \\"Obsessed With Purple\\", and most recently, \\"Tiefenritt\\" on the band's fifth and newest release Von Rosen und Neurosen - Eine erlesene Sammlung grausamster Albtr√§ume. =Former members= * 1998‚Äì2003: Inanis Kurzweil - female vocals Discography =Official albums= * 2000: Ein Mensch, ein Ding, ein Traum * 2001: Ursprung Paradoxon * 2003: Biestblut ‚Äì Zwei in Einem (Ein Gedankenkonstrukt in sieben Szenen) * 2005: Blendwerk Antikunst * 2008: Von Rosen und Neurosen - Eine erlesene Sammlung grausamster Albtr√§ume =Promotional releases= * 2005: Blendwerk Antikunst EP =Compilation contributions= * 1999‚Äìpresent: Compilation contributions by Stillste Stund =Miscellaneous releases= *TV series: Buffy The Vampire Slayer, episode 7x02 Beneath You - Von der Tiefe (inoff.

Isabella Anne Seymour- Conway, Marchioness of Hertford (1759 ‚Äì 12 April 1834) was an English courtier and a mistress of King George IV when he was Prince of Wales. She was a daughter of Charles Ingram, 9th Viscount of Irvine, and married Francis Ingram-Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford, in 1776, at age sixteen. Tall, handsome, and elegant, she soon caught the attention of the Prince of Wales. His attentions were not welcomed by her husband, who took her to Ireland to keep her from the Prince. However, this only increased his passion for Lady Hertford, and she became George's mistress in 1807. As a result, the Prince was a regular guest at Hertford House, Hertford's London residence, and Ragley Hall in Warwickshire. A Tory herself, she was influential in turning the Prince toward the Tories, and used her London residence as the headquarters for Tory sympathisers. The Marchioness's predecessor as the Prince Regent's mistress had been Maria Fitzherbert, a Roman Catholic. Other Catholics disapproved of the Marchioness's influence over the prince, referring to \\"the fatal witchery of an unworthy secret influence\\" that they felt had turned him against the idea of Catholic emancipation. George Canning, speaking for the party in power, made use of these comments to say that, if Lady Hertford was really responsible for the prince's political decisions, she was \\"Britain's guardian angel\\". On the death of her mother in 1807, she inherited Temple Newsam in West Yorkshire, where the Prince of Wales had paid her a visit. She and her husband added the name of Ingram to their surname due to the fortune they inherited from her family. Lady Hertford's relationship with the Prince, now Prince Regent, ended in 1819, when he turned his attentions to Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham. According to Greville‚Äôs diary for 9 June 1820:Charles C. F. Greville, A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV, volume I (London, Longmans Green & Co, 1874), at page 29 > \\"Somebody asked Lady Hertford if she had been aware of the King‚Äôs admiration > for Lady Conyngham, and 'whether he had ever talked to her about Lady C.

The group represents British International Mountain Leaders (IMLs) who work in the hills and mountains of their home country, the alpine regions and further afield. Before November 2004 the recognised qualification was the European Mountain Leader Award (EML). Following the establishment of the Union of International Mountain Leader Associations (UIMLA) in November 2004, EMLs have become International Mountain Leaders (IMLs). As an Association, BAIML now has over 600 members, most of whom hold the full IML award. Qualifications British IMLs have been assessed in the skills required for leading walking parties in mountains. The IML award is administered by Mountain Leader Training UK and is only valid when the IML is a member of a national association (such as BAIML) and holds professional indemnity insurance. History The IML award is a professional qualification, recognised since November 2004 by UIMLA. Before 2004, the appropriate qualification was the EML (European Mountain Leader Award) recognised since 1993 by the former Commission Europ√©enne des Accompagnateurs en Montagne (CEAM). CEAM (La Commission Europ√©enne des Accompagnateurs en Montagne) ‚Äì the European Mountain Leader Commission ‚Äì agreed in 1992 upon an accepted European Standard which would provide a framework for a walking leader's qualification recognised by the signing countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK). The first EML course ran at Plas y Brenin in November 1992. 25 people attended and completed the combined training and assessment course to become the first EML Award holders. In order for the award to be recognised as a professional qualification there needed to be an Association which would provide insurance, a Code of Conduct and a variety of other membership services. Only through membership of this Association would the award be valid. The first EML holders established the British Association of European Mountain Leaders (BAEML) in 1993, with Dave Bursnall being elected first President.

It is rare for a single deity to straddle both of these Hindu denominations. She is sometimes suspected to be a Buddhist tantric figure, as she holds a book, Veena and handbell, which are Mahayana symbols. Goddess Sarala is also known as Vak Devi, the Goddess of Knowledge and Wisdom, and Jhankad Vaasini Sharada. Folklore regarding the goddess goes back to thousands of years, to the age of Parashurama. It is said that it was the god Parashurama who carved the goddess with the tip of his arrow. The worship of the Goddess is said to have been popularized in the 15th century CE by Sidheshwar Parida, a small-time farmer and part-time Odia Paika. He was an ardent follower of the Goddess, and later became Sarala Das, the author of the Odia Mahabharata. At many points and on many occasions he calls Goddess Sarala as Durga, Aparna, Parvati, Narayani, Bhavani, Mahalakshmi, Mahakali, Katyayani, Mahasaraswati, Chandi, Ugratara, Bhairavi, Bhagavati, Mangala, Hingula, Tripura, Vasuli, Barati, Maha Yogeswari, Tarini, Ambika, Charchika, Kamala, Parama Vaisnavi and Maheswari etc. The current temple is approximately 500 years old, and was built by the Raja of Manijanga. The remnants of the old temple are not visible, but folklore suggests that it was sited at Badasarol, where a temple to Ganesha now stands. Many festivals are celebrated in the temple, including Parbana, Sharadiya Utsav, Pana Sankranti, Dola Purnima, and Chandan Jatra. The people of the Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack districts are so attached to the goddess that they make it a point to visit the temple at least once per year. Significance The Maa Sarala temple is one of the most historically significant expressions of Shaktism. It is believed that the temple in the village of Sarala (Kanakapur) of the Jagatsinghpur district, on the eastern coast of India represents Goddess Sarala's heavenly abode. The goddess herself represents a synthesis of the divine figures of Durga and Matangi. The sanctum sanctorum of the main temple contains three idols of the goddess. The main idol, carved out of stone, is an eight-armed figure of the goddess with her right foot on a lion, in the classic posture of Durga destroying the demon Mahishasura. She holds a sword (khadga), trident (trishul), manuscript (pustak) and lute or veena in her right hands and a disk (pattisha), bow (karmuka), bell (ghanta) and the head of the demon in her left hands. The second idol is four-armed, holding a conch shell (shankha) and a chakram, and making gestures of gift giving (varadamudra) and fearlessness (abhayamudra). The third idol is two-armed, made out of eight precious metals (ashtadhatu). The idols are taken out of the temple for different ceremonial occasions. Temple Historical evidence suggests that the original temple was constructed during the Bhauma-Kara in the 8th century. The Goddess Maa Sarala was worshiped in this temple till the end of Hindu rule in 1568 A.D. In 1568 AD the Supreme Commander of the Muslim army Kalapahada of Bengali Sultan Suleman Karani raided the original shrine and partly destroyed the Shakti temple. A hundred years later, during the reign of Moghul emperor Aurangzeb, the old temple was completely destroyed. The ruined temple was renovated in 1982 and is now dedicated to the worship of Lord Ganesh under the patronage of the Sarala Trust. Some important ceremonies are still observed in the old shrine. The processional idol ‚ÄúChalanti Vigraha‚Äù of Sharala is brought in a gorgeous palanquin from the present temple to the old temple seven times in a year to commemorate the ancient rituals. The idol of the deity is ceremoniously installed on the old throne where she had been worshiped for centuries. A male goat was traditionally sacrificed at the old temple in a panchayatana puja as the last ritual during the festival of Dussehra. The new year festival, Pana Sankranti, is the most important festival, when devotees dance on fire to complete their vow to the goddess. The festival of Dol Purnima is also observed with pomp and ceremony. At this festival Goddess Sarala is worshipped along with other deities, signifying that Maa Sarala is an amalgamation of parts of the Vedic, Tantric and Vaishnavic traditions. The present temple was constructed during the Maratha Empire, between 1753 and 1803. In 1863 the Law Commission of India passed the Religious Endowments Act, bringing many religious establishments under the control of the government for the first time in the history of India. The Act provided for trustees selected by the local District Judge to administer the Temple. Although there were many positive provisions in the Act, a significant flaw was that trustees were appointed for life. As the Sarala Temple was inconveniently located, it quickly became neglected. In 1928, following complaints about the mismanagement of the temple, the Cuttack District Judge nominated Ray Bahadur Chintamani Acharya and Choudhury Brajanath Mishra of Veda village as members of the Board of Trustees of the Sarala Temple. Acharya and Mishra improved the administration of the temple significantly. In particular, Acharya developed a system to allow donations of pilgrims to be used directly by the Temple, including a method for sharing donations with local hereditary administrators. He was later able to create a by-law for the temple that abolished the corrupt hereditary administration entirely. In 1939 the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act came into force and the responsibility of appointing trustees was transferred from the District Judge to an Endowment Commissioner. Trustees are appointed for five-year terms. =Location and accommodation= The temple is 20 minutes by road from Jagatsinghpur district headquarters. The nearest airport is Bhubaneshwar, which is approximately 80 km away. The nearest railway station is Rahama Railway Station. The temple is well served by buses from Cuttack. The Roads and Building (R&B;) Department of the Government of Odisha maintains a facility for overnight accommodation. The Water Resources Department also maintains a rest house near the temple. Religious history Tantric Shaktism began in the 7th century. Shaktism holds that the mother goddess (Matrushakti) is the source of power and of highest spiritual bliss. During the early Bhaumakar rule, in 736 A.D, the eight-armed Mahinsamardini Durga appeared in the sculptural masterpieces of Odisha. Some eight-armed Mahinsamardini idols found in other parts of Odisha in the 8th century resembled the Goddess Sarala. Archaeologists and scholars have concluded that the worship of the Goddess Sarala in Jhankad began during the 8th century CE. The worship of the goddess was popularized in the 15th century CE by the work of Sidheshwar Parida, a small-time farmer and part-time Oriya Paika. He was an ardent follower of the goddess, and later took the name Sarala Das, the servant of Maa Sarala. He became the foremost poet of Oriya literature, composing the great epics Oriya Mahabharata, Bilanka Ramayan, Chandipuran and Laxminarayan bachanika.[citation needed] He attributed the composition of these works to divine inspiration by the goddess. =Tantric culture= In the Oriya Mahabharata, the Goddess Sarala was popularly known as ‚ÄòSarola Chandi‚Äô. The worship of the goddess Sarala derives from the worship of Chandi in the Markandeya Purana. As described in the text, the goddess possesses Shiva's trident, Vishnu's Chakra, Vayu's bow, Surya's arrow, Vishwakarma's Axe. Indra's thunder, Ayiravata's bell and Himavan's Lion. Sacred verses of this text are chanted at the Shrine daily. Tantric rituals are still in practice from time immemorial, including the daily offering of coconut water, cakes made of blackgram and different kinds of rice. Dancers also pay tribute to the goddess in the ghata nrutya. In the past, animal sacrifices were made on the occasion of Maha Ashtami, another tantric practice. The features present in the image of the goddess reflect an amalgamation of Matangi and Mahishamardini. =Attribution of entity as Saraswati= The aspect of the goddess Sarala known as VƒÅc devi is the eternal source of all wisdom, intelligence and inspiration. She personifies ‚ÄúBrahmavidya‚Äù, the mystic knowledge of the absolute. She is also known as Utkal Bharati, where Utkal signifies the state of Odisha and Bharati is one of the epithets of Saraswati and Tantrik Matangi, and Sharada, to signify that the substance of life and the power of knowledge are given by the goddess. =Legendary origin= In one legend, the goddess's origins date back to the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, Parashurama the Brahmin warrior. During his travels, Parashurama swam in the river Chandrabhaga and took a rest under a banyan tree. While meditating, he became aware of a power (Shakti) that had been hidden and desired to have self-expression. He recovered a shining stone (Parasmanisila), a form of glittering basalt, from underneath the earth and carved the divine image of the goddess with his arrow. The goddess was named Sarada, since her image was carved out by the arrow (Sara) of Parasurama.[citation needed] In another legend, Sati, the original source of power and the wife of Shiva, caused herself to be sacrificed in the fireplace because she could not tolerate humiliation of her husband by her father, Daksha. Out of grief and remorse, Lord Shiva started roaming relentlessly, holding her corpse on his shoulder. Fearing that the anger of Shiva might be detrimental for mankind, Lord Vishnu sliced her body into pieces using his great weapon wheel (the Sudarshana Chakra) and scattered pieces of her body over 51 places. Around each place where a part of her body landed there grew up a sacred place of worship of the mother goddess. According to the legend, the tongue of Sati fell in Jhankada. Festivals Maha Visuba Pana Sankranti: Some of the rituals performed at the temple are an amalgamation of the practices of different influential sects that have been adapted in the temple over a period of time. The Maha Visuba Pana Sankranti (Jhamu Yatra), otherwise known as the ‚Äúfire-walking festival‚Äù is one of the important festivals of the goddess. Sudra Sevaks belonging to the Roul caste wear picturesque costumes and dance bare-footed over burning charcoals. Some of the participants subsequently tour the nearby villages for nearly one month to spread the magnanimity of the goddess.www.maasarala.org: festival Durga Puja: In the autumn, the Durga Puja is observed from Mulastami to Mahastami. This is one of the greatest festivals in the Devi Peetha. Mahinsa Mardini Besa, Suna Besa and Kalika Nrutya are among the main attractions of the festival. Sodasa Upachara Puja takes place twice daily during this period. In the past, a buffalo was sacrificed on the prescribed day Mahastami (Sandhipuja), and a male goat sacrifice was performed before the ceremonial idol of the goddess on the day of Dussehra at the old shrine of the deity Sarola Grama. Chandan Yatra': Chandan Yatra begins on Akshaya Tritiya and is observed for 21 days. It is a unique festival of the Shakta Shrine as the deity is worshiped here as Parama Vaishnavi. In the text of Oriya Mahabharata Sarala Thakurani is described as Parama Vaishnavi. Nabanna Puja: The Nabanna occurs at the time of Odisha's harvesting season, in the first week of Agrahayana. Different types of foods are prepared for the deity, from the newly harvested crops and offered to the deity through Sodasa Upachara Puja. Many of the rituals show an influence of Jagannath culture and Vasihnavism. For example, in the Gamha Avisek the processional idol of the goddess is taken nine times round the temple, similar to the tradition at the Sri Jaganath Temple Puri. In accordance with Jagannath culture, Suniya in the month of Bhadrav is observed as a coronation ceremony of the Gajapati kings.

The name translates to Vi er ikke alene in Norwegian and in English. Sandemo is best known for her historical fantasy writing. The subject of this book is the guardian angels, known in the book as \\"helpers\\" or \\"guardian spirits\\". The following series of novels by Margit Sandemo, H√§xm√§staren is about this same subject matter. The message of the book is that everyone has, from as early as birth, at least one guardian angel, who stands by the prot√©g√©'s side all their life and appears only in dangerous situations. Usually, women have male and men have female guardian spirits. Sandemo claims to have visions. She believes that some people are born with that talent. She claims that her guardian spirit is a tall, light man called Virgil. She has known him since the age of eight. The bok explains how to tell a guardian angel from a ghost and how to contact one's own guardian angel. Sandemo claims that some people can access other people's guardian angels with metal pins, that people can send their guardian spirit a subtle request and that guardian spirits give answers via dreams, in the shape of a bird or a star. Vi √§r inte ensamma is based on letters from people whose lives guardian angels have effected.

It is located on the picturesque coastline of Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Island. The smaller communities of Port Caledonia and Schooner Pond are directly adjacent to the village proper, connected by a single strip of road called the Donkin Highway. Geography As part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Donkin is located 11 km east of the town of Glace Bay and 32 km east from the city of Sydney. The nearest village is Port Morien which is 10 km away. Donkin sits on the northeasternmost tip of Cape Breton, along the Marconi Trail which stretches from Glace Bay to Louisbourg. Its coastline offers scenery and several sandy beaches as well as vantage points for bird watching. It is not uncommon to spot whales, seals and other marine life from the shore as well as passing cargo ships and fishing boats. Name The community of Donkin was once known only as Dominion No. 6, after the Dominion Coal Company colliery that operated from 1904 to 1934. In an effort to correct errors in postal delivery (another community named Dominion is located nearby), the community was given its own name. In 1940, at a community meeting, the village was named Donkin, in honour of Hiram Donkin, who was the second general manager of the Dominion Coal Company and later became the Deputy Minister of Mines for Nova Scotia. History At the turn of the twentieth century, most families were settled in Schooner Pond. When the Dominion No. 6 colliery opened in 1904, people from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds came from all over the globe in search of work. The area saw active development with the construction of numerous mining buildings, homes and businesses. Businesses included a barbershop, post office, shoemaker, blacksmith, dry goods store, hardware store, a credit union and a farming goods store. Later, there was also a pool hall, taxi and movie theatre. The S&L; Railway provided daily transportation through 5 miles of the community. = Coal mining = Historically a coal mining area, Donkin has a colliery developed by the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO). One of the first mining operations in the area was in Schooner Pond in 1863, when the Acadia Mines opened and began production from the Emery coal seam. The coal was exported by ship until trains began to take coal to the docks at Sydney in 1874. In 1863, the Clyde Mine opened in the area now known as Port Caledonia. All mining operations in the area ceased after the miners' strike of 1925. After the mines closed, workers traveled to the Phalen and Lingan mines to continue working. During the early 1980s, there was a push to develop the coal deposits extending out under the Atlantic Ocean from large adits initiated on the coast. Large scale tunnel burrowing machines were used to provide access to these high quality coal fields. Numerous consultants worked on this job, including Golder Associates, which provided geotechnical consulting services regarding support and stability of the sub- oceanic mine from its offices in Mississauga, Ontario. The Devco mine operated for a few years before closing in mid-1990s. Donkin miners continued to do this work into the 1990s, until all DEVCO mines ceased operations in 2001. In 2006, the Swiss mining consortium Xstrata, the primary partner in the Donkin Coal Development Alliance, won the rights to develop the abandoned mine site. In December 2010, Stephen Harper announced that dredging of Sydney harbour would help allow Panamax sized vessels enter the new deepwater port. Nothing came of this development, however, and the mine was sold to the Cline Group in 2014. Kameron Coal Management Limited, a subsidiary of Cline Group, began operations in March 2017 with plans to mine a half-million tonnes in the first year, but initial testing found the conditions and geological formations to be more complex than anticipated. In November 2017, the company announced that some lay-offs were necessary, new machinery was needed and a new mining plan would have to be approved by the government. Production at the mine ended on March 30, 2020. Subsequently, residents complained of noise from the closed mine coming from fans in the mine's ventilation system that lacked silencers. Community profile =Services= The village's only school is the Donkin Elementary Junior High School. There is also a Canada Post Office, a branch of the Cape Breton Regional Library, and the #5 Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion with its active Ladies' Auxiliary. The community is served by a volunteer fire department with a ladies' auxiliary as well as three churches - St. Gregory's Roman Catholic Church, St. Luke's Anglican Church and St. Luke's United Church. There is no police station but the area is patrolled by the Cape Breton Regional Police. While there is one gas station/convenience store in Port Caledonia located next to the public beach, residents travel to Glace Bay for most of their shopping and recreation. =Economy= When the mines closed in Cape Breton, many moved away to find employment, while others re- trained and found work locally in construction, the lobster fishery and the call centre industry. This means that the majority of residents commute to work in the nearby towns and city. Currently, the community is experiencing significant out-migration of young families, with lack of jobs being a major contributing factor. In June 2015, the Cline Group, an American company that acquired the mine in 2014, began hiring workers as part of its efforts to reopen the mine. It is rumored that production will begin in Fall 2015 with a workforce of 90 to 120 individuals. Unfortunately it was announced on 30 March 2020 that due to ongoing trouble with rockfall, the mine was going to be closed and everyone laid off. =Culture= In recognition of its heritage and culture, the people of Donkin honour their past in a week-long celebration each July called the Coastal Days Heritage Festival. Approximately 1,600 participants enjoy events like baseball, horseshoe and dart tournaments, the William Hunter Sr. Road Race, variety and band concerts, sales, meals, dances, antique car shows and a parade. Donkin is a Block Parent Community. Its clubs include the Donkin Police Boys and Girls Club, Scouts Canada and Girl Guides of Canada, the Donkin Port Caledonia Rural Development Association, and the Queen Victoria Rebekah Lodge. Its oldest group is the Donkin Citizen's Brass Band, which was formed in 1919. Donkin residents have a strong history of involvement in sports. People can be seen playing sports on outdoor rinks, fields, the school's gymnasium and in the playground. Each year, the Labatt Vince Ryan Hockey Tournament draws a huge number of players and fans to raise funds for youth. =Notable residents= * Dave Amadio, NHL hockey player * Leo Amadio, retired hockey player and coach, member of the Nova Scotia Sports Hall of FameLeo Amadio, Nova Scotia Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2011, it had a population of 1,740. Sign on the green Village Sign The village sign was erected in the Queen's Silver Jubilee year and depicts the eight artesian wells that used to exist in the village, a bee skep commemorating a history of honey making, and rooks. History In the Domesday Book Harston is listed under the hundred of Thriplow, and has 29 households. Harston House Harston House is a historic private house in Harston. It was formerly known as Harston Hall. It is grade II* listed. Although the main building is seventeenth century parts of its structure date back to at least 1480 Roman tiles have been found in the grounds and in the foundations of Harston House, supporting a tradition that a property has stood on this land ever since Roman times. The house is noteworthy for its distinctive features of English architecture, including its original Tudor fireplace, original fine wooden panelling from the seventeenth century and its rare pilasters made of clunch. This is not to be confused with Harston House student accommodation at Addenbrooke's hospital. = Notable residents of Harston House = ;The Wale family Harston Hall was owned in the seventeenth century by the Wale family whose descendants included Thomas Wale, whose life and eighteenth-century personal papers constituted the book My Grandfather's Pocket Book. The Wale family were subsequently Lords of the Manor of the Tiptofts close by. ;The Long family Henrietta Long of Harston Hall During the second half of the nineteenth century the house was owned by William Long (died 1883), whose wife was Henrietta Bridge. Henrietta was the granddaughter of John Littel-Bridge and Margaret Hurrell. She was a direct descendant of Gregory Wale. One account of the Long family describes them thus: > \\"Sir. W. Graham Greene's mother came to the house in 1891 and soon > afterwards (1893) she bought it from the Longs after the death of Mrs. Long. > It had been in the hands of the Long family for some time and was known in > those days as the Long House of the Longs.

SR 218 turns south concurrent with US 31, passing east of Grissom Air Reserve Base, before SR 218 turns east, while US 31 continues south. After US 31 SR 218 enters Bunker Hill, making several sharp turns with in the town. Past Bunker Hill the road heads east passes through rural Miami County, before turning to become north-south for about half a mile. The road curves again to become east-west, before a curve where the road becomes north-south. Soon after becoming north-south the western segment of SR 218 end at an intersection with SR 19, near Santa Fe. =Eastern segment= The eastern segment begins at an intersection with SR 15, on the south edge of La Fontaine. SR 218 heads east passing through farmland in rural Wabash County. The road enters Huntington County and passes through a rural intersection with SR 105, followed soon after by an intersection with SR 9. Past SR 9, SR 218 has a concurrency with SR 5, the concurrency has an interchange with Interstate 69, before bending to become north-south. Soon after becoming north-south the road bends again to become northeast-southwest and enters Warren. In Warren the roadway crosses the Salamonie River, before SR 218 turning southeast, while SR 5 continues northeast. SR 218 heads southeast, leaving Warren, before bending to become east-west at the Huntington-Wells county line. The road forms the county line for a few mile, passing through an intersection with SR 3, before completely entering Wells County. In eastern Wells County SR 218 has an intersection with SR 1 before entering Adams County. SR 218 passes through a rural intersection with SR 116, before entering the town of Berne. In Berne the road is concurrent with Main Street and passes through an intersection with US 27 and the center of downtown Berne. East of Berne the road passes through rural farmland, before curving towards the southeast. The SR 218 designation ends at Ohio state line, while the roadway continues southeast, then east, as Ohio State Route 707. History SR 118 was designated between SR 5, south of Warren, and Ohio state line, along modern SR 218, between 1930 and 1932. On March 28, 1932, SR 218 was commissioned between SR 9 and SR 5, in Warren. Between late 1932 and early 1933 a state road was proposed from SR 25 to SR 21, now SR 19, along the modern route of SR 218. SR 218 was commissioned between US 31 and SR 21 in either 1933 or early 1934. The road was extended west to US 35/SR 29, at the time US 35 was concurrent with SR 29, in between 1936 and 1937. SR 218 was commissioned between SR 25 and US 35/SR 29 in either 1938 or 1939. Between 1942 and 1945 SR 218 was rerouted south around Naval Air Station Bunker Hill, now Grissom Air Reserve Base. The segment of road between SR 15 and SR 9 was added in either 1952 or 1953. The road was rerouted north around Bunker Hill Air Force Base, now Grissom Air Reserve Base, onto its modern route, between 1957 and 1959. SR 218 was extended east to the Ohio state line, along the former route of SR 118, in either 1964 or 1965. The entire roadway was paved by 1970.

Biography Aldin Kuriƒá was born in Jajce, Bosnia and Herzegovina (which was then a part of SFR Yugoslavia, where he enrolled in elementary music school, Department of harmonics, simultaneously playing the piano and guitar. To this day he remains a multi- instrumentalist. At the age of sixteen he randomly got a tape of jazz fusion band Weather Report and decided to start learning bass guitar. He lived in Jajce until he was eighteen years old and then went into the army. He later studied medicine in Sarajevo. There he met many musicians, including many jazz musicians and played in many jam sessions in the city as a bass guitarist. At the same time, he fell deeply in love with Bosnia's traditional folk songs, Sevdah and started to play them under the name Al'Dino. He became well known by playing in prestigious Sarajevo restaurants and reveals another hidden love for singing. At the beginning of the Bosnian War, he went to Stuttgart, Germany and began playing bass guitar with Bosnian Stars: Dino Merlin, Hari Mata Hari, Halid Be≈°liƒá, Safet Isoviƒá, Haris D≈æinoviƒá, and many other pop and Bosnian folk singers, and simultaneously studied jazz and played with international musicians at clubs. He played as a \\"one man band\\" in German and Italian restaurants and sang in seven languages under the name Al'Dino. He returned to Bosnia in 1998 and recorded the first songs for his first solo album, Odlazi≈°. The title song became the first big hit in Bosnia. With this song he becomes popular. In 2002, Al'Dino released his second album titled Na drugoj adresi that also featured several hits, \\"Sanjam bolji svijet\\", \\"Sedam godina\\", \\"Sve ƒáe ovo jednom proƒái\\". His third album, Kopriva, was released in 2004 and is his biggest hit to date was the song of the same name, which crossed the borders of Bosnia, and became a hit in Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. Another song off of the album - \\"ƒåar≈°ija\\", is considered the anthem of Bosnian immigrants. The album Kopriva was proclaimed the album of the year and received the prestigious award \\"Davorin\\" at \\"Grand Prix\\" Radio Festival in Zenica, eight Bosnian music awards \\"Oscar popularity,\\" \\"Hit in 2007\\" in Serbia.

The line was officially opened on 9 May 1991, and InterCityExpress service began on 2 June. The Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed railway also opened at the same time. The line cost about DM 4.5 billion to build and has 15 tunnels and more than 90 bridges. Planning Planning for a new line between Mannheim and Stuttgart (the two largest cities of Baden-W√ºrttemberg) began in 1970. The railway lines that it replaced followed the terrain and followed rivers and valleys, resulting in steep gradients and sharp curves and thus not suitable for high- speed trains. The 1973 federal transport plan incorporated the following minimum requirements for mixed traffic to accommodate heavy, slow goods trains and light fast passenger trains: *maximum grade of 1.25% (occasionally 2.0%) *curves with small superelevation and minimum radii of 4,800 to 7,000 metres *maximum line speed of 250 to 300 km/h *average construction costs of 30 to 50 million DM per kilometre *point-to-point connections between two railway junctions. Region To fulfill these requirements, it was necessary to build a large number of structures such as bridges and tunnels. In addition, a new technology had to be pursued: the Forst Tunnel is under the water table for its entire length and required a new water-diverting technology. The Freudenstein Tunnel is through the porous rock strata, which flows as a result of heavy rains on the hillsides above it. That geological feature required expensive safeguards, which were used for the first time. A first planning statement for the Mannheim-Stuttgart route was published in 1974. The Federal Ministry of Transport issued the building permit in 1975, and construction commenced in 1976. More than 6,000 objections led to some route changes during the construction. The construction of some sections was at times completely halted. In seven places the protests of the nearby residents led to the building of cut and cover tunnels. The longest tunnel of this kind was the Pfingstberg tunnel, which leads through a forest, a declared water protection zone, near Mannheim-Rheinau. The route has a (comparatively low) maximum gradient of 12.5 per thousand with curves having a normal radius of 7,000 m and a minimum radius of 5,100 m. Rises are limited to a maximum of 80 mm. The design speed for ICE trains is 300 km/h and in places limited to 250 km/h. Cross-overs were provided for the planned operations mixing passenger and goods trains and for maintenance operations every five to seven kilometres. Planning for the entire route was not resolved until 1985. Construction The first section was completed on 31 May 1987 between the junction with the Rhine Railway in Mannheim and Graben-Neudorf.Eisenbahn-Journal Extra 1/2007, Die DB in den 80ern, S. 28; The last section to be completed was the second tube of the Freudenstein Tunnel, which was completed a few months before the opening of the entire line.Meldung Rohbauarbeiten am Freudensteintunnel beendet. In: Die Bundesbahn, Ausgabe 8 1990, S. 823 The commercial service commenced in 1991. Before the commencement of passenger operations two thousand training runs were undertaken to familiarise drivers with the technical characteristics of driving on high-speed lines, such as in-cab signalling and preventing the application of the emergency brakes.Konrad-H. Naue, Bringfried Belter: Endspurt f√ºr die Neubaustrecken Hannover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg und Mannheim-Stuttgart. In: Die Bundesbahn, Jahrgang 1990, Heft 10, S. 937‚Äì940 Operations The Mannheim-Stuttgart line was opened for commercial operations on 9 May 1991, and the first ICE operation on this route started on 2 June. The maximum speed was initially 250 km/h with 280 km/h permitted to overcome delays. The maximum speed is currently 250 km/h regardless of delays or not. The opening of the line reduced the travel time from Mannheim to Stuttgart from 90 to 44 minutes in 1991. By 2007, the travel time was reduced further to 35‚Äì38 minutes. Since its opening, the various ICE lines have been operating on this route: *line 11: Berlin Ostbf, Berlin Hbf, Berlin-Spandau, Braunschweig, Kassel Wilhelmsh√∂he, Fulda, Frankfurt/Main, Mannheim, Stuttgart, Ulm, Augsburg and M√ºnchen (departing every two hours each way) *line 22: Hamburg, Hanover, G√∂ttingen, Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he, Fulda, Frankfurt, Mannheim, Stuttgart, (departing every two hours, each way) *line 42: Amsterdam/Dortmund, Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, K√∂ln Hbf, Frankfurt Airport ‚Äì Mannheim Hbf, Stuttgart, Ulm, Augsburg and M√ºnchen (departing every two hours, each way) The trains travelling between Heidelberg and Karlsruhe (including TGVs) also use the northern section of this route, which connects at Rollenberg Junction. While the cross-overs were installed every five to seven kilometres to allow the goods trains operating on the same line and at the same time as the passenger train, they were relegated to operating at night while the passenger trains were not operating.

It was decided at the meeting that all IMLs would be awarded the same carnet and badge giving an internationally recognised identity. It also paves the way for other countries from around the world to join UIMLA setting a world standard for mountain leaders. The principal aims of UIMLA are: * To promote the profession of International Mountain Leader (IML) and to reinforce its identity beyond Europe; * To develop relationships between the professionals of various nationalities and to take part in the evolution of the IML training and qualifications; * To represent the profession at a European and international level. The UIMLA International Mountain Leader and the IFMGA Mountain Guide are the only internationally recognised qualifications for those leading groups in the mountains. Holders of these awards can also work in the UK's mountains. The International Mountain Leader Award is the professional qualification for individuals who wish to lead trekking parties to all mountain areas except on glaciers, and where the techniques or equipment of alpinism are required. The International Mountain Leader (IML) can also operate on easy snow-covered terrain, providing it is of a gentle, Nordic type in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù mountains. On successful completion of the full training and assessment programme, and by belonging to their recognised National Body, the individual will gain the full IML Award, a professional Carnet and Internationally recognised badge, giving them comparability with other IMLs worldwide.

History The hospital was founded by Edward Delafield and John Kearny Rodgers. In 1816, upon graduating from the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons and completing their training at New York Hospital, the two native New Yorkers traveled to Europe to continue their medical studies. It was during their studies at the London Eye Infirmary,Kara, Gerald B. \\"History of New York Eye & Ear Infirmary: One hundred fifty years of continuous service\\" New York State Journal of Medicine (December 1, 1973) later famed as the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (Moorfields) that Rodgers and Delafield realized how little attention ophthalmology received in the Americas and set about to change that. Upon their return to New York in 1818, they made the first survey of eye diseases in city. Finding a glaring lack of eye care provided to the poor, except in dire circumstances, and little interest in the medical community or city authorities in offering competent eye care, Delafield and Rodgers opened the New York Eye Infirmary. Founded on August 14, 1820, the first Infirmary was located at 45 Chatham Street (which is now 83 Park Row), across from City Hall and near the Five Points neighborhood. On April 21, 1821, the first bylaws and rules and regulations were drawn up, and a Board of Directors, called \\"The Society of the New York Eye Infirmary,\\" was formed. Early supporters of the Infirmary included prominent New Yorkers such as Colonel William Few - who became the first President of the Infirmary Board from 1821 to 1828, Philip Hone, Benjamin Strong and David Hosack - the founder of Bellevue Hospital, who contributed funds and helped raise money for the fledgling clinic. The hospital was incorporated by the New York State Legislature on March 22, 1822. It received three Magnet awards (Magnet Recognition Program¬Æ) from he American Nurses Credentialing Center, an organization that recognizes excellent nursing performance. In 2009, it received the first Magnet award ever given to a specialized hospital. = Notable faculty and alumni = * Colonel William Few, first president of New York Eye Infirmary and a signer of the U.S. Constitution * Dr. David Kearny McDonogh, NYEE alumnus and first African- American ophthalmologist * Dr. Cornelius Agnew, an NYEE alumnus, was a founding member, New York Ophthalmological Society (1864); Clinic for the Diseases of the Eye and Ear at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons (1866); Brooklyn Eye and Ear Hospital (1868); Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital (1869) * Dr. Henry D.

The band was formed as Point Blank in 1988 by blue-collar friends Ted, Mario & Kevin changing their name to Empty Stares with the addition of Randy and Tom soon after meeting in 1990 at Cardinal Dougherty High School located in Philadelphia, PA. The self-financed \\"To One His Own\\" was released in 1992, but after graduating in 1993, and a reworking of their sound, they were signed to Shangri-la Records. Their dynamic of melodic alternative rock that occasionally expanded into full-blown trance nu-metal mode, complete with lyrics that strike a grim tone on life, was evident on the highly successful Shangri-la Records Release \\"for...\\", where spiritual overtones were also present. This earned Empty Stares a management contract with Buzz Trip and a booking contract with Bay Ridge Talent, New York City and extensive touring with the likes of Anthrax, Clutch, The Misfits, Life of Agony, Type O Negative and Gwar.

Retrieved January 10, 2014. Plot Joan Prescott (Joan Crawford) is a vacuous and flirtatious daughter of the wealthy Montana rancher, John Prescott (Lloyd Ingraham). On the train, Joan's sister, Elizabeth (Dorothy Sebastian) tells her she's in love with Jeff (Ricardo Cortez). Jeff is more smitten with Joan, and kisses her. Joan then impulsively gets off at the next whistle stop, where she meets Larry (Johnny Mack Brown), a Texas cowboy. He is a rancher on John Prescott's land, and does not know who Joan is. He expresses dismay at how spoiled Prescott's daughters are. Joan conceals her identity, refusing to say her name. She tells him to think of something he loves and call her that, and he chooses \\"Montana\\". Joan and Larry fall for one another, and are married. When they return to her father's ranch, the couple are nervous that he will not approve of the pairing. However, to their surprise, John Prescott is delighted for the couple, and believes that Larry is the kind of person who can finally settle Joan. At their party, celebrating their nuptials, Joan sees Jeff, with whom Joan does a daring dance. As they finish dancing, Joan and Jeff share a lingering kiss. After Jeff and Larry come to blows, Joan is embarrassed that Larry resorted to violence. As Joan became familiar with Larry's posse of cowboy friends, she wants Larry to be accustomed to her group of highbrow city friends who are in Montana with John Prescott. She wants to go back to New York, where the couple can live comfortably, but Larry feels it is his duty as a husband to provide for his wife, and having her father take care of him is not an option. Later at another party, Larry catches Jeff trying to make another move on Joan, and the married couple get into a fight. In a fit of rage, she tells Larry that marrying him was the greatest mistake of her life, and tells him to leave her alone. As he is walking away, she realizes her mistake and begs to be forgiven, but he rebuffs her. Even John Prescott advises him to forgive her, but Larry sees too many differences between the two to make the marriage work. With the marriage over, and Larry refusing to speak to Joan, the Prescotts‚ÄîJoan in tow‚Äîdecide to take the train back to New York.

However, the whole robbery is a ruse, and one of the masked cowboys is Larry, who has come to take Joan back to their new life.

Reed - Train Porter Production As opposed to filming in Monument Valley or in California's Sierra Nevadas, director Malcolm St. Clair sent the cast to Montana for location shooting. The change in scenery and remoteness of the location helped create a strong sense of cohesion among the cast and crew, who spent most of their off hours together playing games and rehearsing scenes. Because of delays in getting the script through the Production Code Administration, the film was completed before any requisite changes were requested to get the film past local censors. By the time St. Clair got the lengthy list of cuts, it was too late to go back to Montana and re-shoot the necessary scenes. For instance, all shots of drinking be had to be eliminated since the country was still under Prohibition. This meant that both scenes from the wedding celebration in which people were shown drinking in the background and scenes in which Joan gets tipsy at her own wedding had to be cut. Unfortunately, those scenes explained Joan's flirtatious behavior with Jeff; so, instead of seeming innocently drunk, the character comes off as promiscuous.

Written during the last weeks of the composer's short life, it was only properly identified in the 1970s. It has been orchestrated by Brian Newbould in a completion that has subsequently been performed, published and recorded. Contemporary history The sketch appears to date from the last weeks of the composer's life, in October‚ÄìNovember 1828, and is presumed to be the Last Symphony (Letzte Symphonie) mentioned by his friend Eduard von Bauernfeld in an appreciation of Schubert published in the Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr Kunst, Literatur, Theater und Mode for 13 June 1829.Brian Newbould, Schubert and the Symphony, p. 298. The music of the symphony appears to some extent exploratory and contains unusual elements, notably the hybrid form of the third movement and the highly contrapuntal nature of much of the material. Sketches for the third movement are intermingled with several counterpoint exercises, which suggests that it is related in some way to the single counterpoint lesson Schubert took from Simon Sechter a few weeks before his death in 1828. Extant material of every movement The sketches are written on two staves, with voice leading, and harmonies ranging from complete to partly indicated. The manuscript contains about 30 instrumental indications, confirming that the intended orchestra was similar in size to the eighth and ninth symphonies, with a trio of trombones. The manuscript contains sketches of three movements, each one in different time signatures. Scholars agree that the second movement is virtually completed, while the two outer movements are in less completed form. According to composer, conductor and Schubert expert Brian Newbould, the second and third movements are complete in the sketches, with the first only lacking the recapitulation. =First movement= Allegro maestoso in D major, Beginning of the first movement in Schubert's manuscript. In the exposition of this sonata form movement, the composer crossed out the first subject group and the transition, and wrote a revised version in a separate page. To avoid confusions, it was labeled Anfang (\\"beginning\\"). For the first movement, in sonata form, Schubert wrote the full exposition; however, he then crossed out the first theme group and the transition and rewrote them on the following page; these lead to the second theme as written in the first draft. After ending the exposition in several A major cadences, the tempo changes from Allegro maestoso to Andante, and the new key of B minor is established. This new section, acting as an unconventional development, presents a solemn chorale-like variation of the second subject played by the trombones. According to Newbould, the whole development is written out, but there is no recapitulation. Actually, many sketches of Schubert's finished works lack the recapitulation (like his last piano sonatas), due to it being mostly a partially transposed repetition of the exposition.Stephen E. Carlton, Schubert's Working Methods, pp. 230‚Äì231, 258; Robert Winter, ‚ÄúPaper Studies and the Future of Schubert Research‚Äù, pp. 252‚Äì223; M. J. E. Brown, ‚ÄúDrafting the Masterpiece‚Äù, pp. 21‚Äì28. After this, a series of short \\"modules\\" marked Presto serve as sketches for the coda of the movement. =Second movement= Andante in B minor, 653x653px The second movement, whose lyricism is reminiscent of the composer's Winterreise, as well as foreshadowing Mahler's Kindertotenlieder, is also laid out in sonata form.Newbould, p. 264. In the sketch, Schubert crossed out the coda, despite no apparent falling-off quality. Also, a haunting (in Newbould's words) F major melody at the end of the second subject group of the exposition does not reappear later in the movement (it had been added as an afterthought in another page, apparently after discarding the coda). Newbould claims that the F major melody was \\"too beautiful\\" to be heard only once, and that Schubert's intention was to repeat it in the recapitulation (in the tonic major, B major) before the coda (as expected in sonata form), but that he left those details aside and he began the third movement instead. =Third movement= Scherzo (Allegro moderato in Newbould's edition) in D major, Last 4 measures of the third movement, featuring the motif that opened it (notice the end barline). While being made up of several unordered sections, in Newbould's opinion, the movement is complete. The third movement was at first labelled \\"scherzo\\", despite being in . After a writing a few measures, Schubert left it aside, instead filling the page with counterpoint exercises testing the compatibility of the elements, in order to give the original opening a logical continuation. On another page, the movement is started again, this time materializing into a complete movement that became the finale of the symphony (according to Newbould). The movement is unconventional, either as a scherzo or as a finale. What was intended as the trio of a scherzo in ternary form in the first draft, became an episode later, while the piece was reshaped into a rondo. The movement is riddled with counterpoint (canons, invertible counterpoint, fugato, augmentation), and the two main themes (the original \\"scherzo\\" and \\"trio\\" themes) are superimposed at the end of the symphony. According to Newbould, several middle-sized sections of the movement have to be reshuffled in order to understand the movement, and that two of them were discarded (despite not explicitly deleted in the manuscript) as their material or function was overtaken by other. Newbould's completion According to Newbould, the exposition and development of the first movement are completely written out, so the recapitulation is based on the exposition, with the pertinent transpositions. Only 11 bars based on earlier transitional material or composed by Newbould were added. As for the coda, his reconstruction became more speculative, but Schubert left a series of modules marked presto which left the overall plan clear. In his opinion, the composer left enough clues so as to decide the correct order of the modules. For the second movement, Newbould repeated the F major melody (this time in the tonic, B) at the end of the recapitulation, in analogy to the exposition. He also used the coda that Schubert had discarded, since in his view, it had been crossed out in order to restate the melody before. For the third movement, Newbould reshuffled some sections (as they were not in order in his view), and discarded two of them, which in his opinion had been discarded by Schubert (despite no explicit deletion in the manuscript) as their material or function was overtaken by other sections. =Bartholom√©e's additions= Belgian conductor Pierre Bartholom√©e viewed Newbould's completion as too respectful and conservative. Subsequently, he reharmonized parts of it to fit his idea of Schubert's late style, and gave more development to contrapuntal entries only indicated in the manuscript. He also gave the winds more prominent roles. He also adds the scherzo from the D 708A symphonic fragment as the third movement. In this aspect, Bartholom√©e's edition is debatable as the fragment seems to have been conceived by Schubert in a three-movement form, with the third movement combining elements of a Scherzo and a Rondo. Additionally, Bartholom√©e did not respect the instruments available at Schubert's time, when he wrote for chromatic horns and trumpets.

Diesel engines of the period were unreliable and not very powerful so steam turbines were proposed instead to meet the RN's requirement. Swordfish proved to be slower than designed and unstable while surfacing, and consequently she was modified as an anti-submarine patrol vessel in 1917. She was paid off before the end of the war and sold for scrapping in 1922. Design HMS Swordfish was developed to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of . Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attach√© in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.Maber, pp. 154‚Äì55 Fiat- San Giorgio \\"was wary about using heavy oil diesel engines and hesitated to guarantee the success of such engines of the power required. At the same time Laurenti prepared a design with geared steam turbines having a speed of 18 knots on a surface displacement of 856 tons.\\"Harrison, Section 7.11 His design was modified by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Greenock, to include guns. Swordfish kept the same main dimensions as Laurenti's original design, but had a greater displacement and less endurance. Description Swordfish had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of . She displaced on the surface and submerged. She had a partial double hull, which extended over 75% of her length. The upper portion of the double hull was controlled free-flooding while the rest was devoted to watertight 'baling flats', ballast and fuel tanks. Her hull was divided into eight compartments by seven watertight bulkheads.Harrison, Section 7.12 Swordfishs diving depth and time are not known because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, retracting the funnel and sealing the boiler uptake required about a minute and a quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of the ship.Mader, p. 159 =Propulsion= Swordfish had two Parsons geared impulse-reaction steam turbine sets, each driving one of the two propeller shafts. The turbines were powered by a single Yarrow-type boiler. They were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of which used a superheater to increase the working temperature by . She was fitted with two electric motors which had a combined output of . Two battery rooms each had 64 battery cells. It is uncertain if the ship reached her designed speed of on the surface, although it seems unlikely given her increased displacement over Laurenti's original design. Maximum speed was underwater.Mader, pp. 155, 158 Swordfish could carry of fuel oil, which her builders estimated gave her an endurance of at a speed of on the surface. On her batteries her submerged endurance was at a speed of . =Armament= Swordfish had two tubes for torpedoes in her bow. They were stepped vertically and positioned well back from the stem in a notch from the keel to preserve the fine lines of the bow. Two torpedo tubes were positioned on each beam amidships. Each torpedo tube was provided with one reload. Two gunsThe exact type of 3-inch gun is unknown. were fitted on the deck in disappearing mounts, one each fore and aft of the conning tower. They were covered by watertight hoods to preserve the streamlining of the submarine. Construction and service Swordfish was ordered from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on 18 August 1913 although she was not laid down until 28 February 1914. The start of the First World War six months later greatly hindered her completion, and she was not launched until 18 March 1916.Mader, p. 158 HMS Swordfish was commissioned on 28 April 1916, before completion, and renamed HMS S1 that same day. She was not completed until 21 July.Harrison, Section 7.20 Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials lasted for five months as she was used to evaluate steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with the fact that she was too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.Turrini, p. 146 In July 1917 S1 reverted to her original name and was converted to a surface patrol vessel between 27 June 1917 and 24 January 1918. Her torpedo tubes and disappearing guns were removed. She was given a forecastle, a bridge and her funnel was fixed in place and extended. She was rearmed with a pair of 12-pounderThe exact model of 12-pounder fitted is unknown. () guns and depth charges, weapons more suitable for her new role as an anti-submarine patrol boat. Swordfish joined the 1st Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth upon completion of her sea trials, but nothing is known of her subsequent service. Swordfish was paid off on 30 October 1918 and stricken from the Navy List by January 1919. She was sold for scrapping to Pounds, of Portsmouth in July 1922, but was reported to have been resold to Hayes, of Porthcawl in 1923.Colledge, p. 341 Notes Footnotes References   Category:Submarines of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1916 ships Category:World War I submarines of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Swordfish (1916)"},{"id":"11567308","text":"Feh√©rt√≥ is a village in Gy≈ër-Moson-Sopron county, Hungary.

The title of the feature film, Good Morning, Night, is taken from a poem by Emily Dickinson. The plot is freely adapted from the 1988 book The Prisoner by the former brigadeist Anna Laura Braghetti, which tells of the 1978 kidnapping, detention and murder of Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades.  Plot  A small group of terrorists of the Red Brigades rent an apartment. They kidnap Aldo Moro, former prime minister of Italy and leader of the Democrazia Cristiana (Christian democracy) party. Moro writes many letters to politicians, Pope Paul VI, and his family, but the Italian government refuses to negotiate. A female member of the group, played by Maya Sansa, suffers doubts about the plan.  Cast  * Maya Sansa - Chiara * Luigi Lo Cascio - Mariano * Roberto Herlitzka - Aldo Moro * Paolo Briguglia - Enzo * Pier Giorgio Bellocchio - Ernesto * Giovanni Calcagno - Primo * Giulio Bosetti - Pope Paul VI  Production  Bellocchio had already directed a documentary, in 1995, about the Red Brigades and the kidnapping of Aldo Moro. It was entitled Sogni infranti (Broken Dreams). The title of the film comes from the poem Good morning, midnight by Emily Dickinson, in the 2001 Italian translation by the poet and novelist Nicola Gardini, who first used the form ¬´Buongiorno, notte¬ª. The film was produced by Filmalbatros and Rai Cinema in collaboration with Sky Italia, and distributed in theaters by 01 Distribution. It was recognized as being of national cultural interest by the Directorate General for Cinema of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, based on the ministerial resolution of 17 June 2002.  Soundtrack  The original music of the film was composed by Riccardo Giagni. The film's soundtrack also includes compositions by Franz Schubert, Giuseppe Verdi and Jacques Offenbach, as well as two of the most famous songs by Pink Floyd, The Great Gig in the Sky and Shine On You Crazy Diamond - for example, while Chiara sees on television the images of the partisans shot by the Nazis, while reading the Letters of condemned to death of the Italian Resistance (September 8, 1943 - April 25, 1945) - the latter also used in the trailer; The song that the former partisans sing is, instead, Fischia il vento.  Reality and fiction  In addition to the book by Anna Laura Braghetti, the director took inspiration from other sources; for example, the sentence pronounced by the leader of the brigadists, Mariano, to motivate his followers, namely that the imminent killing of Moro \\"is the highest act of humanity possible in a society divided into classes\\", is taken directly from a press release on May 10 in the courtroom at the La Marmora barracks in Turin, by the imprisoned founders of the BR, Renato Curcio and Alberto Franceschini: ¬´...This is why we claim that the revolutionary act of justice exercised by the Red Brigades against the criminal Politician Aldo Moro, (...), is the highest act of humanity possible for the communist and revolutionary proletarians, in this class-divided society¬ª.  Reception  The film was selected for competition in September 2003 at the 60th Venice International Film Festival, receiving significant critical acclaim, and was also appreciated by the relatives of Aldo Moro. At the same time, the film was released in cinemas, becoming the highest grossing film ever made by Marco Bellocchio at the cinema, with around 4,000,000 euros in Cinetel revenue. Some former Red Brigades, such as Morucci and Gallinari, said they had seen the film; the former also expressed a moderate appreciation: \\"His friends denied the authenticity of his letters while some of us, in reading them, we were associating them with those of the condemned to death of the Resistance. This is underlined by the film, and it is really true. It was a shocking thing.\\"  Controversy  Although the film was seen as a favorite to win the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival, its only significant award was for the screenplay, arousing much controversy among experts; the director Marco Bellocchio, disappointed, abandoned the event, delegating to the actor Luigi Lo Cascio the task of collecting the prize. Following the statements of the jury president Mario Monicelli, which corroborated the motivations that had not convinced the jurors to assign the maximum recognition to the film (\\"it was impossible to convince foreigners ... this film was not up to its precedent, My Mother's Smile\\"), Rai Cinema announced in protest that it no longer wanted to participate in the Show: a declaration right after following a meeting between the then president of the Venice Biennale, Franco Bernab√®, and the CEO of Rai Cinema Giancarlo Leone.

Entertainment career Callinan has performed in many mediums, including TV, film, radio and live stand-up. In 2006, Callinan presented a live comedy show as part of the Melbourne Comedy Festival about his fertility problems entitled Damian Callinan has Spaznuts. That year he also debuted Babysitting, casting himself as a babysitter caring for a giant baby. In his show Sportsman's Night, Callinan, with no props, performed every role in a story about a football club gathering. He's also performed several other solo comedy shows: Damian Callinan Calls \\"Last Drinks\\", Eureka Stocktake, The Cave To The Rave: The Story of Dance and Speech Night. In 2007, he appeared in a stage show called The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged alongside Frank Woodley and Keith Adams. In 2008, he played Pete Minotti in the City Homicides \\"Somersaulting Dogs\\". Callinan appeared in the 2013 film Backyard Ashes, directed by Mark Grentell. Callinan's show The Merger was commissioned by Regional Arts Victoria and Vic Health to deal with issues of racism in regional communities. Callinan began performing the show in 2010. The show tells the story of a struggling country football club that recruits newly arrived refugees to fill its playing roster. In 2015, Callinan began writing a screenplay adaption of The Merger, funded by two grants from Screen NSW. In March 2015 Callinan took his show The Lost WWI Diary to the Adelaide Fringe Festival. The show, a black humour comedy based on a diary discovered in a Warrnambool op-shop, featured characterisations of ANZAC soldiers at the time of the Gallipoli Campaign. A Fairfax Media reviewer who saw the show in Sydney in 2014, Craig Platt, noted the show managed to be both irreverent and reverent, but suggested it could have taken more risks to bring something new to the Gallipoli story. News Corp Australia reviewer Nick Richardson was impressed by the show's realism. Callinan launched his twelfth solo show, Swing Man at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2016. A Herald Sun reviewer who saw the show in March 2016, James Wigney, wrote that the show was an affectionate insight into Callinan's Catholic country childhood and the world of swing dance. In 2017 the one man stage show titled The Merger received funding from Screen NSW Australia and Backyard Ashes director Mark Grentell reteamed with Callinan to helm the film The Merger which is being released nationally around Australia in 2018.

The taluk of Thirukurungudi is Nanguneri and it belongs to Nanguneri Assembly. At the foothills of the Western Ghats and 40 km to the North of kanyakumari and about 120 km from Thiruvananthapuram the capital city of Kerala, Thirukurungudi is a village with history dating back more than 1500 years. Village life revolves around agriculture and the Nambi Rayar temple. It is one of the 108 Divya desams, Hindu temples that are sacred for the Vaishnavites. Thirukurungudi is the home town of the founder, T. V. Sundaram Iyengar of TVS Group. Rice was the major crop until 15 years ago as there was plenty of rainfall and the River Nambi fed the irrigation channels for almost 9 months a year. With advancement in technology to tap ground water and rain becoming scarce, plantains have become a major crop. Almost every household has something related to agriculture, either directly or through the Nambi Rayar temple. The tank in Thirukurungudi is the first place where pristine water from Western Ghats is stored and fed for agriculture through five canals. The pond is a biodiversity hotspot supporting various forms of life from fish, birds, insects, plants, toads and an occasional python. Thirukurungudi is approachable by road. Distance is 45 km from Tirunelveli, 15 km from Nanguneri (Vanamamalai) and 10 km from Valliyoor. Nambi Rayar temple is one of the \\"108 Divyadesams\\" of the Sri Vaishnavas. The temple is 2300 years old. The temple is located in the centre of the town flanked by four big Mada Veethis (Agraharams) and at the outer square by four broad and lengthy Ratha Veethis (Car Streets). The presiding deity of this Divya Desam was sung (Mangalasasanam) by four Azhwars, namely Thirumazhisai Piran, Nammalvar, Periazhwar and Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple has several unique sculptures. A Horse and an elephant sculpture are composed of ladies in a single granite stone. The walls of the temple resemble a big fort and the village has been formed around these walls in a very organized manner. The interiors of the main temple tower is covered with wood sculptures of teak depicting most of the deities as well as other secular scenes. There are five Nambis in this Kshetram. They are Ninra Nambi (Standing posture), Irundha Nambi (Sitting posture), Kidandha Nambi (Sleeping posture), Thiruparkadal Nambi and Thirumalai Nambi. Thiruparkadal Nambi Temple is located very near to the River Nambiyaru one km from the main temple. Thirumalai Nambi Temple is on the hills (Mahendragiri Mountain) 8 km from the main temple. In Tamil language the word \\"nambi\\" means personification of all virtuous and righteous qualities blended with beauty and grace. Demographics India census, Thirukarungudi had a population of 8871. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Thirukarungudi has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 66%. In Thirukarungudi, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Kaisika Puranam Thirukurungudi is a very ancient village referred in Varaha Purana and Brahmanda Purana. Kaisika Puranam is within Varaha Puranam and was narrated by Varaha Nainar (Third incarnation of Lord Mahavishnu) to Sri Bhoomi Devi. Nampaduvan (Madangar) was a great devotee of Lord Nambi, though he was born in a very low class society. He used to sing in praise of the Lord Nambi. One day, on Sukla Ekadasi night in the month of Karthigai (Vrichika masam), he was going to Temple crossing through a dense forest. He was encountered by a Brahma Rakshas (Demon) who was hungry for many days. On seeing Nampaduvan, Brahma Rakshas was very happy and told him that he wanted to eat him immediately. Nampaduvan was not terrified, but told Brahma Rakshas that he would finish his duty first, that is to sing in praise of Lord Nambi and would return without fail. Nampaduvan made many promises, but Rakshas was adamant. Ultimately Nampaduvan had made a promise that if he did not return, he would get the sin of those who equate Lord Maha Vishnu with other deities. On hearing this promise Brahma Rakshas was very much satisfied and allowed Nampaduvan to do his duty and return. After singing in praise of the Lord Nambi in the Ragam (tune) Kaisikam Nampaduvan was returning to see Rakshas. On the way Lord Nambi in the guise of an old man stopped Nampaduvan and asked him where he was going. Nampaduvan told the truth. The old man advised him to escape in some other route and not to get in the clutches of Rakshas. But Nampaduvan reiterated that he would not deviate from his promise. The old man showed his original image (Lord Nambi) and blessed Nampaduvan. Then Nampaduvan went to Rakshas and offered himself to be eaten by Rakshas. Rakshas was very much moved by the behaviour of Nampaduvan and told him that his hunger had vanished and prayed him to give the fruits of his song sung in the praise of Lord Nambi and persisted him several times. Nampaduvan did not budge an inch, but ultimately offered him the fruits of his song since Brahma Rakshas totally surrendered. After obtaining the fruits of the song, the sin of Rakshas disappeared suddenly and he got his original image. He worshiped Nampaduvan and thanked him by saying that he was a Brahmin by name Soma Sarma in his previous birth and because of some irregularities while performing yagna he was cursed to become a Brahma Rakshas and now he had been redeemed by Nampaduvan. This episode is being enacted in the Temple premises every year on the Ekadasi day of Sukla paksha Karthigai by the traditional performers who observe vratha for ten days. On the next day in the early morning of Dwadasi Kaisika Puranam is read out in front of Lord Nambi. Malai Nambi Koil View of Mala Nambi Temple Malai Nambi Koil is a beautiful mountain, 8 km from Thirukurungudi village. It is a small mountain where auto, two wheelers can be hired from the foot hill. There are few steps that will take to the temple entrance. Small waterfall makes devotees fresh before going to the temple. Lord Nambi with Bhoo Devi and Sri Devi shows grace on the devotees in standing posture. Mahendragiri Mountain Thirukurungkudi big pond. Mahendragiri Mountain near Thirukkurungudi has abundant medicinal herbs. This mountain is mentioned in the First Chapter of Srimad Valmiki Ramayanam Sundara Kandam. Hanuman while going to Sri Lanka in search of Seetha set his feet here and then travelled by sky route. There are many Siddha Purushas living in this mountain observing penance.

In 1588 it was undivided property of Count J√°nos Cseszneky and Andr√°s Farkas, later was in the hands of Cseszneky heirs. History The village is first mentioned in a 1237 decree where it is referred to as Tapan. Over time the name was shortened to its current form. According to another document from the end of the 13th century the village contained 195 houses however was nearly destroyed by fire in 1881. The town's name was formally registered as T√°p in 1898 and the village's current flag and crest was registered in 1992. As a result of land reform following World War I the land within the village was broken up into smaller parcels. In further land reform following World War II 621 families were allotted 1800 kilo-hectares. The 1950s saw the collectivization and privatization of the village's agricultural lands. Private land ownership was reinstated during the transition from socialism in 1993-1994 and the collective was replaced by a 20-member agricultural production cooperative. From 1969 to 1990 the village was administered by a regional council along with the neighboring villages Gyorasszonyf√° and T√°pszentmikl√≥s. Since January 1, 1990 the village has an independent, locally elected municipal government. Geography T√°p is a Hungarian village located just south of Gyor on the eastern side of the Pannonhalma (Sokor√≥) Hills. Lying at the edge of the Western Hungarian Plains and the beginning of the Bakony hills, the area around the village is a mix of steep forested hillsides and open meadow. Gyor is the nearest large city and can be reached directly by bus. The nearest train station is a few kilometers away in the neighbouring village of Gyorasszonyfa. Demographics The village has a current population of 745. The local elementary school, which also serves the children of Nyalka and P√°zmandfalu, is also located in the village. Agriculture dominates the local economy however many inhabitants commute to Gyor for work. Agriculture in the village consists of farming and livestock rearing facilities just outside the village limits. Culture Historic Lane and National Folk Monument Nestled in the hills of the village is a group of farm homes dating back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries with the oldest built in 1792. The homes are typical examples of central European adobe peasant homes with pole construction, thatched roofs, thick adobe walls and small windows. The fact they are grouped together makes this area unique and gives visitors a sense of what pheasant life would have been like in the 19th century. The area is made up of 11 plots and received National Monument status in the 1970s. The village owns 8 of the 11 original plots, these areas and buildings are administered by Attila Balogh. Over the years repeated attempts have been made to preserve and restore the buildings. Among the remaining buildings is one home fully furnished with artifacts from the era that serves as a folk museum. Spring Festival (Hegysor Tavasz) Since 1991 the lane is also the site of the village's annual spring festival which celebrates the villages history and Hungarian Folk culture. Generally held around Pentecost in late April or early May the festival features crafts, regional cuisine, contests, folk music, and folk dance groups.

He subsequently left the monastery in 1997. Career Ocampo signing copies of his books after giving a lecture at the Ayala Museum in 2016. =Writings= Looking Back column Ocampo began writing for Weekend Magazine, the Sunday supplement of the Philippine Daily Express in 1985 and subsequently joined its editorial staff as associate editor. His column Looking Back first appeared in the Philippine Daily Globe from 1987 to 1990 and compilations of these columns saw new life as his two bestselling books, namely, the Looking Back series and Rizal Without the Overcoat that was awarded the National Book Award for essay in 1990. At the invitation of Letty Jimenez Magsanoc and Eugenia D. Apostol, Ocampo's Daily Globe column moved to the Philippine Daily Inquirer in 1990, where it appears twice weekly in the Opinion-Editorial page. Since 1986, Ocampo has published over 44 books, as well as other publications, compilations of his essays and writings on Philippine history, arts and culture. Most of his published works have focused on the life and works of the Philippine nationalist and martyr, Jose Rizal with Rizal Without the Overcoat going into six editions since its first publication in 1990. He has vpublished monographs on other historical and cultural figures in Philippine history including musical composer Nicanor Abelardo, historian Teodoro Agoncillo and Teodora Alonso Realonda, the mother of Rizal, amongst others. Ocampo also writes on the foreign relations of the Philippines with France and Japan. He has written numerous articles on the diaries of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and was at work on a biography of former Philippine President Fidel Ramos. When Ocampo was appointed chairman of the National Historical Institute (present-day National Historical Commission of the Philippines) and later elected chair of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared that she was an ardent reader of his newspaper column, commending his writings because he \\"makes history so approachable.\\" Some academics have critiqued Ocampo for his populist approach towards historiography. In response, Ocampo has since released two compilations of his public lectures Meaning and History focused on Jose Rizal and Bones of Contention on Andres Bonifacio both published in 2001 with the required bibliographic references and footnotes. Nevertheless, Ocampo is considered as one of the most prominent Philippine historians. =Art historian and curator= Ocampo giving a lecture on Philippine collectors and stewardship at the Art Fair Philippines in 2018.

Several aspects of the play have led critics to treat it as a key development and a marker of the final decadent phase of English Renaissance drama. Performance Suckling's earliest play, Aglaura was staged in 1637 by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre  not because they thought it was a good play or a potential popular hit, but because Suckling subsidized its production, reportedly spending between ¬£300 and ¬£400. The acting company was paid with the production's lavish costumes (lace cuffs and ruffs made of cloth of silver and cloth of gold), a form of hand-me-down compensation that the King's men accepted only in the 1630s, at a time when the company's fortunes were in relative decline. (When the same company staged a revival of John Fletcher's The Faithful Shepherdess in 1634, they used the sumptuous costumes that had been created for Queen Henrietta Maria's masque of that year, The Shepherd's Paradise; they were then allowed to keep the costumes.) A 1638 production of Aglaura at the English royal court borrowed Inigo Jones's scenery from Luminalia, the Queen's masque of that year. Again, the hand-me- down nature of the proceedings is a noteworthy departure from the practices of the 1620s and earlier. Genre Unusually, Suckling wrote the play as a tragedy, but added an alternative happy ending, so creating an optional tragicomedy. Suckling changed the ending for the April 1638 performance before the King, Charles I, and Queen Henrietta Maria. Publication Aglaura was entered into the Stationers' Register on 18 April, 1638 and published later that year, in an edition printed by John Haviland for the bookseller Thomas Walkley  a vanity edition subsidized by Suckling. Instead of the quarto format then standard for individual plays, Aglaura was printed in the larger folio format, normally restricted for serious works. (Stage plays were then treated largely as ephemera with little claim as serious literature.) Critics  Richard BromeBrome wrote a satiric poem \\"Upon Aglaura in Folio\\". For Brome's hostility to Suckling, see: The Court Beggar. was prominent among them  mocked the folio edition of Aglaura, especially the unusually broad page margins that compensated for the limited text. (For modern readers, the pleasing innovation of the 1638 edition is that it abstained from the full and verbose titles fashionable in the 17th century, and employed a title of one word.) The play was reprinted by Humphrey Moseley in his octavo collection of Suckling's works, Fragmenta Aurea, in 1646 and 1648, and was included in subsequent collections. An early manuscript of the work also exists, in the collection of the British Museum (Royal MS. 18 C. 25). A modern facsimile edition of Aglaura was issued in 1970, reproduced from the copy in the collection of the British Museum. Inspiration Suckling may have based his heroine on a young woman named Mary Bulkeley, the daughter of Sir Richard Bulkeley. She was courted by the author, and is thought to have inspired him to write much of his best work.Madoc-Jones, pp. 196-203. In the Restoration Aglaura was revived during the Restoration era; it was reportedly played at the Red Bull Theatre on 27 February 1662, in the original version, \\"the tragical way.\\" Later that same year, the actor Theophilus Bird was said to have broken his leg while fencing onstage in a performance of Aglaura.Downes, p. 161. Samuel Pepys saw a King's Company production on 10 January 1668 (but he didn't like it). A Suckling lyric from the play, \\"Why so pale and wan, fond lover,\\" became a popular song of the era. John Dryden, an admirer of Suckling's verse, borrowed lines from Aglaura for his first comedy, The Wild Gallant. Sir Robert Howard was impressed with Suckling's dual ending, and imitated it in his own play The Vestal Virgin. Plot Suckling's plot is set in a wildly ahistorical and inauthentic Persia. The King of Persia and his son, Prince Thersames, are both in love with Aglaura; she loves the Prince, but the King takes precedence. The Queen, Orbella, is in love with the King's brother Ariaspes but is the mistress of Ziriff alias Zorannes, captain of the guard and Aglaura's brother. Iolas, a member of the royal council, is a pretended friend of the prince, but in fact a traitor; he is in love with Semanthe, who is in love with Ziriff. Complications ensue. (Semanthe loves Ziriff  but platonically. This is Suckling's nod to the cult of Platonic love that was a cornerstone of Henrietta Maria's Court culture. Suckling also includes an anti-Platonic lord named Orsames, but doesn't do much with the Platonic theme.) In the original tragic version, Aglaura secretly marries Thersames, but mistakenly stabs him to death, thinking he is the king. Most of the other characters, including Aglaura herself, die violent deaths. In the tragicomic revision, Aglaura merely wounds the prince, and the king repents and dispenses justice. (The actual difference between the versions amounts to only about 50 lines). Adaptation \\"Aglaura\\" adapted at Wikiversity Notes Sources * Downes, John. Roscius Anglicanus. 1708. Edited by the Rev.

The original Italian title is L'ora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre) (\\"The Hour of Religion (My Mother's Smile)\\"). Summary The film tells the story of a man whose \\"martyred\\" mother is in the process of canonization. She had been killed by her insane son, Egidio, while she slept. However, since this death would not count as \\"martyrdom\\", and would not qualify her for sainthood, the family is claiming she had been awake, begging her son to stop blaspheming, and that she had forgiven him before she died. The story is told from the perspective of her son Ernesto, a well-known painter and an atheist. The film portrays a colorful fresco so hypocritical to Catholicism today, showing how hard it still creeps into our lives, even against our will (as the protagonist shows). He often remembers for the delivery of a blasphemy explicit narrative tension at maximum (for this reason in Italy it was rated not suitable for kids who are less than 14 years old). Plot Ernesto Picciafuoco, painter and illustrator of children's tales, is a part of a very important but impoverished family, which wants to regain its stature by having a member canonized. ns. The late mother of the protagonist seems to be the only true religious person in the weak and stupid family. Two of the young rebels are now in the 40s and are completely detached from the hypocrisy of religion. One of them pretends to be very religious, to get back his job. The other, the protagonist, is uncertain, beset by moral doubts, mainly because of his young son who could learn the hypocrisy from him. The film is a journey through the absurd and surreal episodes. Ernesto, the protagonist, is contacted by a mysterious cardinal who wants to question him about the process of sanctification of the mother, about which he knew nothing until then. Then the child goes to school for the hearings with teachers, where he meets a young and charming, \\"religious teacher\\", to whom he is attracted, but that will be an impossibility. He has a discussion with a religious man appointed to investigate circumstances of \\"martyrdom\\", which asks account the non- baptism of his son, showing that he is well informed about him and trying to know why Ernest had \\"lost faith\\" . Ernesto is then challenged to a duel, for petty reasons, from a noble dream of an improbable restoration of the monarchy, but the duel is interrupted after a few seconds. He talks with his aunt, who has never shown much faith, but now, attracted by possible financial gain and popularity that the family would derive from sanctification, for a purely opportunistic attempt to bring her nephew on the \\"right path\\". Meanwhile, the wife of Ernesto administers a sort of baptism to the child sleeping, anxious to repair the previous \\"no\\".

The most notable landmark of the village is its 13th century church located at 8 Rohonc Street and named after the archangel Michael. Until as late as 1756 it was surrounded by a cemetery, however this has today been moved to a nearby hill. The church was used in the 17th century by Lutheran inhabitants, and later by Catholic believers. The high altar is decorated by the baroque statues of Saint John Nepomuk, Saint Joseph, Saint Anthony, and Saint Ignatius.

Origin of its name  The name \\"Bucsu\\" comes from the Hungarian name \\"Bulcs√∫\\". It is believed that the village was the winter residence of a 9th-century horka named Bulcs√∫ who occupied this region. History Part of the Roman aqueduct supplying water to ancient Savaria, unearthed at Bucsu. A shot of the Saint Michael Church and the historical center of the village. The history of human settlement in the area goes back at least to Roman times. Within the vicinity of Bucsu were discovered the remains of a Roman aqueduct that supplied Savaria (the Latin name of Szombathely) with drinking water from the mountainous village Bozsok and the town of Rohonc (today Rechnitz, Austria). The earliest written record of the village of Bucsu is found in documents from the medieval Hungarian archives of 1236 where it is called Bulchu.

Documents from the 15th century also mentioned it variously by the names \\"BwlchW\\" (1433) and \\"Bwcsw\\" (1485) In a 1796 work, scholar Andr√°s V√°lyi claimed a village 1.75 m√©rf√∂ld from Szombathely had in the past been variously named Bucsu, Bucsa, and Bucsina with the inhabitants belonging to more than one ethnic group and religion - the majority of whom were Hungarian and Roman Catholic. V√°lyi mentions that the landowner family, Vajda, owned a manor house during this period,Today the same building is used by the Hungarian border guard. and the lands surrounding the village produced several varieties of first class agricultural goods for sale by the residents, although it lacked vineyards. Scholar Elek F√©nyes wrote in 1851 that \\"Bucs\\" or \\"Butsing\\" was a Hungarian village 1 m√©rf√∂ld distant from Szombathely, with lands totaling 429 kath. and situated within the territorial boundaries of the town of K≈ëszeg. The non- Catholic population demographics were listed as 28 Jews and 6 Lutherans. F√©nyes mentions multiple mansions in the village and describes its plains areas as capable of producing good quality wheat. Non-agricultural areas of the village consisted mainly of forest, with grape imports grown on the hills of Rohonc (Rechnitz, Austria). Prominent landowners in the 19th century are listed by F√©nyes as Szab√≥, Sz√©ll, and Vajda. In an 1898 monograph Bucsu is described as \\"a nicely situated Hungarian village with 82 houses, 575 Roman Catholic and evangelical inhabitants.

Bucsu was the site of a camp for forced labourers during World War II until 28 March 1945. After the war the village was connected to the Hungarian electricity circuit. Because Bucsu was no longer considered an official frontier crossing place after 1953, the train between Szombathely and Pinkaf≈ë (Pinkafeld, Austria) that had been introduced in 1888 was stopped and the tracks were eliminated.

Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham. Elizabeth Conyngham (n√©e Denison), Marchioness Conyngham (31 July 1769 - 11 October 1861), was an English courtier and noblewoman. She was the last mistress of George IV of the United Kingdom.K. D. Reynolds, ‚ÄòConyngham , Elizabeth, Marchioness Conyngham (1769‚Äì1861)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004  Early life  She was born in 1769. Her father was Joseph Denison, owner of the Denbies estate in Surrey, who had made a fortune in banking. Her mother was Elizabeth Butler. On 5 July 1794, Elizabeth married Henry Conyngham, Viscount Conyngham, an Irish peer. Despite her beauty, she was considered vulgar, shrewd, greedy, and unsuited to aristocratic society on account of her common background; however, she attracted lovers and admirers, including the Tsarevitch of Russia, the future Nicholas I.  Royal mistress  Elizabeth, Countess Conyngham The Conynghams were not well-connected, but according to the Duke of Wellington, Elizabeth decided as early as 1806 to become a mistress of the Prince of Wales, the future King George IV. She probably became his lover in 1819, when he was Prince Regent, but finally supplanted her predecessor, Isabella Seymour-Conway, Marchioness of Hertford, after he became king in 1820. He became besotted with her, constantly \\"kissing her hand with a look of most devoted submission.\\" While his wife Caroline of Brunswick was on trial in 1820 as part of efforts to divorce her, the king could not be seen with Lady Conyngham and was consequently \\"bored and lonely.\\" During his coronation, George was constantly seen \\"nodding and winking\\" at her. Lady Conyngham's liaison with the king benefited her family. Her husband was raised to the rank of a marquess in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and sworn to the Privy Council, in the coronation honours of 1821. He was also given several other offices, including Lord Steward of the Household and the lieutenancy of Windsor Castle. Her second son was made Master of the Robes and First Groom of the Chamber. Lady Conyngham had Whiggish sympathies, but usually did not concern herself with political ambition; she concentrated rather on furthering the financial position of her family. But on one occasion, she requested that her son's tutor be made Canon of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and the prime minister, Lord Liverpool, threatened to resign over the matter. Arguments with Lady Castlereagh further worsened the relationship between the king and Lord Liverpool's government. She also disliked Benjamin Bloomfield, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and was successful in having him removed in 1822. His successor, William Knighton, was a close friend of the king who successfully cleared all his debts later in his reign. Dorothea Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador, dismissed her with contempt as having \\"not an idea in her head...not a word to say for herself...nothing but a hand to accept pearls and diamonds, and an enormous balcony to wear them on.\\"Hyde, Montgomery. The Strange Death of Lord Castlereagh William Heinemann 1959 p.82  Later life and death Portrait of Lady Elizabeth Conyngham, the Marchioness's daughter, commonly misidentified as the Marchioness herself. The portrait, painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence in the early 1820s, is in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon. Another portrait commonly misidentified as the Marchioness, called \\"Lady Elizabeth Conyngham\\" and attributed to Sir Thomas Lawrence. In fact it is a 1775 portrait of Mrs. Lowndes-Stone by Sir Thomas Gainsborough, also located in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon. As his life progressed, the king became dependent on Lady Conyngham on account of his temper and poor health. However weary she became of his company, his affection for her never ceased. The relationship came to an end with George's sudden death in 1830; she immediately moved from Windsor Castle to Paris. Although the king had bequeathed her all his plate and jewels, she refused the entire legacy. The marquess broke his staff of office at George's funeral and was never to hold another one in the next reign. Lady Conyngham lived until 1861, dying near Canterbury at the age of 92. Although she was excluded from court during the reigns of King William IV and Queen Victoria, her son Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham, was Lord Chamberlain to William. Along with William Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury, he brought the news of William's death to Princess Victoria and was the first to address her as Your Majesty. The 2nd Marquess's daughter, Jane Churchill, was later a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria and one of her closest friends.

Photograph of the village Dozmat from the East. Geography and setting The village can be found 8 km west of Szombathely, on the creek Arany. This region is called Alpokalja (Subalps) because of the vicinity of the Alp Mountains in Austria. The neighbouring villages are: Narda, Torony, Fels≈ëcsat√°r, and Bucsu. History In the vicinity of the village, a neolithic settlement was found. During the Hungarian arrival in the 8-9th century it was the place of the court of Bulcs√∫ and his servants. The church of the village was built in the 12th century and its patron was Saint George. The village is frequently mentioned in medieval charters: in 1269 as villa Duruzmot, in 1281 as Duruzomat, in 1291 as Durzumot, in 1333 as Dorzmat, in 1355 as Torndurzmata, in 1358 as Dorozmath, in 1416 as Eghazasdorozmath, in 1430 as Kysdorozmath, in 1466 as Dorsmath, in 1472 as Drozmath.

In 1690 the church was burned and it was renewed in the next decade, mostly in baroque style. However, recent architectural archaeology has revealed the old carvings of the western tower doorway.

He presided over Dubai during the end of the pearling boom and through the long and difficult recession that followed the collapse of the pearling market, transforming Dubai into an active trading hub which developed new markets and economic opportunities. Despite continuing a long tradition of liberal, trade-minded rulers, he faced pressure from a number of leading figures in Dubai to reform the governance of the town and was eventually forced to quell what became an active rebellion against his rule. In later life he ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son, Rashid.  Background  Saeed bin Maktoum was the son of Maktoum bin Hasher, who ruled Dubai from 1894 to 1906. Following Maktoum's death, his cousin Butti bin Suhail Al Maktoum ruled for eight years, before his own death in 1912. Aged 34 at his accession, Sheikh Saeed inherited a small but thriving trading port and a pearling centre which employed some 7,000 men in the seasonal trade. A simple man, Saeed travelled to hunt in the desert and was respected for his staunch Islamic values. Relations with neighbouring sheikhs were stable, as was Saeed's relationship with the British. The pearling industry was lucrative and trade was based on a lively re-export market, particularly to surrounding Arab sheikhdoms and Persia. Following the movement of merchants from Lingeh to Dubai in the early years of the 20th century, another migration took place with increasingly restrictive conditions for trade being experienced in Southern Persia. Many more merchants from the areas of Bastak and Lingeh moved to Dubai, where they were welcomed. A number had established businesses in Dubai but hadn't moved their families and, in the 1920s, many of these made the move to Dubai permanent. There had long been a trading relationship between Dubai and Bastak, with the latter being a major source of firewood for the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. = The collapse of the pearl trade = As this new influx of trading families took place, storm clouds were brewing over the pearling market. The Japanese cultured pearl, first a wonder shown at expos and other fairs, started to be produced in commercial quantities in the late 1920s. The influx of inexpensive, high quality pearls to world markets took place alongside the economic blight of the Great Depression. The result on the Persian Gulf's pearl markets was devastating. In 1929, 60 of Dubai's pearling boats (in 1907 there were 335 boats operating out of the port) stayed in port throughout the season. The complex system of financing that underpinned the pearling industry, the relationship between owners, pearl merchants, nakhudas (captains) and divers and pullers fell apart and left an increasingly large number of working men in the town facing destitution. A record number of slaves approached the British Agent seeking manumission, a reflection of the parlous state of the pearling fleet and its owners. In 1934, Sheikh Rashid concluded an agreement with Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue. He also signed a preliminary agreement for an oil concession (with British company Petroleum Concessions Ltd) on 22 May 1937, stipulating that local labour would have to be used in an effort to create employment for the people of Dubai. Alongside these efforts, Dubai's traders found new markets in Persia, trading sugar, tea, cloth, hides and even cement into the Persian mainland. Their increasing prosperity came a time when Dubai's traditional wealthy class, the pearl merchants and boat owners, faced penury. This led to growing tensions and rising discontent among some of the more influential families of the town.  Majlis  The Majlis movement of 1938 was a reflection of the discontent felt by a number of leading figures in Dubai, including members of the Maktoum family itself. In October 1938 the situation had deteriorated to the point where Dubai was split into two armed camps by its creek: Deira was held by the discontented members of the Al Bu Falasah and Bur Dubai by Sheikh Saeed and his followers. Following mediation by other Rulers and the British Political Agent, who travelled from Bahrain, on 20 October an agreement was signed establishing the Majlis, a consultative council of fifteen leading community members to be headed by Sheikh Saeed. The Majlis set up a number of Municipal bodies, including a Municipal Council and a Council of Merchants, as well as the post of Director of Education, taken by Sheikh Mana Al Maktoum. The Majlis wasn't only concerned with practical matters, however, but also sought to limit the Ruler's financial standing and call for political reform. Sheikh Saeed quickly became disconcerted with the Majlis process and recused himself from the meetings of the council. On 29 March 1939, the Majlis was dissolved when a number of its members were attacked by Bedouin attending his son's wedding in Deira.  Economic growth  Although he was to rule for a further 20 years, Saeed increasingly avoided political life and ceded the administration of Dubai to Sheikh Rashid, his son. It came to Rashid to implement many of the reforms the Majlis had called for and also to add his own impetus to the drive to develop and reform Dubai, transforming the small trading port into a modern city-state within a generation. By 1950, the British Residency was clearly at a loss to explain the source of Dubai's wealth, which had by now grown to be considerable: > \\"Dubai, in contrast with the moribund Sharjah eleven miles away, is a > flourishing town... there is already a business-like air around the place, > thanks to the Post Office, the bank, a branch of Messrs Gray, Mackenzie and > the offices of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited... to judge by > the prosperous appearance of the bazaar and by the lively atmosphere of the > whole town, its income, for a miniature port of perhaps eight to ten > thousand inhabitants must even today be considerable. The Sheikh and the > merchants give one the impression they are not dissatisfied with present > blessings and that they view the future hopefully.\\"\\"The Economy of Dubai and > Sharjah\\" Note from British Residency, Bahrain, 24 June 1950 In 1954 Dubai became a municipality.https://web.archive.org/web/20190516041329/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/ramadan- in-1954-dubai-became-a-municipality-and-godzilla-attacked-tokyo-1.861797 The increasing activities of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), which had secured a number of exploratory concessions in the area, meant increased economic activity and Dubai acted to accommodate the infrastructure required to take the opportunity. In 1954, Sir William Halcrow and Partners were brought in to survey the Creek and then the Overseas Ast Company carried out the dredging operation. Loans, the issue of 'Creek Bonds' and reselling the land reclaimed by the dredging operations all helped to pay for the operation, which took place through the end of 1958 and into 1959. By now Sheikh Saeed was elderly and infirm and the British were urging Sheikh Rashid to take over from his father, which he refused to do.  Family  Saeed married Sheikha Hessa bint Al Murr, the mother of all his children except his youngest child, Ahmed. Saeed married a second time to Sheikha Fatima bint Ahmed bin Suliman.  Death  Sheikh Saeed died early in the morning of 10 September 1958 at the age of 80 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum. Two months after Saeed's death, his second wife born a son, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, on 1 December of that year. Sheikh Ahmed today serves as Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline.

The film is a follow-up to Our Dancing Daughters (1928) and Our Modern Maidens (1929), which also starred Crawford, Page, and Sebastian. The two previous installments in the series were both silent films, while Our Blushing Brides is a sound film which was a relatively new aspect to motion pictures. The fact that it features audible dialogue was an advertising point mentioned on the movie poster. Our Blushing Brides is Crawford's thirty-first film (of eighty-six total), and her fourth sound film. In her first \\"shopgirl-Cinderella\\" role, Crawford plays the role of Gerry, a department store \\"mannequin\\" who falls in love with the wealthy son of her boss. The role was a departure from Crawford's flapper girl persona of the silent area as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer began to develop a more sophisticated image of her. Plot Fellow department store shopgirls and roommates Gerry March (Crawford), Connie Blair (Anita Page) and Franky Daniels (Dorothy Sebastian) take different paths in New York City, but all seek to marry wealthy men. Connie pursues an affair with David Jardine (Raymond Hackett), son of the department store owner. Meanwhile, Franky meets the slick-talking Marty Sanderson (John Miljan) when he comes into the store to buy $500 worth of blankets. However, when Sanderson comes to pick Franky up, he hits on Gerry instead. At the same time, Gerry has been constantly courted by the dashing Tony Jardine (Robert Montgomery), elder son of the store owner. He is used to getting what he wants, but when he invites her to visit the gardens on his estate alone. Gerry, who believes that virtue will be her only reward, rebuffs Tony and intimates that he is childish. Franky falls in love with Sanderson, who spoils her with diamonds and silk. Gerry is suspicious, especially when she finds them both drunk and has to lead Franky out. However, unbeknownst to them, Sanderson is the leader of a criminal gang that steals from department stores like the one the women work at. The police come to apprehend Franky, believing she is a part of the gang, but she knows nothing of it. Meanwhile, Connie is very happy with David and intends to marry him. However, she reads in the newspaper that David intends to marry the high- society Evelyn Woodforth (Martha Sleeper). She listens to the reception being broadcast on the radio and takes poison in an attempt kill herself. Gerry finds her and goes to Tony in order to force David to leave his reception to visit Connie.

The use of these techniques is called \\"hypermiling\\".http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/hypermiling Merriam Webster dictionary Simple fuel- efficiency techniques can result in reduction in fuel consumption without resorting to radical fuel-saving techniques that can be unlawful and dangerous, such as tailgating larger vehicles. Techniques =Maintenance= Underinflated tires wear out faster and lose energy to rolling resistance because of tire deformation. The loss for a car is approximately 1.0% for every drop in pressure of all four tires.http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/transportation/cars-light- trucks/driving/7521 Improper wheel alignment and high engine oil kinematic viscosity also reduce fuel efficiency. =Mass and improving aerodynamics= Drivers can increase fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. the number of people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as roof racks, brush guards, wind deflectors (or \\"spoilers\\", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, and push bars, as well as using narrower and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing weight, aerodynamic drag, and rolling resistance. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. Removing roof racks (and accessories) can increase fuel efficiency by up to 20%. =Maintaining an efficient speed= A truck restricted to 55 mph Maintaining an efficient speed is an important factor in fuel efficiency. Optimal efficiency can be expected while cruising at a steady speed, at minimal throttle and with the transmission in the highest gear (see Choice of gear, below). The optimal speed varies with the type of vehicle, although it is usually reported to be between 35 mph (56 km/h) and 50 mph (80 km/h). For instance, a 2004 Chevrolet Impala had an optimum at 42 mph (70 km/h), and was within 15% of that from 29 to 57 mph (45 to 95 km/h). At higher speeds, wind resistance plays an increasing role in reducing energy efficiency. Hybrids typically get their best fuel efficiency below this model-dependent threshold speed. The car will automatically switch between either battery powered mode or engine power with battery recharge. Electric cars, such as the Tesla Model S, may go up to at 39 km/h (24 mph).Andersen, Ina. \\"http://www.tu.no/industri/2015/08/26/norske- bjorn-kjorte-728-kilometer-i-en-teslapa-en-lading Norske Bj√∏rn kj√∏rte 728 kilometer i en Tesla ‚Äì p√• √©n lading]\\" Teknisk Ukeblad, 26 August 2015. In English \\"Longest Trip In A Production Electric Car: Tesla Model S P85D breaks Guinness World Records record\\" World Record Academy Road capacity affects speed and therefore fuel efficiency as well. Studies have shown speeds just above allow greatest throughput when roads are congested. Individual drivers can improve their fuel efficiency and that of others by avoiding roads and times where traffic slows to below . Communities can improve fuel efficiency by adopting speed limits or policies to prevent or discourage drivers from entering traffic that is approaching the point where speeds are slowed below . Congestion pricing is based on this principle; it raises the price of road access at times of higher usage, to prevent cars from entering traffic and lowering speeds below efficient levels. Research has shown that mandated speed limits can be modified to improve energy efficiency anywhere from 2% to 18%, depending on compliance with lower speed limits. =Choice of gear (manual transmissions)= Engine efficiency varies with speed and torque. For driving at a steady speed one cannot choose any operating point for the engine‚Äîrather there is a specific amount of power needed to maintain the chosen speed. A manual transmission lets the driver choose between several points along the powerband. For a turbo diesel too low a gear will move the engine into a high- rpm, low-torque region in which the efficiency drops off rapidly, and thus best efficiency is achieved near the higher gear. Typical brake-specific fuel consumption map for a small turbo-diesel. In a gasoline engine, efficiency typically drops off more rapidly than in a diesel because of throttling losses. Because cruising at an efficient speed uses much less than the maximum power of the engine, the optimum operating point for cruising at low power is typically at very low engine speed, around or below 1000 rpm. This explains the usefulness of very high \\"overdrive\\" gears for highway cruising. For instance, a small car might need only to cruise at . It is likely to be geared for 2500 rpm or so at that speed, yet for maximum efficiency the engine should be running at about 1000 rpm to generate that power as efficiently as possible for that engine (although the actual figures will vary by engine and vehicle). =Acceleration and deceleration (braking)= Fuel efficiency varies with the vehicle. Fuel efficiency during acceleration generally improves as RPM increases until a point somewhere near peak torque (brake specific fuel consumption). However, accelerating to a greater than necessary speed without paying attention to what is ahead may require braking and then after that, additional acceleration. Experts recommend accelerating quickly, but smoothly. Generally, fuel efficiency is maximized when acceleration and braking are minimized. So a fuel-efficient strategy is to anticipate what is happening ahead, and drive in such a way so as to minimize acceleration and braking, and maximize coasting time. The need to brake is sometimes caused by unpredictable events. At higher speeds, there is less time to allow vehicles to slow down by coasting. Kinetic energy is higher, so more energy is lost in braking. At medium speeds, the driver has more time to choose whether to accelerate, coast or decelerate in order to maximize overall fuel efficiency. While approaching a red signal, drivers may choose to \\"time a traffic light\\" by easing off the throttle before the signal. By allowing their vehicle to slow down early and coast, they will give time for the light to turn green before they arrive, preventing energy loss from having to stop. Due to stop and go traffic, driving during rush hours is fuel inefficient and produces more toxic fumes. Conventional brakes dissipate kinetic energy as heat, which is irrecoverable. Regenerative braking, used by hybrid/electric vehicles, recovers some of the kinetic energy, but some energy is lost in the conversion, and the braking power is limited by the battery's maximum charge rate and efficiency. =Coasting or gliding= An alternative to acceleration or braking is coasting, i.e. gliding along without propulsion. Coasting dissipates stored energy (kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy) against aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance which must always be overcome by the vehicle during travel. If coasting uphill, stored energy is also expended by grade resistance, but this energy is not dissipated since it becomes stored as gravitational potential energy which might be used later on. Using stored energy (via coasting) for these purposes is more efficient than dissipating it in friction braking. When coasting with the engine running and manual transmission in neutral, or clutch depressed, there will still be some fuel consumption due to the engine needing to maintain idle engine speed. Coasting with a vehicle not in gear is prohibited by law in most U.S. states. An example is Maine Revised Statutes Title 29-A, Chapter 19, ¬ß2064 \\"An operator, when traveling on a downgrade, may not coast with the gears of the vehicle in neutral\\". Some regulations differ between commercial vehicles not to disengage the clutch for a downgrade, and passenger vehicles to set the transmission to neutral. These regulations point on how drivers operate a vehicle. Not using the engine on longer, precipitous downgrade roads, or excessively using the brake might cause a failure due to overheating brakes. Turning the engine off instead of idling does save fuel. Traffic lights are in most cases predictable, and it is often possible to anticipate when a light will turn green. A support is the Start-stop system, turning the engine off and on automatically during a stop. Some traffic lights (in Europe and Asia) have timers on them, which assist the driver in using this tactic. Some hybrids must keep the engine running whenever the vehicle is in motion and the transmission engaged, although they still have an auto-stop feature which engages when the vehicle stops, avoiding waste. Maximizing use of auto-stop on these vehicles is critical because idling causes a severe drop in instantaneous fuel-mileage efficiency to zero miles per gallon, and this lowers the average (or accumulated) fuel-mileage efficiency. =Anticipating traffic= A driver may improve their fuel efficiency by anticipating the movement of other vehicles or sudden changes to the situation the driver is currently in. For example, a driver who stops quickly, or turns without signaling, reduces the options another driver has for maximizing their performance. By always giving road users as much information about their intentions as possible, a driver can help other road users reduce their fuel usage (as well as increase their safety). Similarly, anticipation of road features such as traffic lights can reduce the need for excessive braking and acceleration. Drivers should also anticipate the behaviour of pedestrians or animals in the vicinity, so they can react to a developing situation involving them appropriately. =Minimizing ancillary losses= Using air conditioning requires the generation of up to of extra power to maintain a given speed. A/C systems cycle on and off, or vary their output, as required by the occupants so they rarely run at full power continuously. Switching off the A/C and rolling down the windows may prevent this loss of energy, though it will increase drag, so that cost savings may be less than is generally anticipated. Using the passenger heating system slows the rise to operating temperature for the engine. Either the choke in a carburetor-equipped car (1970's or earlier) or the fuel injection computer in modern vehicles will add more fuel to the fuel-air mixture until normal operating temperature is reached, decreasing fuel efficiency. =Fuel type= Using high octane gasoline fuel in a vehicle that does not need it is generally considered an unnecessary expense, although Toyota has measured slight differences in efficiency due to octane number even when knock is not an issue. All vehicles in the United States built since 1996 are equipped with OBD-II on-board diagnostics and most models will have knock sensors that will automatically adjust the timing if and when pinging is detected, so low octane fuel can be used in an engine designed for high octane, with some reduction in efficiency and performance. If the engine is designed for high octane then higher octane fuel will result in higher efficiency and performance under certain load and mixture conditions. The energy released during combustion of hydrocarbon fuel increases as the molecule chain length decreases, so gasoline fuels with higher ratios of the shorter chain alkanes such as heptane, hexane, pentane, etc. can be used under certain load conditions and combustion chamber geometries to increase engine output which can lead to lower fuel consumption, although these fuels will be more susceptible to predetonation ping in high compression ratio engines. Gasoline direct injection compression ignition engines make more efficient use of the higher combustion energy short chain hydrocarbons as the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber during high compression which auto-ignites the fuel, minimizing the amount of time that the fuel is available in the combustion chamber for predetonation. =Pulse and glide= Pulse and glide (PnG) or burn and coast driving strategy consists of rapid acceleration to a given speed (the \\"pulse\\" or \\"burn\\"), followed by a period of coasting or gliding down to a lower speed, at which point the burn-coast sequence is repeated.Jeongwoo Lee. Vehicle Inertia Impact on Fuel Consumption of Conventional and Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using Acceleration and Coast Driving Strategy. Ph.D thesis. Virginia Polytechnic Institute, September 4, 2009.. Strategies to minimize the fuel consumption of passenger cars during car-following scenarios. Journal of Automobile Engineering, vol.226, Issue 3, pp.419-429, 2012. Coasting is most efficient when the engine is not running, although some gains can be realized with the engine on (to maintain power to brakes, steering and ancillaries) and the vehicle in neutral. Most modern petrol vehicles cut off the fuel supply completely when coasting (over- running) in gear, although the moving engine adds considerable frictional drag and speed is lost more quickly than with the engine declutched from the drivetrain. The pulse-and-glide strategy is proven to be an efficient control design both in car-following and free-driving scenarios,S. Eben Li, X. Hu, K. Li, C. Ahn. Mechanism of vehicular periodic operation for optimal fuel economy in free-driving scenarios. IET Intelligent Transport Systems, vol.9, Issue 3, pp.306-313, 2014. with 20% fuel saving. In the PnG strategy, the control of the engine and the transmission determines the fuel-saving performance, and it is obtained by solving an optimal control problem (OCP). Due to a discrete gear ratio, strong nonlinear engine fuel characteristics, and different dynamics in the pulse/glide mode, the OCP is a switching nonlinear mixed- integer problem.S. Xu, S. Eben Li, X. Zhang, B. Cheng, H. Peng. Fuel-Optimal Cruising Strategy for Road Vehicles With Step-Gear Mechanical Transmission.

Fuel-Saving Servo-Loop Control for an Adaptive Cruise Control System of Road Vehicles With Step-Gear Transmission. IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol.66, Issue 3, pp.2033-2043, 2017. Some hybrid vehicles are well-suited to performing pulse and glide.S. Xu, S. Eben Li, H. Peng, B. Cheng, X. Zhang, Z. Pan. Fuel-Saving Cruising Strategies for Parallel HEVs. IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol.65, Issue 6, pp.4676-4686, 2015. In a series-parallel hybrid (see hybrid vehicle drivetrain), the internal combustion engine and charging system can be shut off for the glide by simply manipulating the accelerator. However based on simulation, more gains in economy are obtained in non-hybrid vehicles. This control strategy can also be used in vehicle platoon (The platooning of automated vehicles has the potential of significantly enhancing the fuel efficiency of road transportation), and this control method performs much better than conventional linear quadratic controllers.S. Eben Li, R. Li, J. Wang, X. Hu, B. Cheng, K. Li. Stabilizing Periodic Control of Automated Vehicle Platoon With Minimized Fuel Consumption. IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, vol.3, Issue 1, pp.259-271, 2016. Pulse and glide ratio of combustion engine in hybrid vehicles points on it by gear ratio in its consumption map, battery capacity, battery level, load, depending on acceleration, wind drag and its factor of speed. =Causes of pulse-and-glide energy saving= Much of the time, automobile engines operate at only a fraction of their maximal efficiency,Jansen p.18) resulting in lower fuel efficiency (or what is the same thing, higher specific fuel consumption (SFC)). Charts that show the SFC for every feasible combination of torque (or Brake Mean Effective Pressure) and RPM are called Brake specific fuel consumption maps. Using such a map, one can find the efficiency of the engine at various combinations of rpm, torque, etc. During the pulse (acceleration) phase of pulse and glide, the efficiency is near maximal due to the high torque and much of this energy is stored as kinetic energy of the moving vehicle. This efficiently-obtained kinetic energy is then used in the glide phase to overcome rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. In other words, going between periods of very efficient acceleration and gliding gives an overall efficiency that is usually significantly higher than just cruising at a constant speed. Computer calculations have predicted that in rare cases (at low speeds where the torque required for cruising at steady speed is low) it's possible to double (or even triple) fuel economy. More realistic simulations that account for other traffic suggest improvements of 20% are more likely. In other words, in the real world one is unlikely to see fuel efficiency double or triple. Such a failure is due to signals, stop signs, and considerations for other traffic; all of these factors interfering with the pulse and glide technique. But improvements in fuel economy of 20% or so are still feasible.Chuck Squatriglia, \\"Hypermilers push the limits of fuel efficiency\\" in Wired (Internet magazine) 6 October 2008 =Drafting= Drafting occurs where a smaller vehicle drives (or coasts) close behind a vehicle ahead of it so that it is shielded from wind. Aside from being illegal in many jurisdictions it is often dangerous. Scale-model wind tunnel and Real-World tests of a car ten feet behind a semi-truck showed a reduction of over 90% for the wind force (aerodynamic drag). The gain in efficiency is reported to be 20‚Äì40%.Dennis Gaffney. This Guy Can Get 59 MPG in a Plain Old Accord. Beat That, Punk.. Mother Jones, January/February 2007. Retrieved 2007-05-11. =Energy losses= Example energy flows for a late-model (pre-2009) midsize passenger car: (a) urban driving; (b) highway driving. Source: U.S. Department of Energy Most of the fuel energy loss in cars occurs in the thermodynamic losses of the engine. The next biggest loss is from idling, or when the engine is in standby, which explains the large gains available from shutting off the engine. In this respect, the data for fuel energy wasted in braking, rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag are all somewhat misleading, because they do not reflect all the energy that was wasted up to that point in the process of delivering energy to the wheels. The image reports that on non-highway (urban) driving, 6% of the fuel's energy is dissipated in braking; however, by dividing this figure by the energy that actually reaches the axle (13%), one can find that 46% of the energy reaching the axle goes to the brakes. Also, additional energy can potentially be recovered when going down hills, which may not be reflected in these figures. =Safety= There is sometimes a tradeoff between saving fuel and preventing crashes. In the US, the speed at which fuel efficiency is maximized often lies below the speed limit, typically ; however, traffic flow is often faster than this. The speed differential between cars raises the risk of collision. Drafting increases risk of collision when there is a separation of fewer than three seconds from the preceding vehicle. Coasting is another technique for increasing fuel efficiency. Shifting gears and/or restarting the engine increase the time required for an avoidance maneuver that involves acceleration. Therefore, some believe the reduction of control associated with coasting is an unacceptable risk. However it is also likely that an operator skilled in maximising efficiency through anticipation of other road users and traffic signals will be more aware of their surroundings and consequently safer. Efficient drivers minimise their use of brakes and tend to leave larger gaps in front of them. Should an unforeseen event occur such drivers will usually have more braking force available than a driver that brakes heavily through habit. The main issue with safety and hypermiling is the lack of temperature in the brake system. The is extremely relevant in older vehicles in the winter. Disc brake systems gain efficiency with higher temps. Emergency braking with freezing brakes at highway speeds results in a number of issues from increased stopping distance to pulling to one side.

After Empress Matilda's army besieged a castle on the edge of Winchester, Queen Matilda's army arrived and blockaded the Angevin army within the city. Cut off from supplies, the Angevin army gave up the siege, then was crushed as it began to retreat. Robert of Gloucester was captured and was subsequently exchanged for Stephen, who was returned to the throne of England. However, the civil war known as The Anarchy dragged on with neither side gaining an advantage. Background =Stephen usurps the throne= When William Adelin drowned in the White Ship, King Henry I of England was left with no male heirs. A second marriage to 18 year old Adeliza of Louvain would produce no children, leaving the widowed Empress Matilda as his only legitimate surviving child. Henry declared Matilda his heir and the English nobility agreed. The first person to swear fealty to Matilda was Stephen of Blois who was the son of Adela of Normandy, the daughter of William the Conqueror. Henry arranged for Matilda to marry the much younger Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, and though the marriage was stormy, it finally produced a son, Henry Plantagenet. When King Henry died in the Duchy of Normandy he reiterated that Empress Matilda was his heir. Nevertheless, Stephen immediately set out for England. He crossed the English Channel from Wissant to Dover and then made his way to London with a few retainers. The people of London acclaimed him king, followed by the nobility and the dead king's ministers. Stephen was crowned on Christmas Eve 1135. During this time, Empress Matilda was powerless to act because her husband Count Geoffrey was busy trying to put down a rebellion in Anjou. Very soon, Stephen's leadership attracted enemies. A Scottish army under King David I invaded the north but was defeated at the Battle of the Standard in August 1138. Empress Matilda and Robert of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I, landed at Portsmouth with 140 men. =Civil War= King Stephen's coronation Empress Matilda and her party took refuge at Arundel Castle where they were welcomed by King Henry's widow Adeliza and her new husband William d'Aubigny. Robert of Gloucester rode to Bristol to rally support for the empress. Stephen quickly assembled an army and surrounded Arundel Castle, demanding that the empress be handed over to him. Though her garrison was weak, Adeliza sent word that she would fight it out. At this point Stephen committed an astonishing blunder by giving Empress Matilda a safe-conduct pass to Bristol and withdrawing his army. When his enemy reached safety, the civil war broke out in full fury. While London and the east remained loyal to Stephen, the west declared for the empress. Stephen hired a body of Flemish mercenaries under William of Ypres, antagonizing his English subjects. The system of justice established under Henry I went to pieces and the common people suffered under the harsh demands of local noblemen and officials. In December 1140, Stephen began the siege of Lincoln Castle which had been captured by the rebel Earl Ranulf of Chester. Ranulf slipped away and got in contact with Robert of Gloucester, his father- in-law. Robert and Ranulf quickly gathered an army and marched to Lincoln. Until too late Stephen refused to believe that his enemies would make a move in winter. On 2 February 1141 in the Battle of Lincoln Stephen's army was defeated and he was captured. Empress Matilda entered London but her arrogant and hostile conduct soon alienated the people. On 24 June, the people of London chased the empress from the city. The forces of Stephen's queen, also named Matilda (Matilda of Boulogne), soon occupied London. Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, who had earlier defected to Empress Matilda's Angevin faction, changed sides again to support Queen Matilda. Siege and Battle Mounted combat in the 1100s Bishop Henry took a force to Winchester where he laid siege to the royal castle which was garrisoned by Angevins. Winchester's royal castle was located on the southwest side of the city, while an episcopal castle was on the southeast side. Only two other English cities at the time had more than one castle, London with three and York with two. When she heard of the bishop's incursion Empress Matilda determined to strike back. She gathered an army of her adherents and sortied from her base at Oxford around 28 July 1141. When the empress appeared before Winchester on 31 July it was a complete surprise. Bishop Henry fled the city while his soldiers retreated to Wolvesey Castle, the one belonging to the church. Empress Matilda While the Angevin host placed Wolvesey Castle under siege, Empress Matilda set up her headquarters in the royal castle and Robert of Gloucester established his command post near Winchester Cathedral (then Saint Swithun's). On August 2, the bishop's men set fire to Winchester, destroying a large part of the city. Wolvesey was a tough nut to crack. It was erected in 1138 and being in the corner of the city walls, could easily contact the outside world. Nevertheless, the Angevins put strong pressure on its defenders. Queen Matilda quickly assembled an army of relief that included mercenaries hired by Bishop Henry, a levy of the queen's feudal tenants from the County of Boulogne, the nearly 1,000-strong London militia, William of Ypres' Flemish mercenary cavalry and other supporters of Stephen. The queen's army set up camp on the east side of Winchester and proceeded to blockade Empress Matilda's forces in the city. While the queen's army was well- provisioned, the Angevin forces soon began to suffer from lack of food. To weaken the blockade, Robert of Gloucester attempted to fortify Wherwell Abbey, six miles to the north of the city, but William of Ypres defeated the Angevins with heavy losses. The supply situation convinced Robert of Gloucester that he must quit Winchester so he planned an orderly withdrawal. Earl Reginald of Cornwall and Brian fitz Count led an advance guard composed of crack troops designed to protect Empress Matilda. The main body guarded the baggage while Robert commanded the rearguard. On 14 September, the Angevins exited from the west side of Winchester on the road to Salisbury. Ahead of them, about to the northwest, the road crossed the River Test at Stockbridge. As soon as the Angevin host left the city the queen's army attacked. They pressed past the rearguard to attack the main body. The advance guard avoided the trap and delivered Empress Matilda safely to Gloucester, but the queen's army destroyed the Angevin main body as an effective fighting force; only remnants managed to escape. Robert of Gloucester's soldiers held together, but when his soldiers reached the Test they could go no further. Surrounded by a part of the queen's troops under William of Surrey and facing a bridge choked with panicked Angevins, Robert surrendered with his men. Result Queen Matilda offered to exchange Robert of Gloucester for her husband Stephen, but Empress Matilda refused to give up her royal prisoner. She would swap Robert for 12 earls and some gold, but not for the king. Therefore, the queen contacted Robert's wife Amabel, who had custody of Stephen. Behind the empress' back, the two wives determined to exchange their two husbands, and both Stephen and Robert were released. The civil war went on with neither side gaining an advantage. Meanwhile, the common people suffered under the oppression of the local barons, who took the law into their own hands. It was said that, \\"God and all His saints were asleep\\" during these grim years. Robert of Gloucester died on 31 October 1147. With her best leader gone, Empress Matilda retired to Anjou and there was a lull in the fighting. Queen Matilda died on 3 May 1151 and was buried at Faversham Abbey. In January 1153, the empress' son Henry landed in England and began seeking combat with Stephen. At Wallingford another battle was averted when the two parties agreed that Stephen would remain king during his lifetime, but that Henry Plantagenet would succeed him. Stephen died on 25 October 1154.

Sources The historian will find some source material in the Archive which the RIBA has made accessible at the Victoria and Albert Museum,administrative archive of RIBA at V&A; and in books, periodicals and other publications of the period which have been deposited and retained in the British Architectural Library (of the RIBA).British Architectural Library (of the RIBA)Angela Mace and Robert Thorne The Royal Institute of British Architects: a guide to its archive and history, Mansell Pub.,1986. Another contemporaneous source of information, upon which the following is largely based, is provided by two editions of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the eleventh of 1910eleventh and the fourteenth of 1929.fourteenth These editions contain articles which conveniently indicate how examination, as a method of gaining recognition for the attainment of the specialist knowledge and skill required of a professional practitioner, had grown and had been thought of in the period leading up to the passing of the 1931 Act. 19th century background The background to the developments in education and the method of attaining professional qualification had been the unprecedented development of industrial and commercial activity in the United Kingdom and other countries in the course of the nineteenth century. This, and the impact on the working and living conditions of the populations affected, had been making demands for the building of factories, warehouses, offices, educational establishments, hospitals, housing, places of recreation and entertainment and places for religious and other purposes. With that came demands upon architectural practitioners for designs for buildings of all kinds, qualities and standards, for the supervision of the construction of works, and in some cases for making planning schemes for area development or redevelopment, of greater or lesser extent; sometimes collaborating with other branches of the construction professions, notably surveyors, civil engineers and, as the period progressed, structural engineers, and those engaged in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. The demand for architectural services, in respect of both traditional and newer materials and techniques, was coming from public bodies, commercial and industrial enterprises, private owners or investors, philanthropists, benefactors and others. The Town Extension Plan, 1912 Warburton lecture, delivered by Raymond Unwin Institutional arrangements As a result, institutional arrangements for architectural education became increasingly systematic, in respect of examinations for formal qualifications, and making qualifications a condition for granting some other form of distinguishing style or title (such as Fellow, Associate or Licentiate of a professional body), or for the right or expectation to be able to practise as an architect, on one's own account or as a partner or as an assistant in another's office. A leading participant in the development of those institutional arrangements was the society which had been formed in London in the 1830s and had petitioned for, and in 1837 had been granted, a charter of incorporation. This society was later granted the name Royal Institute of British Architects, and is for convenience referred to as the RIBA. Qualifying examinations The index of the eleventh edition offers users very little more about architectural education than a few words in an article on Examinations generally, which was attributed in part to Paul George Konody, Art Critic of The Observer and the Daily Mail, formerly Editor of The Artist and Journal of Home Culture, author of the Art of Walter Crane; Vel√°zquez, Life and Work; etc., and in part to Arthur Watson, Secretary in the Academic Department of the University of London. It began with the paragraph: :The term 'examination' (i.e., inspecting, weighing and testing; from Latin examen, the tongue of a balance) is used [in the article which followed] to denote a systematic test of knowledge, and of either special or general capacity or fitness, carried out under the authority of some public body. There followed eight sections beginning with History and ending with a critical appraisal headed The Object and Efficiency of Examinations, and their Indirect Effects. The second section was on Professional Examinations, followed by others on School-leaving Examinations, mentioning the \\"accrediting\\" system in the United States started by the University of Michigan in 1871; Methods of Examination: Written, Oral, Thesis and Practical; Competitive Examinations; The Organization and Conduct of Examinations; and Marking, Classification and Errors of Detail. Perspective The section on History began as follows: :The oldest known system of examinations in history is that used by China for the selection of officers for the public service (c.1115 B.C.), and the periodic tests which they undergo after entry (c.2200). The abolition of this system was announced in 1906, and, as a partial substitute, it was decided to hold an annual examination in Peking of Chinese educated abroad. :The majority of examinations in western countries are derived from the university examinations of the middle ages. The first universities of Europe consisted of corporations of teachers and of students analogous to the trade gilds and merchant gilds of the time. In the trade gilds there were apprentices, companions and masters. No one was admitted to mastership until he had served his apprenticeship, nor, as a rule, until he had shown that he could accomplish a piece of work to the satisfaction of the gild. :The object of the universities was to teach; and to the three classes established by the gild correspond roughly to the scholar, the bachelor or pupil-teacher, and the master or doctor (two terms at first equivalent) who, having first served his apprenticeship and passed a definite technical test, had received permission to teach... After a survey of the development of examination practice in the universities of western Europe up to the early 20c., the next section of professional examinations began with the remark \\"University examinations for degrees having ceased to be used as technical tests of teaching capacity, new examinations have been devised for this purpose\\". For examinations in Medicine, the article referred the reader to the article on Medical Education, and this section concluded with a single paragraph headed Other Professions, stating that a system of professional examinations carried on by other professional bodies, in some cases with legal sanction, was developed in England during the nineteenth century; and, in a list of subjects described as \\"the most important\\" mentioned \\"architecture (Royal Institute of British Architects )\\", along with: accountancy, actuarial work, music, pharmacy, plumbing, surveying, veterinary medicine, technical subjects, e.g. cotton- spinning, dyeing, motor manufacturing, commercial subjects, shorthand and engineering (civil, mechanical and electrical). As of 1929 Publication of the fourteenth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in 1929 happened shortly before the Board of Architectural Education was constituted under the Act of 1931. In it there was an article three pages long on Architectural Education, attributed to Lionel Bailey Budden, MA, ARIBA, Associate Professor of Architecture in the University of Liverpool. The opening sentence was: :Underlying the system of architectural education at present established in most Western countries is the assumption that architecture is one of the fine arts, and that the prime object of the training which the architect should receive is to equip him as a creative artist in building. That could be compared with the words of the charter which had been granted to the RIBA in 1837, in which the purpose of the Institute was described as: :... for the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith; it being an art esteemed and encouraged in all enlightened nations, as tending greatly to promote the domestic convenience of citizens, and the public improvement and embellishment of towns and cities... When the present supplemental charter was granted in 1971, part of the first charter was revoked but the words quoted were retained. In the meantime Professor Budden's article of 1929 included the following: :... it is generally agreed that the study of architecture should be preceded by a liberal education. As one of the fine arts, historically associated with the arts of painting and sculpture, and as the background of civilized society, it demands both for its practice and its appreciation some measure of general culture. The tendency today [1929] is, therefore, for schools of architecture in Europe, the British Empire and America to require from candidates for admission evidence of a broad non-technical education... Today architectural education in all countries is in the hands of practising teachers. Direct connection between the instruction given in the school and the experience of actual practice is thereby assured ... The article then considered: Italy, France, Great Britain and Dominions, Other European Countries, United States, and Mexico. It mentioned that the largest school of architecture in England was that of the Architectural Association (London) and the next that of Liverpool University, and explained the part played by the RIBA: :From its foundation in 1835 the Royal Institute of British Architects has been the supreme controlling authority of the profession throughout the empire. At no time, however, has the RIBA itself undertaken the teaching of architecture. But by setting up, in the latter half of the last century [19c.], a centralized system of examinations when no professional tests existed in the country, it performed a notable service in raising the general level of professional knowledge. Through its board of architectural education it has now delegated to certain approved schools the task of qualifying candidates for admission to the institute, only maintaining its own centralized examinations for students not seeking entry through scholastic channels. Schools of architecture which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA final examination (except in the subject of \\"Professional Practice\\") were named as: :Robert Gordon's Colleges, Aberdeen; Edinburgh College of Art; Royal Technical College, Glasgow; University of Liverpool; Architectural Association, London; University of London; University of Manchester; McGill University, Montreal; and the University of Sydney. Schools in certain institutions which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA intermediate examination were named as: :School of Art, Birmingham; Royal West of England Academy, Bristol; University of Cambridge; Technical College, Cardiff; Leeds College of Arts; Leicester College of Arts and Crafts; Northern Polytechnic, London; Armstrong College, Newcastle-on-Tyne; University of Sheffield; Municipal School of Arts and Crafts, Southend-on-Sea; University of Toronto; and Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay. It was mentioned that in both classes the maintenance of the requisite standard was assured by the periodic inspection of the visiting board, appointed by the RIBA board of architectural education, which reported to the institute on the work of the various schools granted or applying for exemption. The system continued after the statutory Board of Architectural Education had been constituted, in connection with the provision in the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 making it the duty of the Board to recommend \\"the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board, to qualify persons for registration\\" under the Act (subsection 5(2)(a)). Consonant with Professor Budden's remarks at that time, the objects of the RIBA are declared in its charter to be: :The advancement of architecture and the promotion of the acquirement of the knowledge of the Arts and Sciences connected therewith; and the next paragraph in the charter expresses the power of the RIBA to grant diplomas, certificates or other forms of recognition. Later developments The former division of the membership of the RIBA into the two classes of Fellows and Associates ceased under the supplemental charter and byelaws of 1971, but the method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA has recognized as allowing exemption remains available. To be eligible for election to the now undivided class of Chartered Members a candidate is still required to have undertaken courses of study and passed examinations which have been prescribed or recognized by the Council, or to be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council having had a proper training in architecture. As the field in which architecture is practised has continued to change, so has the RIBA Chartered Membership been keeping pace. In recent years a Byelaw was introduced to the effect that practising members are responsible for undertaking continuing professional development, defined in the Byelaws as: :The systematic improvement and broadening of knowledge and skill and the development of personal qualities necessary for the execution of professional and technical duties in the course of a Chartered Member's working life. A further and more recent development has been the passing of a Byelaw allowing a Chartered Member to apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice, defined in the Byelaws as: :a formally-established business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members which meets criteria for, and operates in accordance with, a scheme prescribed by the Council, or a board to which the Council has devolved responsibility. Further information Professor Budden's article in the fourteenth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1929) was published shortly before the passing of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 of the Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938. His School, Liverpool, was one of those listed in the Act for the purpose of constituting the statutory Board of Architectural Education. When he contributed the article he was Associate Professor in Architecture in the Liverpool University School of Architecture, becoming Roscoe Professor from 1933. He retired in 1952. He had entered the School in 1905, graduated BA in 1909 and MA in 1910, teaching there from 1911 and becoming Associate Professor in 1924. He had been University of Liverpool travelling Scholar in Architecture in 1909, and a student at the British School at Athens 1909-1912. He was first an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA), later becoming a Fellow (FRIBA). His architectural work included extensions to Liverpool University Students‚Äô Union.

Coming to France around 1590, he was naturalised by Henry IV. Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who gave Tilenus his De Veritate, took his original name to be Tieleners.J. M.

They had earlier, in 1601, been allies on the Huguenot side of a public disputation against the Catholic Jacques-Davy Duperron and others. Du Moulin's view was that the christological attitude of Tilenus endangered the doctrine of justification; the matter became a very public split among Huguenots. James I of England exerted himself to restore Protestant unity in France, working through the Huguenot aristocrats Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon and Philippe de Mornay, and also his own envoys David Home and Thomas Edmondes. The issue was patched up by 1615. At Sedan Andrew Melville arrived in about 1612 from Scotland (via the Tower of London) and became a difficult colleague, sharing in the theology teaching.Dictionary of National Biography, Melville or Melvill, Andrew (1545‚Äì1622), Scottish presbyterian leader and scholar, by Alexander Gordon.

Cameron published his version as Amica collatio de gratia et voluntatis humanae concursu in vocatione (1622). Later life Later in 1620, Tilenus was finally forced out from Sedan by general hostility. He was on friendly terms with Hugo Grotius; they shared a house in 1622/3 in the Rue de Cond√©, Paris. He was also close to the philosopher Walter Donaldson. Tilenus went to England; there he published against presbyterianism. in Paraenesis ad Scotos Genevensis disciplinae zelotas. He was pursued by a personal attack by James Sempill, a friend of Melville.

Ukrinform. 19 June 2014 UEFA did not allow Mariupol to play League matches at home, Ukrayinska Pravda (22 June 2018) History The airport's history began in 1930 when project Mariupol Airport started (officially named Zhdanov Airport [–ñ–¥–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ê–µ—Ä–æ–ø–æ—Ä—Ç] at the time of construction because the city was named Zhdanov until 1989). The first flight was made on a Putilov Stal-3 from Mariupol to Berdyansk in the spring of 1931. However, due to economic problems, the airport was inactive until the autumn of 1932 and did not establish regular flights before the beginning of World War II. In 1967, the airport underwent new constructions with the runway and the airport terminal. In its heyday (and during the Soviet Era), the airport transported up to 120,000 passengers a year. There were 30 to 40 flights a day, and during the summer the airport served up to 25,000 passengers per month. However, after the collapse of Soviet Union, and the fall of Aeroflot (the airport's primary airline), airline service and passenger travel declined and the airport became inactive. Until 1993, the airport was a member of the Donetsk United Squadron, and on 26 May 1993, Mariupol Airport was registered as a state enterprise. Construction of a new terminal building which could handle 200+ passengers per hour was launched in February 2003. Also, a new ramp was constructed, and the runway underwent minor repairs with installation of ILS on Runway 20. In 2004, the airport transported over 11,000 passengers. In 2006, 18,000 passengers were transported, and in 2007 more than 20,000. On 26 May 2004, the airport received the status of International Airport, and on 7 November 2005, the State Aviation Administration of Ukraine issued the Certificate of Conformity (MCI-00-04-02-01) which allowed airport to service airlines, passengers, and air cargo.

Staffed partially by Royal Naval personnel the school was also used by children of personnel of the Military of the United States in the 1950s. When first occupied as a school in 1947 only the buildings in the southern and central area of the present day school had been built. The remaining buildings were constructed in the early to late 1950s, initially with the objective of supporting a complement of some 800 British Forces pupils. The school was co- educational with similar numbers of boys and girls. It was also both a Secondary Grammar and a Secondary Modern school until 1963 when it re-formed as a comprehensive. Numbers at the school steadily increased until by 1960 the school held over 1000 pupils. Even so, class size was still not excessive with a typical class size of 25 pupils in 1960. The Royal Naval School was renamed the Service Children's Comprehensive School in 1969. It closed as a Forces' school in 1978 just before the final withdrawal of British forces from Malta in March 1979. The school re-opened as a Junior Lyceum in September 1981 under the name of Liceo M. A. Vassalli. In 2006 new building began on completion of which most of the old buildings were demolished. The new buildings opened in 2008 as Kullegg Sant' Injazju.

It is not uncommon for British people to incorrectly pronounce Maltese words containing the silent Q as if it were an English word. For example, Qormi (pronounced 'Ormi) is sometimes wrongly pronounce \\"Kwormi\\" by British people unfamiliar with the written Maltese language. Similarly Tal Handaq (pronounced Tal Handa') was often pronounced Tal HandaK by British Forces personnel. Between the years 1947 to 1978 the Royal Naval Secondary School for British Forces children was located at Tal Handaq and a number of printed documents relating to the school employed the more comfortable (to the British) spelling of Tal Handak.

Via the Minnesota River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 230 square miles (596 km¬≤) in an agricultural region. The Little Cottonwood River rises south of Jeffers in Amboy Township in Cottonwood County, beginning as a drainage ditch constructed in 1997. In its upper course the stream flows swiftly in a northeastward course and passes rock outcrops, including the Jeffers Petroglyphs. It flows generally east-northeastwardly through Brown County into northwestern Blue Earth County, where it joins the Minnesota River in Cambria Township, approximately seven miles (11 km) southeast of New Ulm. For much of its lower course, it roughly parallels the Cottonwood River to the north at a distance of three to ten miles (5‚Äì15 km). The stream's watershed is narrow, with no major tributaries. Land within the watershed consists primarily of till plains; in 1990, 90% of the land was cultivated for agriculture. Common fish in the river include black and yellow bullhead, rock bass, golden redhorse, and various species of darters and shiners. Flow rate At the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge in Cambria Township, 0.7 miles (1.1 km) upstream from the river's mouth, the annual mean flow of the river between 1974 and 2005 was 72.5 cubic feet per second (2 m¬≥/s).

He represented Nipissing in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1890 to 1902 as a Liberal member. He was born in Bromley Township, Canada West in 1852, the son of Irish immigrants, and was educated in Pembroke. He was a justice of the peace and served as reeve of Mattawa for three years. Loughrin was also chairman of the Separate School board. He operated a general store in Mattawa. In 1884, he married Bridget Gorman. John Loughrin succeeded William Doran as Nipissing stipendiary magistrate in June 1902 at a salary of $1,600. The former MLA functioned as Master of Titles and Registrar of Deeds for Nipissing. In Renfrew County following school in Pembroke, he worked as a clerk for Murray Brothers‚Äô stores in Beachburg and Renfrew. In 1876 he arrived in Mattawa where he joined Timmins and Gorman until 1879. In that year, he returned to T. & W. Murray at their business in Deux Rivieres until the store moved to Mattawa when it became Messrs. Murrray‚Äôs & Loughrin. His public service began in 1886 as reeve in Mattawa for two years. He was also a separate school trustee. When Nipissing became an electoral district in 1890, Loughrin was selected Reform candidate and defeated Liberal-Conservative David Purvis of North Bay. In 1894 he was re- elected over Independent Conservative Steven Fournier of Sudbury and in his last electoral campaign in 1898 defeated Charles Lamarche. In 1893 he ended partnership with T. & W. Murray and in 1894 purchased the Mattawa hardware business of Messrs. Dunlop & Co. In 1905, the Whitney government dismissed John Loughrin for partisan political activity while serving as a public officer. The Conservatives elected Charles Lamarche in East Nipissing who gave up his seat so that Frank Cochrane could contest the vacancy. Cochrane was acclaimed and immediately entered Whitney‚Äôs cabinet. Loughrin‚Äôs dismissal opened the door for Whitney to reward Lamarche. That occurred in October 1905, when Whitney appointed Lamarche police magistrate and registrar of deeds for the District of Nipissing. Loughrin died in 1917 and was buried at Mattawa.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~murrayp/nipissin/mattawa/st_ann/loughri2.jpg References  External links  *The Canadian parliamentary companion, 1891 JA Gemmill *Member's parliamentary history for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario Category:1852 births Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:People from Renfrew County Category:Mayors of places in Ontario Category:People from Mattawa, Ontario Category:1917 deaths ","title":"John Loughrin"},{"id":"11568343","text":"A shutdown valve (also referred to as SDV or emergency shutdown valve, ESV, ESD, or ESDV; or safety shutoff valve) is an actuated valve designed to stop the flow of a hazardous fluid upon the detection of a dangerous event. This provides protection against possible harm to people, equipment or the environment. Shutdown valves form part of a safety instrumented system. The process of providing automated safety protection upon the detection of a hazardous event is called functional safety. Shutdown valves are primarily associated with the petroleum industry although other industries may also require this type of protection system. ESD valves are required by law on any equipment placed on an offshore drilling rig to prevent catastrophic events like the BP Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. A safety shutoff valve should be fail-safe, that is close upon failure of any element of the input control system (such as temperature controllers, steam pressure controllers), air pressure, fuel pressure, current from a flame detector, or current from other safety devices such as low water cutoff, and high pressure cutoff. A blowdown valve (BDV) is a type of shutdown valve designed to depressurize a pressure vessel by directing vapour to a flare, vent or blowdown stack in an emergency. BDVs fail-safe to the open position upon failure of the control system. The type of valve, type of actuation and performance measurement are similar to an ESD valve. Types of valve For fluids, metal seated ball valves are used as shut-down valves (SDV's). Use of metal seated ball valves leads to overall lower costs when taking into account lost production and inventory, and valve repair costs resulting from the use of soft seated ball valves which have a lower initial cost. Straight-through flow valves, such as rotary-shaft ball valves, are typically high-recovery valves. High recovery valves are valves that lose little energy due to little flow turbulence. Flow paths are straight through. Rotary control valves, butterfly valve and ball valves are good examples. For air intake shut down, two distinct types are commonly utilized, i.e. butterfly valves and swing gate or guillotine valves. Because diesel engines ignite fuel using compression instead of an electronic ignition, shutting off the fuel source to a diesel engine will not necessarily stop the engine from running. When an external hydrocarbon, such as methane gas, is present in the atmosphere, it can be sucked into a diesel engine causing overspeed or over revving, potentially leading to a catastrophic failure and explosion. When actuated, ESD valves stop the flow of air and prevent these failures. Types of actuation Pneumatically actuated shut down valve A diagram of the internal components of a safety shutoff valve. When this type of valve is tripped, the flow is quickly stopped and an indicator disc tells the operator that the electrical circuit has been opened by a failure somewhere in the system. When the system failure has been corrected so that the circuit is again closed, the valve can be opened by the action of the hand lever. If, however, the system failure has not been satisfactorily corrected, the circuit will remain open and moving the hand lever will not open the valve, because the valve stem remains disengaged from the handle. As shutdown valves form part of a SIS it is necessary to operate the valve by means of an actuator. These actuators are normally fail safe fluid power type. Typical examples of these are: :*Pneumatic cylinder :*Hydraulic cylinder :*Electro-hydraulic actuator In addition to the fluid type, actuators also vary in the manner in which the energy is stored to operate the valve on demand as follows: :*single-acting cylinder - Or spring return where the energy is stored by means of a compressed spring :*double- acting cylinder - Energy is stored using a volume of compressed fluid The type of actuation required depends upon the application, site facilities and also the physical space available although the majority of actuators used for shutdown valves are of the spring return type due to the fail safe nature of spring return systems. In a solenoid-operated safety shutoff valve, a spring action closes the valve instantly when an electric current fails and the solenoid ceases to be energized. The solenoid circuit is generally arranged so that it is broken upon failure of any element of the system. This valve cannot be re-opened until the solenoid is again energized. The coil of the valve solenoid must be connected in series with all of the elements. For this to operate, fuel, air and steam pressure can be converted to electrical signals by means of bellows, a bourdon tube, or a diaphragm-operated mercury switch. Complications However, sudden closing of a valve in a piping system may lead to water hammer or implosion so in special cases there may be additional items connected to the shutoff valve, such as a pressure relief valve or an aerator valve. Measuring performance For shutdown valves used in safety instrumented systems it is essential to know that the valve is capable of providing the required level of safety performance and that the valve will operate on demand. The required level of performance is dictated by the Safety Requirements Specification, where eventually a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) is indicated. In order to maintain the level of performance required during the valve lifetime, the Safety Maintenance Manual prescription shall be fulfilled: one of the possible requests is to test the valve. Among the others 2 types of testing methods are: *Proof test - A manual test that allows the operator to determine whether the valve is in the \\"as good as new\\" condition by testing for all possible failure modes and requires a plant shutdown *Diagnostic Test - An automated on-line test that will detect a percentage of the possible failure modes of the shutdown valve. An example of this for a shutdown valve would be a partial stroke test. An example of a mechanical partial stroke test device can be found here. The performance standard of ESDVs may include the specification and testing of a closure time (e.g. to close in less than 10 seconds) and the specification and measurement of an acceptable leakage rate of fluid through the closed valve.

The book puts forward a set of policies and strategies for implementing the most promising clean energy technologies by all spheres of government, business and community organisations. Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy suggests that a mix of efficient energy use, renewable energy sources and natural gas (as a transitional fuel) offers a clean and feasible energy future for Australia.UNSW Press. : Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy Structure and themes The book is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy: Review by Patrick O'Neill Chain Reaction 100, August 2007. and is structured in three sections: * Introduction to the basic concepts and latest scientific evidence regarding global warming. * Assessment of energy technologies, including coal, nuclear and more sustainable alternatives. * Discussion of policies and strategies needed to overcome the non-technical barriers to renewable energies and energy efficiency.Scientific approach to an emotional ‚Äì and political ‚Äì issue ECOS, June‚ÄìJuly 2007, p.31. Diesendorf argues that: * Ecologically sustainable energy technologies based on energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural gas are commercially available today, and that their implementation could halve Australia's greenhouse gas emissions within a few decades. * To implement these technologies, new policies must be developed and implemented by all three levels of government. * The main barriers are neither technical nor economic, but rather our social institutions and the political power of the big greenhouse gas emitting industries: coal, oil, aluminium, cement and motor vehicles. Wind power variability Early in his career, Mark Diesendorf was a principal research scientist with CSIRO where he was involved in early research on integrating wind power into electricity grids. This issue is discussed in some detail in Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy. Diesendorf explains that large-scale wind power is not \\"intermittent\\", because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously. In practice, the variations in thousands of wind turbines, spread out over several different sites and wind regimes, are smoothed. As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases. This has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by Graham Sinden from Oxford University:Diesendorf, Mark (2007). Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, p. 119. > [Graham Sinden] analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 > sites spread out over the United Kingdom.

Diesendorf goes on to say that every conventional power station breaks down unexpectedly from time to time, causing an immediate loss of all its power. That is true intermittency, according to Diesendorf, and it is a particular type of variability that switches between full power and no power. Once a conventional power station has broken down, it may be offline for weeks, much longer than windless periods.Diesendorf, Mark (2007). Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, p. 118. Quotes * \\"The enhanced greenhouse effect is arguably the most dangerous environmental problem and the most difficult political issue to be faced by the world in the 21st century.\\" (p. 1) * \\"The recent push for a revival of nuclear energy has been based on its claimed reduction in CO2 emissions where it substitutes for coal-fired power stations. In reality, only reactor operation is CO2-free. All other stages of the nuclear fuel chain  mining, milling, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning, and waste management  use fossil fuels and hence emit CO2...\\" (p. 252) * \\"Global wind-power capacity continues to expand and, apart from the blip in 2006, its costs continue to decline steadily. Wind power is one of the few energy supply technologies that are ready for wide dissemination today, unlike coal with CO2 capture and sequestration and unlike nuclear power. Wind can deliver deep cuts in CO2, while providing a hedge against fluctuating fossil fuel prices and reducing energy import dependence.\\" (p. 126) Critical reception Dick Nichols, in Green Left, states that Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy brings together much useful material about global warming and possible solutions: : Diesendorf's book concentrates into one volume a succinct analysis of global warming, a rebuttal of climate change scepticism, a thorough summary of the state of development of each renewable energy technology, a masterly demolition of false ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to greenhouse (like carbon sequestration and nuclear power) and a presentation of strategies and policies for uprooting carbon-intensive power production in Australia. Add in chapters on saving energy and transport and urban redesign and Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy illuminates the reader about all the main features of the many-sided debate on how to make sustainable energy production the heart of the attack on climate change.Dick Nichols, How can sustainable energy solve greenhouse? Green Left, 5 April 2008. Nichols suggests that if there's one serious shortcoming in Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy it's \\"a failure to consistently trace what rate of implementation of energy efficiency and uptake of renewable energy sources is necessary to confront the greenhouse emergency\\". Patrick O'Neill, in Chain Reaction, suggests that Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems, and that the book is \\"simply a joy to read\\". O'Neill explains that whilst an immense amount of technical and scientific detail is presented, the language is simple and the book is well laid out. It also covers often ignored areas of the sustainable energy discussion such as population issues, morality, social justice and equity. In conclusion, O'Neill states that the book is a \\"wonderfully energising piece of sedition\\", which calls for a \\"coordinated national strategy for non-violent action\\". George Wilkenfield, in Australian Review of Public Affairs, is more critical and suggests the book feels \\"strangely anachronistic\\", partly because it treats climate change as an issue that can be resolved through grassroots activism or by the opposition of protest movements to unjust regimes. Wilkenfield explains that \\"this rather misses the point that the continuing rise in global greenhouse gas emissions is not a byproduct of injustice or repression but of economic freedom in the West and the unrelenting economic growth by which repressive regimes such as China‚Äôs buy legitimacy. In general, very few people want to be freed from consumption‚Äîmost want the freedom to consume even more\\". Wilkenfield goes on to say that Diesendorf misses some of the dynamics of consumption: energy use gives people comfort, speed, privacy and convenience. Many people actually enjoy driving and like their cars, and would continue to use them as long as they could afford to, even if public transport were available.George Wilkenfield, Cutting greenhouse emissions‚ÄîWhat would we do if we really meant it? Australian Review of Public Affairs, August 2007. Nevertheless, in the end, Wilkenfield concedes that Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy is very suitable as a textbook, or as a handbook for activists, journalists or the more committed reader who is not afraid of numbers. Author Mark Diesendorf teaches and researches ecologically sustainable development and greenhouse solutions at the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of NSW.

As a conductor, he founded several ensembles including the chamber orchestra Virtuosi Saxoniae. His name is sometimes written in English as Ludwig Guttler. He received a number of awards including Discovery of the Year in 1983, and Frankfurt‚Äôs Musikpreis for extraordinary achievements in 1989. He was a founding member of the Rheingau Musik Festival and has appeared regularly since the first season in 1988. Dresdner Frauenkirche, 2006 As head of the society of the Dresdner Frauenkirche, Ludwig G√ºttler promoted the reconstruction of this famous Baroque church, which was destroyed during World War II and was rebuilt in 1994‚Äì2004. In recognition of these contributions, Queen Elizabeth II appointed him Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in November 2007.  Biography  G√ºttler was born in 1943 in Sosa, in the Ore Mountain region of Saxony. He studied at the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik ‚Äì Mendelssohn- Akademie in Leipzig with Armin M√§nnel. From 1965 to 1969 he played in the orchestra of the Handel Festival in Halle and from 1969 to 1980 with the Dresden Philharmonic. He has been teaching the trumpet at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden until 1990, and at the annual International Music Seminar in Weimar from 1980 to 1990. Since the mid-1970s, G√ºttler has been mainly active as a soloist and later as a conductor, at home and abroad, devoted mainly to the trumpet literature of the 18th century, especially the high-pitched piccolo trumpet. He was also involved in the development of a modern brass instrument to play parts designated for the historic corno da caccia. The instrument was made by Friedbert Syhre in Leipzig. G√ºttler is also musical director of the festival \\"Sandstein und Musik\\" (Sandstone and Music) in Saxon Switzerland, founded in 1983 and of the festival Musikwoche Hitzacker in Hitzacker. G√ºttler is a member of the S√§chsische Akademie der K√ºnste (Saxon Academy of Arts). = Virtuosi Saxoniae = G√ºttler founded the Leipziger Bach-Collegium in 1976, the Blechbl√§serensemble Ludwig G√ºttler in 1978, and in 1985 the chamber orchestra Virtuosi Saxoniae. The group of members of the Staatskapelle Dresden concentrates on performing music from the 18th century found in Dresden libraries, in the fields of opera, sacred music and chamber music. = Rheingau Musik Festival = He supported the Rheingau Musik Festival from the beginning in 1988, both as a performer and a curator. In 2011 he appeared with his Brass Ensemble. In 2012, he conducted his orchestra Virtuosi Saxoniae in Eberbach Abbey in works by Bach, Handel, Johann Friedrich Fasch, Christoph F√∂rster, Telemann and Mozart, as part of the series \\"Companions along the way\\".  Awards  In 1983 he received a record prize of the Deutsche Phono- Akademie in Hamburg as \\"Discovery of the Year\\". In 1988 he was the second recipient of the Georg-Philipp-Telemann-Preis of Magdeburg, in 1989 the Frankfurter Musikpreis. In both 1978 and 1985 he received the National Prize of East Germany, which he returned in 1989, asking that the money should be devoted to the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche.  Frauenkirche  After the German reunification, Ludwig G√ºttler became chairman of the society for promoting the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche Dresden and curator of the foundation Stiftung Frauenkirche. He regularly conducted \\"Wiederaufbaukonzerte\\" (concerts for the reconstruction). For his involvement in the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche, he received several honours. President Horst K√∂hler awarded him in September 2007 the Great Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Erich Iltgen awarded him the S√§chsische Verfassungsmedaille on 26 May 2005.

The lake is situated in an old residential neighbourhood located between the municipalities of Stockholm and Huddinge and most of the shoreline is private property. The water level is controlled by a sluice in the north-western end of the lake where the lake empties into Lake M√§laren through a system of dikes and culverts. Polluted waste water was poured directly into the lake during the early 20th century which caused up to two-thirds of the lake to be choked-up until the 1940s. It was subsequently one of the first lakes in Stockholm to be subject to various attempts to restorations. The northern shores are waterlogged whilst the bedrock surfaces along the southern. The lake has no major feeders, the inflow instead coming from local stormwater and surface runoff.Vattenprogram, p 15.3-15.4  Catchment area  Some 60 per cent of the lake catchment area is occupied by settlements, mostly one-family houses but several minor green spaces are scattered around the lake. South-west of the lake is a small area forming part of the G√∂mmaren nature reserve. The lake has two bathes. = Environmental influence = The number of polluting operations in the catchment area is limited to a petrol station and an engineering workshop. In the end of the 1930s sewers were built in the area and the waste water fed into the lake during the 1920s and 1930s is today brought to the wastewater treatment works at Henriksdal, but old sewers still leak into the lake and the water was considered unfit for bathing at several occasions during the 1990s. L√•ngsj√∂n is one of few lakes in Stockholm where spillway overflow adds appreciable amounts of phosphorus. Surface runoff adds some 70 kg of phosphorus and 1,000 kg of nitrogen annually and more than half of phosphorus added through surface water is produced by the surrounding one- family houses and their gardens.  Flora and fauna  In August, the stock of phytoplankton is dominated by cyanobacteria and green algae, of which several are potentially poisonous and caused major algae blooms during the 1990s. The community of zooplankton is representative for lakes rich in nutrients with medium-sized taxa dominating in late spring and June, while minor taxa are otherwise prevailing. Larger zooplankton, such as cyclopoid copepods, are rare and reaches about 40 per cent in July and August.Vattenprogram, p 15.5-15.7 No inventory of aquatic plants has been done since the mid-1970s, but white waterlily is common in the minor bays. yellow water-lily occur in minor numbers but reed beds are missing. Lake bed fauna includes more than 50 species dominated by freshwater gastropods (Hippeutis complanatus), Caddisflies (Somatochlora metallica), beetles, and leeches (Alboglossiphonia heteroclita). Additionally, in 1969 a freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbii) was documented in the lake, a continental species then new to Sweden but not found in the lake since. Fishes natural to L√•ngsj√∂n include perch, northern pike, roach, rudd, carp bream, crucian carp, tench, and ruffe; extraneous species are common carp and mirror carp. Pike and zander are planted-out carnivorous species while roach and crucian carp have been decimated by trawling. Sample catches in 1999 showed the number of perch, roach, and carp had increased far beyond expected levels. Crayfish plague hit the lake in 1984, but the signal crayfish was reintroduced within a few years. The lake is a breeding ground for most birds common to the Stockholm-area ‚Äî such as mute swan, mallard, and Eurasian coot ‚Äî and some less common ‚Äî such as common moorhen and great crested grebe. Other bird sightings include heron, tufted duck, common tern, pochard, and spotted crake. The lake is one of the most important breeding grounds for amphibians, with a documented presence of common frog, common toad and smooth newt.

Early life The Hohe Schule in , where Vorstius was a professor before he moved to Leiden Vorstius was born at Cologne on 19 July 1569. His parents were Roman Catholic but he converted to the Reformed Christianity. He studied at D√ºsseldorf from 1583 to 1587, he also studied at Aix-la-Chapelle and then entered the college of St. Lawrence in Cologne; he next studied for two years to prepare for business but in 1589 again altered his intention and studied at the Herborn Academy from 1589 until 1593, he entered further schooling at Heidelberg on 12 April 1593, focusing on theology on 12 April 1594. There he studied under Johannes Piscator and received a theological doctorate on 4 July 1594. In December 1595 he went to Basel and Geneva, where he attended Lectures by Theodore Beza. It was also here where his disputations De sacramentis (Basel, 1595) and De causis salutis (1595) gained him the offer of a position as teacher (with the approval of Beza and Johann Jakob Grynaeus). Instead, he went to Burgsteinfurt in 1596, in the County of Bentheim. There, thanks to a recommendation from Beza and David Pareus, he taught at Graf von Bentheim's Hohe Schule for fifteen years. In Burgsteinfurt Vorstius defended the Reformed religion against the Catholic theologian Robert Bellarmine. He also received offers for teaching positions at Saumur and Marburg. It was in Burgsteinfurt that his De praedestinatione (Burgsteinfurt, 1597), De sancta Trinitate (1597), and De persona et officio Christi (1597) brought on him a suspicion of Socinianism; but in 1599 he successfully defended his orthodoxy before the theological faculty of Heidelberg. He was promoted in Burgsteinfurt, in 1605 receiving the additional appointments of preacher and assessor to the consistory. At Leiden After the death of Arminius, he accepted, in 1610, a call to Leiden. He was \\"praised enthusiastically by indisputably orthodox divines at Heidelberg and Arnhem as worthy of the post\\". He was nominated for the divinity chair there by moderate members of the Remonstrant party who approved of his support of public freedom of opinion (\\"having defended the toleration of diverse opinions in his book against Bellarmine\\") and thought that due to his orthodox background he would also be acceptable to some of the Contra-Remonstrants. In 1610 he reprinted Disputationes decem de natura et attributis Dei (Steinfurt, 1602) as Tractatus theologicus de Deo sive de natura et attributis Dei. That same year he also published Anti-Bellarminus (1610). His statements in the Tractatus on God, the divine attributes, predestination, and Christ led the Counter-Remonstrants to accuse him of Socinianism and heterodoxy. The Heidelberg theologians condemned the book; Vorstius replied in his Protestatio epistolica contra theologorum Heidelbergensium (The Hague, 1610). In 1611 he damaged his reputation by re- editing a work of Socinus; De auctoritate sanctae scripturae, with a preface of his own. The authorities in Heidelberg refused to publish it and he later claimed to have been ignorant of its authorship. As the controversy grew \\"His appointment became a symbolic cause in the struggle between the two parties [Remonstrants and Contra-Remonstrants] in church and state. Oldenbarnevelt and Uyttenbogaert, the leaders of the Remonstrants, were committed to the appointment of Vorstius, which would ensure that an exponent of the Arminian- Remonstrant point of view would continue to be heard at Leiden.\\" They were joined by Hugo Grotius who defended the right of the civil authorities to appoint whomever they wished to university faculty. Vorstius's opponents, led by Sibrandus Lubbertus, lodged official protests with the states of Holland and West-Friesland, and attempted to bring the Anglicans over to their side by communicating with the Archbishop of Canterbury and other English divines, as well as the King, James I of England. Opposition from King James I of England In the pamphlet published in 1612 concerning the denunciation of Vorstius, King James briefly traced the events that led up to the beginning of his opposition: > \\"In Autumne last [1611], about the end of August, ... there came to our > hands two bookes of the said Vorstius, the one intituled Tractatus > Theologicus de Deo, dedicated to the Lantgraue of Hessen, imprinted in the > yeere 1610, the other his Exegesis Apologetica vpon that booke, dedicated to > the States, and printed in the yeere 1611. Which books, as soone as we had > receiued, ... we stayed not one houre, but dispatched a letter presently to > our Ambassadour resident with the States\\" James, through his ambassador, swiftly urged the States-General to expel Vorstius, giving the following explanation for why he involved himself in this controversy: > \\"If the subject of Vorstius' Heresies had not been grounded vpon Questions > of a higher qualitie than the number and nature of the Sacraments, or the > points of Iustification, of Merits, of Purgatorie, of the visible head of > the Church, or any such matters, as are in controversie at this day betwixt > the Papists and vs; Nay more, if he had medled onely with the nature and > works of GOD ad extra, (as the Schoolemen speake,) If hee had soared no > higher pitch; we doe freely professe, that in that case we should never haue > troubled ourselues with the businesse in such fashion, and with that > fervencie as hitherto we haue done. But this Vorstius, ... confounding > infinitie, (one of the proper attributes of God,) and immensitie, (sometime > applied to creatures,) the essence and substance, with the hypostasis, > disputing of a first and second creation, immediate and mediate, making God > to be quale and quantum, changing eternitie, into euiternitie, teaching > eternitie to consist of a number of aages, and in the head as a sworne > enemie not onely to Divinitie, but even to all Philosophie, both humane and > naturall, denying God to be Actus purus, and void of qualities,\\" etc. > > Let the world then iudge whether we had not occasion herevpon, to be moued, > ... as a Christian at large; yea, euen as a Theist, or a man that > acknowledgeth a GOD, or as a Platonique Philosopher at the least. James argues here that his objections were to the passages that touched upon the basic aspects of religion (such as the substance and infinity of God), and not upon topics then current in the debates among Christians ('the number and nature of the Sacraments, the points of Justification', etc.). Which, if they were those, England 'should never have troubled ourselves with the business in this fashion, and with that fervency'. This and other messages formed a series of dispatches that were exchanged between the James and the States General, whose response to him amounted to little action, and discomfort about foreign nations being involved in Dutch religious affairs, in light of the bloody persecutions inflicted by the Roman Catholics during the Dutch War of Independence. Attempting to persuade the States one more time, in 1612 James submitted a letter where he outlined the concrete passages out of Vorstius that he found objectionable: > Out Of His Annotations. *\\"But there is nothing forbids vs to say, that God > hath a Body, so as we take a body in the largest signification.\\" *\\"They > therefore doe not speake circumspectly enough, who say, that God is > altogether as vnchangeable in his will, as he is in his essence.\\" *\\"We finde > it no where written, That the substance of God is simply immense; nay, there > are many places, which seeme to cary a contrary meaning.\\" *\\"No Magnitude is > actually infinite, and therefore God is not actually infinite.\\" *\\"And > surely, if all and euery euent of things were precisely set downe, and from > eternitie, there needed not then that continuall inspection and procuration, > which neuerthelesse is euery where attributed vnto God.\\" *\\"They therefore, > who teach that there is in God a certaine vniuersall knowledge in genere, > doe seeme to answere more fully; but so as they doe confesse likewise that > there bee more causes of certaintie in the vision of things present, then in > the vision of things future contingent.\\" *\\"All things which God hath once > decreed, and precisely determined, uno modo & actu, he doth after such his > determination exactly know them: But this cannot be affirmed of all and > euery other thing, which are, or come to passe, being considered seuerally > and by themselues, because they haue their existence, not onely successiuely > in time, but also contingently, and oftentimes conditionally.\\" Out Of His > Apologie. *\\"It is to be vnderstood that the Father hath a certaine peculiar > being, or as it were a limitted and bounded essence.\\" *\\"From whence it is > easily prooued, that there are really certaine internall accidents in God, > that is to say, (if it be lawfull to vse such a word) in the very fore- > electing minde and will of God.\\" *In the 16 Chapter, he doeth dangerously > dissent from the receiued opinion of Diuines, concerning the Vbiquitie of > Gods presence. *In the 19 Chapter, pag. 99 he doth attribute vnto God, > Magnitude and Quantitie. Finally, this correspondence between the two nations was made public to the world in 1612, when James published a pamphlet entitled A Declaration Concerning the Proceedings with the States Generall, of the United Provinces of the Low Covntreys, In the cause of D. Conradvs Vorstivs, subsequently republished in his collected Workes of 1616. He also recruited the ex-Catholic Richard Sheldon, and the Catholic juror William Warmington, to write against him. In 1613, Sir Dudley Carleton asked Paolo Sarpi to assess the views of Vorstius. What Sarpi delivered was at very least double-edged, hitting at all reformers, and with criticism hardly veiled of James's interventions and mixing of religious and political strands. Opposed and exiled Vorstius responded in his Christiana ac modesta responsio ad articulos quosdam nuper ex Anglia transmissos (Leiden, 1611), but the States-General felt obliged to dismiss him, though continuing his salary, in 1612.W. B. Patterson, King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom (1997), p. 263. He settled as an exile in Gouda, about May 1612. Attacks on Vorstius continued, and he pleaded his own cause in a series of polemics.Catalogua errorum sive hallucinationum D. Sibr. Lubberti (Steinfurt, 1611); Prodromus plenioris responsi suo tempore secuturi ad declarationem Sibrandi Lubberti et ministrorum Leovardenaium iteratam cautionem (Leyden, 1612); Responsum plenius ad scripta quaedam eristica (1612); and Paraenesis ad Sibrandum Lubbertum (Gouda, 1613). James caused Vorstius's book to be burned in London, Oxford, and Cambridge, and informed the States-General, through his ambassador Ralph Winwood, that he would consider them his enemies if they tolerated the presence of such a heretic. Winwood made a long speech entirely based on the Contra-Remonstrant tenet that the appointment of Vorstius was not just a political matter but one of religion as well. He stated that since some cities, such as Holland, were against the appointment to move forward on it threatened the unity of the Provinces. Oldenbarneveldt thanked the ambassador for the king's \\"princely affection\\" and promised the proposal would be considered. In a letter to Cecil, Winwood cast the contest as between those \\"who sincerely do affectionate, the profession of the one only true religion\\" and those who hold \\"that the strength of their state, chiefly does consist, in maintaining Religion to be professed in a certain Latitude, the bounds whereof they enlarge, and restrain, at the humor and appetite of every particular man's fantasy\\". While James was tolerant for his time, it was only toleration in private; no public preaching or opposition to his religious policies was allowed. Despite the Remonstrants having the same position of supremacy of the state over the Church, their open toleration was seen as a danger to the peace. While Vorstius called for toleration of various religious opinions, his English opponents held that this could only lead to the disruption of the state and lose the blessing of Jesus. They held that the only reason the United Provinces had not been annihilated by Spain was through the service of God and the advancement of true religion. Finally, in 1619, Vorstius was condemned as a heretic by the Synod of Dort and banished.The Decree of the LL. the Estates of Holland and West-Friesland concerning Conrad Vorstius, 1619. London: John Bill, 1619. Later life He left Gouda and remained in hiding, mostly in the area of Utrecht. In 1622 Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp offered him a refuge. Shortly before his death he is reported to have drawn up a confession of faith in which he openly professed Socinianism. He died at T√∂nning on 29 September 1622. Vorstian theology While the Calvinists had opposed Arminius' ideas, he was still viewed as Christian and Protestant, and it was difficult to oppose him without appearing to oppose the political powers that had appointed him chair at Leiden University. But upon the appointment of Vorstius the Calvinists had \\"a golden opportunity to present their intervention in politics as a defence, quite simply, of the Christian religion.\\" To them Vorstius \\"was an academic of the most troubling kind, who pushed the framework of scholastic theology to its limits.\\" The historian Sarah Mortimer lists elements of his theology, saying \\"He began to argue that God was not infinite in essence, that his knowledge of the future was limited and that he could not be wholly present in every part of the universe. Though, Vorstius noted, he could not be sure of any of these claims - it was said that he began every theological proposition with the phrase 'it seems that'. Not only did Vorstius appear heterodox but also deeply skeptical, and many of his hearers and readers were convinced that his beliefs and arguments went beyond Christianity, even beyond theism.\\" Vorstian theology did not find any defenders, \\"even those who had backed his appointment dissociated themselves from his opinions.\\" The opponents of the Calvinists focused instead on the ecclesiological point, \\"arguing that it was for the civil magistrate and not the clergy to decide who would instruct students at Leiden University.\\" Hugo Grotius, wishing to detach the issue from both Arminian and Vorstian theology, argued that the states of Holland had the right to appoint the university professors they deemed fit. Vorstius' theology was seen as so heterodox that it became difficult for people to separate it from the question of the rights of the States. Holding his works up as blasphemy and irreligious, the Calvinists derided the political authority of Holland for appointing him to teach the youth. Vorstius did not help his cause as his work began to be influenced by Socinianism (another theological system which questioned the concept of a Trinitarian and infinite god; which was also opposed by the Calvinists). Vorstius began meeting with Socinians and giving their books to his students. He even printed his own edition of one of Socinus's works. Sibrandus Lubbertus championed the Calvinist side, insisting that while they had no intent to encroach on the magistrates' territory, they couldn't sit by while true religion was being molested. He warned that religious divisions were bad for the States and blamed the magistrates for perputating them. Grotius, on the other side, argued that the States could not be judged on religious grounds, and their rights were independent of religious learning or beliefs. The truce with Spain that had allowed the debate was coming to a close in 1621 so there was an urge to have the matter settled before then. Family Conrad's son Adolph Vorstius (Delft, 1597 ‚Äì Leiden, 1663) was to become professor in medicine at the Leiden University in 1636. His son Willem Hendrijk Vorstius (d. 1 October 1652), who studied rabbinical literature, was Remonstrant preacher at Leiden after 1642, and was also suspected of Socinianism. Another son, Guernerus (died March 1682), was also a Remonstrant preacher at Dokkum in 1632, but was banished for five years in 1634. In the following year he returned, only to be arrested and rebanished again, after which he was a preacher at Hoorn (1641), Leiden (1653), and Rotterdam (1658), where he became pastor emeritus in 1680. Guernerus edited his father's Doodsteek der Calvinistische prasdestinate. Descendants of Vorstius were preachers in Dutch Remonstrant churches for a century.

Pultost is an acid-set cheese, and very low in fat. Pultost is found in two variants, spreadable and grainy. The spreadable variant has a stronger taste. Pultost is commonly either spread on bread, lefse or flatbread or served with boiled potatoes. Norwegian dairy products company Tine produces pultost at its dairy at Nybergsund in Trysil. Tine make three qualities: a spreadable, soft type, called L√∏iten, a looser type with a dry and grainy texture, called Hedemark and another grainy type, with stronger flavour, called Lillehammer. Synn√∏ve Finden is another manufacturer of pultost in Norway. The cheese mass is produced by Tine and processed further by Synn√∏ve Finden.

Also known as 'the snake pit', an occasional Sunday afternoon visit to the Snake Man was a tradition for generations of Sydney families.  History  The show was held on the same site in La Perouse since the early 20th century. =\\"Professor\\" Frederick Fox= The original Snake Man was \\"Professor\\" Frederick Fox, also known as the \\"Snake King\\", who was proud of the immunity to snake venom that he had developed. However, like other such showmen, he did have his own special antidote. In 1913, Fox travelled to India to sell his antidote. =Herbert See= Another local, Herbert See, took over the La Perouse show but he was bitten by an Eastern Brown Snake and died in hospital. While demonstrating his antidote in Calcutta in 1914, Fox was bitten several times by a krait. He treated himself but overlooked one bite and died after a few hours. =George Cann= George Cann took on the show in the 1919 and the Cann family ran the show thereafter. Snake bites were an ongoing hazard. John Cann was awarded an OAM in 1992 for service to the community, conservation and the environment. The area surrounding the snake pit has been named Cann Park. The last snake man, John Cann, indicated in 2010 that he was soon to retire. His last show was held on 18 April 2010. The 7.30 Report broadcast a story on Cann on 13 April 2010. =Hawkesbury Herpetological Society= Since John Cann's retirement in 2010, the Hawkesbury Herpetological Society has been conducting the shows every weekend. John Cann is still an active member of the Hawkesbury Herpetological Society, of which he is the patron. In November 2012 it was announced that the La Perouse Museum would include a permanent exhibition to recognise the Cann family. In 2014, the snake pit was damaged by vandals,  Show  The Snake Man performed in a 13 m x 7 m area of grass defined by a metre-high corrugated steel fence. He stood in the 'pit' and removed reptiles one by one from canvas bags to show them to people lining the fence. He held a snake by the tail as he talked about it, or he may have walked around the perimeter of the pit with the reptile just centimetres from the onlookers. Often he allowed a harmless reptile, such as an Australian water dragon, to roam the pit for the duration of the show. At the conclusion of each half-hour show 'the hat' was passed around for a small donation. The show was usually at 1.30 pm on Sundays.

Early life and education Thomas was born in Treboeth, Swansea to John Robert and Lorna (n√©e Harris) Thomas, and she attended Llwyn-y-Bryn High School for Girls. She continued her education at University College of Swansea where she received a first class Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry in 1964 followed by a PhD in 1967. Her thesis was on Hydroxyl-carbonyl interaction in cyclic peptides and depsipeptides. Career and research After her Ph.D. in 1967, Thomas remained with Cambridge at Darwin College until 1969. During this time, she held a Beit Memorial Fellowship for Medical Research at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), a lab dedicated to understanding biological processes in order to solve major problems in human disease. She then served as a member of the University academic staff as well as a Fellow of New Hall, now Murray Edwards College, where she acted as vice president from 1983 to 1987. In 1985, during her time as vice president of New Hall, she received her degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Cambridge. Thomas is a professor emeritus of macromolecular biochemistry at Cambridge and has been a professor there since 1991. She acted as chairman of the Cambridge Centre for Molecular Recognition between 1993 and 2003. In 2007, Thomas became a fellow of St. Catharine's College, and in 2016, she became an honorary fellow. She was elected as the 38th master of St. Catharine's College in 2007, making her the first female master since the college was founded in 1473. Elected by the president and fellows of the college, she remained master until 2016, when she was succeeded by Professor Sir Mark Welland. A scholarship fund called the Jean Thomas Ph.D. Award was created in her honor by alumnus of St. Catharine's Peter Dawson. It grants one fully funded Ph.D. studentship per year to a student at St. Catharine's. Her other contributions to external organizations include serving on the Science and Engineering Research Council, the Council of the Royal Society, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Starting in 1994, she served as a trustee of the British Museum for ten years. In October 2000, she became a governor of the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest biomedical research charity. In 2002 she was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) and she is also a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (FLSW). Between 2000 and 2005, she served as president of the Biochemical Society and was granted honorary membership of that body in 2008. The Wolfson Foundation, an independent charity that supports excellence in science and education, appointed her as a trustee in November 2013. In 2014, Thomas was elected as the second President of the Royal Society of Biology, succeeding Nancy Rothwell of the University of Manchester. In 2018 she was appointed Chancellor of Swansea University. In addition to the many positions she has held, Thomas became an honorary fellow of the University of Wales Swansea in 1987 and of Cardiff University in 1998. She was also granted honorary doctorates in science from the University of Wales in 1992 and from the University of East Anglia in 2002. In 2009, she was ordained as an honorary fellow of Aberystwyth University in recognition of her distinguished career as a Welsh scientist. =Work in biochemistry= Her career as a biochemist has been heavily focused on studying the structure and dynamics of chromatin and its role in the repression and activation of genes via regulatory proteins. She was the first person to isolate and characterize the histone octamer, which ultimately and led to the universal nucleosome model for chromatin structure formulated by Roger D. Kornberg. Kornberg would eventually be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on gene transcription and translation. Thomas's recent work has focused on the in- depth understanding of chromatin proteins, such as high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and histone H1, and their interactions with DNA. In 2007, her research team used NMR mapping to better define the negative regulation of the HMGB1-DNA interaction that was suspected to be largely controlled by the acidic tail of HMGB1. They found that regardless of the length of the acidic tail, it makes extensive contacts with the DNA-binding regions of the two tandem HMG-boxes in HMGB1. A year later, she published a paper describing the opposing effects of H1 and HMGB1 on the nucleosome. Histone H1 was shown to stabilize the structure by winding two turns of linker DNA around the octamer while HMGB1 destabilized the nucleosome by bending adjacent DNA. NMR spectroscopy was again used to show that H1 binds to the acidic tail of HMGB1 via its basic C-terminus, thus halting the HMGB1-DNA interaction. She later described the structure of these interactions as collapsed and sandwich-like, suggesting that it is important for the dynamic activity of the DNA-binding proteins. Thomas also found that HMGB1 plays a role as a chaperone in the binding of transcription factors like p53 to DNA. In 2012, again using NMR spectroscopy, her team solved the structure of the A-box/p53 complex formed by the interaction between the N-terminus of p53 and a single HMG-box of HMGB1. Recently, she studied proteins from Drosophila melanogaster and maize that are analogous to HMGB1 in order to describe a simpler, general mechanism of the self-inhibitive behavior of the DNA-binding regions of the HMG-boxes in HMGB1. She currently continues to lead a team of researchers in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge. =Awards and honours= Outside of her direct involvement at Cambridge, Thomas has received numerous awards and honors throughout her career. In 1982, she was elected as a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), and in 1986 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: She served as the biological secretary and vice-president of the Royal Society for five years beginning in 2008. She became a member of the Academia Europaea (MAE) in 1991, which aims to promote learning, education, and research. She was awarded Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993, and in 2005 she was awarded Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the New Year's Honours List for her services to biochemistry.

Life and career Grave of August Schoenborn at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. He was born in October 1827 in the town of Suhl, Germany, a major arms manufacturing center. He attended the city's public schools, and after graduation worked as a mechanic for three years. Schoenborn enrolled at the Technical Institute and School of Art in 1843 in Erfurt, where he studied architecture. He emigrated to the United States in 1849 and settled in Wisconsin. Two years later, he moved to Washington, D.C. In June 1851, he found a position as a draftsman under Thomas U. Walter, Architect of the Capitol. With only a small scale model and some very rough drawings to work from, Schoenborn produced highly detailed architectural plans. Walter did not initially believe that Schoenborn had done the work himself, but was quickly satisfied that Schoenborn was a trained architect. President Millard Fillmore was also highly impressed with Schoenborn's work, and often visited him in the architectural offices at the Capitol. Schoenborn made two important contributions to the United States Capitol. When the Capitol library burned on December 24, 1851, it was replaced with an iron library which was designed by Schoenborn. Schoenborn also made the original drawings for the new iron dome of the Capitol. When the American Civil War broke out in April 1861, Schoenborn worked as a surveyor and mapmaker for Union Army General Irvin McDowell in Virginia. He also drew numerous plans for barracks, hospitals, and offices for the Quartermaster General of the United States Army. He returned to work on the Capitol in May 1862. Personal life and death Schoenborn spent the post-war years in Washington, D.C. designing numerous public buildings, for which he became very well known. He married Helene Schoenbrun, and had four daughters and two sons. His son William committed suicide on January 4, 1897. He died at his home in Washington, D.C. on January 24, 1902, at the age of 74. A member of Concordia Lutheran Church, he was interred at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Initially trained in internal medicine in Giessen and Strassbourg he received his doctors degree in Berlin in 1894. Kohnstamm then began as a general practitioner in K√∂nigstein im Taunus, a small town in Hesse. There, he became more and more interested in neurology and psychiatry. His wife, Eva, daughter of Johannes Gad - one of Kohnstamm's Berlin professors, agreed to have occasionally depressive patients as guests in the house, who then got chores assigned in housekeeping, gardening or minding the children. Gradually, the idea ripened to build a small sanatorium for treating clinical depressions. The house, build in Jugendstil style, opened in 1905 and was expanded in 1912. Kohnstamm was no follower of Sigmund Freud but worked often with hypnosis. Among his patients were three young men who would become world-famous: the painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), the actor Alexander Moissi (1879-1935) and the conductor Otto Klemperer (1885-1973). Even the playwright Carl Sternheim (1878 ‚Äì 1942) has been in medical treatment in Kohnstamms sanatorium during the First World War. The poets Stefan George, Karl Wolfskehl, the archaeologist Botho Graef and the architect Henry van de Velde have been friends of him. Gertrude Kingston was a cousin of him, Phyllis Konstam a niece. The tale Peter and Anneli's Journey to the Moon, which was written by a former patient Gerdt von Bassewitz, was playing in his sanatorium with his children as the main character.

Battle On May 30, between 12 and 35 heavily armed Islamist fighters arrived in two fishing boats from southern Somalia and clashed with local troops. On June 1, a United States Navy warship, the USS Chafee, shelled hills around Bargal where Islamist militants were reported to have set up a base. The target of the shelling may have been an al-Qaeda operative who the United States believed was involved in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. According to the Puntland regional government, as many as a dozen fighters including Somali militants as well as British nationals, Americans, Swedish, Pakistanis and Yemenis were killed in these operations, and five government troops were injured.
