Despite these dangers, Roberts and five other men of the ship's engineering department entered the engine room to haul the boiler fires and perform other tasks necessary to prevent a boiler explosion. After ensuring the safety of the ship, they then searched for and removed the bodies of the three sailors killed in the initial explosion. For these actions, Roberts and the five other men were approved for the Medal of Honor a month later, on October 4. On 13 June 1911, President Taft presented all six heroes with their medal in a ceremony at the White House. The others were Chief Machinist's Mate Thomas Stanton, Chief Machinist's Mate Karl Westa, Chief Watertender August Holtz, Chief Watertender Patrick Reid, and Watertender Harry Lipscomb.

Found throughout Europe, it is a rare fungus occurring in deciduous forests. The small fruit bodies bear a distinctive smell of coal gas and appear in autumn on damp ground. It is not an edible mushroom. Description The fruit body of Cystolepiota bucknallii is a relatively small, thin-fleshed agaric. The cap is at first hemispherical and becomes convex with maturity. It bears a broad central umbo and reaches 5 cm in diameter. The cap cuticle is white with a lilac or violet tinge. The gills are crowded and not attached to the stipe. Their colour is cream to pale yellow. The stipe is comparatively long (up to 6 cm), slender and bare, tinged lilac or violet except for the uppermost section where it is pallid. Both cap and stipe are covered with a mealy powder which is easily rubbed off. All parts are fragile. The flesh is white, thin and does not bear a distinctive taste. The spore mass is white. With the aid of a light microscope, the spores are seen ellipsoid, smooth and colourless. When Melzer's reagent is applied, the spore walls barely stain; hence, the spores are weakly dextrinoid. Their dimensions are 7.5‚Äì10 ¬µm by 1‚Äì3.5 ¬µm. Cystolepiota bucknallii has a characteristically pungent odour, reminiscent of coal gas or sulphur. Indole is present in this as well as in other similar-scented fungi: Tricholoma inamoenum, Tricholoma lascivum, Tricholoma sulphureum and others. While its edibility is not known, there exists speculation about possible toxicity. Habitat C. bucknallii has been recorded in various countries in central and northern Europe including France, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Russia. It is a terrestrial decomposer which occurs in deciduous forests with moist, calcareous soils rich in nutrients and especially nitrogen. Fruit bodies appear in autumn. Moreover, C. bucknallii is an uncommon or rare fungus whose populations are found in communities harbouring a diversity of other rare species. A population may serve as an indicator for rich, conservable biotopes.

Nikolai, determined to rally sub cultures for the purpose of effecting positive change, invites participants to sign up as Agents and embark on real world missions around the country. The experiential framework for missions was intended to create the feeling of subversion and disruption. Accordingly, The N.O. facilitated a space for members to effect positive change in an manner that felt subversive but was in fact completely legal.

Positive change manifested in a variety of forms. Personalised missions helped individuals achieve their wishes and desires. Over the 3-year period a personal dialogue was maintained by Nikolai and his Agents. In this way the campaign grew with the wishes and desires of its members. Positive social change included planting 24,000 trees on an island in only a few hours, to bringing hot dinners to the sick and homeless to holding underground poker tournaments in car park basements (where all winnings went to charities).

The area is roughly bounded by Interstate 65 and Fall Creek on the north, Interstate 65 and Interstate 70 on the east, Interstate 70 on the south, and Harding Street on the west. History The 36 properties included in the nomination are generally in the period from 1890 to 1930, when Indianapolis was experiencing its greatest economic growth. The oldest property, the Sid-Mar, was built in 1887, while the youngest property, the Wyndham, was built in 1930. The need for apartments in downtown Indianapolis came about as a result of the city's industrial development during the late 19th century, led by the railroad and automobile industries, as well as Eli Lilly and Company. Banking, retail, and educational institutions grew during this time as well. The growth in population in Indianapolis after 1880 was fueled mostly by rural people moving to the city, as opposed to foreign immigration. The city was attractive to people who wanted educational, financial, and social advancement. The apartments and flats built in the city were an affordable alternative for people who wanted to move to the city before marrying or having children. Single women were needed in the workforce during World War I, so they found apartment dwelling acceptable. Young men moving from the countryside were moving away from living in boarding houses and choosing apartments. Architecture A 1904 ordinance by the Indianapolis City Council outlawed wood-frame construction within the downtown area. All of these apartment buildings were built of brick, with some use of Indiana limestone used for ornamentation, lintels, and sills. Most of the buildings are three stories high, except for a few that were considered \\"high-rises\\". There is not a lot of differentiation between architectural styles. Most of the buildings use Classical Revival design features with symmetric facades, pilasters, keystones, and dentil and modillion cornices. Other architectural styles popular at the time, such as Gothic Revival and Second Empire are absent. The Blacherne has a few elements of Richardsonian Romanesque design, while a few bay windows show influence of Queen Anne style architecture in the United States. Tudor Revival architecture began its influence in the 1920s, with the Dartmouth and the Wyndham as examples. The McKay, built in 1924, has Art Deco detailing. Initially, an apartment was defined as a suite of two or three rooms without a kitchen. These were popular with young men. A flat was defined as five to seven rooms, including a kitchen and a dining room, and were attractive to young married couples as well as retired couples. The distinction began to fade by the 1920s, and \\"apartment\\" became the label for any multi-unit rental properties. Properties included in the nomination There were 37 properties in the nomination. An additional eligible property, the Delmar, was demolished while the nomination was in progress. One of the 37 listed buildings, the St. Clair, was removed from the National Register in 1991. The Chardwick and the Harriett were removed in 2011 due to destruction. {| style=\\"width:98%\\" ! ! width = 18% Landmark name ! width = 8% class=\\"unsortable\\" Image ! width = 10% |Date listed ! |Location ! width = 8% |City or Town ! class=\\"unsortable\\" Summary |-- ! 1 The Alameda 100px  37 W.

The undead are another matter. Like any sensible girl, Cassie tries to avoid vampires. But when the bloodsucking mafioso she escaped three years ago finds Cassie again with vengeance on his mind, she's forced to turn to the vampire senate for protection. The undead senators won't help her for nothing, and Cassie finds herself working with one of their most powerful members, a dangerously seductive master vampire- and the price he demands may be more than Cassie is willing to pay. Claimed by Shadow A recent legacy made Cassandra Palmer heir to the title of Pythia, the world's chief clairvoyant. It's a position that usually comes with years of training, but Cassie's circumstances are a little...unusual. Now she's stuck with a whopping amount of power that every vamp, fey, and mage in town wants to either monopolize or eradicate-and that she herself doesn't dare use. What's more, she's just discovered that a certain arrogant master vampire has a geis on her-a magical claim that warns off any would-be suitors, and might also explain the rather ... intense attraction between them. But Cassie's had it with being jerked around, and anyone who tries it from now on is going to find out that she makes a very bad enemy. Embrace the Night Recently named the world's chief clairvoyant, Cassandra Palmer still has a thorn in her side. As long as Cassie and a certain master vampire‚Äîthe sizzling-hot Mircea‚Äîare magically bound to each other, her life will never be her own ... The spell that binds them can only be broken with an incantation found in the Codex Merlini, an ancient grimoire. The Codex's location has been lost in the present day, so Cassie will have to seek it out in the only place it can still be found‚Äîthe past. But Cassie soon realizes the Codex has been lost for a reason. The book is rumored to contain some seriously dangerous spells, and retrieving it may help Cassie to deal with Mircea, but it could also endanger the world. Curse the Dawn Cassandra Palmer may be the all-powerful Pythia now, but that doesn't mean people have stopped trying to kill her. Most of the supernatural power players don't want the independent minded Cassie as chief clairvoyant‚Äîand they'll stop at nothing to see her six feet under. The Vampire Senate does support Cassie in her position, but their protection comes with a price: an alliance with the sexy master vampire Mircea, who has claimed Cassie as his own. But even the vampires will have trouble keeping Cassie alive now that the self-styled god Apollo, the source of the Pythia's power, has it in for her in a big way. To save her life‚Äîand the world‚ÄîCassie's going to have to face down her creator once and for all. Hunt the Moon Cassandra Palmer recently defeated a god, which you'd think would buy a girl a little time off. But it doesn't work that way when your job description is Pythia-the world's chief clairvoyant. Cassie is busier than ever, trying to learn about her power, preparing for her upcoming coronation, and figuring out her relationship with the enigmatic sexy master vampire, Mircea. But someone doesn't want Cassie to become Pythia, and is willing to go to any lengths to make sure the coronation ceremony never happens-including attacking her mother before Cassie is even born. Tempt the Stars Being a goddess is a lot less fun than you might think. Especially when you're only a half goddess, and you only found out about it recently, and you still don't know what you're doing half the time. And when you've just used your not-so-reliable powers to burglarize the booby-trapped office of a vampire mob boss. Yeah, that part sucks. But that's just the tip of the iceberg for Cassandra Palmer, aka the Pythia, the freshly minted chief seer of the supernatural world. After all, Cassie still has to save a friend from a fate worse than death, deal with an increasingly possessive master vampire, and prevent a party of her own acolytes from unleashing a storm of fury upon the world. Totally just your average day at the office, right? Reap the Wind You'd think that being Chief Seer for the supernatural world would come with a few perks. But as Cassie Palmer has learned, being Pythia doesn't mean you don't have to do things the hard way. That's why she finds herself on a rescue mission skipping through time‚Äîeven though she doesn't entirely understand her dimension-bending new power. Rescuing her friend John Pritkin should have been an in and out kind of deal, but with the near-immortal mage's soul lost in time, Cassie has to hunt for it through the ages‚Äîwith Pritkin's demon dad in tow. He's the only one who can reverse Pritkin's curse, but with the guardians of the time-line dead set on stopping anyone from mucking about, Cassie will have to figure out how to get her friend back without ruffling too many feathers‚Äîor causing a world-ending paradox or two... Ride the Storm Ever since being stuck with the job of Pythia, the chief seer of the supernatural world, Cassie Palmer has been playing catch up. Catch up to the lifetime's worth of training she missed being raised by a psychotic vampire instead of at the fabled Pythian court. Catch up to the powerful, and sometimes seductive, forces trying to mold her to their will. It's been a trial by fire that has left her more than a little burned. But now she realizes that all that was the just the warm up for the real race. Ancient forces that once terrorized the world are trying to return, and Cassie is the only one who can stop them... Masks Fifteenth century Venice is the only open port where the masterless dregs of the vampire world can live without fear of attack for violating another's territory. But there are plenty of other ways for a young vampire to die in the most glittering city of the age, as former prince and current pauper Mircea Basarab quickly learns. But there are opportunities, too‚Äîin the service of a secretive courtesan, in the bed of a beautiful senator, and in the hunt for an ancient assassin. A vendetta older than Venice itself comes to a climax as Mircea struggles to evade the dangers of his current life, to come to terms with his past, and to uncover the truth hidden behind a city of masks. Characters Cassandra Palmer Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Palmer is the lead character in seven novels: Touch the Dark, Claimed by Shadow, Embrace the Night, Curse the Dawn, Hunt the Moon, Tempt the Stars and Reap the Wind. A powerful seer, she was brought up by a vampire who wanted to monopolize her gift. She escaped him, but soon her past caught up with her, although not in the way she'd feared. The Pythia, the supernatural community's chief seer, was dying and she tapped Cassie to replace her. That stuck Cassie with a lot of power she doesn't know how to use and a metric ton of new enemies. To make matters worse, a war has broken out in the supernatural community and everyone is choosing sides. Now Cassie is trying to stay alive long enough to figure out how to use the power of her office, and to determine what to do with it when she does. Mircea Basarab Mircea Basarab is a bridge character, playing an important role in both the Cassandra Palmer and Dorina Basarab novels. He also has his own book, Masks, describing some of his history as a five- hundred-year-old master vampire and a member of the Vampire Senate. John Pritkin John Pritkin is from the Cassandra Palmer series. He was a war mage‚Äîa member of the supernatural community's police force‚Äîwith a specialization in demon killing. But then his bosses sent him on a new mission‚Äîto kill the upstart pretender to the pythia's throne, one Cassie Palmer. They didn't want an unknown taking such a powerful position and possibly interfering in their affairs. And they didn't think a demon-hunting assassin would have a problem with a spot of political murder. They thought wrong. Now Pritkin is a former war mage and the pythia's new bodyguard. So far, the move has brought him no pay, long hours, constant stress and has almost gotten him killed at least a dozen times. Francoise Francoise, from the Cassandra Palmer series, doesn't have a last name because she was born a poor village girl in seventeenth century France. She doesn't have much of anything else, either, after getting transported to the 21st century through an alarming series of events. Well, that's not entirely true. She still has her magic, and although it's seriously outdated, at least the Inquisition isn't after her anymore. And she has a new boyfriend who would be perfect if he wasn't possessed by an ancient demon. But Francoise has learned the hard way‚Äîyou have to take what you can get out of life. And she's busy taking everything she can. Tomas Tomas, from the Cassandra Palmer series, also doesn't have a last name. He was born the bastard son of a Spanish conquistador who didn't stay around long enough to impart his surname‚Äîor much of anything else. Tomas could have taken on his master's name, once a life-challenged Spanish nobleman took a liking to him. But after being forcibly changed into a vampire and treated as a slave for four hundred years, he wasn't feeling too chummy. Now, all he wants is his hated master dead‚Äîpermanently. He'll figure out the rest later. Kit Marlowe Kit Marlowe is a crossover character, appearing in both the Cassandra Palmer and Dorina Basarab series. A spy since Elizabethan times, he currently employs his abilities on behalf of the vampire senate. Of course, Marlowe isn't just any old spy; these days, he runs the senate's spy network and he does it very well. He's best known for being handsome, charming, and knowledgeable...and cunning, sneaky and utterly ruthless. Billy-Joe When she was 17, Cassie bought an \\"ugly old necklace\\" from a pawn shop and discovered that it was haunted by a ghost named Billy Joe. Billy had cheated at a card game and was subsequently shoved into a sack and tossed into the Mississippi River at the age of 29. Cassie and Billy are good friends and Billy often works as a good spy because practically none of the supernatural community can see him. He helps Cassie escape from a few scrapes throughout the novels. Louis- C√©sar Louis-C√©sar, a master-level vampire and duelling champion of the European Senate.

The name comes from the fact that they were initially established by Emperor Paul I of Russia in 1797. Paul I abolished Peter the Great's law which allowed each reigning emperor or empress to designate his or her successor, substituting a strict order of succession by proclaiming that the eldest son of the monarch shall inherit the throne, and other dynasts according to primogeniture in the male line. Succession to the Imperial Throne of Russia. Fundamental Laws. Edited under the supervision of Antony, Archbishop of Los Angeles and South California. Order of the Imperial Union of Russia, Bridgeport, Connecticut, 1984. In so doing, Paul implemented a semi-Salic line of succession to the Russian Throne: the throne could henceforth pass to a female and through the female (cognatic) line of the dynasty, only upon the extinction of all legitimately-born, male dynasts. Over time the house laws were amended, and in the late Russian Empire the laws governing membership in the imperial house, succession to the throne and other dynastic subjects were divided, some being included in the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and others in the Statute of the Imperial Family (codification of 1906, as amended through 1911).The Russian Imperial Succession, by Brien Purcell Horan Dynastic marriage In the spring of 1911, Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia became engaged to Prince Konstantin Alexandrovich Bagration- Mukhransky (1889‚Äì1915), a Georgian by birth, serving in a Russian Imperial Guards regiment, who would die in World War I. She was to be the first daughter of the Romanovs to openly marry a Russian subject or non-dynastic prince since the Romanov dynasty ascended the throne in 1613. Her anxious father approached the Emperor Nicholas II and his empress, Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, for approval. On 30 November 1910 Grand Duke Constantine Konstantinovich noted in one of his posthumously published journals (\\"From the Diaries of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich\\", Moscow, February 1994), that he had received assurances that \\"they would never look upon her marriage to a Bagration as morganatic, because this House, like the House of Orl√©ans, is descended from a once ruling dynasty.\\" Previously, the morganatic wives of Romanov grand dukes had been banished from Russia along with their disgraced husbands (e.g., Sophia von Merenberg, Countess de Torby and Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich; and Princess Olga Paley and Grand Duke Paul Aleksandrovich). Female Romanovs had only dared marry morganatically in secret, and the couples‚Äô relationships remained open secrets (e.g., Empress Elizabeth of Russia and Alexey Razumovsky; and the second marriage of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna and Count Grigory Stroganov). Nonetheless, legally, Tatiana Konstantinovna's marriage was morganatic. It was, in fact, the first marriage in the dynasty conducted in compliance with the Emperor‚Äôs formal decision not to accept as dynastic the marriages of even the most junior Romanovs--those that bore only the title of prince/princess--with non-royal partners. According to \\"Always A Grand Duke\\", the 1933 memoir of Nicholas II‚Äôs brother- in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich (published in New York, by Farrar and Rinehart, Inc.), concern about the eventual marriages of cadet Romanovs so troubled the senior grand dukes that Alexander approached the Emperor about relaxing the requirement that all dynasts marry partners \\"possessing corresponding rank\\" enshrined in article 188 of the Pauline Laws, but was rebuffed. The grand dukes then officially petitioned the Emperor through a commission chaired by Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich of Russia, requesting that a new category of dynastic marriages be recognized, to consist of Imperial princes and princesses entitled, with specific Imperial consent, to marry persons of non-royal blood yet retaining the right to transmit to the issue thereof eligibility to inherit the throne. The Emperor‚Äôs response was issued formally on 14 June 1911 in the form of a memorandum from the Minister of the Imperial Court, Baron Vladimir Frederiks:State Archives of the Russian Federation, Series 601. The Emperor Nicholas II. Inventory {register} 1, File 2143, pages 58‚Äì59. > The Lord Emperor has seen fit to permit marriages to persons not possessing > corresponding rank of not all Members of the Imperial Family, but only of > Princes and Princesses of the Blood Imperial...Princes as well as Princesses > of the Blood Imperial, upon contracting a marriage with a person not > possessing corresponding rank, shall personally retain the title and > privileges which are theirs by birth, with the exception of their right to > succession from which they shall have abdicated before entering the > marriage. In relation to the categorization of the marriages of Princes and > Princesses of the Blood Imperial, the Lord Emperor has seen fit to recognize > only two categories in these marriages: (a) equal marriages, i.e. those > contracted with persons belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, and (b) > unequal marriages, i.e. those contracted with persons not belonging to a > Royal or Ruling House, and will not recognize any other categories. As promised in this communiqu√© (the so-called \\"Frederiks Memorandum\\"), the Emperor proceeded to legalize authorized marriages of imperial Romanovs below grand ducal rank to persons who lacked \\"corresponding rank\\". Such marriages had been altogether banned, rather than deemed morganatic, by Alexander III‚Äôs ukase #5868 on 23 March 1889. But ukase #35731/1489, issued on 11 August 1911, amended the 1889 ban with the words, \\"Henceforth no grand duke or grand duchess may contract a marriage with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling house.\\" Both the 1889 and 1911 decrees were addenda to article 188 of the Pauline laws (re-codified as article 63 of the Imperial Family Statute). Left intact, however, was that original statute: \\"A person of the Imperial family who has entered into a marriage alliance with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, cannot pass on to that person, or to any posterity that may issue from such a marriage, the rights which belong to the Members of the Imperial family.\\" Also remaining unrepealed was article 36 (\\"Children born of a marriage between a member of the Imperial Family and a person not of corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, shall have no right of succession to the Throne\\"). Aside from article 188, article 36 applied to prevent Tatiana Konstantinovna's issue from claiming succession rights. Her contemplated marriage having been rendered legal, Tatiana Konstantinovna renounced her dynastic rights, as required. Nicholas II acknowledged this in a ukase addressed to the Imperial Senate on 9 February 1914: \\"Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna has presented to Us over Her own sign manual, a renunciation of the right to succession to the Imperial Throne of All the Russias belonging to Her as a member of the Imperial House,\\"Collection of Statutes and Decrees of the Government. 1914. #441. receiving in return Nicholas II‚Äôs authorization to marry Bagration- Mukhransky (This was the same family into which Princess Leonida Bagration of Mukhrani, wife of Vladimir Cyrillovich, was born). Tatiana Konstantinovna and her Georgian prince were married at her father's estate at Pavlovsk, on 3 September 1911. The Emperor was present at the wedding. On the same day the Emperor issued yet another ukase, (#35766): \\"By Our and Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich‚Äôs and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna‚Äôs consent, the wedding took place on 24th day of this August [old style] of the Daughter of Their Imperial Highnesses, Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna, with Prince Konstantin Bagration-Mukhransky.

Based on Mircea II of Wallachia, he was a noble, along the lines of a prince, in Romania before a gypsy cursed him with vampirism around 500 years ago.  Family  The eldest of three sons, Mircea has two younger brothers, Radu the Handsome and Vlad Dracula, both of whom are vampires themselves and feature in the novels. His mother was a devout Catholic and Mircea credits his own religious devotion to her. He fell in love with a peasant girl, Elena/Helen (both are correct), who worked at the family's castle. When he initially propositioned her, believing himself to be quite good at attracting the opposite sex, she slapped him and he was smitten. Romanian women of the time were expected to be demure and submissive to the extreme compared to modern standards and Mircea enjoyed the challenge. They secretly married and Mircea set up a home for her in a nearby village. Due to her lower social status and the enormous political unrest, Mircea was reluctant to make their marriage publicly known. Elena later gave birth to Dorina, a dhampir, with whom Mircea has a strained relationship.  Transition, Departure, and Return  Due to political unrest in the region, Mircea and his father were eventually attacked by nobles from T√¢rgovi»ôte. His father was scalped, tortured, and killed while Mircea was blinded by hot pokers and then buried alive. As he had recently been cursed with vampirism he was able to dig his way out of the grave. After about a week of noticing things had been different (almost attacking a serving girl), he could no longer deny he was a vampire. In his fear, he arranged for Elena to be left a large sum of money and for her to receive the news of his \\"death\\". He then travelled to Venice where he could operate relatively independently as a masterless vampire with no vampire family to protect him. After a few years, he returned to Romania in hopes of reuniting with Elena, but he discovered she had been murdered in his absence. He also learned of Dorina's existence but could not find her for she had been given to Gypsies shortly after her birth. Dorina, however, later found Mircea by coincidence when she was still rather young and Mircea recognized Elena in her features. He later took Dorina out of Romania to raise her.  Cassie  Mircea met Cassie Palmer when she was a little girl at a vampire named Tony's court, whom he had sired many years ago, while she was living there. He believed she might become the Pythia one day, so when she ran away some years later, he tried to protect her and make sure she wasn't killed. Cassie feels safe with Mircea but is frequently confused as to how she truly feels. They are dating.  Senate and Characteristics  Mircea gained master level status relatively quickly. His master ability deals with the mind, which is a relatively rare gift. He is a member of the North American Vampire Senate and holds the position of Chief Negotiator, also Ambassador, due to his ability to thwart even the most adept mental persuasion from members of other competing senates. He is chary and very skilled at navigating political intrigue.

It tells the story of the famous Battle of Sutjeska, the greatest engagement of the Yugoslav Partisan War. The film is one of the most expensive ever made in Yugoslavia. It was selected as the Yugoslav entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 46th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences It was also entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Special Prize. Plot German-occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1943; under the faithful leadership of Marshal Tito, the Yugoslav Partisans have, for a number of years, put up a staunch fight against the occupying Axis powers. Despite being out-gunned, outmaneuvered and vastly outnumbered, they managed to recuperate in a harsh mountainous region called Durmitor in northern Montenegro. However, their respite is short-lived as the combined foreign and domestic Axis powers begin an encirclement offensive, outnumbering them 6:1. The Partisans have no choice but to fight their way out of the encirclement, then head towards eastern Bosnia. They finally clash with the Axis on the plains of Sutjeska in south- eastern Bosnia. Various people are caught up in the fighting, such as a Dalmatian who lost all of his children during the war. As the fighting intensifies, the story and the scenes are drawn more and more into the colossal battle as both sides are forced into a conflict that can only be described as a living hell. Battle scenes are interlaced with the personal agonies and fates of the main characters, from supreme commanders to ordinary soldiers. The offensive ends in failure for the Axis, but the Partisans are in no mood to celebrate ‚Äî they have suffered devastating losses. Still, on they march.

It follows the deranged archaeologist, Dr Andrew Forbes, as he uses his discovery of a killer bird god, the mythical Quetzalcoatl, to murder his enemies. The film is directed by Sam Newfield and features George Zucco, Ralph Lewis, Hope Kramer and Eddie Acuff.. It was telecast to WCBS in New York on Saturday the 5th of February 1949. The film is also known as Killer with Wings (American recut version). Synopsis  The opening sequence features an introductory text in the form of a scroll which reads: > \\"Near the little city of San Juan, New Mexico, stand the Aztec ruins. > Archeologists tell us they are the remains of a once great temple, abandoned > by the Aztecs when they migrated south to the Valley of Mexico, where they > founded a rich empire. To defeat the greed of Cortez and his Spanish > adventurers who had inaugurated a campaign of loot and murder, the wiley > Emperor Montezuma hid his fabulous treasure far to the north and implored > his native gods to guard it. Among these gods was the feathered serpent--- > Quetzalcoatl.\\" The first scene shows Dr Forbes (George Zucco) driving to the cave in which Quetzalcoatl lives. Here he taunts the serpent and, in doing so, explains that Quetzalcoatl has guarded Montezuma's treasure for 300 years. The creature has been imprisoned behind bars by Dr Forbes; it is revealed that this has been the case for 5 years. Forbes takes a feather from Quetzalcoatl and antagonises the beast, remarking that it will kill to have its feather back. In the next scene, Forbes pretends to unintentionally give the feather to Dr. John Lambert by dropping it on the ground. Lambert, who has recently written an article entitled, \\"Aztec carving of the legendary bird Quetzalcoatl.\\", recognises the feather and acknowledging its worth, keeps it. Forbes returns to the cave and releases Quetzalcoatl which then flies in search of its feather. The beast finds Lambert, who by this point has left his office, it kills him, and returns to its cave. It is revealed that Richard Thorpe (Ralph Lewis) will be undertaking an investigation into the death of Dr. Lambert. Upon hearing this Forbes resolves to plant a feather on Thorpe in order to have him killed. In conducting his investigation Thorpe brings up the point that Forbes' late wife died under similar circumstances to Lambert, suggesting that the two murders may be linked and that Forbes may be implicated in them. Forbes plants the feather with the hope that Thorpe will take it, however, Sheriff Bill Hayes (Henry Hall) spots it first and retrieves it. Forbes returns to the cave and releases Quetzalcoatl to kill Thorpe. However, Hayes is killed as he is in possession of the feather; Thorpe and Hastings are able to spot the beast before it flies off.

There was some criticism of the film due to its resemblance to the 1940 movie, \\"The Devil Bat\\". Notably, author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it \\"Basically a reworking of The Devil Bat.\\" Similarly, American film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a grade of 'C+' commenting that the film is, > \\"A remake of the Devil Bat that offers a slightly different theme and > instead of a bat it offers a special effects flying creature (looking > harmlessly like a stuffed puppet) that's half bird and half reptile... Sam > Newfield shows no imagination or ability...\\" Remake The film was loosely remade in 1982 by director Larry Cohen as Q, starring Michael Moriarty, Candy Clark and Richard Roundtree.

Arthur Irwin (May 27, 1898 - August 9, 1999), was a Canadian journalist and diplomat. He is best known for his work on Maclean's, a magazine with which he held various positions across a quarter of a century. He also served as the Commissioner of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and as Canadian high commissioner or ambassador to various countries. Life and career Irwin was born in Ayr, Ontario, on 27 May 1898 to Reverend Alexander J. Irwin and Amelia (Hassard).http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem‚ü®=eng&rec;_nbr=106660&rec;_nbr_list=1897383,105869,880485,106660 During the First World War he served abroad, before returning to Canada after the end of the conflict to attend the University of Toronto. While still attending the university he made his first steps into journalism, working at The Mail and Empire for $30 a week. He subsequently moved on to work for The Globe, for which he worked until 1925 when he resigned following criticism from the paper's owner about a piece he had written during the 1925 federal election. The same year, he began working for Maclean's. He was initially the magazine's associate editor, becoming the full editor in 1945, although even before this point he was regarded as being the driving force behind the publication. He is credited with having brought a new generation of Canadian artists and writers to prominence at Maclean's, including Pierre Berton, June Callwood, Trent Frayne and Clyde Gilmour. Irwin was a Canadian nationalist, who believed his job at Maclean's was \\"interpreting Canada to Canadians.\\" In addition to his journalistic career in this period, during the 1930s he worked with the Canadian Institute of International Affairs. In the 1940s he also began working for the United Nations, an organisation with which he continued to be associated through to the 1960s. In 1948 he suffered a personal loss when his wife Jean, whom he had married shortly after leaving university, died of asthma. Irwin left Maclean's in February 1950 when he became the Government Film Commissioner, in charge of the National Film Board. He had been recruited to try to restore the Board's public image and combat the perceived threat of communism within the organisation. Some NFB staff were concerned about Irwin's appointment, both because of his complete lack of any experience in the film industry and because Maclean's sister publication, the Financial Post, had made damaging revelations about communist elements in the NFB. However, Irwin made important changes that helped to revive the fortunes of the NFB. He re- wrote the National Film Act, making the organisation independent of government control. He also decided to move the NFB's headquarters from Ottawa to Montreal, believing it would benefit from being away from the capital. It was also at the NFB that Irwin met his second wife, the writer and poet P. K. Page. She was working as a scriptwriter at the NFB when he arrived there in 1950. She had decided to leave the NFB, and Irwin had initially invited her to dinner to try to persuade her to stay, from which had blossomed a friendship which turned to romance, and they married later the same year. Page later commented that her success as a poet would not have been possible without Irwin's support. Irwin left the National Film Board in 1953, to take up work for the Department of External Affairs. He served as High Commissioner to Australia, and then as Ambassador to Brazil, Mexico and finally Guatemala before retiring from diplomatic service in 1964. He then worked as publisher of the Times newspaper in Victoria, British Columbia until his retirement in 1971.

As Director for 48 years (1848‚Äì96), he did much to develop Sydney's Botanic Garden in its modern form. He tackled the problems of poor soil, inadequate water and shortage of funds to develop much of the Gardens in the form we see today. The Palm Grove, in the heart of the Garden, is a reminder of his skill and foresight, as is the reclaimed land behind the Farm Cove seawall which added a significant area to the Royal Botanic Gardens. Nineteen species were named after him by Ferdinand von Mueller  References   External links  * http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050316b.htm * http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/moore-charles.html Category:Australian botanists Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:1820 births Category:1905 deaths ","title":"Charles Moore (botanist)"},{"id":"26044632","text":"Ruben Bierer (Dr. Rubin Bierer, often: Reuben Bierer; born c. 1835 in Lviv; died 1931 lviv.) was a doctor in Sofia and one of the first pioneers of the Jewish nationalism and one of the first active zionists in Galicia and Bulgaria, adherent of Hovevei Zion in Galicia, Austria and Bulgaria. In 1867, he was in Lviv a co-founder of the first Jewish-political association of Austria-Hungary, Shomer Israel. As an opponent against Polish assimilation of the Jews, he established, for the 1873 elections of the Reichsrat, a Jewish- Ruthenian electoral alliance. In 1879, he separated from the Shomer Israel and went to Vienna for the purpose of medical studies where he ‚Äì together with Peretz Smolenskin ‚Äì found the Jewish-political association Ahavath Zion (for the reason of colonisation of the holy land). In 1882, he was a cofounder of the Viennese Kadima Studentenverbindung. In 1883 he returned to Lviv where he founded the first Jewish-national association of the Austrian east, Miqra Kodesh. In 1885, he went to Serbia, in 1900 he returned to Lviv where he successless tried to reactivate the Shomer Israel. Nathan Birnbaum coined the word zionism about the year 1890. But he is not the creator of this word, it was already in use, e.g. you can find in a letter of Ruben Bierer from 9 December 1888 the expression zionist brother's greeting. The word zionist is found already in the year 1877 in an in Roumanian written pamphlet (annual report of the order \\"Zion\\" in Bucharest).M. K√ºhntopf-Gentz: Nathan Birnbaum.

He began his career playing with Eduardo Mateo and Uruguayan rock bands Psiglo and Dias de Blues.Uruguayan Rock Bands He is credited with incorporating jazz, blues and rock influences to urban Uruguayan music as it is ascertained in the book \\"De las Cuevas al Sol√≠s\\"De las cuevas al Sol√≠s by Fernando Pel√°ez. Federico later moved to southern Spain and eventually to Los Angeles where he is a specialty studio musician. He has shared stage, collaborated with, or recorded for artists Andy Williams, Dr. Yusef Lateef, Jon Anderson, Milton Nascimento, Ray Brown, Jr., Freddie Hubbard, Cheb Mami, Joan Sebastian, Alejandro Fern√°ndez, Vicente Fern√°ndez, Jon Hassell, Mark Isham, Elton John, James Moody, Terry Plumeri, Alphonso Johnson, Chester Thompson, and Dionne Warwick. Federico has participated in many films and television shows along films composers such as Hans Zimmer, John Powell, James Horner, Germaine Franco, Danny Elfman and Michael Giacchino. Biography Born in the big town Treinta y Tres, Uruguay, Federico began his studies in Montevideo, capital of the country. The musical roots of his ancestors first directed him to the Southern Coast of Spain and while residing in Sevilla and Jer√©z de la Frontera Federico was involved with flamenco music. Nevertheless, he formally studied classical guitar at the Real Conservatorio de Madrid during the five-year residency. Formal studies were continued first at the Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts and later in California at the Guitar Institute of Technology (MI). In Valencia, at the California Institute of the Arts, he was the recipient of full scholarships. In due course Federico obtained a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and taught a course on Cross-Cultural Improvisation at the California Institute of the Arts. When Federico arrived in the United States in 1980, soon began expanding his musical and cultural spectrum. He settled in Santa Monica. In the eighties Federico co-founded Eternal Wind, a band whose music style was characterized by improvisational compositions of world sounds. Eternal Wind Dr. Charles Moore, Adam Rudolph, Ralphs Jones and Federico, recorded several albums that were released by the Chicago-based Flying Fish Records Co.. Soon, Eternal Wind toured extensively with Dr.Yusef Lateef, who then wrote and composed two symphonic works intended to be performed and recorded by Eternal Wind. One of them, The African-American Epic Suite for Quintet and Orchestra was recorded in Germany with the K√∂ln Radio Orchestra in 1993, and released in Europe by ACT Records. As a member of Eternal Wind, Federico also participated in the recording of Metamusic, also written and conducted by Dr. Lateef exclusively for his quartet. Later on, in 1995, the work The World at Peace of Yusef Lateef and Adam Rudolph (Eternal Wind) performed by 12 musicians, was released by Meta Records. This live performance at the Jazz Bakery of Los Angeles features Federico playing acoustic, electric and midi guitars throughout the session as well as his performance of percussion instruments and African kudu horn. References to Lateef and Eternal Wind association are further explored in Yusef Lateef's autobiography The Gentle Giant. In 1990, Federico Ramos, Eduardo M√°rquez Del Signore and Bernardo Rubaja worked in a debuting ensemble of compositions and performances. The ensemble fused ancient folk traditions of South America with an array of influences spanning jazz, pop, avant-garde and classical music. The instrumental textures and harmonic tints of their native cultures offered a unique and personalized style. Their recorded work Newland, was released by Narada Productions, featuring Mark Isham on trumpet, Alex Acu√±a on drums and percussion and Steve Fowler on flutes. In 1991, Federico was introduced to the Englishman and pioneer artist Jon Anderson of the legendary progressive rock group \\"Yes\\", with whom he recorded. Subsequently, the Windham Hill releases of Deseo, Toltec, The Best Of Jon Anderson-South America 1993 and Deseo Remixes followed. Federico toured as lead guitarist on Jon's Latin American tour of nine countries in 1993. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Federico was guest guitarist performing with Milton Nascimento, Simone and James Taylor, for a benefit presentation in the fight against hunger, Natal Sem Fome (Christmas Without Hunger). Later, the Uruguayan drummer Jos√© Luis P√©rez joined Federico to create P√©rez & Ramos. Their work Flip Flop expressed a contemporary improvisational music based primarily on the Uruguayan rhythms of candombe and African rhythms blending tango, Brazilian melodies and jazz. P√©rez & Ramos Flip Flop was well-reviewed after being released by World Alchemy Records in February 1994.Flip Flop Reviews During the year 1994, Federico was co-producer on the project Heart of Brazil with Dionne Warwick in the recording of Brazilian Artist Eliana Estev√£o. During those years, Ramos co-founded the group Hecho en M√©xico with musicians Luis P√©rez Ixoneztly and Germaine Franco (with whom now he collaborates for film scores). Hecho en M√©xico's music was a junction of pre- Columbian sounds of instruments and language with other contemporary musical expressions. North Star released Calido's Tropical Nights in the year 1994. The duet of Federico and guitarist Ramon Stagnaro featured melodic songs with an array of exotic rhythms of Latin and Spanish compositions. Soon followed the collaboration with Michael Feinstein Michael & George: Feinstein Sings Gershwin, which was nominated for a Grammy. The Savage Rose's disc For Your LoveListen to For Your Love featuring Ramos' guitars was granted the Gold Sales Award in Denmark in 2002. The recording of \\"En Vivo Desde el Auditorio Nacional\\" with Mexican superstar Joan Sebastian was awarded the Grammy for the 2006 best live disc. Also released in 2006 was a DVD of the Latin American Tour with Jon Anderson. For 2007, an educational disc for DW drums under the guide of Alex Acu√±a includes a vast array of Latin American styles. In 1995 Federico again joined with Uruguayan drummer Jos√© Luis P√©rez and Uruguayan bassist Eduardo M√°rquez Del Signore (Jon Anderson's Latin Band). The Trio found in the combination of their sounds the name of Ritual and the compact disc Presencia was released by Amazone Records. Presencia was presented in Montevideo, in the Teatro Sol√≠s in July 1997 with sold out tickets. Ritual traveled to Montevideo accompanied by their guest artist, pianist, composer and producer Tommy Eyre, the Englishman that had arranged Joe Cocker's version of A Little Help From My Friends. From 1996, Federico engaged in different work projects, collaborations and special guest performances. Among these musical productions Federico's highlighted participations are: Cielo y Tierra: Heaven and Earth, Warner-M√©xico 1996, with Jon Anderson, performing acoustic guitars and choirs; putoInternational Inc. 1997, guest guitarist; Adam Rudolph's Moving Pictures: Contemplations, Meta Records 1997, acoustic guitars, charango, oud, bamboo flutes; Cayambe: Influences, Andes Inc. 1997, guitars; Cayambe: America, Andes Inc. 1998, guitars; Heart & Soul, North Sound Music Group 1999, flamenco guitarists (with individual performances also by Ramon Stagnaro and Adam Del Monte), soloist guitars, composer and arranger. During the early months of 1997, Sony Music contracted Federico as producer of Alexis Pe√±a's recording project. For this occasion Federico convoked the participation of renowned musicians such as Alex Acu√±a and Alphonso Johnson (\\"Weather Report\\"), Alex Ligertwood (\\"Santana\\") and Tommy Eyre (B.B. King, George Michael, Gary Moore). In February 2001 The African-American Epic SuiteReview The African-American Epic Suite by Dr. Yusef Lateef with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. For over a decade, Federico toured with famed, multi-Grammy award winner Mexican singer Joan Sebastian throughout Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and the U.S.. In 2016 and 2017, Federico toured with The Alphonso Johnson Band, feat. the maestro Chester Thompson in Chicago, and throughout Argentina and Uruguay, where he also taught clinics. He is a dedicated studio musician collaborating in recordings, and music for films and TV shows. Ramos was the guitarist for the Disney animated film Coco, and performed one of the songs at the 90th Academy Awards.

A map of the world.  Nature of geography   Geography is  * an academic discipline - a body of knowledge given to ‚àí or received by ‚àí a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities ‚àí not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'. * a field of science - widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals. ** a natural science - field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography). ** a social science - field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography). * an interdisciplinary field - a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.  Branches of geography  As \\"the bridge between the human and physical sciences,\\" geography is divided into two main branches: *human geography *physical geography Other branches include: *integrated geography *geomatics *regional geography All the branches are further described below...  Physical geography  * Physical geography - examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation & life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.  Fields of physical geography  * Geomorphology - study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling. * Hydrology - study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability. ** Glaciology - study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice. ** Oceanography - studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. * Biogeography - study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal ecological changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living 'refugium', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.Martiny JBH et al. Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map Nature: FEBRUARY 2006 VOLUME 4 * Climatology - study of climate, scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of time. * Meteorology is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology). * Pedology - study of soils in their natural environment that deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification. * Palaeogeography - study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment. * Coastal geography - study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast. * Quaternary science - focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period. * Landscape ecology - the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.  Approaches of physical geography  * Quantitative geography - Quantitative research tools and methods applied to geography. See also the quantitative revolution. * Systems approach -  Human geography  * Human geography - one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the built environment and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.  Fields of human geography  * Cultural geography - study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially. ** Children's geographies - study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of foci within children's geographies include: *** Children and the city *** Children and the countryside *** Children and technology *** Children and nature, *** Children and globalization *** Methodologies of researching children's worlds *** Ethics of researching children's worlds *** Otherness of childhood ** Animal geographies - studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature- society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights). ** Language geography - studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language: **# Geography of languages - deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). The geography of languages. In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. Readings in cultural geography. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93. **# Linguistic geography - deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.Trudgill, P. (1974). Linguistic change and diffusion: description and explanation in sociolinguistic dialect geography. Language in Society 3:2, 215-46.Trudgill, P. (1983). On dialect: social and geographical perspectives. Oxford: Basil Blackwell; New York: New York University Press.Trudgill, P. (1975). Linguistic geography and geographical linguistics.

The Dictionary of Human Geography, Gregory, Derek; Smith, David M., Second edition, Oxford: Blackwell, 252-3. ** Sexuality and space - encompasses all relationships and interactions between human sexuality, space, and place, including the geographies of LGBT residence, public sex environments, sites of queer resistance, global sexualities, sex tourism, the geographies of prostitution and adult entertainment, use of sexualised locations in the arts, and sexual citizenship. ** Religion geography - study of the influence of geography, i.e. place and space, on religious belief. * Development geography - study of the Earth's geography with reference to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. Measures development by looking at economic, political and social factors, and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs). * Economic geography - study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as \\"linkages\\"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization. ** Marketing geography - a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.\\"Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data\\", Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010 It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix ‚Äì the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting). ** Transportation geography - branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials. * Health geography - application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers. ** Time geography - study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints: # Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities # Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep # Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task * Historical geography - study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and \\"real\\" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape. * Political geography - study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory. ** Electoral geography - study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior. ** Geopolitics - analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international. ** Strategic geography - concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations. ** Military geography - the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war. * Population geography - study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places. * Tourism geography - study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the environmental impact of tourism, the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism. * Urban geography - the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.  Approaches of human geography      Harrison, Paul; 2006; \\"Post-structuralist Theories\\"; pp122-135 in Aitken, S. and Valentine, G. (eds); 2006; Approaches to Human Geography; Sage, London - * Qualitative geography - qualitative research tools and methods applied to geography.  Integrated geography  * Integrated geography - branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.  Geomatics  * Geomatics - branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.  Fields contributing to geomatics     * Global navigation satellite systems represented by - Any system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning *    Regional geography  Regional geography - study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions. Region - an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.  Realm - broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. ** Ecoprovince - biogeographic unit smaller than a realm that contains one or more ecoregions. ********************* = Natural landforms = The Ganges river delta in India and Bangladesh is one of the most fertile regions in the world. The volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington, United States. Natural landform - terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, stratification, rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies). * - rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill. ** - clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands). ** - human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American \\"small towns\\" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British \\"small towns\\" would qualify as cities in the United States. *** - ranks the structure of towns within an area. **** - bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk. ******** - relatively large and permanent settlement. In many regions, a city is distinguished from a town by attainment of designation according to law, for instance being required to obtain articles of incorporation or a royal charter. **** - the leading city in its country or region, disproportionately larger than any others in the urban hierarchy. *** - very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications. *** - region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.Squires, G. Ed. Urban Sprawl: Causes, Consequences, & Policy Responses. The Urban Institute Press (2002) *** - city that is deemed to be an important node in the global economic system. Globalization is largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales (including global cities) according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade. *** - chain of roughly adjacent metropolitan areas. An example is the huge metropolitan area along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. extending from Boston, Massachusetts through New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland and ending in Washington, D.C.. *** - theoretical \\"continent city\\".

Geographers are historically known for making maps, the subdiscipline of geography known as cartography. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and wildlife ecologies, weather and climate patterns, economics, and culture. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.  Influential physical geographers  Alexander Von Humboldt, considered to be the founding father of physical geography.

Geography Geography 1 ","title":"Outline of geography"},{"id":"26044793","text":"The Sierra de la Ventana (also Sierras de Ventania) is a mountain range in Buenos Aires Province, and one of the only two located within the Pampas ecosystem. Overview Bounded approximately by the Laguna del Monte, Guamin√≠ at its northwestern end and the Atlantic Ocean to its southwest, the Sierra de la Ventana lies on a precambrian base formed around 2.2 billion years ago, and is interspersed with granite, granodiorite, and amphibole deposits. Characterized by its escarpments, this orography prevented the deposit of significant amounts of loess, and make the area the least propicious to agriculture within the pampas; sunflower fields are common along the foot of the range. Its soils feature a A-AC-C horizonation, not unlike those found along the Appalachian range. Its climate is rather colder and drier than that prevailing in the surrounding Humid Pampas, though the range receives more rainfall than the Semi-arid Pampas, located to the west. Sizable extensions of lacebark pines grow along the range, possibly introduced from Asia. Peppered by caves and grottoes, the range is relatively modest in height and extension, and exceeds 1000 m (3280 ft) at only six points. These peaks are: *Cura Malal Chico (1000 m) *Cura Malal Grande (1037 m) *Napost√° Grande (1108 m) *La Ventana (1184 m) *Destierro Primero (1172 m) *Tres Picos (1239 m) British naturalist Charles Darwin described his ascent of the Sierra de la Ventana range in the sixth chapter of his work The Voyage of the Beagle.Charles Darwin, The Voyage of the Beagle p. 113 The region's breezes and mild climate made it of tourist interest since the early part of the 20th century, and its principal early promoter was Ernesto Tornquist, a prominent rancher, banker and developer.

Unsupervised learning methods rely on knowledge about word senses, which is barely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases. Supervised learning methods depend heavily on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense, a requisite that can be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes, as it is done in the Senseval exercises. Existing methods Therefore, one of the most promising trends in WSD research is using the largest corpus ever accessible, the World Wide Web, to acquire lexical information automatically.Kilgarriff, A.; G. Grefenstette. 2003. Introduction to the special issue on the Web as corpus. Computational Linguistics 29(3) WSD has been traditionally understood as an intermediate language engineering technology which could improve applications such as information retrieval (IR). In this case, however, the reverse is also true: Web search engines implement simple and robust IR techniques that can be successfully used when mining the Web for information to be employed in WSD. The most direct way of using the Web (and other corpora) to enhance WSD performance is the automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora, the fundamental resource to feed supervised WSD algorithms. Although this is far from being commonplace in the WSD literature, a number of different and effective strategies to achieve this goal have already been proposed. Some of these strategies are: * acquisition by direct Web searching (searches for monosemous synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, parsed gloss' words, etc.), * Yarowsky algorithm (bootstrapping), * acquisition via Web directories, and * acquisition via cross-language meaning evidences. Summary Optimistic results The automatic extraction of examples to train supervised learning algorithms reviewed has been, by far, the best explored approach to mine the web for word sense disambiguation. Some results are certainly encouraging: * In some experiments, the quality of the Web data for WSD equals that of human-tagged examples. This is the case of the monosemous relatives plus bootstrapping with Semcor seeds techniqueMihalcea, Rada. 2002. Bootstrapping large sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), Las Palmas, Spain. and the examples taken from the ODP Web directories.Santamar√≠a, Celina, Julio Gonzalo & Felisa Verdejo. 2003. Automatic association of Web directories to word senses. Computational Linguistics, 29(3): 485‚Äì502. In the first case, however, Semcor-size example seeds are necessary (and only available for English), and it has only been tested with a very limited set of nouns; in the second case, the coverage is quite limited, and it is not yet clear whether it can be grown without compromising the quality of the examples retrieved. * It has been shownAgirre, Eneko & David Mart√≠nez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automatically retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona, Spain, 25‚Äì33. that a mainstream supervised learning technique trained exclusively with web data can obtain better results than all unsupervised WSD systems which participated at Senseval-2. * Web examples made a significant contribution to the best Senseval-2 English all-words system.Mihalcea, Rada. 2002a. Word sense disambiguation with pattern learning and automatic feature selection. Natural Language Engineering, 8(4): 348‚Äì358. Difficulties There are, however, several open research issues related to the use of Web examples in WSD: * High precision in the retrieved examples (i.e., correct sense assignments for the examples) does not necessarily lead to good supervised WSD results (i.e., the examples are possibly not useful for training).Agirre, Eneko & David Mart√≠nez. 2000. Exploring automatic word sense disambiguation with decision lists and the Web. Proceedings of the COLING Workshop on Semantic Annotation and Intelligent Annotation, Luxembourg, 11‚Äì19. * The most complete evaluation of Web examples for supervised WSDAgirre, Eneko & David Mart√≠nez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automatically retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona, Spain, 25‚Äì33. indicates that learning with Web data improves over unsupervised techniques, but the results are nevertheless far from those obtained with hand-tagged data, and do not even beat the most-frequent-sense baseline. * Results are not always reproducible; the same or similar techniques may lead to different results in different experiments. Compare, for instance, Mihalcea (2002Mihalcea, Rada. 2002b. Bootstrapping large sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), Las Palmas, Spain.) with Agirre and Mart√≠nez (2004Agirre, Eneko & David Mart√≠nez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automatically retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona, Spain, 25‚Äì33.), or Agirre and Mart√≠nez (2000Agirre, Eneko & David Mart√≠nez. 2000.

Proceedings of the COLING Workshop on Semantic Annotation and Intelligent Annotation, Luxembourg, 11‚Äì19.) with Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999Mihalcea, Rada & Dan Moldovan. 1999. An automatic method for generating sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Orlando, U.S.A., 461‚Äì466.). Results with Web data seem to be very sensitive to small differences in the learning algorithm, to when the corpus was extracted (search engines change continuously), and on small heuristic issues (e.g., differences in filters to discard part of the retrieved examples). * Results are strongly dependent on bias (i.e., on the relative frequencies of examples per word sense).Agirre, Eneko & David Mart√≠nez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automati- cally retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona, Spain, 25‚Äì33. It is unclear whether this is simply a problem of Web data, or an intrinsic problem of supervised learning techniques, or just a problem of how WSD systems are evaluated (indeed, testing with rather small Senseval data may overemphasize sense distributions compared to sense distributions obtained from the full Web as corpus). * In any case, Web data has an intrinsic bias, because queries to search engines directly constrain the context of the examples retrieved. There are approaches that alleviate this problem, such as using several different seeds/queries per senseMihalcea, Rada. 2002b. Bootstrapping large sense tagged corpora.

Future Besides automatic acquisition of examples from the Web, there are some other WSD experiments that have profited from the Web: * The Web as a social network has been successfully used for cooperative annotation of a corpus (OMWE, Open Mind Word Expert project),Chklovski, Tim & Rada Mihalcea. 2002. Building a sense tagged corpus with Open Mind Word Expert.

The station aired between 12noon Sundays and 12noon Fridays, with Surf City Sound broadcasting on the same frequency during the Shabbat period. During 2010 and 2011, Lion FM held a Temporary Community Broadcasting Licence, and broadcast from the Melbourne CBD. History As a TCBL Melbourne Jewish Radio was established in December 2008, with the goal of achieving a form of dedicated full-time broadcast media for the Jewish community. Previously, the Melbourne Jewish community had little representation in the media, aside from Hebrew language programmes on 3ZZZ and SBS Radio. In June 2010, broadcasting regulator Australian Communications and Media Authority granted Melbourne Jewish Radio, Inc. a 12-month TCBL on 96.1 FM ‚Äì a frequency formerly used for special events ‚Äì with reduced power towards Geelong due to potential co-channel interference from 96three FM. In June 2011, the spectrum was revoked, forcing Lion FM to close. In a media release, ACMA stated they \\"decided not to make additional radiofrequency spectrum in the Melbourne City RA1 licence area available to temporary community broadcasting licensees.\\" During Senate Estimates on 18 October 2016 Eric Abetz said to ACMA Deputy Chair Richard Bean he was advised \\"Lion FM stopped using 96.1 for broadcasting\\" and went on to query Richard Bean about why the frequency had not been made available subsequently. As a Narrowband station In December 2011, Lion FM began broadcasting on 1674 AM, as a timeshared service with Surf City Sound. Both services closed in March 2015.

He was caught at the port of Le Havre at the end of September 1869 while attempting to flee the country. Convicted after a three-day trial on December 30, 1869, Troppmann was executed publicly by guillotine outside the gates of La Roquette Prisons on January 19, 1870. His murders, trial, and execution were extensively reported in the French press, and this reporting was a major milestone in the development of the French tabloid press (the petite presse or the presse √† un sou.) For example, Le Petit Journal, the bestselling newspaper in France, more than doubled its daily circulation, selling 594,000 copies the day of Troppmann's execution. The Attorney General at Paris, Th√©odore Grandperret, gained much attention for his indictment of Troppmann. He receives an offhand mention in Mikhail Bakunin's book God and the State,, written a few months after his execution, and his execution was witnessed and written about by Ivan Turgenev.

The building, which was completed in 1986, was opened to residents in 1987 and comprises 148 apartment units ranging in size from studios to three-bedroom apartments.Does not account for apartment combinations The building thumb The Forum, which was designed by architect Elliott Vilkas, is often noted from a distance for its pronounced sloping curtain wall on the building's south side. The sloping glass wall was designed to provide optimum light for the duplex and triplex units that occupy the top floors. The building's massing is also noted as unique for a midblock building, with roughly half of its frontage set back to create a small plaza along 74th Street featuring two-story arched windows at the base of the building. The apartments in the building range in size from studios to three-bedroom penthouse units. The building's top five floors make up a penthouse complex, comprising a small number of large three-bedroom duplex and triplex apartments. The Forum is located roughly equidistant between First and Second Avenues, whereas taller buildings in Manhattan are typically located at the corner intersection of an avenue due to zoning restrictions. The Forum is located between the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral and the Jan Hus Presbyterian Church. Also located on the same block as the Forum are The Cathedral School and IPS (The International Preschools). Among other amenities, the building features a parking garage, health club, roof deck and concierge. Each of the units in the building includes a washer dryer unit, which was relatively unique in the mid-1980s when the building was constructed. History The Forum was originally developed by the Carlyle Development Corporation and designed by the Vilkas Group and completed in 1986. The building, which has 148 cooperative apartments was opened to residents in 1987. During the construction of the Forum, the zoning restrictions between 59th Street and 96th Street were changed to limit the construction of large mid-block buildings.Trager, James. The New York Chronology: The Ultimate Compendium of Events, People, and Anecdotes. Harper Collins, 2003. p. 785 The ownership of the Forum is structured as a condop with the residents of the building's residential units owning a single condominium through a corporation. The Forum was among the most notable examples of the use of the condop structure when it came into vogue in the 1980s. The land on which the Forum is located was leased from the church, located next door, through a ground lease that extends for 149 years from 1987 through 2136.

His father Sunit Kumar Banerjee did his Ph.D. on Elizabethan lyrics under Sir H. J. C. Grierson, the famous discoverer of the metaphysical poets, at University of Edinburgh in the 1930s, and subsequently became a professor of English literature. If his scholarship inspired the younger Samik to study English literature, his political consciousness inspired Subrata, the eldest of his sons, to joining Communist Party. Bandyopadhyay entered college in 1955, graduated from the University of Calcutta in 1961, and subsequently earned a Master of Arts degree in English literature. He started working as a lecturer Rabindra Bharati University in 1966. In 1973, he joined the Oxford University Press as an editor and worked there till 1982. He resigned and never sought an employment because no job was lucrative enough for buying the books he wanted to read. He took up tutoring English literature for his profession, which enriched his reading as well as brushed his critical edge.Bandyopadhyay, 2001, pp. 16-18. He continued book editing, however, with Seagull Books, till 1988, and then with Thema Publishing. Bandyopadhyay joined the Communist Party of India after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, -i.e., with full knowledge of the Soviet discovery of the truth about Stalinist era, when many of Indian Marxists were leaving the Communist Party out of the disgust that ensued. Later on, he also witnessed incorporation of Gramscian thought in Indian Marxism. In 1993, his book Antonio Gramsci Nirbachita Rachansamagra was published in Calcutta. On theatre His first writing on theatre, on the actor Mei Lanfang of Beijing opera, was rather insignificant. His next article was on Jatra performances he saw in 1962; that was published in Bohurupi patrika. His love with theatre intensified and he started interviewing contemporary stalwarts of Bangla theatre, e.g., Utpal Dutt, Badal Sircar, Sombhu Mitra, among others, for further clarifications on their works. His assessment of Nandikar's 1969 production of Tin Poysar Pala, and adaptation of Brecht's The Threepenny Opera: > \\"When we have a production of The Three Penny Opera which simply goes in for > wild fun, we regard it as a compromise, a betrayal. The production has no > point when there is serious political violence in Calcutta. ... This is > status quo theatre, which means nothing to a generation that thinks in > political terms.In interview with Gunawardana, \\"Problems and Directions: > Calcutta's New Theatre\\", Drama Review, vol 15, no 3, Spring 1971: 242 Foucault's influence on him seems to be a later development. For instance, in 1986, he opines that in Vijay Tendulkar's play Ghashiram Kotwal, 'power is defined 'horizontally' (in the sense in which Maurice Duverger uses it in his The Idea of Politics, London, 1966)'. He does not bring in Foucaulding discourse of power yet. In his 2003 introduction to a collection of Tendulkar's plays (including Ghashiram Kotwal'), however, he sees them evolving around the hub of 'strong ethical concern exploring and critiquing the relations of power in all their complex ramifications' where power is 'what Michel Foucault defines as 'the relationship in which one wishes to direct the behaviour of another'. On film Introducing his translation of the script of Mrinal Sen's Akaler Sandhane, Bandyopadhyay wrote in 1983 that this film raised 'disturbing questions about the Indian reality today and about the capacity of the medium to tackle this reality.'Sen, Mrinal. 1983. In Search of Famine (Akaler Sandhane). Calcutta: Seagull Books. p. vii. Samik has been questioning that capacity of film all along. In general, his assessment is as follows: > Bangla theatre or film did not enter into the social-political complexities > of the 1970s. The emblemized angry young man of Kolkata could relate to his > rural other only on the platform of Marxian theory; rest of the commonality > is mere wrath. The urban youth is portrayed not as directly participating in > revolutionary activities: he is either hiding, or attacked or living a dual- > life. This is the general portrait of Bangali angry young man as seen in > theatre and films.Bandyopadhyay, 2001, p. 155.

He is the youngest son of Tito Jackson. Career 3T released their debut album Brotherhood in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international hit with their debut single \\"Anything\\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \\"24/7\\", \\"Why\\" (a duet with their uncle Michael Jackson), \\"I Need You\\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \\"Tease Me\\" and \\"Gotta Be You\\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the Spice Girls, as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for soundtracks to films such as The Jacksons: An American Dream, Free Willy, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, Men in Black and Trippin'. Taryll and TJ have written/produced tracks for their aunt Janet Jackson as well as for Lindsay Lohan and Bruno Mars. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album Brotherhood, which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T') and a surprise performance of the Oasis hit, \\"Wonderwall\\". The Lost Album (1998-2002) Over 20 songs were recorded for the album and only 12 would have been on it. 3T completed the album in-between Brotherhood (1995) and Identity (2004). The album however was never released by Sony, due to strained relationships between Michael Jackson (MJJ Music) and Sony. This album is considered by many fans to be The Lost Album. Identity (2003‚Äì2005) After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in 2003, 3T continued to perform in France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances and performances. The album titled Identity was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: \\"Stuck On You\\" (a cover of the Lionel Richie song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and \\"Sex Appeal\\" in 2004. Neither single was released outside of Europe. In 2008, 3T made Identity available on both iTunes and amazon.com worldwide. On-and- off appearances (2007‚Äì2011) The brothers appeared on the show This Is David Gest in 2007, including recording the theme tune \\"Crazy Kinda Guy\\". The show began on April 22, 2007. They appeared in an episode where Gest took cameras for a rare glimpse of the Jackson family house in Encino, California, where he met Tito and 3T as well as matriarch Katherine Jackson, as well as a later episode showing them recording the theme tune. During the summer of 2008, the Jackson family (including Tito) stayed at a holiday let (rental) for six weeks in Appledore, Devon, England while searching for a house to buy in the area. The project was filmed for a Channel 4 documentary called The Jacksons are Coming, which was aired in 2008. Taj and TJ appear with their father, but Taryll did not join them on the trip. The three family members also attended a Michael Jackson fan event in Devon as part of their stay, ringing him up during the event which led to Michael talking to the fans over a loudspeaker on the phone. All three of them appeared on the A&E; TV show entitled The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty. They appear with their father Tito, who is trying to convince them to relaunch their career. On January 31, 2010, the three brothers appeared on stage at the 52nd Grammy Awards to support their cousins Prince Michael Jr. and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, as they accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of their father Michael Jackson. On February 1, 2010, all 3 brothers then appeared in the remake of \\"We Are The World\\", this time in aid of the Haiti Appeal. However, they did not sing main parts of the song, only in the background. Currently, Taj is working on the Code Z zombie series and a science fiction project called Clone 3. TJ was selected to play the role of Prince Jean-Luc in the new stage version of Larry Hart's musical Sisterella that was scheduled to premiere in the fall of 2011. Taryll is working on his first solo album that he hopes will make his family and fans proud. On October 8, 2011, 3T performed at the Michael Forever ‚Äì The Tribute Concert held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. They performed the Jacksons' track \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" (also known as \\"This Place Hotel\\") followed by their own number 2 hit single \\"Why\\", which was originally a duet recorded with Michael for their 1995 album Brotherhood. At the end of the performance of \\"Why\\", all 3 brothers broke down into tears. They then appeared in the finale of the show performing Michael's hit \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\" with various other performers from the concert as well as members of the Jackson family who had been in attendance, including Michael's children Prince, Paris and Blanket (Prince II). Co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children (2012) On August 25, 2012, a judge granted TJ guardianship over Michael Jackson's children Michael Joseph \\"Prince\\" Jackson Jr., Paris Katherine Jackson and Prince Michael \\"Blanket\\" Jackson II along with his grandmother Katherine Jackson. On November 1, 2017, Jackson resigned as co- guardian of Michael's youngest son, Blanket. Jackson stated her reasons for resigning included her own advanced age, the fact that Michael's older children Prince and Paris were now adults, and that Blanket was now 15 years old. T.J. Jackson was, without objection, awarded sole custody of Blanket. Sharing Love Charity Tour Italy (2013) After almost two years away from the stage, 3T performed live on stage in Rome, Milan, Torino and Verona during four charity concerts in Italy from December 5 to 8th. 3T performed a 30-minute show and the set list featured 'Stuck On You', 'Anything', 'I Need You', the new song 'Forever Girl', 'With You', a jam session (Ed Sheeran's 'The A-Team', Oasis' 'Wonderwall' and 'Give Me All Your Lovin') and 'We Are The World'.

As of 2014 it had a population of 36,274. Recensement de 2004 (Institut national de la statistique) Ksour Essef is noted as the birthplace of the poet Youssef Rzouga.  Etymology  According to oral tradition, the site was occupied by a system of ruined Roman fortifications, which served as a refuge for sparrowhawks (s√¢f), whence it got the name \\"Sparrowhawk Castle\\". This legend contains a note of truth because a text attests that the aristocracy of Mahdia, located twelve kilometres from Ksour Essef, was accustomed to hunt sparrowhawks in the region of Salakta and its environs.  Geography  Ksour Essef is divided into many suburbs, including El Baabouss, El Tafalla, Bab El Ksar and Mallaji city. There are several beaches near the village of Salakta.  History  The creation of the city coincided with the arrival of Banu Hilal in 1050. After the destruction of the city of Salakta and the arrival of the Arabs, most of the punic, Greek and Roman inhabitants converted to Islam. Ksour Essef cuirass on display in the Bardo National Museum One of the must beautiful pieces in the Bardo National Museum is a bronze cuirass found in a local sepulture, discovered in 1910. It is an import from Italy datable to c.300 BC. The deceased had been buried in a sarcophagus of cypress wood which had traces of the ochre used at the funeral, as did the bones. This coffin is similar to that found at Gigthis with the following dimensions: 84 cm high, 180 cm long and 68 cm wide.  Economy  Ksour Essef's economy is based on agriculture, fishing, commerce and emigration. In fact, migrants participate directly in its economic development and invest in it, especially in the construction of houses and the establishment of commerce and industry. In addition, a market occurs on Fridays in the central city. Further, in this region, part of the population also lives from the product of the olive and has lately benefited from the supply of electricity and water in the zensfine, groups of family houses which have cultivated olives together for many generations.

It is known for the important political role that its inhabitants, especially the youth, played in the manifestations during the tunisian revolution between december 2010 and February 2011.  Geography  It is located a few kilometers from Tunis downtown, on the road to Oued Ellil. It is limited by Hay Ettadhamen to the east, La Manouba to the west, Den Den to the south and Oued Ellil to the north. Its territory covers 1,125 hectares.  Evolution  The city was part of Ariana governorate until 2001, date of the creation of the Manouba governorate, to which it got attached as one of its eight municipalities.  Administrative geography  Administratively attached to the governorate of Manouba, it has a delegation and a municipality with a population of 82,532 inhabitants in 2014, which makes it one of the most important towns in the suburbs of Tunis. Besides Douar Hicher, the municipality has other agglomerated cities such as Ennassim, Erriadh, Echabeb and Khaled Ibn El Oualid.  History  The inhabitants of Douar Hicher, especially the young among them, played a very important role in the popular demonstrations against the dictatorship of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali which led to the 2011 revolution. The district, with that of Ettadhamen, represents an almost obligatory stop in electoral campaigns, both presidential and legislative  Economy  Much of the town's population works in the local factories which have made Douar Hicher a local industrial center. Among the most widespread activities, we can mention: * Textile industry * Wood and furniture industry; * Leather industry * Glaze industry * Marble industry; * Metal door industry; * Iron machinery industry; * Plastic industry But even with this diversity, the socio-economic level of Douar Hicher remains one of the poorest in Tunisia. Before independence, the local population depended a lot on solidarity funds 26-26 promoted by ex-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. During the latter era and until now, the youth of Douar Hicher, like many other neighborhoods in greater Tunis, suffer from one of the highest unemployment rates in the whole country due to the marginalization that Ben Ali's system created and those who followed maintained. According to official figures, this rate is two to three times higher than the 15.5% recorded nationally, especially among young people with university degrees  Douar hicher and Politics   Before the revolution  Before the revolution, the Tunisian people lived under a dictatorial regime that practiced repression and marginalization in the country. Before the revolution, the youths of Douar Hescher suffered from marginalization in the political, social and economic spheres. Indeed, the youths of Heather Hecher were absent and away from participation in the political life that was lacking in the country before the revolution, in addition to the fragile economic conditions of young people who suffer from unemployment, absenteeism and exclusion, and it means a lot of discrimination. All of these factors led to a situation worsening and caused a lot of youth to become very angry, which led to the outbreak of protests, demanding a change of situation and demanding a revolution.  After the Revolution  Following the outbreak of the revolution and the escape of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the political situation in the Hescher roundabout changed, and freedoms of freedom of expression, opinion and participation in political life became possible. The youth became practicing their freedoms in all fields (religion, politics, art, freedom of expression,etc). A glimmer of hope has emerged to change the situation and improve the situation of young people in the Hescher roundabout. However, the hoped-for change did not happen, it is true that all freedoms are available to young people, but in the economic sphere the situation did not change, but rather increased in worsening. And the economic situation of young people is misleading. The benefits of the revolution and the youth have not been achieved  Douar Hicher and Culture   Cultural infrastructure  The cultural infrastructure of the city of Douar Hescher is very limited. It has only one cultural center and two public libraries. In spite of these few resources, the local civil society is active, by organizing activities for the youth and engaging them in debates in the cultural center in Douar Hescher and even outside. For many young people, especially girls, these activities are the only way to entertain. The culture center also regularly presents films for children, followed by meetings or workshops led by professionals depending on the topic of the month. The city also has three training centers for people interested in crafts. These centers also provide craftsmen with spaces to display and sell their products. Its total capacity spans over 6000m 22. According to a study conducted by a group of sociologists on youth from the Hescher and Solidarity Circle, 55% of active associations are athletic, 18.5% non-profit, 10.3% cultural, and 10.5% religious. This study shows that only one out of every four young adults knows at least one active connection in their neighborhood.  Media  The city has a radio and a local radio station who is presenting cultural, sports and local news.  Douar Hescher and Sport  Sports are the most popular entertainment activity in Douar Hicher. More than half of the local associations are sporting, something which has pushed the government to invest in the infrastructure of these activities by developing a multidisciplinary sports center inaugurated in 2018 by the former Prime Minister Youssef Chahed.  Douar Hescher and Education  According to the official website of the town, it includes 18 schools ,5 primary schools and 3 high schools. That said, according to a study carried out on a representative sample of Douar Hicher's youth in 2018, 51.7% of young people stopped their studies in high school, and only 27.9% went to higher education7. The researchers find that violence within these establishments, something which was confirmed by 20% of the young people questioned, is one of the main causes for dropping out of school. It is also estimated that the average absenteeism rate in the schools of Douar Hicher and Ettadhamen combined is 60%.

Following the disaster of the Caudine Forks, where both Roman consuls were obliged to surrender their army and pass under the yoke, opinions in Campania were divided as to whether the defeat would forever halt the progress of Roman arms down the Italian peninsula.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ix. 1-7.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. The Samnites were of the opinion that their victory would ensure a permanent peace with the Romans; and indeed, peace did hold from the time of the surrender in 321 until 316 BC. Calavius, one of the most distinguished men of Capua, the greatest city of Campania, witnessed the grim procession of the defeated Romans, who were escorted to the borders of the country and allowed to return home with their lives. His view of the Roman attitude to their defeat was less sanguine; he predicted that the humiliation of their defeat foreshadowed the eventual return of Roman arms, and grim days ahead for the people of Campania.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ix. 7.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Calavius' suspicions proved to be correct; hostilities resumed in 316 BC, and despite some early setbacks, and the intervention of the Etruscans in 311, the Romans persevered, and the Samnites sued for peace in 304, bringing the war to an end. The city of Capua retained its independence, but became a Roman ally.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ix. passim. Family The Calavii were a leading family in Campania for generations. Calavius (whom some manuscripts call by the Latin praenomen Aulus, instead of the Oscan praenomen Ofilius), was the son of Ovius Calavius, and apparently father of the brothers Ovius and Novius Calavius, who in 314 BC headed a conspiracy to mount an insurgency against the Romans.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ix. 7, 26.Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft. A century later, during the Second Punic War, Pacuvius Calavius held the chief magistracy at Capua, and by a clever stratagem, prevented the Capuan senate from surrendering the city to Hannibal. Although the city eventually capitulated to the Carthaginian general, Calavius became his honored guest. When his son disclosed a plan to assassinate Hannibal, Calavius was able to dissuade him from this rash deed.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 2-4, 8, 9. Some of the Calavii were subsequently held responsible for a series of fires set at Rome in 211 BC, supposedly set in revenge for the treatment of Campania by the Romans.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxvi. 27.

Michael Mancini is notable for being the only character who was present for the original show's entire run. Storylines Melrose Place During the first season, Michael begins as a very dedicated husband to Jane, and the show chronicles their troubles as a couple. Towards the end of the first season, Michael has an affair with colleague, Kimberly Shaw, causing Jane to file for divorce and kick him out of their apartment. Michael then moves into a beach house with Kimberly, but yet again has an affair with his ex-sister-in-law Sydney Andrews, Jane's younger sister. Kimberly breaks up with Michael but they briefly get back together when he asks her to marry him. She happily agrees but their bliss is very short since they get into a serious car accident. Michael is injured badly, but Kimberly is left comatose and is taken back home by her mother, who later claims that Kimberly later died of her injuries. Meanwhile, Sydney blackmails Michael into marrying her and their marriage is mostly one sided. When Kimberly shows up alive at the end of season two, he goes back to her and divorces Sydney. He later marries Kimberly in season three. Michael's marriage to Kimberly ends when he cheats on her with Amanda Woodward, causing Kimberly to have a mental breakdown. After Kimberly blows up the apartment complex, he gets back together with Sydney. While he was dating Sydney again, he tried to have an affair with his ex-wife, Jane, but whom Sydney drugs. After finding out Sydney drugged Jane, he breaks up with her, and gets back together with Kimberly. Kimberly and Michael later renew their vows. After Kimberly falls ill from a brain aneurysm, she hires a prostitute named Megan to have an affair with Michael so he can enjoy sex. However, things turn sour when Michael and Megan's relationship becomes more than just sexual. Michael and Kimberly then divorce for good, and he marries Megan in Las Vegas. In season seven, Michael begins a relationship with Lexi Sterling who breaks up with him after his marriage proposal.

History Built on a mountainside along a single street, the place was frequented by the Romans of Carthage, who came here by boat and called it Aquae Calideae Carpitanae (Eaux de Carpis), due to the hot springs rising to more than 50¬∞C, as evidenced by the many Roman remains and an inscription now on display at the Bardo National Museum. Fallen into oblivion, the site was only frequented by a local population after the Arab conquest.

It would be on the site of an ancient mausoleum dating back to the second century BC. J. - C., as Fernand Benoit thinks in 19314.

History Lunni, built in 1976 by Werft Nobiskrug GmbH in Rendsburg, Germany, was the first ship of a series of four arctic product tankers ordered by a Finnish oil and petroleum products company Neste Oyj in the 1970s. The ships were given names after Finnish seabirds and the silhouettes of their namesake birds were painted on the side of the ships' superstructure. Lunni (Atlantic puffin) and Sotka (Aythya) were delivered in 1976 and Tiira (tern) and Uikku (grebe) in the following year. Until the 1990s the ships were used mainly to transport oil products in the Baltic Sea. In 1993 Lunni made three consecutive voyages from Arkhangelsk to the Yana River in Siberia along the Northern Sea Route. The tanker was assisted by nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Vilkitsky Strait, but was under constant escort by Russian icebreakers only from Dikson Island to the Khatanga River.Muhlerin, N et al.: Northern Sea Route and Icebreaking Technology , pages 13-14.

In 1994, a year after her sister Uikku, Lunni was also chartered to Arctic Shipping Services to ship petroleum products in the Arctic Ocean. After Uikku 's successful refit her propulsion machinery was also modernized for navigation in the harsh ice conditions of the Arctic Ocean in 1994. Her ice-strengthening was later increased as well. In the following years Lunni operated in the Baltic Sea in winter and in the Northern Sea Route during summer months.Juurmaa, K et al.: New ice breaking tanker concept for the arctic (DAT) . Kvaerner Masa-Yards, 1995. Fortum sold Lunni, mainly due to her age exceeding 25 years, to Murmansk Shipping Company in 2003. She was renamed Indiga (–ò–Ω–¥–∏–≥–∞) after the Indiga River. As Fortum is a state-owned company, the selling of two oil tankers capable of navigating in severe ice conditions resulted in a written question to the Parliament of Finland by Representative Pentti Tiusanen about whether the ships should be retained in Finnish control as they could be used to lighten a grounded oil tanker in harsh winter conditions.KK 137/2003 vp, Pentti Tiusanen /vas The ship has since been used for oil transportation in the Arctic Ocean. Along with her sister ship Varzuga (ex-Uikku), sold to Russians at the same time, she has been involved in transporting oil from an oil terminal in the Ob Bay of the Kara Sea through the Kara Gates, the strait between Vaygach and Novaya Zemlya, to FSO Belokamenka in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea.Bambulyak, A and Frantzen, B: Oil transport from the Russian part of the Barents Region, Status per January 2009, page 41.

Design Lunni and her sister ships were designed to be able to navigate in the ice conditions of the Baltic Sea independently without icebreaker assistance and maintain a moderately high speed in ice. For this purpose they had more power than an average Baltic tanker and were normally required to use only 50-75% of the full engine power in iceH√§nninen, S: Ship based observations onboard MT Uikku during the winter 2003 , 11/2003. ‚Äî in normal operation only one of the two main engines was coupled to shaft, with the other remaining in reserve for difficult ice conditions.Gallin, I. et al. Ships and Their Propulsion Systems - Developmentsr in Power Transmission. Lohmann & Stolterfoht GmbH, Witten, West Germany. . The highly raked stem, similar to those in traditional icebreakers, was designed to break the ice by bending it downwards under the ship's weight. The ships were also equipped with an air bubbling system to reduce friction between the hull and ice.Mulherin, N et al.: Development and Results of a Northern Sea Route Transit Model, pp. 15-17. Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), 1996. Retrieved on 2010-02-05. To prevent pollution in case of grounding the ships were also built with double hulls and conformed to the IMCO regulations in respect of segregated ballast tanks even though they were regarded only recommendations back then. Modernization A year after Uikku 's successful refit Lunni was also extensively modernized by Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards' Helsinki New Shipyard in 1994 and became the second merchant ship to receive a newly developed electronic azimuth thruster, Azipod. Her original MaK 12M551AK main engines (2 √ó 5737 kW), reduction gearbox, shaft generators, controllable-pitch propeller and rudder were removed and replaced with W√§rtsil√§ Vasa marine generating sets and an 11.4 MW electric propulsion unit. Being one of the early designs the Azipod unit in Lunni was of the so-called \\"pushing\\" type with an aft-facing propeller instead of the more efficient \\"pulling\\" set-up usually used in modern Azipod-equipped ships.Photograph of Lunni 's Azipod unit , Aker Arctic Technology Inc. As with Uikku, upgrading the propulsion machinery dramatically improved Lunni 's manoeuvering and icebreaking capabilities, especially when running astern. Even though the ship's stern wasn't originally designed or shaped for icebreaking, ice resistance astern in level ice was only 40% of that of when running ahead despite the icebreaking bow. The modernization of Lunni and Uikku also further proved the feasibility of Azipod in icebreaking ships and the double acting tanker (DAT) concept as navigation in the severe ice conditions in the Northern Sea Route sometimes required the ship to be turned around and run astern to break through ice. The refit also increased her speed from 14.5 to 17 knots despite the propulsion power remaining roughly the same.

Haynes enrolled in the Colorado School of Mines, studying Geologic Engineering (with the Mining Option) for two years. Like his father, Haynes entered the USAF; he served for almost four years 1951‚Äì1954. During this time, he was posted to air bases in Fairbanks, Austin, El Paso and in Albuquerque. At each station he indulged his interest in archaeology, and sought contact with some of the early researchers studying Paleoindian traces. He was interested in rocketry and guided missiles, and was posted to special weapons units, including a stint at Sandia Base adjoining Albuquerque. In the Albuquerque area on his days off, he explored early human settlement sites with an Air Force colleague. After his military stint, Haynes returned to the Colorado School of Mines, earning his Bachelor of Science degree in geology and archaeology in 1956.  Archaeology  Attracted by the school's program in geochronology, Haynes entered the University of Arizona at Tucson for graduate study. As well, he was drawn by the Paleoindian research being performed by Emil Haury. Under Haury, Haynes and professor George Agogino began in 1960 to gather charcoal samples from many sites of ancient human activity in the Great Plains, returning to the university's new radiocarbon dating equipment to process the samples and establish as narrow a time range as possible. From this work, Haynes established the first reliable dates for the Folsom tradition and the Clovis culture. Later, Haynes became one of the leading proponents and defenders of 'Clovis first' theory. For many years, he was very critical of all proposed pre-Clovis sites. He earned his PhD in 1965, and joined in archaeological digs at Hell Gap and Sister's Hill in Wyoming. Fred Wendorf invited Haynes to join the High Plains Paleoecology Project (HPPP), an association which led to his first work at the Clovis archaeological dig, Blackwater Draw Locality 1\\\\. His careful dating of Clovis carbon traces provided Haynes with one of the most significant advances in the understanding of early human activity and migration in North America. Tule Springs Archaeological Site Haynes has primarily been interested in determining how the New World was populated by humans. Other interests of his include studies of the Quaternary extinction event, the Pleistocene‚ÄìHolocene transition in which megafauna died off in great numbers. Haynes has studied both modern and historic climate change, human occupation of the Sahara, and battlefield archaeology.Dr. C. Vance Haynes Jr., School of Anthropology, University of Arizona. Haynes has studied the disappearance from Earth of its largest animals approximately 11,000‚Äì10,900 years ago. Using contrary evidence, he questions the theorists who say that humans killed off the large mammals by predation, as well as the theorists who look to an asteroid impact. Haynes notes that the extinction period could have been as short as one century‚Äîhe concludes that too little is known, and more research must be undertaken to achieve complete understanding.Harrison, Jeff (April 22, 2009) \\"Did a Significant Cool Spell Mark the Demise of Megafauna?\\" UANews, University of Arizona.

Geoarchaeology of Egypt  In the 1960s, Haynes began research into geoarchaeology of middle and late Paleolithic sites in the Western Desert of Egypt. He investigated the geochronology of playas, landscape evolution, processes of sand movement, and other relevant subjects. In this, he was influenced by the work of Ralph Bagnold. He also documented previously unknown Paleolithic sites and the historic camps of early desert travelers.

This layer is associated with the Younger Dryas cooling episode 10,900 B.P. to 9,800 B.P., and covers the surfaces on which the last remnants of the terminal Pleistocene megafauna are recorded. According to Haynes, 'black mat' is a general term that also includes the similar other deposits of various shades of grey or even white, because some Younger Dryas marls and diatomites are actually white to grey in colour. Also, at least at the Murray Springs Clovis Site, raised levels of radioactivity were associated with the mat. This radioactivity had not been there before the mat formed. Magnetic grains were also found.Richard Firestone, Allen West, Simon Warwick-Smith, The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes: How a Stone-Age Comet Changed the Course of World Culture. Inner Traditions / Bear & Co, 2006 p48 In the late 1990s, it was reported that, in the North American Great Basin area, black mats actually occur between 11,000 and 6300 BP (cal).

History Thyna is located in the area of the Roman city (') of Thenae. It is the most important archaeological site in the vicinity of Sfax. Thyna was the southernmost city in the Roman Province of Africa and became a colony under the Emperor Hadrian (117-138). Little remains on the site, but traces can be seen of Roman villas, bath-houses, an early Christian basilica, a necropolis, and tannery. The town was considered to be on the frontier between the Carthaginian territory and the Berber kingdom of Numidia. Many objects, including some of the mosaics, have been removed to the museum at Sfax. The main point of interest is the \\"Baths of the Months\\"; the mosaics here are intact but largely covered with sand. Nearby is a smaller bath house, and parts of the walls of the Roman town can still be traced. A temple has been excavated as well as some dwellings beside a Roman street. Geography The town is traversed by the RN1 which connects Sfax to Gab√®s. The town has an industrial area that was built in 1999, and to the west lies the Sfax-Thyna International Airport. There are salt mines nearby extending over an area of about and producing 300,000 tonnes of salt a year. On the coast are saltmarshes which are visited by large numbers of migrating water birds.

As of 2004 it had a population of 6,405. Recensement de 2004 (Institut national de la statistique) Bir El Hafey (Arabic: ÿ®ÿ¶ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÅŸä), located about thirty kilometers south of Sidi Bouzid, in the southern foothills of the Tunisian ridge. Attached to the governorate of Sidi Bouzid, it is a municipality with 6,475 inhabitants in 2014. It is also the capital of a delegation. It is in crossroads position on the Kairouan-Gafsa axis because crossed by the RN3 while being connected to Sidi Bouzid, the chief town of the governorate.  History  Bir El Hafey is the modern site of the Ancient, notably Roman, city of Nara. H.H. Abdul Wahab identified Bir El Hafey with the medieval city of Jamunis (aka Jam≈´nis al- SƒÅb≈´n), one of the main cities of the Qammuda region. Jamunis is first mentioned in the 10th century, when it became the capital of Qammuda under the Zirid dynasty, replacing the nearby city of Madhkur, which had been sacked by the forces of Abu Yazid. However, Jamunis was probably an important city before this. It was the site of a battle in 1030 between the Zirid ruler al- Mu'izz ibn Badis and the Zenata Berbers, which al-Mu'izz won. Jamunis is no longer mentioned after the 11th century, having been sacked by the Banu Hilal. Al-Bakri described the city of Jamunis as being surrounded by sand and olive trees and having a strong fortress which served as an agadir (granary). He wrote that it was surrounded by many large and prosperous villages. Al- Muqaddasi mentioned the village of Khawr al-Kaf as being among those villages. Jamunis also had many fig and almond orchards, as well as a jami mosque.  Ecclesiastical history  Nara was important enough in the Roman province of Byzacena to become a suffragan bishopric of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Hadrumetum, but faded.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, (Leipzig, 1931), p. 467.Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), p. 240.J. Mesnage, L'Afrique chr√©tienne, (Paris, 1912), p. 77. There are three bishops documented from Nara. *Crescenziano participated in the Council of Cabarsussi, held in 393 by the Maximianists, a dissident sect of the Donatists, and he signed the council's acts. * The Donatist Gennaro intervened at the 411 Carthage conference, which saw the Catholic and donatists from all over Roman North Africa debate. On that occasion the town had no Catholic bishops. *Vittore was present at the synod assembled in Carthage in 484 by King Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom. After the council Vittore was exiled.  Titular see of Nara  The diocese was nominally in 1925 restored as a Latin titular bishopric. Nara at www.catholic-hierarchy.org. Nara at www.gcatholic.org.

They conspired to mount an insurrection against the Romans, but when their conspiracy was discovered, and steps taken to prevent their plan from coming to fruition, they did away with themselves rather than face arrest.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Background In 321 BC the Romans had suffered a humiliating defeat at the Caudine Forks, where both consuls were obliged to surrender their army and pass under the yoke. The Romans were escorted to the borders of Campania and allowed to return home with their lives. Ofilius Calavius, father of the two brothers, warned that the sting of their defeat would likely be erased only with the return of Roman arms and the renewal of the war.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ix. 1-7. After five years' peace, the war was resumed. In 314 BC a number of plots against the Romans were suspected and investigated. These may have been encouraged by the harsh treatment of Luceria, whose inhabitants had given up the Roman garrison to the Samnites.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita ix. 25, 26. The conspiracy At Capua, Ovius and Novius Calavius conspired with other Capuan nobles to mount an insurgency against the Romans. When this plot was discovered and reported to the Roman Senate, the alarm wrought by the potential defection of a nominal ally prompted the appointment of a dictator. Gaius Maenius, who had been consul in 338 BC, was nominated, and as his magister equitum he chose Marcus Foslius Flaccinator. Before the dictator's investigation could begin, and evidence could be given against them, the brothers took their own lives, thereby escaping trial.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita ix. 25, 26.

The magazine had its origins in the Canadian Society of Cinematographers (CSC), which began publishing a bi-monthly newsletter under the name Canadian Cinematography in 1962. In 1967, the publication's name was changed to Cinema Canada. In 1972, the CSC approached George Csaba Koller and Phillip McPhedran of Toronto to produce a glossier format. However, this association lasted only four issues, after which McPhedran resigned for personal reasons. Koller continued to edit and publish the magazine, which became independent of the CSC in the fall of 1973. It was scrappy, provocative and ashamedly nationalistic. In March 1975, a non-profit organization, the Cinema Canada Foundation, was formed, and in September of that year it was transferredto Jean-Pierre Tadros and Connie Tadros, who moved the editorial office to Montreal while maintaining a Toronto office. Jean-Pierre had been the film critic for Le Devoir and editor of Cinema Quebec and had been a contributor to Cinema Canada. At first it was published 10 times a years, then it went monthly until its last issue in 1989. In all, there were 169 issues published over the span of 18 years. A home for Canadian nationalists and cinema activists in the 1970s, Cinema Canada became the voice for The Council of Canadian Filmmakers, a lobby group of filmmakers and industry professionals campaigning for a quota for Canadian movies in the American-owned theatres. The Toronto office became a hub for the emerging Toronto New Wave in the 1980s, and Bruce McDonald edited Cinema Canada's \\"Outlaw\\" issue in the fall of 1988. Toronto's staff included, at one time or another, Tom Perlmutter (future National Film Board of Canada Commissioner), John Harkness (influential film critic for Now weekly), Cameron Bailey (future Toronto International Film Festival co-director) and Wyndham Wise, who would go on to publish and edit Take One: Film and Television in Canada (1992‚Äì2006). The impending GST and removal of postal subsidies in 1991 were the official reasons given when the magazine folded. The underlying truth, however, was that Cinema Canada had lost its reason for being. The production climate in Canada had changed considerably from the days in the early 1970s, and the magazine eventually lost its constituency. Cinema Canada provides a unique and rich historical resource for scholars of Canadian cinema and the original documents and papers are held as a special collection in TIFF's Film Reference Library in Toronto.

Background Kaiserbahnhof Potsdam The Kaiserbahnhof HalbeThe best source of information is the 22-page booklet published in 2006 by Landkreis Dahme-Spreewald: Der Kaiser Kommt. is a receiver station, of which a number were built in Germany. A receiver train station is a separate building in a train station for highly placed individuals - in this case the German emperors or kaisers. This receiver train station was built in 1865 in the town of Halbe for the exclusive use of Germany's emperors until 1912 when the station was converted to civilian residential use. The Kaiserbahnhof Halbe lies just outside the town of Halbe which is about 40 km southeast of Berlin. East of the town is a level crossing from the main street which leads to Halbe's train station. Parallel to the railway track about 10 meters apart from each other to the north is the Public Building and Station to the south the extraordinary and historic listed property, the Royal train station building, also known as the Royal reception building. In older sources and postcards of the station it is known as the Emperor station or is designated the Imperial Hunting Seat for the Hohenzollern family. Separate receiver stations are known in Germany as Furstenbahnhofs. Others are the Kaiserbahnhof at Potsdam, at Bad Homburg and at Kierberg. History The history of Halbe station is closely linked with the development of the Prussian railway system after 1838 the first Prussian railroad track had already been opened from Berlin to Potsdam. In the following decade, almost further connections to the capital Berlin were developed. A second rapid development phase of the railway began in the 1860s. In little more than a decade the number of the tracks emanating from Berlin doubled. Cottbus-G√∂rlitz line The first new building of this second construction phase was the Berlin connection with Cottbus from G√∂rlitz. A royal decree of 1858 smoothed the way for its construction. Bethel Henry Strousberg,Strousberg is frequently referred to as \\"The Railway King\\" (Der Eisenbahnk√∂nig). See Roth, Ralf (Frankfurt): The Rise and Fall of the Railway King Henry Bethel Strousberg: Difficulties of International Railway Investments in Germany in the 1860s the railway king of this time, formed the Berlin G√∂rlitz Railway Company. A cabinet order of May 1864 approved the building of the railway by Strousberg's corporation. The initial distance to Cottbus was completed in 1866, and to G√∂rlitz in 1867. The line's main station in Kreuzberg, Berlin was designed in 1866-68 by August Orth. The Halbe train station on this line was used from 1866 until just after the First World War in 1920 when the building was adapted for other uses, primarily with the installation of partitions and with the height of the rooms being reduced with false ceilings. Furthermore, a single-storey porch was added to the structure to the south and the goods sheds to the north was extended. Architect Portrait of August Orth The Royal reception building was designed by the renowned Berlin architect, August Orth. The building,for which a full set of plans survive and which are held by the Universitats Biblioteck der Technischen Unitersitat, Berlin probably a gift of the railway company to Kaiser Wilhelm I, served as the starting point for his hunts in the extensive forests surrounding Halbe. The emperor used the Royal reception building, which was administered by a house yard master, on only six occasions. It was from there that he travelled by coach to the hunting lodge: Forsthaus Hammer. August Orth was one of the most important architects in Berlin in the second half of the 19th Century. Beside numerous churches (e.g. the 1865 Zion Church in Berlin) he was particularly famous as the architect and planner for the rapidly developing railway network. He is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Berlin's metropolitan railway. From the 1860s he was the preferred architect of the railway tycoon Henry Strousberg Bethel, for which he sketched a splendid palace in 1867/68 which became known as the Palais Strousberg at 70 Wilhelmstrasse and was the British Embassy from 1877 to 1939 and in Berlin's Wedding district the large cattle and slaughterhouse from 1868. The buildings for the Berlin Gorlitz railway, which also developed from his Strousberg connection, are an outstanding example of Orth's work. The most important building was the Gorlitz railway station (1866‚Äì68) in Berlin. This station became famous but was destroyed in World War Two. The site today comprises a small cafe in the remaining building which is open in the summer and a large park. The Royal reception building in Halbe is an important example of architect August Orth's work. Architecture The station reception building comprises a half-red building of exposed bricks, whose wall surfaces are highlighted with horizontal strips of yellowish clay bricks. It consists of the actual reception building adjacent to a single-storey shed goods directly to the north. The station reception building had a ticket hall, restaurant and official residence as well as other facilities. The simple decoration of the building is complemented by ornaments such as round windows. Exterior The Royal reception building is a rectangular, single-storey building of exposed red bricks with four towers. The towers each enclose five arched arcades which overlook the free standing area to the east and to the railway tracks to the west. At the track side there are two entrances. From the free standing area by the entrance there was access by horse and carriage. The building is again crowned by an eagle carved out of porcelain, and coloured red. As with the station reception building, the wall surfaces consist of red clay bricks laid horizontally and broken by bands of yellow clay bricks. All joints are mortared with red mortar. The straight lines and the regularity of the brickwork are emphasised by the joint line. The upper level is surrounded by a parapet wall, which incorporates the remaining windows and wall openings. Interior Completion of the 2010 interior demolition worksThe inside of the Royal reception building comprises three principal rooms with complex, magnificent painted ceilings. In the design drawings these are called 'Vestibule', 'Waiting room for the Emperor' and 'Room for the Attendants'. Finally there was a 'toilet & closet' as well as an area for the servants. With the 1920 changes, intermediate partition walls and ceilings were inserted, with the original space remaining hidden above the false ceilings. The original ceilings with their golden painted stucco with narrow ribs, staff bundles comprising oak leaves and shells are again visible and restored now that the 1920 additions have been removed. A stone spiral staircase in the northeast tower gives access to the first floor. The interior was vastly altered in 1920 to convert the Kaiserbahnhof to civilian use, with the space being converted to 3 apartments, from 13 newly created rooms. These were removed in 2010, as the first stage in the restoration of the building. Halbe Station buildings The ensemble of the station building, Royal reception building and cargo building in Halbe is unique in Brandenburg. The buildings are all important examples Prussian railway buildings in the second half of the 19th Century. Comparable royal reception buildings The Royal reception building in Halbe documents the railway company's enthusiasm for assisting the emperor. The building is the earliest example of a building reserved for the emperor and his guests in Brandenburg. Comparable buildings are the later emperor stations in Zehdenick Neuhof (1888), Joachimsthal (1899) and Potsdam (1906). Restoration New windows, August 2011 New garden, July 2019 Having falling into disrepair in the 1990s, the Kaiserbahnhof has now been restored to its 1865 state. The initial works beginning in the summer of 2010 involved removing the 1920 additions which converted the building to three apartments, making the building watertight and connecting water, gas and power, repairing and replacing the roof, repairing and cleaning the brickwork. In 2011, the windows at the first floor level were restored, the external brickwork repointed and the two decorative north towers rebuilt. The 2012 works focused on the restoration of the two south towers, repairs to the exterior brickwork, the garden and preparing for more extensive repairs to the interior, particularly on the ground floor. The restored Kaiserbahnhof is to include a small cafe and museum. The restoration was the subject of a front page story in the Markische Allgemeine newspaper of 12 June 2010 under the title: The neue Kaiser.Issue number 134 of the 65th year, article by Andrea Muller and in the same newspaper on 10 August 2011 under a similar title: Mister Macky ist der neue Kaiser.Issue number 185 of the 66th year, article by Andrea Muller It has also been the subject of a story in the New Zealand Herald's Viva Magazine of 29 April 2011 under the title: At Home: The Station Master.Article by Owen Scott There has also been an article by expat New Zealander Andre Gifkins on 4 September 2012 in Slow Berlin.http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/2012/09/03/restoring-halbes- kaiserbahnhof/ During 2013 further restoration works were undertaken being primarily incorporating a damp course barrier, laying concrete floors in the ground floor and laying drainage pipes for surface and ground water to a collection pit built in the garden to the south of the building. The ground floor windows and doors were restored in 2015. The interior restoration of the King's Room, the Salon for the Attendants and the Vestibule commenced in May 2015 and was completed in 2016. These works had been the subject of much debate as to the methodology. Whether to do a partial restoration, adopting techniques successfully applied to Berlin's Neues Museum, to leave the interior largely 'as is' or to undertake a complete restoration, so that the interiors will look much like they did when the building was completed in 1865. After much discussion the decision was made to undertake a complete restoration. The remaining works to complete the restoration were progressed between 2016 and 2019. In addition, a new building, known as the 'Neubau' was built to the north of the Kaiserbahnhof. This new building houses the kitchen, lavatories and 'back of house' for the cafe. A major feature of the restoration was the garden, which is now fully restored, based on the 1865 plan. Also restored, were the two flagpoles which grace the building's north and south gable. They were an important feature of August Orth's 1865 design, were removed some time ago and have now been rebuilt.

Situated between La Goulette, the port of Tunis, and Carthage, it opens onto the Gulf of Tunis to the east and the Lake of Tunis to the west. As of 2004 it had a population of 58,152. Recensement de 2004 (Institut national de la statistique) Before 2001, Le Kram was a municipal district within the municipality bordering La Goulette. The original name of the city was Aga El Kram; it was Gallicised as Le Kram. The word kram in Tunisian Arabic refers to a fig tree or a fruit tree in general. Professor Mohamed El Aziz Ben Achour says of the town's founder: > \\"Mustapha Aga [...] living peacefully in his palace in the area of Carthage, > in the midst of an extensive orchard with fig trees, the source of the name > of the village which was established later in this location... \\" Ahmad I ibn Mustafa, Bey of Tunis under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, gave this orchard to Mustafa Aga, who served from 1837 to 1855 as war minister in the Kingdom of Tunis. Under the French protectorate, Kram was home to many Europeans who built houses along the beach, some of them modest and others sumptuous. These villas have been replaced by military training centers and the residential area of Kram Salammbo. One can still admire some of the gardens that surrounded the houses; the oldest were built in an Islamic Tunisian style, while the larger homes of the bourgeoisie were built in a purely Italian style, exemplified by La Carmencita, a small villa located on the street Sakiet Sidi Youssef (formerly Rue Jules Ferry). The town was developed mainly as a result of the opening of the Tunis-Goulette-Marsa or TGM railway combining the Khereddine line and the La Goulette-Carthage Salammb√¥ line. The center of Salammb√¥ contains, among other curiosities, the remains of the port of Punic Carthage, the Tophet (or sacred area) of the ancient Carthaginians and the buildings of the Institute and Museum of Oceanography  See also  *List of cities in Tunisia  References   External links  * Category:Populated places in Tunis Governorate Category:Communes of Tunisia Category:Tunisia geography articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ","title":"Le Kram"},{"id":"26046349","text":"Sidi Hassine is a town and commune in the Tunis Governorate, Tunisia.

They were built by Belgian railway rolling stock manufacturer La Brugeoise et Nivelles between 1911 and 1919 for the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company's (Compa√±√≠a de Tranv√≠as Anglo-Argentina, CTAA in Spanish) first underground line. They were originally designed to run both as metro and tramway cars, but they were refurbished in 1927 for underground use only. They were the oldest underground rolling stock in commercial service in the world as well as a tourist attraction and part of Buenos Aires cultural heritage.  Technical information  thumb Premetro. The La Brugeoise trains were designed to run using either 550 VDC - as surface tramways did until the system was eradicated in 1962- or 1,100 VDC in the tunnel. Traction is controlled through a 9-power run (originally 11-power run) handle, known as the \\"controller\\", the motorman spins anticlockwise to increase acceleration. Its loose end is fitted with the dead man's switch, a button-shaped mechanism that allows the motorman to enable or cut current flow to the motors in normal conditions. This system was also meant to serve as an emergency train stop: if anything should prevent the motorman from keeping this button pressed, the train will automatically stop accelerating. \\"Information and photografs herein reproduced thanks to the author's kind permission\\" In normal driving conditions, braking is entirely achieved by means of a traditional air brake system. Because of their long life-span, La Brugeoise trains use custom-made brake shoes made of hard wood embedded with creosote for additional resistance. Friction between the steel wheels and the brake shoes releases a peculiar fragrance Line A is known for among porte√±os (as Buenos Aires inhabitants call themselves) and tourists. The emergency brakes operation is entirely mechanical: the motorman applies them by spinning a wheel located on the right-hand side of the driving cab, tensing up a chain connected to the brake mechanism. If emergency brakes are engaged for more than 10 seconds, current flow to traction motors and auxiliary equipment is interrupted by the main fuse. The trains were equipped with mechanical ATS at the CTAA's workshops. Initially, train traffic in Line A was controlled using manually operated signalling. In the mid-1920s this system was automated by Siemens, including also the installation of mechanical ATS and traffic lights. Each train was fitted with two levers -called anthennas- on top of each driving cab, which are lowered by train stops fixed to the tunnel's wall in case a train passes by a red light, thus applying the brakes and cutting off traction current flow. By 2010, train stops are automatically controlled by digital signal system ATP (Automatic Train Protection) developed and installed by Alstom.  History  La Brugeoise trains were the first electric multiple units (EMU) to run in Argentina. Commissioned by the Anglo- Argentine Tramways Company Ltd. for their first underground line, they were prepared to run either on surface as regular tramways or as underground cars. Thanks to a ramp built after Primera Junta station, Line A's terminus from 1914 to 2008, two cars were decoupled from arriving trains and continued service as tramways until the intersection of avenida Rivadavia and avenida Lacarra. Thus, each car had a tramway-like platform on both ends used by passengers to board and leave the train when on surface. When on duty in the tunnel, passengers used the pair of sliding doors on each side of the car body. The CTAA bought 115 cars, all of them with the same technical characteristics but with two different car body layout (or \\"series\\"). The first series cars -numbered 5 to 50-, together with four English Electric luxury cars -numbered 1 to 4 and forming a special train-, began service on December 1, 1913.  First series (5 to 50) Car 16 of the first series with its original layout in 1915 They arrived at Buenos Aires in mid-1913, in time to run preliminary tests. They had six wide windows per side with rolling curtains to protect passengers from sunlight when running on surface. The interior was entirely made of finely carved wood, lit with 38 solid bronze artifacts using incandescent light bulbs. Their seats, with capacity for two passengers, were upholstered in scarlet leather and arranged in two groups of two seats facing each other. On both sides of each sliding door, a seat was placed longitudinally to allow for extra room for standing passengers to travel comfortably.  Second series (51 to 120) Second series car at the Polvor√≠n workshop, 1915. They arrived at Buenos Aires in two separate groups. Those numbered from 51 to 84 arrived by mid December 1913, when the line was already operating. The remaining, numbered 85 to 120, arrived in 1919 after the end of the First World War. The second series cars had the same decoration, number and distribution of seats and lights as those of the first series, but they also had some easily recognizable differences. For instance, the second series cars had their tramway-like platform roof at the same level as the salon roof. They also had two smaller windows at the end of the salon instead of the wider ones seen in the first series. This shape and size of windows was later adopted as a model to reform all of the wide windows due to serious structure torsion and stress caused by the tunnel's sharp curves.  Refurbishing  Car 10, refurbished for underground use only. This unit is currently the only one being restored for preservation After a few years in service, the CTAA began reforming the cars after some problems were detected during service. As mentioned above, the windows were gradually narrowed and, since 1923, one pantograph was removed from each car. On December 31, 1926, the CTAA cancelled the mixed \\"tramway-metro\\" service as growing surface traffic caused delays to trains circulating through Rivadavia avenue. Thus, a major reform was decided: 116 units lost their tramway-style platforms, which were replaced by the curved fronts that can be seen nowadays. Also, a third sliding door was added and the seats scarlet-leather upholstery was replaced with wooden bars. Later, minor reforms were undertaken: the windows next to the doors were blinded, with mirrors taking their place on the inside. Also, most cars lost their air takes except for car 81, which keeps them on its sides.  Modernisation  From 1921, several attempts were made to modernise them, so prototypes were built upon working and scrapped units. Some of them, such as units 90 and 121, were imitations of Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel cars running in lines C, D and E while others were entirely new designs. Besides, units 124 and 125 were completely manufactured at Polvor√≠n workshop in 1944 to enhance Subte services during World War II as a lack of imported spare pieces for tramways and buses left most of the surface transport out of order. In 1987, fifteen cars were taken to EMEPA, a workshop established in the city of Chascom√∫s (Buenos Aires province) specialized in rolling stock overhauls, where a new car body made of metal was built upon the original 1913 chassis and mechanics. These cars were in service up to the day the un-overhauled cars retired.  Maintenance  Spare parts for these trains were no longer available in the market so parts had to be custom-made by request at Polvor√≠n workshop, where La Brugeoise trains and other Buenos Aires Underground rolling stock were repaired by highly skilled and qualified personnel. According to Metrov√≠as, Buenos Aires Underground private operator, every 20 days cars underwent a routine check-up, while every four years the cars underwent heavy maintenance. Despite their 96 years of uninterrupted service, La Brugeoise trains had one of the lowest mechanical failure averages in the network: 19 every 100,000 km. Transport authorities replaced the cars with new rolling stock as soon as Line A reaches its new terminus, San Pedrito station. Nevertheless, financial problems affecting the network's expansion since late 2008 might make it possible for these trains to reach a century in service. The Buenos Aires City Legislature passed a law indicating that two trains should be restored and preserved operational. They will be formed by cars 24 - 107 - 121 - 124 - 125 and 100 - 86 - 22 - 89 - 48 respectively. It also ordered that cars 27, 81 and 114 be preserved due to certain unique details in their decoration and structure that distinguish them from the rest. In January 2010, national transport authorities announced that an agreement for the provision of 279 cars had been reached with Chinese rolling stock manufacturer CITIC. Forty-five of these cars were to be operational by late 2011 in Line A, thus gradually replacing the La Brugeoise units. However, the cars were not retired until January 12, 2013, when local authorities suspended service on line A in order to finally replace the aging cars with new 200 series cars. The upgrade was completed in two months. After retirement, certain units will be used as decoration in parks. Others will be kept as museum pieces, but the majority will go to the Polvor√≠n workshop.  Heritage service  La Brugeoise car during its first heritage trip After the sanction of law 4886, it was determined that some of the preserved cars would be used in a heritage service, which was finally implemented in September 2017.

Haskins first became known as a proponent of the DIY ethic in Ireland for his work on several projects initiated as a teenager, including the establishment of all ages, non-alcohol spaces in north Wicklow and Dublin. Haskins since became involved with broadcasting, independent music management, social entrepreneurship, social activism and politics. He was an unsuccessful independent candidate in the 2011 general election. Career Soundings Podcast In 2013 Haskins launched the Soundings Podcast, a cultural podcast that he co-hosted with singer Lisa Hannigan, where they would discuss \\"culture, books, music, theatre, films and other weird things that happen.\\" Throughout the first eleven podcast Haskins and Hannigan discussed and engaged in a variety of activities including interviewing notable guest like Dermot O' Leary and Harry Shearer, going on an outing to Chislehurst caves, attending art exhibitions and attending a performance of Stephen Ward the Musical. Although each episode the hosts, sometimes joined by guests, discussed their opinions on recent books, films, exhibitions and plays, from the onset Haskins was clear that the Soundings was not a review show stating that \\"People make art to express their ideas and provoke thought and conversation, which is what this show is all about.\\" The podcast quickly won fans for its relaxed style and the easy chemistry between its hosts. Writing for Metro UK, Rahul Verma described the podcast as a \\"lively, informed arts and culture chat with a fresh, unpretentious feel.\\" Haskins and Hannigan later expanded the podcast into the Holy Trinity series where they recorded live discussions with panels of guests including actress and writer Sharon Horgan, drag queen and activist Panti Bliss, Fr. Peter McVerry and war photographer Giles Duley. Music Haskins ran gigs in his former home, The Hideaway House which became a hub for the DIY music scene in Dublin and his independent record label Hide Away Records. Hide Away Records' most notable release is the debut album of popular Irish band Heathers, whom Haskins also managed from 2007‚Äì2009. Their debut album 'Here, Not There' featured the popular single 'Remember When', which was used in a 2010 F√°ilte Ireland advertising campaign. Social activism In May 2009, Haskins was a member of a group that founded Exchange Dublin,Official website of Exchange Dublin an arts centre in Temple Bar with the support of Project Arts Centre, where he sits on the Board of Directors. The Exchange is now run by a collective of volunteers, and provides an independent space for meetings, events and exhibitions. The project received a Dublin City Council arts award in 2010, a Music Network/Arts Council Music Capital Scheme award in 2009 and Arts Council funding in 2009. It received funding from the Arts Council until it closed its doors in 2014. Later in 2009, Haskins curated and directed the event 'Culture and the City: the debate' for Temple Bar Cultural Trust. It took the form of a masked debate about culture in Dublin at Meeting House Square in Temple Bar. The debate focused on the question 'Is this city fit for purpose?‚Äô. The event was praised as an innovative approach to an urban public forum. Also, that year, Haskins collaborated with a group of NCAD students called 'Office of Public Works' to organize 'Change?', a week of film, open exhibitions and discourse on the notion of societal change that involved photographers, secondary school students and members of the public. It took place in Project Arts Centre. Broadcasting Haskins is also a broadcaster on Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â) television and radio. He presented the first series of Two Tube on RT√â Two, and since May 2010 has worked as a reporter for Arena, an arts programme on RT√â Radio 1. In December 2011 he began presenting coverage of Other Voices (TV series) for guardian.co.uk and covered the series in Derry in 2013 and 2014. Film In 2008, Haskins directed a documentary called Roll Up Your Sleeves about DIY counterculture. DIY figures including Ian MacKaye of the band Fugazi, Ellen Lupton, and Dutch band The Ex took part in the documentary. The film was funded by Broadcasting Commission of Ireland Sound & Vision Award. It was produced by Project Arts Centre for DCTV. Roll Up Your Sleeves premiered at the 2009 Stranger Than Fiction Festival in the IFI in Dublin. In January 2011, the film was made available free online. Politics From a young age Haskins took an active interest in community and social issues. In his interview with Jarlath Regan on The Irishman Abroad podcast Haskins expressed his frustration at a very young age about the lack of facilities available to young people in Ireland. Early political activities included petitioning for a skate park in his local area and attempting to turn a local disused building into a community centre. Haskins became increasing frustrated with the slow process of trying to make changes through official channels and the lack of engagement of local politicians. Haskins was an independent candidate for the Dublin South-East constituency in the 2011 general election. His campaign was the subject of Irish and international media attention with appearances on BBC Newsnight, BBC World Service and Al Jazeera and articles in The Guardian and Le Monde. Haskins was eliminated on the fourth count with 1,928 votes. The four constituency seats were eventually divided between Fine Gael's Lucinda Creighton and Eoghan Murphy and Labour's Ruairi Quinn and Kevin Humphreys. Haskins was entitled to a refund of ‚Ç¨8,700 in election expenses which he subsequently combined with the remainder of his election funds and donated ‚Ç¨10,000 to 10 Irish charities.

The other condo units are typically retained or sold separately by the developer and may be retail space, office space or parking garage. History Condops first came into use in the 1960s when the residential condominium was not yet popular in major cities, particularly in the United States in New York City, New York. This structure was used to separate the residential component from the commercial components of a building. Developers or co-op sponsors sought to retain ownership of the more lucrative non-residential spaces in a building, whilst also minimizing taxes on non-residential income.Cohen, Marjorie (April 2, 2013). \\"Condops demystified: What they are, why you should care--and how to find one?\\". Brick Underground. The condop is still a relatively rare item in the U.S. As of 2007, New York City had fewer than 300 condop buildings as compared to more than 6,700 cooperatives and 2,300 condominiums, representing just over three percent of residential buildings.Toy, Vivian S. (May 20, 2007). \\"What Exactly Is a Condop?\\". The New York Times. Legal definition The Forum at 343 East 74th Street is an example of a condop in New York City, New York, where the co-op corporation owns the residential portion of the building and the developer owns the retail space. The condop is a type of condominium building, not a distinct legal construct. A condop, an abbreviation of the words condominium and cooperative (or \\"co-op\\"), is a co-op inside a condo. Stepping back, condominium owners actually hold title to a piece of real estate. Co-op owners are actually shareholder-tenants with shares in and a long-term lease from the co-op corporation. In all co-ops, a corporation owns the building. Condops are a variation on that theme the distinction between the two concepts as the cooperative corporation does not own a whole building but just the residential condominium unit within it. Common use and misuse Sometimes the phrase condop is used to refer to the residential portion only of such a building (i.e. to distinguish it from the commercial unit(s)). However, this term is commonly misused to describe a cooperative corporation that behaves like a condominium. The cooperative portion of the condop is effectively no different than any cooperative building that contains only residential units. However, in some real-estate circles, the term condop continues to be mis-used to refer to a cooperative that behaves like a condominium or a \\"co-op with condo rules\\". Typically condo will require a lower required down payment for prospective purchasers and do not include many of the restrictive measures that impact prospective purchasers of cooperative apartments. Further, the bylaws for a condo typically do not include the need for board approval to sell or sublet an apartment. Additionally, restrictions on alterations to the apartment are more consistent with cooperatives than condos.

The Villa ten Hompel was named after its builder, the industrial merchant Rudolf ten Hompel from M√ºnster, and was constructed from 1924 on. Ten Hompel was one of the richest citizens of M√ºnster and was co- owner of the ‚ÄúWicking-Werke‚Äù, the biggest combine of cement factories in Germany from this time period. Furthermore, he was a representative of the Catholic Centre Party in the German Reichstag from 1920 until 1928. The Villa and its ample gardens were often used for parties and other social gatherings and were therefore equipped very luxuriously. During the Great Depression at the beginning of the 1930s, ten Hompel‚Äôs ‚ÄúCement Empire‚Äù collapsed. In 1935, the former Chief Executive ten Hompel was convicted of embezzlement, bankruptcy offense, postponement of fortune, and forgery of documents by the regional superior court in M√ºnster and was sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of 22,000 Reichsmark. In 1939, the Villa became property of the National Treasury and Rudolf ten Hompel moved to Munich, where he died in 1948. In 1940 the Ordnungspolizei (Uniformed Police) moved into the Villa and made it the headquarters of the sixth military district, which contained the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia and the area around the nearby city of Osnabr√ºck and parts of Belgium. During the war, police guards were sent by the Villa to supervise deportation trains, as well as the Arbeitserziehungslager, or worker education camps. The Chief Commander of the Ordnungspolizei supervised nearly 200,000 men. In 1940 the Major General of the police, Heinrich Lankenau, was appointed as Chief Commander of the Ordnungspolizei. In 1942 Lankenau was replaced by Major General d.P. Kurt G√∂hrum. In the fall of 1944 Lieutenant General Reiner Liessem held office until the end of the Second World War. Liessem moved the headquarters of the Ordnungspolizei to D√ºsseldorf. After the Second World War the Villa ten Hompel served as headquarters for the state police, and from autumn 1946 the criminal police. But this criminal police unit was combined with the D√ºsseldorf criminal police in October 1946, and the criminal police of M√ºnster withdrew from the Villa. Until 1953, the water police was also stationed there. Afterwards, the water police headquarters were moved to Duisburg. Beginning in 1953, the district government‚Äôs Reparations Department took up residence in the Villa. It was responsible for the facilitation of reparations payments to victims of National Socialism and their surviving family members. In the years until 1968, 12,000 individuals applied for such payments, to which 100,000,000 Reichsmark were distributed altogether. At the end of the 1990s the municipality of M√ºnster bought the Villa in order to set up a memorial site dedicated to research concerning the attitudes of police and public administration and the ways in which they carried out their work. Lord Mayor Berthold Tillmann inaugurated the first exhibition on the 13th of December 1999 in the presence of the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Wolfgang Clement, and the President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Paul Spiegel. Apart from the permanent exhibition Im Auftrag (On Behalf Of), the Villa presents exhibitions that deal with subjects such as National Socialist war crimes and police or administrative history. Besides the exhibitions, there is a library and archive specialized in these topics. The Villa works closely with the local university, with schools and with the police.

Western Electric experimented as early as 1941 with methods of using mechanically activated reeds to produce two tones for each of the ten digits and by the late 1940s such technology was field-tested in a No. 5 Crossbar switching system in Pennsylvania.Bell Telephone Laboratories, A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System - Switching Technologies (1975, AT&T;)Push. Click. Touch. - History of the Button - 1963: Pushbutton Telephone - December 11, 2006 But the technology proved unreliable and it was not until long after the invention of the transistor when push-button technology matured. On 18 November 1963, after approximately three years of customer testing, the Bell System in the United States officially introduced dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under its registered trademark Touch-Tone. Over the next few decades touch-tone service replaced traditional pulse dialing technology and it eventually became a world-wide standard for telecommunication signaling. Although DTMF was the driving technology implemented in push-button telephones, some telephone manufacturers used push-button keypads to generate pulse dial signaling. Before the introduction of touch-tone telephone sets, the Bell System sometimes used the term push-button telephone to refer to key system telephones, which were rotary dial telephones that also had a set of push- buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features. Digital push-button telephones were introduced with the adoption of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) technology in the early 1970s, with features such as the storage of phone numbers (like in a telephone directory) on MOS memory chips for speed dialing. History Analog The concept of push-buttons in telephony originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood later. This use even predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891.The New York Times - \\"When Dials Were Round and Clicks Were Plentiful\\" - by Catherine Greenman, October, 1999 The Bell System in the United States relied on manual switched service until 1919, when it reversed its decisions and embraced dialed, automatic switching. The 1951 introduction of direct distance dialing required automatic transmission of dialed numbers between distant exchanges, leading to use of inband multi-frequency signaling within the Long Lines network while individual local subscribers continued to dial using standard pulses. As direct distance dialing expanded to a growing number of communities, local numbers (often four, five or six digits) were extended to standardized seven-digit named exchanges. A toll call to another area code was eleven digits, including the leading 1. In the 1950s, AT&T; conducted extensive studies of product engineering and efficiency and concluded that push-button dialing was preferable to rotary dialing.Britannica. - Call number dialing After initial customer trials in Connecticut and Illinois, approximately one fourth of the central office in Findlay, Ohio, was equipped in 1960 with touch-tone digit registers for the first commercial deployment of push-button dialing, starting on 1 November 1960.AT&T;, J.G. Lindsay (ed.), December 1960, Touch-Tone Phones Offered, Long Lines, Vol. 40 (5), 25. In 1962, Touch-Tone telephones, including other Bell innovations such as portable pagers, were on display for the public to try out at the Bell Systems pavilion at the Seattle World's Fair. Ref. YouTube video entitled \\"Vintage Roadtrips - 1962 Seattle World's Fair\\". On 22 April 1963 President John F.

This phone, the Western Electric 1500, had only ten buttons. In 1968 it was replaced by the twelve-button model 2500, adding the asterisk or star (*) and pound or hash (#) keys. The use of tones instead of dial pulses relied heavily on technology already developed for the long line network, although the 1963 touch-tone deployment adopted a different frequency set for its dual-tone multi-frequency signaling. Although push-button touch-tone telephones made their debut to the general public in 1963, the rotary dial telephone still was common for many years. Sales of touch-tone telephones picked up speed during the 1970s,https://triblive.com/news/allegheny/4291278-74/phone-touch-tone though the majority of telephone subscribers still had rotary phones, which in the Bell System of that era were leased from telephone companies instead of being owned outright.http://www.irememberjfk.com/mt/when_we_dialed_telephone_numbe.php Adoption of the push-button phone was steady, but it took a long time for them to appear in some areas.I Remember JFK - Push-Button Telephones At first it was primarily businesses that adopted push-button phones.Wise Geek - What is a Touch Tone Telephone? Digital The touch-tone system required the need for additional equipment at the telephone exchange to decode the tones. However, most telephone exchanges in the early 1970s only supported pulse dialling based on the Strowger switch system, restricting touch-tone telephones to some private branch exchanges (PBX). Tone to pulse converters were later added to linefinder groups in Step by Step offices to allow some subscribers to use DTMF sets. British companies Pye TMC, Marconi-Elliott and GEC developed a new digital push-button telephone technology, based on metal- oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip technology. It was variously called the \\"MOS telephone\\", the \\"push-button telephone chip\\", and the \\"telephone on a chip\\". It used MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) logic, with thousands of MOS transistors on a chip, to convert the keypad input into a pulse signal. This made it possible for push-button telephones to be used with pulse dialling at most telephone exchanges. MOS telephone technology introduced a new feature to push-button telephones: the use of MOS memory chips to store phone numbers, which could then be used for speed dialing at the push of a button. This was demonstrated in the United Kingdom by Pye TMC, Marcno-Elliot and GEC in 1970. Between 1971 and 1973, Bell Laboratories in the United States combined MOS technology with touch-tone technology to develop a push-button MOS touch-tone phone called the \\"Touch-O-Matic\\" telephone, which could store up to 32 phone numbers in an electronic telephone directory stored on memory chips. This was made possible by the low cost, low power requirements, small size and high reliability of MOS transistors, over 15,000 of which were contained on ten IC chips, including one chip for logic functions (such as shift registers and counters), one for the keypad dial interface, and eight for memory storage. By 1979, touch-tone phones were gaining popularity, but it was not until the 1980s that the majority of customers owned push-button telephones in their homes; by the 1990s, it was the overwhelming majority. Some exchanges no longer support pulse-dialing or charge their few remaining pulse-dial users the higher tone-dial monthly rate as rotary telephones become increasingly rare.TimesDaily.com - Advances make many items close to obsolete - by Tom Smith & Bernie Delinski - October 14, 2009 - Retrieved February 10, 2010The Free Lance-Star - Aug 12, 1994, by Michael Zitz, page 1 - Rotary phone users in info highway's slow laneSacramento Business Journal - Rotary phones ring true for few - all but gone from workplace - March 9, 2001 Dial telephones are not compatible with some modern telephone features, including interactive voice response systems, though enthusiasts may adapt pulse-dialing telephones using a pulse-to-tone converter. Most, but not all VoIP analogue Telephone Adapters (ATA) will only support DTMF dialling. Touch-tone The international standard for telephone signaling utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more commonly known as touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower pulse dial system.University of Salford - Computer Networking and Telecommunications Research - General TelephonesWise Geek - What is a Rotary Phone? The push- button format is also used for all cell phones, but with out-of-band signaling of the dialed number. The touch-tone system uses audible tones for each of the digits zero through nine. Later this was expanded by two keys labeled with an asterisk (*) and the pound or hash sign (#) to represent the 11th and 12th DTMF signals. These signals accommodate various additional services and customer-controlled calling features.Great Achievements-Telephone Timeline The DTMF standard assigns specific frequencies to each column and row of push- buttons in the telephone keypad; the columns in the push-button pad have higher-frequency tones, and rows have lower-frequency tones in the audible range. When a button is pressed the dial generates a combination signal of the two frequencies for the selected row and column, a dual-tone signal, which is transmitted over the phone line to the telephone exchange. When announced, the DTMF technology was not immediately available on all switching systems. The circuits of subscribers requesting the feature often had to be moved from older switches that supported only pulse dialing to a newer crossbar, or later an electronic switching system, requiring the assignment of a new telephone number which was billed at a higher monthly rate. Community dial office subscribers would often find the service initially unavailable as these villages were served by a single unattended exchange, often step by step, with service from a foreign exchange impractically expensive. Rural party line service was typically based on mechanical switching equipment which could not be upgraded. While a tone-to-pulse converter could be deployed to any existing mechanical office line using 1970s technology, its speed would be limited to pulse dialing rates.Mitel Application note MSAN-108: Applications of the MT8870 integrated DTMF receiver, Page A50, Figure 2 (MT8870 DTMF receiver, MT4325 Pulse dialer), June 1983. A tone-to-pulse converter was one of Mitel's first products in 1973.United States Patent 3959598: Identification forwarding circuit for use with tone-to-pulse converters, filed April 15, 1974. The new central office switches were backward-compatible with rotary dialing. DTMF keypad layout DTMF keypad layout The standard layout of the keys on the touch-tone telephone was the result of research of the human-engineering department at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s under the leadership of South African-born psychologist John Elias Karlin (1918‚Äì2013), who was previously a leading proponent in the introduction of all-number-dialing in the Bell System. This research resulted in the design of the DTMF keypad that arranged the push-buttons into 12 positions in a 3-by-4 position rectangular array, and placed the 1, 2, and 3 keys in the top row for most accurate dialing. The remaining digits occupied the lower rows in sequence from left to right; the 0, however, was placed into the center of the fourth row, while omitting the lower left, and lower right positions. The DTMF keyboard layout broke with the tradition established in cash registers (and later adopted in calculators and computers) of having the lower numbers at the bottom.Why do telephone keypads count from the top down, while calculators count from the bottom up? This was due to research conducted by Bell Labs using test subjects unfamiliar with keypads. Comparing various layouts including two-row, two-column, and circular configurations, the study concluded that while there was little difference in speed or accuracy between any of the layouts, the now familiar arrangement with 1 at the top was the most favourably rated.R. L. Deninger, Human Factors Engineering Studies of the Design and Use of Pushbutton Telephone Sets, The Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 39, no. 4, July 1960 The engineers had envisioned telephones being used to access computers, and surveyed a business customers for possible uses. This led to the addition of the number sign (#, pound or diamond in this context, hash, square or gate in the UK, and octothorpe by the original engineers) and asterisk or star (*) keys in 1969. Later, the hash and asterisk keys were used in vertical service codes, such as *67 to suppress caller ID in the Bell System. In military telephone systems four additional signals (A, B, C, D) were defined for signaling call priority. Pulse dialing Iskra ETA85 pushbutton telephone with pulse-dialing keypad (Yugoslavia, 1988). Historically, not all push-button telephones used DTMF dialing technology. Some manufacturers implemented pulse dialing with push- button keypads and even Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional dial pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a switch on the telephone. Pulse- mode push-button keypads typically stored the dialed number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button pulse dial phones allow for double-speed pulse dialing. These allow even faster pulse dialing in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse dialing. As telephone companies continued to levy surcharges for touch-tone service long after any technical justification ceased to exist,The 'Busted' Edition, CBC Marketplace, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2012 a push- button telephone with pulse dialing capability represented a means for a user to obtain the convenience of push-button dialing without incurring the touch- tone surcharge. DC signaling Heemaf 1955 type wall telephone by Philips with DC signaling pushbutton dial (Netherlands, Dec.1962). In the 1950s, the Dutch electronics concern Philips developed a direct current (DC) signaling method for dialing telephone numbers, for use in the UB-49 private branch exchange (PBX) system. The push-button dial pad used an arrangement of semiconductor diodes to produce a distinct sequence of polarity states for each dialed digit between the two line conductors and ground return, which were analyzed in the exchange by relay logic.B.H. Geels, N. Scheffer, Keyset Selection of Telephone Numbers, Philips Telecommunication Review, Volume 17(1), August 1956, p.30‚Äì37 In 1968, the system was used in the UK, in a brief excursion from standards, when the General Post Office (GPO) introduced the first UK-made push-button telephone, the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series).726 British GPO 726 telephone with DC signaling dial pad (1968). Features Telia Mox and Fido Modern push-button telephone Electronics within push- button telephones may provide several usability features, such as last number redial and storage of commonly called numbers. Some telephone models support additional features, such as retrieval of information and data or code and PIN entry.Mobile Phone As Home Computer - Philip Greenspun Most analog telephone adapters for Internet-based telecommunications (VoIP) recognize and translate DTMF tones but ignore dial pulses, an issue which also exists for some PBX systems. Like cellular handsets, telephones designed for voice-over-IP use out-of-band signaling to send the dialed number.

He has worked in East Greenland, Guatemala, Tokyo, Bangkok, Copenhagen, America and Russia. In 2007 Sobol became a nominee at Magnum Photos and a full member in 2012. Four monographs and many catalogues of his work have been published and widely exhibited including at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York and at the Diemar/Noble Photography Gallery in London. Life and work Born in Copenhagen, Sobol lived in Canada from 1994 to 1995. Back in Europe he first studied at the European Film College and from 1998 at Fatamorgana, the Danish School of Art Photography. In the autumn of 1999 he went to the remote East Greenland village of Tiniteqilaaq to photograph. The visit was only supposed to last a few weeks but after meeting a local girl, Sabine, he returned the following year and stayed there for the next two years, living the life of a fisherman and hunter. In 2004 Sobol published Sabine, which in photographs and narrative portrays Sabine and describes his encounter with Greenlandic culture.\\"Grit, Grain, Veins: The Diaristic Photographs of Jacob Aue Sobol\\" Time. Accessed 21 January 2017 The pictures in the book express the photographic idiom he developed at Fatamorgana. In the summer of 2005, Sobol went with a film crew to Guatemala to make a documentary about a young Mayan girl's first trip to the ocean. The following year he returned to the mountains of Guatemala, this time by himself, to stay with an indigenous family for a month to document their everyday life. In 2006 he moved to Tokyo to spend 18 months photographing the city for his book I, Tokyo. Commenting on the book, Miranda Gavin appreciates how \\"the sensitivity of his approach shines through the work and sets him apart as one of a new generation of photographers with the ability to allow eroticism and danger to seep through his images without becoming sordid or clich√©d. Sobol became a nominee of Magnum Photos in 2007 and a full member in 2012. In 2008, Sobol worked in Bangkok where he photographed children fighting for survival in the Sukhumvit slums, despite the country's growing economic prosperity. In 2009, he moved back to Copenhagen. Since then he has worked on projects at home as well as in America and Russia. Publications Publications by Sobol *Sabine.

The principal research focus is on bird migration through banding studies. Over 400 species have been recorded. OAG Helgoland produces an annual bird report. History Heligoland is on a major migration route for birds crossing the North Sea; for centuries, both those on migration and those breeding there, were an important source of food for the islanders. In the early 19th century Heligoland also became a source of bird specimens for collectors and museums. Ornithologist and artist Heinrich G√§tke first visited the island in 1837 and moved there permanently in 1841 as secretary to the British Governor. He began collecting specimens of rarities for both artistic and scientific purposes. He spent most of the next 60 years studying the birds and coined the term \\"Vogelwarte\\", producing a book (\\"Die Vogelwarte Helgoland\\") on his research in 1891, with an English translation published in 1895.

He was a leader of the German American community as part owner and editor of the Westliche Post, one of the most notable and well- circulated German-language newspapers in the United States.Saalberg, 1968 Biography He was born in Alzey, then part of the German Confederation, and attended gymnasiums at Mainz and Darmstadt, and then the Universities of Giessen and Heidelberg. He graduated from Heidelberg in 1848. He began the practice of law with considerable success, but in consequence of having participated in the revolutionary movements of 1848, he was obligated to leave Germany in 1850. Preetorius arrived in St. Louis in 1854, and engaged for a while in mercantile pursuits. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he devoted his time and means to organizing German regiments and sending them to the field. In 1862, he was elected to the Missouri state legislature on the radical emancipation ticket, and positioned himself as an \\"immediate emancipationist\\". In 1864, he resumed business pursuits, became editor of the Westliche Post, and took an active part in the presidential campaign. In 1872, he identified himself with the Liberal Republicans. Preetorius was a crisp, clear writer, and a logical and convincing speaker. His lectures on aesthetics, philosophy and history attracted much attention, not only among Germans, but among English speakers as well. His direction placed the Westliche Post in the front rank of American journalism.Saalberg, 1968 When the Westliche Post merged with the Anzeiger des Westens in 1898, he and Carl Daenzer, the latter the editor of the Anzeiger, both retired. Preetorius died at his home at 2013 Park Avenue in St. Louis. The year before his death, influenced by his son, Edward L. Preetorius, he had refused a decoration from Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. He had also refused decorations from the Kaiser in years past. He never went back to Germany saying that when he would have gone back he could not, and when he could have gone back, he would not.

His dismembered body parts were scattered across Hertfordshire and Leicestershire, leading to him being known in the press as Jigsaw Man. Marshall became known as the Jigsaw Killer. Marshall initially pleaded \\"not guilty\\" to murder, but changed his plea to \\"guilty\\" and was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2010. Background Jeffrey Howe, 49, was a kitchen salesman. He had worked around the country and had been a chef in Italy, and was a Manchester United football supporter. His brother described him as \\"a jovial, charming character who had a heart of gold and would get on with anyone.\\" He had twice been married. Neighbours said that he was aggressive and argued about children playing, and said they had not seen him or his two Jaguar cars for about six months, believing that he rented out his ground floor two-bedroom flat. Stephen Marshall, 38, was a body builder, personal trainer and former bouncer of Ayot Path, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, and formerly of Park Street, St Albans, where he once owned a gym. He was a work associate and lodger of Howe's at his flat in Southgate, London. Marshall had lived at the Southgate flat since November 2008 after Howe, said to be his 'drinking buddy', wanted to help him out. He stayed without paying rent along with his girlfriend Sarah Bush, 21, from Southgate, who was a sex worker. They stole Howe's food and refused to leave after promising to do so, which he complained about to a friend at Christmas time. They fraudulently claimed housing benefit by forging his signature, saying he was leasing the property to them. Sarah Bush met Marshall when he hired her as a prostitute. He made her change her name from Sara. She spent most of her childhood in care, and has two children. Her first baby, which she had when she had just turned 15, died aged 10 days. Murder Howe was murdered on the night of 8‚Äì9 March 2009. He was stabbed twice in the back with a 4-inch blade, one of the wounds puncturing his lung. Howe may have been alive for up to an hour after he was stabbed. Marshall \\"skillfully and cleanly\\" removed Howe's limbs, which Home Office pathologist Simon Poole estimated would have taken at least 12 hours. After the murder, Marshall and Bush used Howe's bank account to buy a laptop, shoes, takeaways, and other consumer goods and food. They set up an account with online retailer Littlewoods, some of the purchases being made on a computer in St. Albans library. They wrote forged cheques to clear his account. They sold some of his belongings, including his mobile phone, furniture, and his Saab car, which was sold on eBay. They said to Howe's friend Shehrya Khan that he had \\"packed up and left.\\" Howe's adopted brother John visited the flat on 28 March and was told by Bush that Howe had not collected rent for a while and had left with his belongings. Discovery of his body * 22 March. A left leg with the foot attached was found in a lay- by on the A507 in Cottered, Hertfordshire, wrapped in blue plastic bags. A murder investigation was launched. * 29 March. A left forearm, dismembered at the elbow and wrist, was found on a grass verge along Drovers Lane, Wheathampstead. * 31 March. A head was unearthed by a farmer in a cattle pen in a field in Asfordby, Leicestershire. The flesh had been removed and the eyes, ears, tongue and neck had been cut off. * 7 April. A right leg was found in a holdall near the A10 Puckeridge bypass in Hertfordshire by a driver. * 11 April. A torso, right arm and upper left arm were discovered in a ditch by a walker near Standon, Hertfordshire inside a green suitcase, the same brand as the holdall. * His hands have not been found, though Bush has said they were buried in Epping Forest. Investigation Detective Superintendent Michael Hanlon from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit led the investigation, named Operation Abnet and involving up to 100 officers. To aid the investigation, police revealed that the victim was overweight, suffered from eczema, had bleached skin pigmentation on his legs, a fungal infection on his toenails, and was missing two front teeth. They released a picture of the suitcase in which the torso was found. The police decided to keep details of the dismemberment from the public to avoid panic. A friend of Howe had visited the flat at the end of January 2009 and found the couple living there. After trying to phone him and hearing he had gone missing, she reported him as a missing person on 15 March. Howe's mother, who usually received calls from him several times a week, rang the incident room some time before 21 April to report Howe missing. Two police officers went to the flat at 11:30 on the morning of 16 March and forced entry when there was no answer, searching all the rooms. There was no visible sign of blood, and Howe's passport was on a coffee table. When questioned by police, Marshall and Bush said that as far as they knew he was alive. The police used dental records to identify Howe from his remains and discovered that Marshall had lived close to where the torso was found. Police arrested the couple at the flat in Southgate, north London on 21 April. The arresting officer said that \\"[Marshall] was very, very nervous, jittery, his leg was shaking. Sarah Bush was uncomfortable, and at that point I knew that Jeffrey Howe was going to be our victim.\\" Taken to a station in Hertfordshire for questioning, Bush told police that Marshall suffered \\"mood swings\\" and that she had been planning to leave him. Marshall gave \\"no comment\\" to police questioning. Howe was publicly named as the victim on 23 April. Blood was found in the bedroom, bathroom, under the carpet, and in Howe's car after it was recovered. Green fibres from a T-shirt in Marshall's bedroom matched fibres on duct tape used to wrap Howe‚Äôs body parts. The journey of Marshall and Bush to Leicestershire was traced from CCTV and Automatic number plate recognition. The IPCC is supervising a Metropolitan Police Service review of procedure of how Howe's missing person case was handled. Trial The trial began on 12 January 2010 and was held at St Albans Crown Court, with Stuart Trimmer QC prosecuting. Marshall initially denied murdering Howe, claiming that Bush murdered him and that he only helped to dismember and dispose of the body, admitting counts of perverting the course of justice and intending to prevent a coroner from holding an inquest. Bush denied all charges. The court heard that Marshall previously threatened to \\"get rid of\\" Bush's previous partner in Epping Forest, and to \\"dispose of\\" another woman. He had boasted to her of having \\"considerable experience of disposing of bodies\\". She said the first time he did so he was nauseated and took cocaine to cope, becoming an addict. A witness said that when working for the Adams crime family, Marshall had used a meat cleaver, meat knives, a hacksaw, or a chainsaw to cut up bodies. A friend of Bush, Sophie Franklin, told the court that when drunk, Bush confessed to friends that she helped Marshall kill Howe after Marshall stabbed him in the back, placing a pillow over Howe's face to stop the noise. Another friend of Bush, Danielle Matthews, said Bush told her she had seen the murder and that Howe had laughed when Marshall had earlier threatened to kill him unless he left the flat. On 29 January, three weeks into the trial, Marshall changed his plea to guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 1 February, for a minimum of 36 years. The judge, Jeremy Cooke, ruled that little credit could be given for the change of plea given the overwhelming evidence. He dismissed Marshall's claim that he was on the verge of drug-induced suicide when he stabbed his victim in bed. Marshall is ineligible for parole until 2046. Bush also changed her plea to guilty on 1 February, and was sentenced to three years and nine months for perverting the course of justice by helping Marshall take Howe's head to Leicestershire and was given a concurrent sentence of two years and three months for giving false information about Howe's whereabouts, although she was acquitted of murder. She served 45 months in prison. After the trial it was revealed that Marshall had previous convictions for criminal damage, assault, battery, cocaine possession, and possessing a firearm. He had attacked his first wife in 2003, and was arrested on suspicion of murdering Minesh Nagrecha in 1996 when his burnt body was found. He was never charged, instead appearing as a witness. Bush had two prior cautions for possession of cannabis and assault. Marshall was refused leave to appeal in October 2010. A challenge to the length of his sentence was turned down by two Court of Appeal judges in November 2010. Previous bodies Via his lawyer, Peter Doyle, Marshall admitted in court on 1 February to dismembering four more bodies between 1995 and 1998 and disposing of them in Epping Forest, when he worked for the Adams crime family as a doorman for a London nightclub. This admission was to the surprise of police, but Marshall refused to give them details of the other victims.

The Westliche Post was Republican in politics. Carl Schurz was a part owner for a time, and served as a U.S. Senator from Missouri for a portion of that time. History Carl Daenzer, founder The Westliche Post was established September 27, 1857. The first publishers were Carl Daenzer,Daenzer had separated from the Anzeiger des Westens due to differences with Henry Boernstein. He returned to the Anzeiger in 1862. and F. Wenzel.Wenzel had edited a paper at Belleville, Illinois. The initial investment, supplied by Daenzer and friends, was $1,275, comparatively small, but the paper paid its way from the beginning. It did business under the firm name of Daenzer & Wenzel. Wenzel sold his part in 1859 and Carl Daenzer left the paper in 1860 due to health reasons.Hertle wrote an interesting history of the Germans in Missouri, especially dealing with the war period, when political and military affairs were conspicuously shaped by German voters and soldiers. During the Civil War, Theodore Olshausen was editor-in-chief of the Westliche Post. At the end of the war, he sold his interest in the Westliche Post and returned to Europe on account of ill health, settling in Zurich. In April 1864, Theodore Plate became publisher and Emil Preetorius acquired an interest in the paper and became editor-in-chief. In 1867, Arthur OlshausenArthur Olshausen was the publisher of the old Anzeiger des Westens, and the brother of Theodore Olshausen. acquired an interest, and in May of that year Carl Schurz became a partner and an associate of Emil Preetorius in the editorial management. The publishing firm was then Plate, Preetorius, Olshausen & Schurz. Plate and Olshausen gradually disposed of much of their interest, and Preetorius and Schurz became the principal owners; it was then published under the auspices of the Westliche Post Association, Emil Preetorius, president; Felix Coste, secretary and treasurer. Schurz, still retaining a pecuniary interest, retired from the paper in 1881 and moved to New York City. In April 1874, the paper moved to a commodious and convenient building at the corner of Fifth and Market Streets, the property having been purchased May 27, 1871, for about $90,000. Carl Schurz, editor and stakeholder Emil Preetorius, editor and stakeholder Among the talented contributors to the columns of the Westliche Post was William Stengel.He died October 29, 1880, leaving a wife and six children. He was born in Germany in 1830, and studied law at the University of T√ºbingen. In consequence of the active part he played in the revolutions of 1848, he was compelled to leave Germany and came to America, making his home in New York City. In 1856, he emigrated west, and at Cincinnati entered the profession of journalism. At the beginning of the Civil War, he was one of the first to go to the front, entering the Ninth Ohio Regiment as chaplain. The position was not active enough for him, and he was made captain. His company took part in the battles of Wilderness, Lookout Mountain and other noted engagements. At the close of the Civil War, he settled in St. Louis and became assistant editor of the Westliche Post, where he remained until his death. He was a well known political writer. In May 1881, Edward Leyh became a principal member of the editorial staff of the Westliche Post.Edward Leyh started out as a journalist in Baltimore, Maryland, on the editorial staff of the Baltimore Wecker. He subsequently established the New Correspondent and was for many years connected with the German Correspondent. As a terse, brilliant and logical writer, Leyh had no superior on the German-American press. His information on political, historical and scientific subjects was thorough and accurate. He corresponded with several of the leading papers of Berlin, including Die Gartenlaube, and did much literary work, including a translation into German of Joaquin Miller's poems. The translation was published in Berlin and had an extensive sale. Joseph Pulitzer, editor and stakeholder Joseph Pulitzer published his first news story in the Westliche Post and worked on it as a cub reporter. He was hired in 1867. Preetorius had noticed his skill and industry at the Mercantile Library where they both spent leisure time, and city editor Louis Willich was the recipient of many aptly chosen pieces of news which Pulitzer gathered from immigrants while working as secretary at the Deutsche Gesellschaft (German Society). After Pulitzer joined the paper, Schurz took him under his wing and showed the fledgling reporter the ropes of reporting and politics; Pulitzer rapidly won recognition. Willich left the paper in 1869, and Pulitzer took his place as city editor. In 1872, Pulitzer became one of the proprietors of the paper. Preetorius and Schurz bought him out in 1873, and he went on to other enterprises. On June 1, 1898, the Westliche Post consolidated with the Anzeiger des Westens, which had previously absorbed the local Tribune. Preetorius and Daenzer, the latter now long-associated with the Anzeiger, both retired at this point. Under the consolidation, both papers, the Morning Westliche Post and the Evening Anzeiger, were issued by the German-American Press Association, the stockholders being Emil Preetorius, Carl Daenzer, Edwin C. Kehr, Charles Nagel and Paul F. Coste; John Schroers was business manager. The Sunday issue was called The Mississippi Blaetter (The Mississippi Leaves). The Westliche Post remained Republican in politics, and the Anzeiger des Westen remained independent. Edward L. Preetorius was prominent in the management, and the editorial corps included Carl Albrecht. The Westliche Post was edited with marked ability, and was one of the most prosperous German papers in the United States. It apparently ceased publication in 1938.

By using HPHPc as a source-to-source compiler, PHP code is translated into C++, compiled into a binary and run as an executable, as opposed to the PHP's usual execution path of PHP code being transformed into opcodes and interpreted. HPHPc consists mainly of C++, C and PHP source codes, and it is free and open-source software distributed under the PHP License. The original motivation behind HipHop was to save resources on Facebook servers, given the large PHP codebase of facebook.com. As the development of HipHop progressed, it was realised that HipHop could substantially increase the speed of PHP applications in general. Increases in web page generation throughput by factors of up to six have been observed over the Zend PHP. A stated goal of HPHPc was to provide a high level of compatibility for Zend PHP, where most Zend-based PHP programs run unmodified on HPHPc. HPHPc was originally open sourced in early 2010. As an addition to HPHPc, Facebook engineers also created a \\"developer mode\\" of HipHop (interpreted version of a PHP execution engine, known as HPHPi) and the HipHop debugger (known as HPHPd). These additions allow developers to run PHP code through the same logic provided by HPHPc while making it possible to interactively debug PHP code by defining watches, breakpoints, etc. Running the code through HPHPi yields lower performance when compared to HPHPc, but the developer benefits were, at the time, worth having to maintain these two execution engines for production and development. HPHPi and HPHPd were also open sourced in 2010. By many accounts HPHPc fulfilled its goals, especially within Facebook as it allowed facebook.com to run much faster while using fewer resources. However, in early 2013 Facebook deprecated HPHPc in favor of the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM), which is a just-in-time (JIT) compilation-based execution engine for PHP, also developed by Facebook. There were many reasons for this; one of them was HPHPc's flattened curve for further performance improvements. Also, HPHPc did not fully support the PHP language, including the \`create_function()\` and \`eval()\` constructs, and it involved a specific time- and resource-consuming deployment process that required a bigger than 1 GB binary to be compiled and distributed to many servers in short order. In addition, maintaining HPHPc and HPHPi in parallel (as they needed to be, for the consistency of production and development environments) was becoming cumbersome. Finally, HPHPc was not a drop-in replacement for Zend, requiring external customers to change their whole development and deployment processes to use HPHPc.

Around 1295, Huang returned to Songjiang and began to teach the local women about cotton spinning and weaving technology whilst at the same time manufacturing suits, fine silk fabrics and weaving machinery (such as fluffing machines, crushers and three- spindle treadle powered weaving looms) that greatly increased efficiency. From the weaving aspect, Huang produced mixed cotton fabrics, colored fabrics and fabrics with mixed warp and weft fibers. Her weaving technology made her hometown famous and began its textile manufacturing industry. Shanghai Botanical Garden hosts the Huang Daopo Memorial Hall in her honor.

Description  Adult T. stercorea are long, oval, brown, flattened, and have hairy elytra with parallel lines of fine hairs. It takes 21 to 33 days for the species' eggs to hatch, and the eggs are laid or loosely attached to grain. The larvae are able to move easily and the adults can run very fast and fly. The species are pests of grain. This species may have been confused with minute mold beetles. When the species does damage, it is not possible to tell right away what insect is responsible. The species eats stored products such as moldy cereal, tobacco, peanuts, and hay. The species also eats fungi that grow on damp food. One of the things that the larvae eats is fungi. This species has been found in grain storages dating all the way back to the Iron Age.  Habitat  The species can commonly be found on ripening hay and grain crops before harvest in temperate and tropical areas.  Disease vector  It was discovered in 1994 that this species can carry Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis. The species carried the bacterium into a Danish broiler house that infected 39,900 day-old chicks. The chicks were infected by eating the beetles. A study of species of beetles in broiler houses, including this species, showed that the beetles that are in broiler houses are likely to carry salmonella.

The company built about 1,888 locomotives. Predecessors In 1842, Samuel Smith, Abram Collier, and George Bradley started a small foundry in Paterson. In 1848, Smith sold his interest to Collier and formed a new partnership with his brother, William C. Smith, Henry Whitely, and Thomas Beggs. Beggs died soon thereafter and William Smith and Whitely sold their interests. William Swinburne, who had been superintendent at Rogers Locomotive Works bought Beggs's interest. The firm was renamed Swinburne, Smith and Company. In 1848, it took an order for ten locomotives for the New York and Erie Railroad; three years later, it received a corporate charter as New Jersey Locomotive and Machine Company. In 1863-64, Oliver De Forest Grant bought the stock and ran the business with his sons, David B. Grant and R. Suydam Grant. The father died shortly thereafter and David Grant took over as president. Consolidation locomotive D&RGW; No. 223 awaiting restoration in 2010. The namesake of the 2-8-0 Consolidation type was designed in 1866 by Alexander Mitchell, Master Mechanic of the Mahanoy Division of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Baldwin Locomotive Works was asked to build it, but was reluctant; Rogers Locomotive Works declined. Grant submitted a bid of $19,500, but ultimately the contract went to Baldwin. Fifteen years later, in 1881, the Baldwin Locomotive Works was unable to fill an order of Consolidations from the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad, and part of the contract went to Grant to build that railroad's C-16-60N (better known as C-16)-class locomotives. One of the two surviving Grant-built locomotives, D&RGW; 223, was built to this Consolidation design. Financial troubles In 1867, the business was granted a New Jersey corporate charter as Grant Locomotive Works. The business muddled along, \\"rarely enjoying continuing financial success\\". The company's boilermakers struck for higher wages in 1872; Grant locked them out and eventually replaced them for less money. In 1874, the Russian Empire ordered 55 Consolidations, but difficulties arose and ultimately the Russians canceled 20 of the order. Grant retired on January 1, 1880, and was succeeded by William W. Evans, who had been chief accountant since 1866. Two years later, the company had 720 men on the payroll. In 1881, the company completed 110 engines. In 1882, the company owned of manufacturing and office space in nine buildings, of which it occupied . In 1887, the company lost half of its buildings in a fire. Chicago A group of Chicago businessmen convinced the company to move there. They spent more than a million dollars on buildings and installed largely new machinery, bringing only certain patterns from Paterson. The company built only 24 engines in Chicago before a strike and the Panic of 1893 forced it into receivership, from which it did not recover. Production The company built locomotives for at least 134 domestic railroads, including: Until the early 1870s, these were largely Americans (4-4-0s), with a few six-wheel switchers (0-6-0s), Moguls (2-6-0s), and Ten Wheelers (4-6-0)s. In 1865, the firm built 22 eight- wheel switchers (0-8-0s) for the B&O.; The order for the Russian government was apparently the firm's first 2-8-0s. In 1878, it built 35 Columbias (2-4-2s) for the Manhattan elevated railway. From 1878 to 1882, it built 96 Consolidations for the New York, Lake Erie & Western. Their first three-foot- gauge order came from the Utah Northern, a narrow-gauge line that ran from Ogden, Utah, to Butte, Montana. These locomotives, of the 2-4-0 type, were delivered in 1871. In 1881, the Denver and Rio Grande ordered 30 narrow-gauge Consolidations of the 60N (later C-16) class.

Until January 2010, he was the Inspector General of the Congolese National Police.http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=4880 In 2018 he was appointed as the Inspector General of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC).Plusieurs nominations dans l'arm√©e en RDC . BBC Africa, 16 July 2018.  History  Numbi is of the same Lubakat group as former President Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila. Politically active, he was an organizer of the youth militia of the Union of Federalists and Independent Republicans (JUFERI), which was used by former governor Gabriel Kyungu wa Kumwanza against Luba supporters of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress in the late 1990s. In 2000, he held the rank of Brigadier General and was the commander for military Region 4 (Katanga). In November 2006, the Congolese military's offensive against the armed National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) had stalled. Numbi, then commander of the Congolese air force, was sent in Goma to negotiate with CNDP commander Laurent Nkunda. The talks were moved on 31 December to Kigali, where they were facilitated by senior Rwandan officers, including Chief of Staff Gen. James Kabarebe. In early January, an agreement was reached, the terms of which included that Nkunda's forces would be subject to mixage with government units in North Kivu, and eventually deployed outside the province. On 14 February 2007, in reaction to increasing international criticism of the use of child soldiers, Numbi was among a group of senior officers who issued a notice to commanders of mixed brigades that they would be held responsible for the illegal presence of children in their units.Human Rights Watch (2007), p. 54 On 26 February 2008, Numbi met with Interior Minister Denis Kalume and President Joseph Kabila to discuss Bundu Dia Kongo (BDK), an unarmed religious movement that had been engaged in violent demonstrations for greater political independence in Bas Kongo. Two days later, 600 police officers armed with machine guns and grenades were deployed from Kinshasa to repress the group. This action was criticized by United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo as an excessive use of force. In 2009, Numbi and Kabarebe of Rwanda managed Operations Kimia II and Umoja Wetu, a joint operation against Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda forces operating in eastern Congo.For a more detailed account of Numbi's involvement in the 2009 offensives, see Historian G√©rard Prunier in a 2009 publication states that Numbi, along with , , Kalume and , are the \\"old palace guard\\" who \\"are the ones actually running things\\" in the Congolese government. Prunier further asserts that this group has \\"a vested interest in 'personally fruitful' stagnation.\\" On 28 September 2016, Numbi received United States sanctions because he used \\"violent intimidation\\" to secure victories for his favored candidates in 2016 provincial elections. U.S. citizens are now barred from conducting financial transactions with him. The measures were seen as a warning to president Joseph Kabila to respect the country's constitution.

Under Corus ownership, Souvenirs Garantis stations were based in all major Quebec markets, except for Montreal, which had no station carrying the format full-time. The format featured a largely defined classic hits format, including music from the 1970s to the 1990s but mostly from the 1970s and 1980s. CFOM-FM's logo as a \\"Souvenirs Garantis\\" station, 2005-2012. All stations of the network used a logo design similar to this one. The branding was first used by CFOM-FM in 2005, though that station carried an oldies format since 1995. CFOM-FM acted as the flagship station of the Souvenirs Garantis network. In March 2009, Corus expanded the Souvenirs Garantis format to four other stations -- CHLT-FM 107.7 in Sherbrooke, CJRC-FM 104.7 in Gatineau, CHLN-FM 106.9 in Trois- Rivi√®res and CKRS-FM 98.3 in Saguenay -- replacing their long-time news-talk formats on these stations.Francophone news-talk listeners across much of Quebec will be out of luck at month's end Scott Fybush/NERW, 2009-03-09 These changes also came following the closedown of these stations' AM signals, as well as a CRTC revision of its formatting regulations a few weeks earlier to permit oldies music on FM radio for the first time.Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2009-61 These stations carry local programming, along with some networked programs originating from CFOM. There was no full-time Souvenirs Garantis outlet in Montreal, though its programming is simulcasted during weekends on CHMP-FM 98.5; until 2010, it was also carried during late-night hours on CKAC-AM 730. It was also broadcast overnight on news radio station CINF AM 690, until that station folded in January 2010. On April 30, 2010, it was announced that Cogeco would acquire all radio stations owned by Corus in Quebec, including its Corus Qu√©bec stations and Montreal anglophone station CFQR-FM, pending CRTC approval. The sale of the Corus Qu√©bec stations has been approved by the CRTC on December 17, 2010.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-942: \\"Transfer of effective control of various commercial radio programming undertakings from Corus Entertainment Inc. to Cogeco inc.\\", issued December 17, 2010.

The North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA) was a large newspaper syndicate that flourished between 1922 and 1980. NANA employed some of the most noted writing talents of its time, including Grantland Rice, Joseph Alsop, Michael Stern, Lothrop Stoddard, Dorothy Thompson, George Schuyler, Pauline Frederick, Sheilah Graham Westbrook, Edna Ferber, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway (who famously covered the Spanish Civil War for NANA).  History   Foundation  NANA was founded in 1922 by 50 major newspapers in the United States and Canada led by Harry Chandler of the Los Angeles Times and Loring Pickering of the San Francisco Chronicle.Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"CHAPTER VIII: Recent Developments in Syndicate History 1921-1935,\\" 'History of Newspaper Syndicates. Archived at Stripper's Guide.  Wheeler era  Publishing executive John Neville Wheeler became general manager of NANA in 1930, which soon absorbed the Bell Syndicate, a similar organization Wheeler had founded around 1916, although both continued to operate individually under joint ownership. NANA continued to acquire other syndicates over time, including Associated Newspapers and the Consolidated Press Association (at that point headed by David Lawrence). In the 1930s and 1940s, NANA was known for its selections for the College Football All-America Team, using four well-known coaches each year. One of NANA's most famous correspondents was Ernest Hemingway, who was sent to Spain in 1937 to report on the Spanish Civil War.Speiser and Easterling-Hallman Collection of Ernest Hemingway, \\"The Spanish Civil War and The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories\\" Hemingway based one of his best-known novels, For Whom the Bell Tolls, published in 1940, on his experiences there. Edith Ronne was a correspondent for the NANA syndicate during the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (1947-1948). In 1943, Ira Wolfert won an international Pulitzer Prize for Telegraphic Reporting for his field reports for NANA during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. Among NANA's other notable stories from this period were those about the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition, which in 1947 and 1948 researched the area surrounding the head of the Weddell Sea in Antarctica. Edith Ronne, wife of the expedition leader, was a correspondent for the syndicate, posting dispatches from Antarctica for the duration of the expedition. She named a landform there, Cape Wheeler, in honor of her editor, John Neville Wheeler.  Cuneo era  By the early 1950s the syndicate was being overshadowed by more powerful news syndicates, and in March 1951 it was purchased by a small group of investors led by Ernest Cuneo,Knoll, Erwin. \\"McClure Syndicate Sold to Bell-NANA\\".

Cuneo acquired full control over NANA in the mid-1950s and served as president until 1963 when he sold it. However, he remained with NANA as a columnist and military analyst from 1963 to 1980.\\"Ernest L. Cuneo, 82; Owned Newspaper Service\\", The New York Times, March 5, 1988. Accessed April 23, 2010. Because of Cuneo's association with former members of American and British intelligence, including Fleming and Bryce, and because some writers in the Cuneo era had alleged links to the CIA, critics have suggested that NANA under his tenure was a front for espionage.  Later years  A notable event late in the syndicate‚Äôs history occurred when a freelance correspondent, Lucianne Goldberg joined the press corps covering candidate George McGovern during the 1972 presidential campaign, claiming to be a reporter for the Women's News Service, an affiliate of NANA. In reality, she was being paid $1,000 a week by Richard Nixon operative Murray Chotiner for regular reports about happenings on the campaign trail. She said \\"They were looking for really dirty stuff. . . Who was sleeping with who, what the Secret Service men were doing with the stewardesses, who was smoking pot on the plane -- that sort of thing.\\" NANA and Bell McClure were acquired by United Feature Syndicate in 1972.

The Ancient Fleets: The Story of Naval Warfare Under Oars, 2600 B.C. - 1597 A.D. New York: Twayne Inc, 1968. Print. The harpax allowed an enemy vessel to be harpooned and then winched alongside for boarding. It was first deployed at the Battle of Naulochus in 36 BC. Appian explains the device called the 'grip', [was] a piece of wood, five cubits long bound with iron and having rings at the extremities. To one of these rings was attached the grip itself, an iron claw, to the other numerous ropes, which drew it by machine power after it had been thrown by a catapult and had seized the enemy's ships.\\" . The harpax had a distinct advantage over the traditional naval boarding device, the corvus, in that it was much lighter. The corvus boarding bridge is estimated to have weighed a ton. The harpax could be thrown long distances due its light weight. It was discharged by a ballista as if it were a heavy dart. Furthermore, the harpax was composed of iron bands that could not be cut, and the ropes could not be cut due to the length of the iron grapple. Appian notes \\"As this apparatus had never been known before, the enemy had not provided themselves with scythe-mounted poles.\\" The casualty totals provide a broad picture of the tool's effectiveness: Sextus lost 180 of a total force of 300 warships - 28 by ramming and 155 by capture and by fire.William M.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Lake Trasimene, he prevented the people of Capua from surrendering the city to Hannibal. When the Capuans finally capitulated, he dissuaded his son from a rash attempt on the life of the Carthaginian general.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Background Calavius was descended from the noble Campanian family of the Calavii, which first appeared in history a century earlier, during the Great Samnite War. He was connected by marriage with some of the leading families at Rome. His wife, Claudia, was the daughter of Publius Claudius Pulcher, consul in 249 BC, and his daughter, Calavia, married Marcus Livius Salinator, consul in 219 and 207 BC. He may have had a brother, Sthenius, but the historian Livius states that he was one of the Ninnii Celeres.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 2, 8.Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft. In 218 BC, Hannibal invaded Italy, and began his relentless march down the peninsula, inflicting devastating losses to the Romans at the Battle of the Trebia, and the following year at the Battle of Lake Trasimene. As Hannibal approached Campania, Calavius, who was chief magistrate of Capua, apprehended that the people were so frightened by the approach of the Carthaginian forces, that they would demand the surrender of the city, and perhaps massacre the Capuan senate, which opposed capitulation.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 2. Calavius reconciles the senate and the people In order to prevent the collapse of the Capuan government, Calavius devised a clever plan to bring about the reconciliation of the senate and the people. He assembled the senate, and warned them of their peril. On his assurance that he could preserve their lives, the senators allowed themselves to be shut in the senate-house under guard. Calavius went out to meet the people, and presented them with a surprising option.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 2, 3. He proposed that the people should proceed with their plan to try the senators and sentence them as they saw fit; but for each senator executed, the people should first choose a better man to replace him. The citizens quickly found that it was easier to condemn their leaders than to agree on their replacements, and again entrusted themselves to the senate.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 2-4. The attempt on Hannibal Following the disaster of the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, Hannibal entered Campania, and Capua yielded to the inevitable. Making Capua his winter quarters, Hannibal invited Calavius and his son, Perolla, to a banquet at the house of another noble family, the Ninii Celeres. Perolla was a supporter of Decius Magius, who had opposed Hannibal's entry into the city, and argued for an alliance with Rome. It was Hannibal's plan to win over the Capuan nobility, whom he knew to be hostile to him.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 7, 8. During the banquet, Perolla, who made no pretense of enjoying himself, followed his father into the garden, and revealed a sword, with which he proposed to assassinate the Carthaginian general. Horrified, Calavius pleaded with his son to reconsider, arguing that such a deed, even if accomplished, would be a betrayal both of the young man's father and his city; and furthermore, that the plan was unlikely to succeed, but Perolla would certainly be cut down in the attempt. Persuaded by his father's entreaties, the younger Calavius threw his sword over the garden wall and returned to the hall.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 8, 9. Reputation Despite his noble birth, and successful prevention of first a massacre and then the rash action of his son, the Roman historians describe Calavius as a man of unlimited ambition and yearning for power, who obtained his position through trickery. Some of this may have been interpolation from his skillful manipulation of the political crisis in 217, or it may reflect the Roman viewpoint of a powerful magistrate, whose actions placed the needs of his own city ahead of Rome.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiii. 2.

Background The refusal of medical assistance, or RMA, ensures the continuum of care that ambulance squads have a responsibility towards. In a typical emergency call, the ambulance service will assess and transport the patient to an appropriate facility. The ambulance squad's duty towards the patient begins with patient contact and generally ends with transfer to the emergency department of the receiving hospital. The call can terminate in other ways; for example an ambulance service may cancel their own services if the patient becomes violent (scene safety), if they are canceled by on-scene personnel (such as the police or, in the case of a MICU service, the on-scene BLS EMT), or at the discretion of the dispatcher (if another ambulance is better positioned to take the call). In general, once patient contact has been established, the ambulance service must either transport or obtain an appropriate refusal from the patient. Types There are three general types of RMA, designated by scope. In the widest sense, the patient may even refuse to be evaluated by EMS. Generally, however, the patient will submit to an evaluation (consisting of vitals and an assessment) before asking or being asked about refusal by the EMS agency. Or a patient may refuse only specific actions, such as C-spine precautions. Uses As policy, ambulance services are usually unable to release a patient on their own - that is, a crew is usually unable to determine that a patient is fine (this is the job of the doctors in a hospital). Unofficially, it may be obvious that a patient does not need transport - in these situations, EMS personnel may 'guide' the patient towards an RMA. The refusal is best suited for these situations; for example, a minor cut or bruise or uninjured parties in a motor vehicle accident. It can also be used where non-critical transport is advised, but it would be counterproductive to take the party by ambulance, e.g. an injured but fearful child could be comforted and transported to the hospital or doctor's office by the parent. In general, ambulance squads are unable to contravene the wishes of a mentally competent patient. This may lead to situations of likely cardiac compromise, likely internal trauma, or other life-threatening situations. However, if the patient is of sound mind, they are generally able to refuse treatment. The EMS provider has limited options at this point, since EMS generally cannot restrain and take a person involuntarily. However, depending on local policy, the police may be able to place the patient in protective custody (essentially arresting the person and releasing them to the EMS agency). This option is not to be pursued lightly. This is typically termed the RMA-AMA (refusal of medical assistance against medical advice) to differentiate it from a standard RMA (which may be assumed to be the end to a trivial call) Issues with refusal Most EMS providers operate on the principle of informed consent; that is, patients must know exactly what it is they are refusing, and what the possible consequences might be, in order to make a proper decision. This precludes parties who are intoxicated or otherwise incapable of making an informed decision, such as the mentally incompetent. Otherwise, agencies could release someone who was not able to understand what refusing might mean to their health. For similar reasons, minors (those under the age of 18) are generally unable to refuse medical care. In these circumstances, the crew can elect to wait for a parent or other legal guardian, who is able to. The refusal itself Ideally, the refusal is a form provided by and filled out by the agency and signed by multiple parties - usually the EMS agency itself, the patient (or his legal proxy or guardian), and a witness (ideally a police officer). A copy is attached to the patient care report or otherwise secured and retained by the agency, and another copy is usually given to the patient. The patient is advised of the risks of refusal, including the fact that their condition may worsen, and advised to call 9-1-1 or the emergency number without hesitation if they feel the need.

It is also named Vira Kamparaya Charitham by the poet. It chronicles the life of Kumara Kampana, a prince of the Vijayanagara Empire and the second son of Bukka Raya I. The poem describes in detail, the invasion and conquest of the Madurai Sultanate by the Vijayanagara empire. The poem along with Ibn Battuta's memoirs and epigraphical and numismatic records, has been used as a historical source for determining the history of the Madurai Sultanate and the Vijayanagar empire's conquest of the Sultanate. Content Madhura Vijayam (lit. The conquest of Madhura (Madurai) or Vira Kamparaya Charitham (lit. The history of the brave king Kampa) is a mahƒÅkƒÅvya (epic poem) in nine cantos (chapters), though possibly there was an extra canto (now lost) between the eighth and final canto. The available text contains 500-odd verses. M. Krishnamachariar in his History of Classical Sanskrit Literature describes the narrative as consisting of \\"melodious verses\\" and summarizes it thus:M. Krishnamachariar (1937), History of Classical Sanskrit Literature, Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanams Press, Madras, p. 215 In the early chapters, Gangadevi, the wife of Kumara Kampanna II, describes the historical background of the Vijayanagar empire, the benevolent rule of Bukka I, the birth and early life of Kumara Kampanna. The middle chapters detail the adulthood actions of Kampanna, his south bound invasion and conquest of Kanchipuram. After conquering Kanchipuram and subduing Sambuvaraya chieftain, Kampanna enjoys a brief interlude while consolidating his southern conquests. He is visited by a strange woman (described as the Goddess Meenakshi in disguise) who pleads with him to liberate South India from the rule of the Madurai Sultanate. Heeding her exhortation, Kampanna resumes his invasion of the South. The final chapters chronicle his invasion of Madurai, where he destroys the Muslim armies, slays the last sultan in single combat and restores the temple of Srirangam to its old glory.

It was found in the form of a single manuscript of sixty-one palm leaves, bound between two other unrelated works. The available poem is made up of nine cantos (chapters) containing 500-odd verses, with some verses incomplete and others missing and presumed lost, including possibly an entire canto between the eighth and final canto.

Along with Hamline Avenue Station and Victoria Street Station, this station was originally planned to be an infill station that would be built after the main line was constructed and if there was sufficient demand. However, significant political pressure and changes in the Federal Transit Administration's rules led to an early 2010 announcement that it would be built at the same time as the rest of the line. Construction in this area began in 2012. The station opened along with the rest of the line in 2014.

Biography Early life Wilhelm Friedrich Iwan was born in Falkenberg in the Prussian province of Upper Silesia, on August 5, 1871, as the third of seven sons, to a master builder and brick factory owner, Gottlieb Iwan. He attended secondary school at Breslau and Hirschberg and graduated valedictorian. He then went on to study theology at the Silesian Frederick William University and the Hallensis in Halle upon Saale.

He documented these years in his journals, including accounts of his congregation and his personal experiences. As a collector, he assembled Australian pipes, boomerangs, snake skins, butterflies, glass cages with hummingbirds, cabin trunks full of furs and pelts, poison tipped arrows and stone weapons, tortoise shells, precious gems, and gold dust. He brought these collections to Silesia when he returned. Return to Germany Iwan returned from a life of world travel to Germany in 1911 and soon settled into a new life. In 1912, he married Hedwig Koffmane the daughter of a well-respected Silesian theologian Gustav Koffmane, and together they had five daughters. The Nicolstadt (also spelt Nikolstadt) congregation, a parish within the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces, was his first and also his last in Germany, as he worked for the next 30 years as pastor of the local Lutheran church of the village (map, postcard picture) near Wahlstatt.

Refugee In 1939, he retired and moved to Breslau hoping for some peaceful years, but at the end of January 1945, towards the end of World War II, as the Russian army was moving into Silesia, he was forced to flee his city on foot taking his ailing wife and his children with him, pulling his luggage behind him on a small sled, leaving behind his books, manuscripts, collections, and property. After several stops, he and his family were fortunate to be taken aboard a hospital train in May 1945, and made the dangerous journey to Lindau on Lake Constance. From there, the refugee office sent them along with other displaced civilians to Wohmbrechts. There they lived under the sponsorship of a farmer by the name of Reichart. Iwan had to earn his keep but was also well treated for five years by the family. At the age of 80, he succeeded in finding a new home in Wangen im Allg√§u where he died on May 27, 1958, aged 86. He is buried together with his wife in the local Sankt Wolfgang cemetery. Places named after Wilhelm Iwan A street in Hamburg, the Wilhelm-Iwan-Ring in the suburb of Allerm√∂he, is named after him.

The route of Bustamante's Atrevida was mostly the same, but deviated in some places. The Descubierta and Atrevida were twin corvettes of the Spanish Navy, custom-designed as identical special exploration and scientific research vessels . Both ships were built at the same time for the Malaspina Expedition. Under the command of Alessandro Malaspina (Descubierta) and Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra (Atrevida) the two vessels sailed from Spain to the Pacific Ocean, conducting a thorough examination of the internal politics of the American Spanish Empire and the Philippines. They explored the coast of Alaska and worked to reinforce Spain's claim to the Pacific Northwest in the aftermath of the Nootka Crisis. After crossing the Pacific Ocean, the government in the Philippines examined. Exploration and diplomatic reconnaissance followed, with stops in China, New Zealand, Australia, and Tonga. Under Malaspina's supervision and according to his specifications the Descubierta and Atrevida were constructed at the La Carraca shipyard in Cadiz by the shipbuilder T√≥mas Mu√±oz . Both vessels were long with a beam of , a depth of hold of , and a tonnage of 306 toneladas.The Spanish word toneladas is a unit of capacity of a ship's hold, roughly equivalent to English terms ton, tonnage, or tons burthen. The exact size of a tonelada varied but was usually somewhat smaller than the English ton. For older ships it is difficult if not impossible to convert between English tons and Spanish toneladas. See Glossary of Spanish Names, Blue Water Ventures . The tonelada was eventually standardized to (See ). The complement of both the Descubierta and the Atrevida was 104. Their armament consisted of fourteen 6-pounder and two 4-pounder cannons. They were launched together on 8 April 1789. Malaspina Expedition Malaspina's expedition was the most important voyage of discovery dispatched by Spain in the 18th century. It had two primary goals, the first being to increase geographic and scientific knowledge in general, the second being to check on the status of Spain's vast empire, especially along the west coast of North America, where the Russians and the British were expanding their influence. Modeled after the voyages of James Cook, the Malaspina expedition was conducted in a highly scientific manner. Numerous scientists from many fields were among the crew. Indigenous peoples, such as the Tlingit and Tongan, were studied by the expedition's ethnographers. The Descubierta and Atrevida sailed from Cadiz on 30 July 1789, stopping first at Montevideo on the R√≠o de la Plata, then sailing south along the coast of Patagonia and visiting the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas). After rounding Cape Horn the expedition stopped at several Chilean ports and surveyed the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. The two corvettes sailed north separately, surveying and mapping the coast between Peru and Mexico, where they arrived at the end of March 1790. In Mexico Malaspina received instructions from the Spanish king, Carlos IV requiring a change of plans. Instead of sailing to the Hawaiian Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula, Malaspina was to sail to Alaska and survey the coast between Mount Saint Elias and Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island, in order to prove or disprove the existence of a Northwest Passage supposedly located in that area. Accordingly, the two corvettes sailed from Acapulco on 1 May 1791, and arrived at Yakutat Bay by the end of June. Staying at Yakutat Bay for about a month, the scientists made detailed ethnographic studies of the local Tlingit people. Surveys along the coast of Alaska revealed no hint of the fabled Northwest Passage. On July 27 Malaspina and Bustamante headed south to Nootka Sound, arriving there on 12 August 1791. They remained at Nootka Sound for about a month. Detailed surveys were made of the area, while the ethnographers studied the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people. Leaving Nootka Sound, Malaspina and Bustamante sailed the Descubierta and Atrevida south to Monterey, Alta California. There Malaspina learned from Juan Carrasco that an inland sea had been discovered near Nootka Sound. It was the Strait of Georgia. Malaspina knew that an exploration voyage had to be dispatched immediately. He gave two of his officers, Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano and Cayetano Vald√©s y Flores, command of two newly constructed goletas (schooners or brigs), and instructed them to thoroughly explore the new discovery. Malaspina himself supervised the final construction and fitting out of the two goletas, called the Sutil and the Mexicana. The Malaspina expedition crossed the Pacific Ocean, from Acapulco to Manila in the Philippines, by way of the Mariana Islands. Coastal surveys were done and a side-trip to Macao was made. Then the two corvettes sailed southwest, landing at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, then continuing on to southern New Zealand. After a visit to Dusky Sound, previously explored by Cook, the Spaniards explored Doubtful Sound, which no European had visited before. From New Zealand the expedition sailed west to Port Jackson, Australia (today part of Sydney). They arrived in March 1793, about five years after the British first colonized Australia. The Malaspina expedition stayed for about a month. Relations with the British colonists were warm and friendly. The Spanish conducted scientific experiments, including astronomical and hydrographic observations, and the collection of many specimens of flora, fauna, and minerals. They also observed the British settlement, taking special note of any potential threat to Spanish interests in the Pacific. Malaspina was concerned that the increasing British presence in the Pacific might jeopardize Spanish trade between the Americas and the Philippines, which the Manila galleons had carried out for over two centuries with virtually no outside interference. The Spanish corvettes left Port Jackson on 11 April 1793 and sailed northeast to Tonga, then known as the Friendly Islands. Cook had visited the southern Tongan islands in 1773. Malaspina opted to visit the northern archipelago now known as Vava ªu. After the stay in Tonga the expedition sailed to Peru, then back around Cape Horn and on to Spain, arriving in Cadiz on 21 September 1793 after a voyage of over four years. Aftermath In Spain Malaspina's involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow the government culminated in Malaspina's arrest, imprisonment, and eventually banishment. Most of the material collected by the expedition was put away and didn't see the light again until late in the 20th century.

Design and development In 1917, Nieuport-Macchi built the M.6. for comparison with its Macchi M.5 flying boat fighter, which went into service that year and operated successfully over the Adriatic Sea against Austro- Hungarian forces during World War I. The M.6 was identical to the M.5 in most respects; like the M.5, it was a single-seat wooden biplane flying boat fighter with plywood and fabric skin, powered by a 139-kilowatt (187-brake horsepower) Isotta Fraschini V.4B engine mounted on struts above the hull and below the upper wing, driving a pusher propeller. Its cockpit was beneath the radiator, it was armed with a single 7.7-millimeter (0.303-inch) Vickers machine gun, and its hull was of the same design. It differed from the M.5 in having a different wing cellule; instead of the interplane Vee struts used in the M.5 to brace the wings and the smaller Vee struts used in the M.5 to support the overhanging leading edge of the upper wing, the M.6 had parallel steel tube struts. The outermost of a set of parallel struts were placed farther outboard in the M.6 than the Vee struts in the M.5, and the M.6 had additional parallel struts closer to the hull.Green and Swanborough, p. 356-357. Comparative trials were held between the M.6 prototype and standard M.5 aircraft to evaluate whether the M.6s revised wing cellule provided any advantage over that of the M.5 fighter. It did not, so further development of the M.6 was abandoned and no more M.6 aircraft were built.Green and Swanborough, p. 356-357.

During World War I, daily life was affected as men were drafted and sent abroad, and women had to fill their places in the factories. Youth programs grew and developed in a response to aid the government with these new programs. During and after the war, life for children in the United States was greatly affected in a variety of ways. Drawing by Marguerite Martyn of two women and a child knitting for the war effort at a St. Louis, Missouri, Red Cross office in 1917 More than 116,000 members of the U.S. military died in the war, far fewer than combatants from other countries. No one has estimated how many orphans resulted.Greenwald, Women, War, and Work, 4 Additionally, as the male workforce left for battle, mothers and sisters began working in factories to take their positions, and the family dynamic began to change; this affected children as they had less time to spend with family members and were expected to grow up faster and help with the war effort. Similarly, Woodrow Wilson called on children involved in youth organizations to help collect money for war bonds and stamps in order to raise money for the war effort.McDermott, T. P \\"USA's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds\\", pg. 70 This was a way to mobilize public opinion and shame adults who did not donate. The Office of War Information and other agencies implemented programs and created posters and pamphlets to encourage war support. Background of World War I The United States was involved in World War I for the last 19 months of the war (April 1917 to November 1918), 4,355,000 men were conscripted into service. By summer 1918, they were trained and shipped to France at the rate of 10,000 military personnel a day.John W. Chambers, II, To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America (1987) Meanwhile, every farm, town and city, and every economic sector, was mobilized for the war effort. Tens of millions of parents took war jobs or joined voluntary organizations such as the Red Cross. This involvement changed the course of the war and directly affected daily life, education, and family structures of children in the United States.Adams, Eyewitness, 62 The home front saw a systematic mobilization of the entire population and the entire economy to produce the soldiers, food supplies, munitions, and money needed to win the war. Although the United States entered the war in 1917, there had been very little planning, or even recognition of the problems that the British and other Allies had to solve on their homefronts. As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, then efficiency took control.David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (2004), is the standard scholarly history Impact on daily life After the United States entered the war, daily life was affected for most as men prepared for battle, women began working, and children and families had less time to spend together. The women and children did much more work than they used to. Children were affected as many of their fathers were killed or wounded in battle, and their mothers began working long hours in the factories. As the war progressed, technology advanced and industry boomed, enabling women to spend less time on household chores and more time outside of the home.Dowswell, True Stories, 131 The American family began to change as women started working more regularly, which affected the role of the child in American life, The Great Depression also followed WWI . Home life Girls too young for paid jobs learned how they could help the war effort. Over 21 million people were killed or injured in World War I; in many cases, all of the men in one family were killed, numerous cities in Europe were destroyed, and family life throughout the world was greatly affected.Adams, Eyewitness, 30 While the United States suffered the fewest casualties, family life was still greatly affected as husbands were deployed and wives had to begin working. As the war draft suddenly removed many men from factory work, the factories began soliciting for women workers in traditionally male-dominated areas. Therefore, women had less time to spend at home with the children, as many of them would have before the war. As fathers, uncles, brothers, and grandfathers deployed in military service, women filled their places in factories and offices, changing the ways young children and teens received home nurturing. Additionally, women moving into new roles in society had lasting effects on children and family life after the war. President Woodrow Wilson stated, \\"We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?\\"\\"Wilson Makes Suffrage Appeal, But Senate Waits\\" The New York Times. As women began working in the factories, more of society began to realize the need for women's rights; while women had been granted suffrage (voting rights) to varying degrees in several states beginning in the late 19th century, they were now guaranteed full suffrage throughout the United States by the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution passed in August, 1920. This also paved the way for the children of future generations by creating greater career opportunities for girls and women; as women gained a stronger voice, girls became more involved in the workforce and education and prepared for roles outside of the home. Additionally, family life was affected after the war as more and more women entered the work force, moving away from the traditional stay-at-home mother and housewife role. Over the course of the war, the United States mobilized hundreds of thousands of men and endured an estimated 117,465 casualties.\\"American Merchant Marine at War, www.usmm.org\\" Of the men who survived and returned home, post-traumatic stress disorder created a major impact on society. During this time, and still today, post-traumatic stress (then more likely to be known as \\"shell shock\\") was not fully understood, but because of the traumatic nature of battle, many men were negatively affected after the war. Some men were forced to leave battle, which many people considered cowardice, and there were asylums throughout Europe housing men suffering from this condition. In some extreme cases, men were even shot for showing weakness. There are still people living today who lost family members because of this practice, which created lasting impacts on these children. Additionally, many of these men were teenagers when they left for war, and virtually all were under the age of 30; therefore many of these soldiers were barely out of childhood themselves.Dowswell, True Stories, 132 This is a young American man enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War I. Furthermore, because over a million young men were deployed overseas, marriage had to be postponed. In addition, a large number of the military personnel who returned home suffered from serious permanent injuries. Technology On the home front, domestic appliances were being created, alleviating the amount of time that women needed to spend on chores, so they had more time to work outside of the home. Additionally, this lessened the need for female servants, as things like laundry services and food preparation services became popular.Greenwald, Women, War, and Work, 11 Therefore, women were able to move into more traditionally male-dominated areas, as technology began to do the service jobs that women primarily were responsible for. Additionally, this showed young girls that they could eventually work outside of the home and more opportunities were available to them after they completed their education. Impact on Education World War I altered education in the United States through curriculum changes with government pamphlets and required patriotism sessions. Even though the United States was only involved in World War I for a short period of time, the government instituted many programs for and changes to American education. During this war period, there was a strong focus on nationalism and patriotism, which significantly affected education. Woodrow Wilson and the United States government funded a series of pamphlets, posters, bulletins, and speeches, which promoted strong nationalism and anti-German sentiments.Spring, Images of American Life, 20 These forms of nationalist propaganda were used nationwide in public school districts and influenced students to remain loyal to the United States. These programs promoted things like volunteering with federal organizations such as the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and buying War Bonds to support the government.Spring, Images of American Life, 25 Additionally, the government created several programs to help support education such as the Committee of Public Information (CPI), the National Education Association (NEA), and the Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education, all of which promoted nationalist movements and changes to education. For example, as part of the CPI and NEA programs, with the assistance of Woodrow Wilson, pamphlets were published advocating democracy and national patriotism in schools. These pamphlets also focused on a new movement of social efficacy, which strongly favored students growing as people and becoming involved, patriotic citizens. Another main goal of these educational programs was a move away from state education systems and toward a nationalized system of education, which would keep curriculums similar and promote a unified nation among students.Spring, Images of American Life, 21 For example, the national government changed textbooks to portray the American Revolution in a way that didn't make Britain appear malevolent. This was important because the United States allied with Great Britain.Spring, Images of American Life, 27 Starting as early as the elementary level, patriotic and pro-war lessons were instituted in public schools. They included things such as weekly fifteen-minute periods on patriotism for first and second grades. They stressed that teachers instruct the children so that they viewed the war in a positive manner and portrayed war in terms of celebrations, and victories, not destructive realities. An elementary pamphlet stated, \\"In teaching the war to young pupils, the appeal should be directed primarily to the imagination and to the emotions. It is not enough that our pupils shall be informed of the events of the war...Their imaginations must be awakened and their feelings aroused to an appreciation of the significance of the great happenings of the times.\\" Therefore, starting at a very early level, students were taught that the war was a good thing and the importance of patriotism. The patriotic sentiments were also carried out in secondary settings. Specific programs and in-school curricula targeted the patriotic development of children, especially teens. New history curricula introduced rewrote the story of the American past to de-emphasize the friction between the colonies and Britain, and to deconstruct historical American and German amity, to vilify the Germans.Spring, Images of American Life, 24‚Äì25 For example, every senior in high school received their own pamphlet in January 1918 called \\"Study of the Great War.\\" This attempted to encourage enmity for Germany and emphasized the importance of an Allied victory. Things like the importance of the ROTC program were also stressed during this time. Nationalist posters and other forms of propaganda were placed in public areas throughout the country and again showed the importance of patriotism.Spring, Images of American Life, 25‚Äì26 Posters, like the Boy Scout poster shown below, depicted teenagers helping the war effort as being courageous and admired. This form of propaganda was especially influential on teenagers because most of them were trying to figure out their roles in society and desired to fit in; therefore, posters showing their peers serving their country and receiving recognition and respect, were particularly influential in persuading teenagers to join the war effort in whatever way they could.Snowman, McCown, and Biehler, pg. 29 Post-war After the war ended, nationalist movements changed to a larger focus on international peace. There were strong government movements toward peace and anti-war sentiments and the need to avoid further wars.Wit, Internationalization of Higher Education, 10 Additionally, there was a focus on internationalization of higher education. For example, in 1920, the Belgian American Educational Foundation instituted a program with over 700 students, in which American students went to study in Belgium and vice versa in order to promote international understanding.Wit, Internationalization of Higher Education, 22 Youth organizations As a result of World War I, youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls greatly expanded, helping to raise money for the war effort.McDermott, T. P \\"America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds\\", pg. 70‚Äì72 Boy Scouts Due to the large nationalist movement during World War I, many youth organizations were developed or expanded, including the Boy Scouts of America. During World War I, Woodrow Wilson placed a great importance on the Boy Scouts of America, asking them to encourage war support and educate the public sources about the importance of the war. They helped distribute the war pamphlets, helped sell war bonds and helped to drive nationalism and support for the war. Additionally, they were involved in many acts that helped the national government, such as locating black walnut to use in war materials and peach pits for gas masks.McDermott, T.P. \\"America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds\\" The Boy Scouts were involved in five Liberty Bond drives in which they helped sell Liberty Bonds to benefit the American Government. During the first campaign, they raised a total of $23,000,000 and in the second drive they collected $. For the third campaign, known as the \\"Wake Up, America\\" rally, beginning on April 27, 1918, 400,000 Boy Scouts embarked on a door to window program selling Liberty Bonds as well as war stamps. At the end of the five campaigns, the Boy Scouts raised $354,859,262 in bond subscriptions and $43,043,698 in war stamps.McDermott, T. P \\"America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds\\", pg. 72 When a Boy Scout sold a bond or stamp, he would record the sale and send in a post card to his local post office, which would then forward it to the bonds and stamps, he would receive an \\"Ace Medal\\".McDermott, T.

Aftermath After the conclusion of World War I, the United States and the rest of the world changed. Those who were children during World War I grew up to become the adults of World War II. These children were exposed to propaganda and indoctrinated to value strong nationalism and loyalty to the United States and its allies. Therefore, when World War II was on the forefront, many of the adults in the United States still harbored negative feelings toward the Germans because of their schooling during World War I. Additionally, women were granted suffrage shortly after World War I. This was partly due to the fact that they had moved away from their traditional roles and filled the factory jobs that the men were forced to leave in order to serve in World War I. Women showed their importance in society, which fueled many women's rights movements post‚ÄìWorld War I. The girls who were in school during World War I were also learning about the importance of nationalism, and saw their mothers fulfilling traditionally male-dominated roles. This desire for nationalism and exposure to wider opportunities helped to enable these girls to grow up and become involved in securing rights for themselves.

Clarence Ollson Senior (1903‚Äì1974) was an American socialist political activist best remembered as the National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America during the 1930s. Originally a prot√©g√© of Presidential candidate Norman Thomas, during the inner-party fight of the 1930s, Senior became an active supporter of the so-called \\"Militant\\" faction. After resigning his post late in 1936, Senior returned to graduate school, becoming a widely published academic specializing on the affairs of Puerto Rico and other nations of the Caribbean. Biography Early years Clarence Ollson Senior was born in 1903. He attended the University of Kansas, where he was active in the Student League for Industrial Democracy, the current incarnation of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society headed by Harry W. Laidler.Bernard K. Johnpoll, Pacifist's Progress: Norman Thomas and the Decline of American Socialism. Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1970; pg. 60. Senior worked his way through high school and college, performing a variety of jobs, including work as a mechanic, night watchman, truck driver, shipping clerk and working in a soap factory.\\"Roy E. Burn, New National Secretary; Ill Health Caused Senior Resignation,\\" Socialist Action [Chicago], vol. 2, no. 9 (November 1936), pg. 1. Upon graduation from Kansas, Senior had become associated with the League of Kansas MunicipalitiesDavid Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A History. New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 202. before moving to join the Cleveland Federation of Teachers in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1927, Senior joined the Socialist Party of America. Historian Bernard K. Johnpoll indicates that Senior was an acolyte of rising Socialist Party star Norman Thomas even in these early days, representative of the sort of middle class intellectuals which Thomas sought to bring into the party. Senior spent three months in Europe in 1928 studying workers' education on behalf of the Adult Education Association.\\"Clarence Senior,\\" short biography, 1930. Socialist Party of the United States of America Records, Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison, WI. Box 6, folder 4. While in Europe, Senio attended a conference of the War Resisters' International and was a delegate to the World Youth Peace Congress held in the Netherlands. Political career During the second half of the 1920s, the Socialist Party was headed by William H. Henry, a venerable party loyalist from Indiana. Historian Irving Howe recalled Henry as an inept figure: > \\"...provincial, bumbling, half-literate ‚Äî one of those figures from the > Midwest who might have stepped out of a Dreiser novel depicting the struggle > of small-town Americans for the rudiments of culture. That the Socialist > Party could find no one better to run its day-to-day affairs tells almost > everything about its decline.\\"Irving Howe, Socialism and America. New York: > Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985; pg. 50. When the Spring of 1929, Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party Henry fell into personal difficulties with his wife, Emma Henry, herself the SPA's State Secretary in Indiana, Executive Secretary Henry abruptly resigned his office.Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pg. 201. The governing National Executive Committee found themselves in a position of needing to find a permanent replacement, appointing Mabel H. Barnes to fulfill the role on a temporary basis. The NEC targeted the 27-year-old college-educated Clarence Senior for the position, bringing him to New York City for conversations with key party leaders. Senior confessed that he felt inadequate to the task of assuming the position of National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party owing to his rather superficial knowledge of socialist theory. Morris Hillquit queried the young man from Cleveland: \\"You've read Comrade Laidler's book, haven't you?\\" Senior allowed that he had. Harry Laidler continued in the same vein: \\"You've read Comrade Hillquit's book, haven't you?\\" Again, Senior responded in the affirmative. \\"What more do you need to know about socialist theory?\\" asked Morris Hillquit with a smile.Interview of Clarence Senior by Harry Fleischman, March 1974. Cited in Howe, Socialism in America, pg. 50. The NEC arbitrarily waived the party's constitutional requirement that the Executive Secretary be a party member for at least three years and named Senior to the position. The formal nomination of Senior was made by NEC member Victor L. Berger on June 11, 1929, and was approved by a vote of 6 to 2, with 1 abstention, on June 19.Socialist Party of the United States of America Records, Wisconsin Historical Society, box 1, folder 5. The Socialist Party was in a tenuous position when Senior was finally able to assume his new position in August 1929. The party owed money to its printer and was nearly two years in arrears in the payment of its dues to the Socialist International in Switzerland. Party membership was at its nadir, less than 8,000, about half of whom were members of non-English-speaking foreign language federations.\\"Socialist Party of America Annual Membership Figures,\\" Early American Marxism website. Retrieved February 2, 2010. Senior was instrumental in solidifying the party's financial situation through economical operation of the national office and through the successful solicitation of funds from the organization's loyal remaining membership core. Senior also set about building the size of the Socialist Party's membership ranks. Historian David A. Shannon recalled: > \\"When Clarence Senior became national secretary in the summer of 1929, he > brought to the national office some long-needed vigor. the results were > immediate. By the end of 1929 the Socialist Party had gained more members > than it had in all the years since 1923. Through the United Socialist Drive > it had raised more funds than it had in years, it had revived the flow of > Socialist pamphlets which had all but dried up since the war, and it had > boosted the circulation of Socialist newspapers....Shannon, The Socialist > Party of America, pg. 207. Senior established a Social Problems Lecture Bureau bringing Socialist speakers to paying audiences around the country, promoting the party's cause and bringing in needed funds at the same time.Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pp. 207-208. Senior also targeted sympathetic individuals who were not formal members of the Socialist Party in his fund-raising efforts, sending out 10,000 letters as part of a 1931 campaign called the \\"Socialism Forward Drive.\\"Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pg. 208. These efforts proved to be relatively successful. \\"The Socialist Party never had enough money to do all it wanted to, but Senior's money-raising enabled it to do more than it had for over a decade,\\" Shannon notes.Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pp. 208-209. While the Socialist Party received an injection of enthusiasm in the aftermath of the first Presidential run of Norman Thomas in November 1928 and gained adherents in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and the coming of the Great Depression, many believe the party's growth during the first half of the 1930s was also due to Clarence Senior's energetic leadership. Historian David Shannon called 1930. Senior's first year on the job as Executive Secretary, \\"the first full year of vigorous leadership for the party since [Otto] Branstetter resigned in the early 1920s.\\"Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pg. 224. A period of growth followed, with 32 new SPA locals established in 1930, 96 more in 1931, and nearly 600 in 1932. With the influx of new members came a radicalization of the Socialist Party, with many newcomers professing a belief in revolutionary socialism rather than strictly concentrating upon biannual parliamentary campaigns. From about 1930 these new radicals organized themselves into a formal faction known as the \\"Militants,\\" while older, more tradition-bound members also formally organized themselves as a so-called \\"Old Guard faction.\\"Johnpoll, Pacifist's Progress, pg. 88. Senior aligned himself with the younger, more vigorous, and more radical forces and against the \\"Old Guard.\\" In the summer of 1933 the Militants, with Senior as their ostensible spokesman, sought to remove \\"official\\" status from the New York weekly newspaper The New Leader, the voice of the Old Guard edited by James Oneal ‚Äî an action which earned the enmity of the slighted moderates. Personal antipathy was also intertwined in this factional struggle. Ever since 1928, party Presidential candidate Norman Thomas had been at odds with National Chairman Morris Hillquit, the best known and most widely respected of the Old Guard leaders. According to one historian, Thomas had played a leading role in an effort to oust Hillquit: > \\"Thomas believed that Hillquit acted as a brake on Socialist activity > nationally at a time when Thomas's prot√©g√©, Clarence Senior, was trying to > make the party an effective organization. For these reasons, Thomas was > instrumental in arranging for a coalition of all anti-Hillquit elements in > an effort to wrest the national chairmanship from him.\\"Johnpoll, Pacifist's > Progress, pg. 92. At the same time the Old Guard, with National Chairman Morris Hillquit at their head, sought to remove Senior from his post as National Executive Secretary in favor of their own man, Marx Lewis,Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pg. 237. who had recently led successful fundraising efforts on behalf of the Milwaukee socialist daily newspaper, The Milwaukee Leader.The fundraising effort on behalf of the Leader was organized under the banner of the Victor L. Berger Foundation, with Marx Lewis at the helm. See: Nathan Fine (ed.), The American Labor Year Book, 1931. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1931; pg. 152. Although the governing NEC of the party was narrowly split between the followers of Hillquit and Thomas, Clarence Senior was narrowly able to retain his position in 1932 due to the concerted effort of the Thomas group. This phase of the inner-party struggle ended in October 1933, when Hillquit died from the tuberculosis which had plagued him throughout his life and the balance of power shifted further away from the Old Guard in the Socialist Party. In August 1933, Senior was elected one of six delegates of the SPA to a special conference of the Labor and Socialist International held in Paris. Senior was joined by three other members of the Militant faction, including Paul Blanshard and Professor Maynard Krueger, as well as two supporters of the Old Guard, Hermann Kobbe and Jacob Panken.Johnpoll, Pacifist's Progress, pg. 116. The Militant majority of the American delegation lent their support to what one historian has called a \\"quasi-Communist resolution\\" calling for \\"workers' democracy\\" ‚Äî a position which factional patriarch Norman Thomas did not share.Johnpoll, Pacifist's Progress, pp. 116-117. Thomas was placed in a difficult position when this action of his allies was repudiated at a national conference of the SPA held in Detroit in June 1934.Johnpoll, Pacifist's Progress, pg. 117. In 1935, the Socialist Party began an official party newspaper, The Socialist Call, in opposition to The New Leader, and the organization moved towards a formal split, with James Oneal, Louis Waldman, Algernon Lee, and the Old Guard leaving the party immediately after the May 1936 Cleveland Convention to form the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Senior remained in the post of Executive Secretary through the November 1936 election, resigning in December so that he might go to Mexico to \\"recover his health.\\"\\"Retires,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 2, whole no. 91 (December 12, 1936), pg. 2. The retiring Senior was feted at a dinner in his honor at the Cafe Idrott in Chicago on the evening of December 12, 1936. Senior was replaced by Roy E. Burt, effective December 15, 1936.\\"Burt, Trager Take Posts at Party Office,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 2, whole no. 92 (December 19, 1936), pg. 3. The Roosevelt landslide in the 1936 election in the face of a full Socialist campaign was disheartening and amidst the faction fighting and splits, party membership dropped precipitously. By February 1937 less than 6,500 paid members remained in the organization.Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pg. 249. With the end of Senior's tenure as Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party, his political career essentially drew to a close. A new chapter of his life awaited him in the world of academia. Academic career Around 1940, Senior returned to college, attending the University of Kansas City (now the University of Missouri-Kansas City) in the Department of Political Science and History. In 1942 he completed his Masters' thesis, entitled The Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railroad. Senior went on to publish a wide range of journal articles and books, specializing on Puerto Rican affairs with an emphasis on matters of emigration and the problems of the Puerto Rican working class. Senior was also the biographer of Puerto Rican socialist and labor leader Santiago Iglesias, with his book published on that figure in 1972.Clarence Ollson Senior, Santiago Iglesias: Labor Crusader. Hato Rey, Puerto Rico: Interamerican University Press, 1972. Later years, death, and legacy Clarence Senior died in 1974.

Season summary The big news at Chelsea at the start of the 1995-96 season was the arrival of Manchester United striker Mark Hughes, one of the most accomplished strikers of the last decade in the English leagues, and the arrival of Dutch superstar Ruud Gullit. Chelsea had a mid-table Premiership campaign in 1995‚Äì96, finishing 11th for the third time in four seasons, but once again they enjoyed a good cup run. This time they reached the FA Cup semi-finals, taking on Manchester United, who had beaten them in the final two years earlier. Chelsea took an early lead, but lost 2-1 and with it went their hopes of a foray into Europe. A few weeks later, Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle's decision to quit for the England manager's job was understandable as a job he could not turn down. They responded by appointing Ruud Gullit as player-manager. Gullit wasted no time in preparing Chelsea for the following season, breaking the club record in a ¬£4.9 million move for Italian midfielder Roberto Di Matteo from Lazio.

Although the Timurid Mongols had been Muslim since the early 14th century, a strong hostility remained between them and the Ottoman Turks as well as the Egyptian Mamluks. Although his self-proclaimed title was ghazi (or \\"conqueror\\"), Timur maintained relatively friendly relations with Europe. Europe at the time was threatened by the invading armies of the Ottoman Turks and was desperate for allies. Timur likewise saw the European states as allies to help him destroy his Ottoman enemies. After his campaigns in India in 1399, Timur took Aleppo and Damascus in 1400. He fought and eventually vanquished the Ottoman ruler Bayazid I at the Battle of Ankara in July 1402. Relations with Spanish and French kingdoms Prior to the Battle of Ankara, as the Hundred Years War was going through a quiet phase, many European knights and men-at-arms sought adventure abroad and some of these ended up serving in Tamerlane's armies. There is one recorded instance of a French squire by the name of Jacques du Fey who served under Timur though the exact circumstances of his service are unknown. What is known is that Timur released him so he could rejoin his countrymen for the crusade against the Ottomans which ended in disastrous failure at the Battle of Nicopolis. After the battle, the Ottoman sultan ordered many prisoners to be executed but Tartar warriors, sent by Timur to answer the Ottomans' call for Jihad, recognized Jacques du Fey and were able to save him from execution. At the time of the Battle of Ankara, two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. There was the possibility of an alliance between Timur and the European states against the Ottoman Turks attacking Europe. There was a clear motive for Timur, who wanted to surround his Ottoman and Mamluk enemies in an offensive alliance. These mirrored attempts towards a Franco-Mongol alliance a century before, especially since Ottoman offensives were already threatening Constantinople at that time. Timur sent an ambassador to the court of Charles VI, in the person of the Dominican friar Jean, Archbishop of SultƒÅnƒ´ya. Jean arrived in Paris on 15 June 1403. Timur's letter was delivered to Charles VI, describing him as: Timur offered an offensive and defensive alliance to Charles VI, as well as the development of commercial relations. Charles VI was only able to send an answer and an envoy shortly before Timur's death (1405). Relations with Spain were also developed. In the view of the Spanish historian Miguel √Ångel Ochoa Brun, the relations between the courts of Henry III of Castile and that of Timur were the most important episode of the mediaeval Castilian diplomacy. Timur sent to the court of Castile a Chagatay ambassador named Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi with letters and gifts. In December 1402, Timur came into direct conflict with a small European outpost on the Anatolian coast. The fortress and harbour of the city of Smyrna were held by the Knights Hospitaller. Timur besieged Smyrna for a fortnight and captured it. This action caused some consternation in Aragon and Castile. Embassy of Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo In return, King Henry III of Castile sent an embassy to Timur's court in Samarkand on 21 May 1403, led by Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo, with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return in 1406, Timur said that he regarded the king of Spain \\"as his very own son\\". According to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the \\"lord of Cathay\\" (i.e., the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor). The Chinese ruler, whose title was \\"lord of the realms of the face of the earth\\",. Her source is , who in his turn cites a translation of the Persian text of Yongle's letter from a Samarkand ca. 1475 source was called by Timur (to Clavijo's face) a \\"thief and a bad man\\", and his ambassadors were seated below the Spaniards.. Her source is . (Levathes quotes a 1970 reprint, with the same pagination). Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from Cathay (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of Marco Polo. Clavijo's account reported, even if in a garbled form, on the recent civil war between the descendants of the Hongwu Emperor. The Spanish were able to talk to some of the Chinese visitors, and learned about the caravan routes between Samarkand and Cambalu (Beijing). Besides telling the European readers about the Cathayan capital Cambalu, which he was told was \\"the largest city in the world\\", and the mighty armies of that country, Clavijo also‚Äîmistakenly‚Äîreported that the new emperor of Cathay had converted to Catholicism.. During Clavijo's visit the capital of the Ming Empire was actually Nanjing, rather than Beijing (Cambalu). Thus his report served as one of the factors supporting the European belief in the widespread presence of Christianity in Cathay, which was to persist until the early 17th century and to be one of the reasons for sending the famed Bento de G√≥is expedition in 1603. Relations after Timur Timur died in 1405, and his son Shah Rukh continued to campaign against the Ottomans, creating hope in the Christian West that the invading Ottoman Empire might be diverted away from Europe. A Bavarian adventurer, Johann Schiltberger, is known to have remained in the service of Timur from 1402 to 1405. Also, numerous Venetian and Genoese traders were active in Sultaniya at that time, since the time of their establishment in Sultaniya under the Il-Khanids. The next contacts between Europe and Persia would be those of the Venetian traveler Niccolo da Conti from 1420 to 1425. Contacts failed to develop much further thereafter, although Spain's desire for rapprochement with the Mongols remained until the time of Christopher Columbus in 1492, whose objective was to reach the Great Khan in China. The story of Tamerlane has a long legacy associated with Orientalism in Europe, with such publications as Tamburlaine the Great by Christopher Marlowe in 1590 and Handel's opera Tamerlano in 1724.

It is revealed that Thulasi is none other, but the daughter of Harinarayanan Namboothiri, who was killed in a fire accident years back. Automatically, the ownership of the house comes into the hands of Tulasi. One night, one of the disciples of Madhavan is killed. The same night, Madhavan is attacked by Jayan, the son of Gupthan Namboothiri. The next day, Jayan's corpse is found in the river. Beeran (Devan), the SP of police arrives at the spot for investigation and is shocked to find another corpse, that is of Vishahari, a trusted left hand of Jayan in the house. Madhavan explains Beeran the secrets of the supernatural things happening inside. A secret passage exists from the pond to the river that carries anyone who steps into the pond to the river. He also explains, that it was not any supernatural element that had killed his disciple, but was Jayan and Vishahari, who were in the house to hunt down Madhavan. The next night, Madhavan is getting prepared for the final puja to clear up the whole mess, when Gireeshan arrives in the garbs of Savitri. It is revealed that Gireeshan is suffering from multiple personality disorder and it is him, whom many people mistook to the ghost of Savitri. Madhavan physically overpowers Gireeshan and defeats him, thereby putting an end to the mystery of the ghost. He thus moves back from Nellur Mana, handing the key to Thulasimani.

Sammis (October 8, 1820 ‚Äì October 17. 1908) was the son of Ezra Sammis and Anna Hawxhurst, born in Oyster Bay, New York on October 8, 1820. He would live his whole life in Oyster Bay, and during that time became a leading merchant, property owner, and civic figure in Long Island. He was a close personal friend of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Sammis at age 80 Biography Sammis was the son of Ezra Sammis and Anna Hawxhurst, born in Oyster Bay on October 8, 1820. In 1837 Sammis went to work at the general store and lumber yard in Oyster Bay Cove operated by Colonel Samuel Youngs. Sammis stayed with Youngs for several years learning the business. In 1843 he opened his own store in Oyster Bay and in 1846 he bought land on South Street opposite the intersection with East Main Street, where he built his own store building. The Walling Map of Kings and Queens County from 1859 shows \\"J.M.S.\\" owning the building at the corner of South Street and West Main in Oyster Bay, just south of his store. On January 6, 1847, John M. Sammis was married to Rebecca Townsend, daughter of Isaac Townsend, by the Rev. Marmaduke Earle. Sammis‚Äô daughters would go on to marry influential figures in Oyster Bay. His daughter Sarah E. married Edward A. Hegeman who would late become responsible for managing Sammis‚Äô store. His daughter Mary A. married James H. Ludlam who was responsible for building the brick Greek Revival Ludlam Building at the south-west corner of South and West Main Street that housed a store of his own. Sammis would go on to make a fortune in the lumber and coal business. He was instrumental in founding of the First Presbyterian Church of Oyster Bay and through those activities became a close personal friend with Theodore Roosevelt. Sammis amassed substantial land holdings supporting his commercial interests. These included the wharf at the end of South Street and much of the property leading up to that especially along the west side of South Street. Sammis sold the \\"J.M.S. Store\\" to Jones and Young in 1868. After selling his store in 1868, Sammis purchased the lumber yard and coal business of James Prior at the foot of White Street. Meanwhile, Jones & Young hired Sammis‚Äô son Edgar to run the store. In 1872 an eighteen-year-old Edward A. Hegeman went to work in the store with his brother-in-law. A few years later Hegeman bought the business from Jones and Young around 1880 and the site became known as Hegeman‚Äôs Corner. Hegeman would also marry Sammis‚Äô daughter Sarah. By the start of the 20th century when John M. Sammis was in his 80s, his advanced age most likely caused him to sell properties he owned to his longtime tenants Arthur Snouder and his son Andrew Snouder. The former J.M. Sammis store was demolished in 1907. As a concession, plate glass windows from the store were removed and used as windows in Snouder's Drug Store a few buildings to the south. Very soon thereafter the North Shore Bank Building was built on this site of Sammis' store. The demolition of his former store and sale of other properties marked physically and symbolically the transfer of influence over this important area in the heart of the downtown and vis-√†-vis change of leadership in the business community in Oyster Bay. Sammis died on October 17, 1908 and services were held at the First Presbyterian Church of Oyster Bay.\\"J.M.

It is in Ernakulam district in the state of Kerala, India. The estimated population is 19,712.Source : Census data 2001 History In olden times, at Kanjoor, there used to be an office of the princely state of Kochi, probably for collection of taxes. This was referred to as Kachery in the local language and the present day town of Kanjoor came to be referred as 'Kacheryparamb'. There used to be a police station also in Kanjoor. Though it was referred to as police station, it was nothing but a police beat room for recording the observations made on their beats. Etymology It is said that the Kochi dynasty travelled from places like Vannery and Thiruvalwamala and such other places thereabout in search of safer locales to settle down fearing the onslaught of marauding army of Zamorins of Calicut. Accordingly, at some of time, Puthiyedam was considered to be a place for settling down. They aptly named it as 'puthiya idam' meaning the new place. The two kovilakams, which can extend its matrilineal roots to the royals of Kochi, that exist on either side of the temple, bears testimony to the fact that this place was indeed used as a settlement by the members of royal family. The presence of other kshatriya families around this place corroborates these facts. Administration Kanjoor is a panchayat in the Ernakulam District. It has as many as 15 wards. The panchayat can be divided into places like thuravunkara on the north-west, kozhikkadanpady-thattanpady in the west, puthiyedam on the south, parappuram on the east and arankaavu in the north-east. Geography River Periyar that separates neighboring panchayats from it helps to meet not only the water needs of the people but also provides employment. Kanjoor is nearly 5 km away from Kochi international airport Education The panchayat has four high schools and seven lower division schools. Among these, St. Sebastian's High School, Kanjoor is the renowned school which established in 1912. Economy Just as the case for most other Gram panchayats in Kerala, the main occupation of the people of this panchayat is agriculture and allied works. NRI population of the panchayat is not comparable with many other panchayats and is in fact, very low. Inter-religious ratios are much in alliance with the state ratio in this regard. Ezhavas and Nairs in that order remain the most prominent Hindu communities in this panchayat. Worship Centers The main religious centres in this village are Kanjoor Church and Puthiyedam Temple. Kanjoor Church: St. Mary's Forane Church Kanjoor, one of the historic Churches in India. The Saint Sebastian at kanjoor, The Kanjoor Punyavalan is the Living saint who removes all the diseases and epidemics.St. Sebastian is known for his quick reply to those who call on him in distress especially those who seek the assistance of the saint for deliverance from incurable diseases, epidemics, and shattering problems of life. A lot of incidents illustrating the power and the divine nature of the Saint of Kanjoor, still live on in the minds of the locals and devotees. The festival in the church comes on 19 and 20 January every year, and is celebrated by all in Kanjoor irrespective on religion or cast. The eighth day of the feast is celebrated on 26th and 27th January. Puthiyedam Temple: The main deity is standing posture of \\"parthasarathy\\" strangely holding butter in his right hand rather than a weapon. However, the temple is renowned for its bhagavathy temple. Legend has it that this bhagavathy was worshiped by one among the many maternal branches of the then-local kings of Kochi dynasty as their mother goddess, when they lived in this part of the village. Sakthan Thampuran, probably the only king worth his name in Kochi dynasty, was born in this place. Old timers say that the temple was constructed in this current shape during his time of rulership. This temple had the now defunct and detestable practice of 'aal thookkam'. 'All Thookkam', when translated to English would mean dangling of human beings, This was a religious practice in which the man either opted or identified by the community to do the performance would at first allow himself to bear the inscrutable pain of piercing his flesh on the back of his body with iron hooks and then dangle in the hooks. Thereafter the man thus dangling would then be taken for circumambulation in a specially made wooden structure. Kodungallor Kunjukkuttan thampuran has written few slokas on this deity. Festivals The annual festival of the temple is performed every summer during the Malayalam month menam in such a way that the 'aaraatu' will coincide on thiruvonam. Accordingly, chothi of meenam month shall be the kodiyett. To repopitiate the goddess guruthy is performed during the annual festival. During mandala kaalam daily 'kalam pooja' is performed. Apart from the above poomoodal also is being performed on the deity during mandala pooja days. The famous kanjoor church feast is celebrated on Jan 19th and 20th of every year.

In the 1980s, California developer Lester O'Shea spent $4 million trying to turn the hotel into an Edwardian-style tourist retreat, but that project eventually collapsed in bankruptcy proceedings. At the 2003 Goldfield Days auction, the hotel was sold to Edgar S. \\"Red\\" Roberts, a rancher and engineer from Carson City, for about $360,000. Roberts told The Wall Street Journal in 2004 that he had plans to refurbish the bottom two floors of the four-story hotel and open them to the public by 2006. He also told the newspaper: \\"It's a challenge. I may regret it.\\" As of 2010, work remained uncompleted. Goldfield resident Virginia Ridgway spent three decades as caretaker and \\"keeper of the keys\\" to the hotel, granting visitors access to the building and accompanying them as they toured its floors. In January 2016, Ridgway announced that she was giving up that role and turned the keys of the hotel over to Malek DaVarpanah, who owns an antique shop in Goldfield. In September 2017, the Pahrump (Nev.) Valley Times reported that renovation work on the Goldfield Hotel had resumed. In media The building was used in the film Vanishing Point (1971) as the site of Super Soul's radio station, KOW. It also featured in the film Cherry 2000 (1987) and the film Ghosts of Goldfield (2007). In 2004 the American television programme Ghost Adventures featured the property, where cast members Zak Bagans and Nick Groff conducted a paranormal investigation. The investigation became famous for a specific incident in the basement when a brick was seemingly flung across the room on its own, provoking a terrified response from Bagans. Four years later, in 2008, TAPS of the popular Syfy show Ghost Hunters investigated the hotel. A researcher for the Central Nevada Museum, however, notes that there are \\"inconsistencies\\" in the stories, and most apparently stem from a book written by a former owner of the property. The notoriety has not helped the hotel rehab and has led to frequent vandalism and unauthorised entry. In 2011, Ghost Adventures returned to the hotel to conduct a third investigation, during which the crew observed a significant amount of unexplained activity. In that episode, Bagans learned that owner Red Roberts was in talks with people who were interested in buying the hotel. In 2013, the Ghost Adventures crew returned once again for a fourth investigation where, like their previous investigations, a lot of unexplained activity was captured.

She and her husband Eric were two of the moving spirits of the Edinburgh chapter of the Symbolist movement in the early 20th century. Life Walton was born in Glasgow, the eldest of four children and daughter of the artists Helen and Edward Arthur Walton. In 1893, when Walton was two years old, her family moved to London, where from 1902 her neighbour was James Abbott McNeill Whistler. In 1904, the Waltons moved again to Edinburgh, and Walton was taught etching by John Duncan at his home, where she also met artists and writers, including Dorothy Johnstone and, in 1907, Eric Robertson. She also attended the Edinburgh College of Art where, in place of drawing, she took Percy Portsmouth's sculpture modelling class. While still a student, Walton was elected to the Society of Scottish Artists in 1908, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy from 1909 and the Royal Glasgow Institute from 1910, and she showed at the Royal Academy in London from 1913. Walton also studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris for two winters and spent some time in Florence. In 1911, Walton was commissioned by the publishers T.C. & E.C. Jack to illustrate their edition of Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales. Against her parents' advice, she married her fellow Edinburgh student, Eric Harald Macbeth Robertson (1887‚Äì1941) in 1914. Eric had abandoned architecture and turned to art. He was described as \\"one of the most brilliant art students of his period\\". They had two sons, the first, Gavril, born in February 1915 and the second, Edward, in December 1919. Eric, Cecile and the painter Dorothy Johnstone (1892‚Äì1980) had formed a close painting and physical liaison. In 1913, the three artists exhibited together at Edinburgh's New Gallery, and after the war they regrouped as the Edinburgh Group, now with Mary Newbery. However, Eric's excessive drinking led in 1923 to the collapse of the group and Cecile's moving in with Johnstone. In 1924, Walton had a joint exhibition with Johnstone in Edinburgh. However, her painting career foundered with their marriage, which ended in divorce in 1927. Walton 's painting faltered, but she did execute murals for the Children's Village in Humbie, Midlothian in the mid 1920s, and for Small's department store on Princes Street, Edinburgh, and she was also the art editor of Edinburgh University's Atlanta's Garland (1926) where she wrote on women's art in Scotland. She also turned to the theatre and worked for four seasons as a decor artist for Tyrone Guthrie at the Cambridge Festival Theatre. In 1936, Walton returned to Edinburgh and began working for BBC radio where she was in charge of the Scottish Children's Hour radio programming. Eric's career also collapsed after their separation, and he eventually succumbed to alcohol. Walton remarried in 1936 to producer Gordon Gildard, with whom she moved to Glasgow, however this was another short-lived marriage and she divorced in 1945. She spent the rest of her life in Kirkcudbright. She died in Edinburgh on 23 April 1956.Modern Scottish Women: Painters and Sculptors 1885‚Äì1965 Walton is best known for her ironic self-portrait Romance, in which she depicts herself as a latter-day Olympia, critically inspecting her newborn son Edward, while both are watched by his sibling Gavril.

Keach's Catechism (also known as the 1677 Baptist Catechism or 1693 Baptist Catechism) is a Reformed Baptist catechism consisting of a set of 118 basic questions and answers from scripture teaching readers the basics of the Reformed Baptist faith. The Catechism is similar to the earlier Heidelberg Catechism and Westminster Catechism except for the sections on baptism. It followed the 1677 Baptist Confession which was later ratified by over 100 baptist congregations in England and Wales as the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, which was signed by Hanserd Knollys, William Kiffin, Benjamin Keach, and others.. The Confession was written by English Particular Baptists, who held to a Calvinistic analysis to give a formal scriptural explanation of their Christian faith from a Baptist perspective. One of the preachers active in creating Confession of Faith, Benjamin Keach, is often credited with the writing of the Baptist Catechism commonly known as \\"Keach's Catechism\\", although it was likely compiled by William Collins, Keach's associate in drafting the Confession.

Born in Dunedin, Waite was a farmer at the outbreak of the First World War. He joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and served in the Gallipoli Campaign, during which he received the Distinguished Service Order. He was evacuated from Gallipoli due to sickness and repatriated to New Zealand, where he saw out the war as an instructor in NZEF training camps. He wrote a history of New Zealand's military efforts during the Gallipoli Campaign that was published in 1919. He returned to his farm and soon became involved in politics, joining the Reform Party. In 1925 he was elected Member of Parliament for the Clutha electorate, serving two terms. He was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1934. During the Second World War, Waite was overseas commissioner for the National Patriotic Fund Board and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services in this role. Two years later he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He died in 1952 at the age of 67. Early life Waite was born in Dunedin on 21 August 1885, one of eight children of George Waite, a storekeeper, and his wife. After leaving Mornington School, he worked for the regional newspaper, the Otago Daily Times, and for the Otago Witness. He was a typesetter when he married Ada Taylor in 1912 but the following year took up farming near Balclutha. He was interested in the military and was a member of an engineers unit in the Volunteer Force, which was later re-organised into the Territorial Force (TF). First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Waite volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) that was being raised for service overseas. He also undertook to send dispatches from the front for his previous employer, the Otago Witness, but this work proved short-lived when he became a censor as part of his military duties. He was posted as a lieutenant in the New Zealand Engineers and sailed with the main body of the NZEF to the Middle East in October 1914. Promoted to captain, Waite participated in the Gallipoli Campaign. In early May 1915, he restored order amongst personnel of the Otago Infantry Battalion following a failed attack on Turkish positions. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the citation reading: \\"For gallantry and devotion to duty in connection with the operations at the Dardanelles (Mediterranean Expeditionary Force). On the night of 2‚Äì3 May 1915 during the operations in the neighbourhood of Gape Tepe for gallantry and resource in rallying his men, and leading them forward at critical moments\\". Later in the campaign Waite served as the adjutant of the New Zealand Engineers and was twice mentioned in dispatches. Evacuated to England with dysentery, he was repatriated to New Zealand in 1916. His service with the NZEF ceased and he returned to the TF in his pre-war rank of major. He took up an appointment as Chief Engineer Instructor of the NZEF training camps. Shortly before the end of the war, Waite wrote a brief account of New Zealand's contributions to the Gallipoli Campaign. Authorities invited him to prepare a more substantial work and this resulted in The New Zealanders at Gallipoli, the first volume in a series of the Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War, published in 1919. Two years later it was republished as a revised edition. The figure of 8556 New Zealand soldiers who served at Gallipoli given by General Ian Hamilton in his forward to Waite‚Äôs demi-official 1919 history was always known to be too low; as Waite himself thought at the time. Between 16,000 (perhaps 17,000) served there, as shown in a 2019 study by New Zealand historians John Crawford and Matthew Buck. (see link to ebook below) Waite also worked on the production of the three other volumes in the series, which were published around the same time. Interwar period After the war, Waite returned to his Balclutha property which he converted to dairy farming. He remained a member of the TF for several years and was a major in the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment before being promoted to lieutenant colonel and becoming its commander from 1927 to 1930. For his prolonged service with the TF, he eventually received the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration. In 1935 he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Already involved in the dairying industry, he began to participate in the governance of the sector and set up the Co-Operative Dairy Company of Otago. He later joined the New Zealand Farmer's Union and was president of its Otago Branch. As well as his work in the dairying sector, Waite soon became involved in local politics and joined the Reform Party. He first stood for election to the House of Representatives in , when he defeated the incumbent in the electorate, John Edie of the Liberal Party, with ease. He was one of 13 new members in a House of 80 representatives. In the , he was challenged by Joseph Stephens, who was an independent candidate describing himself as Liberal‚ÄìLabour. Waite had a 523-vote margin, which represented 6.5% of the valid votes. In the , Waite was defeated by Peter McSkimming, who stood as an Independent, but had links to the United Party. Prime Minister George Forbes had not made appointments to the Legislative Council since 1930, with the exception of James Parr in 1931, and membership dwindled during the years of the Great Depression. By 1934, the membership had reduced to 19, the lowest since 1860, with two members about to retire. In 1934, 14 new members were appointed by Forbes, including Waite. All appointments became effective on 22 June 1934, and Waite, at age 49, was the second youngest of the intake; only Vincent Ward was younger. Waite was reappointed twice, and served until the abolition of the Upper House in 1950. When the National Party was formed in 1936 from the merger of Reform and the United Party, publicity was one of the major considerations. The party's provisional council established a sub- committee consisting of Henry Livingstone, Frederick Doidge, and Waite. This committee reported back in February 1937, recommending the establishment of a Dominion publicity committee, and a trustee company for the purpose of publishing a party newsletter. Party Publications Ltd was thus created, and Waite was the first editor of The National News. Initially, all financial members were to receive this monthly newsletter, aimed at being a counterpart to Labour's Standard. While The National News performed an important function during the party's formative years, the venture was expensive and following the , it was changed to a quarterly schedule, before being discontinued in September 1939 just after the outbreak of the war. The seven-member Dominion publicity committee, of which Waite was a member, engaged three advertising companies to jointly prepare for the 1938 election. Two of those companies, John Ilott and Charles Haines, remained joint agents for the National Party until 1973. Second World War Lieutenant Colonel Waite (far right) with Prime Minister Peter Fraser (in white suit), visiting the Infantry Training Depot at Maadi Camp in Egypt, May 1941 When the Second World War began, Waite was still a lieutenant colonel in the TF. He was appointed overseas commissioner for the National Patriotic Fund Board. Based in Egypt, he worked to provide the soldiers of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force with special supplies and treats. His services in this capacity were recognised in 1944 with his appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He finished the war a colonel, working in Europe on the repatriation of New Zealand personnel recently released from prisoner-of-war camps in Germany. In 1946, he travelled to Japan to inspect the infrastructure set up for J-Force, New Zealand's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, following which he retired from the military. In the 1946 King's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Later life In his retirement, Waite wrote papers on archeology and history including one on Egyptian pottery. While in Cairo during the Second World War, he collected several historical antiquities on behalf of the Otago Museum. In 1951 Waite was granted the right to retain the title of \\"Honourable\\", having served more than 10 years as a member of the Legislative Council. In his later years, his health was poor and he died in Balclutha in 1952 at the age of 67. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.

It stars Mohanlal, Shobana, Revathi, Thilakan, Sukumari, Kaviyoor Ponnamma and Shanthi Krishna in pivotal roles. The songs featured in the film were composed by Reghu Kumar, while Johnson provided the background score. The film was produced by R. Mohan under the banner GoodKnight Films. Plot Nanda who is an engineering graduate lives with her friend Vimala in Bangalore. After a public event, Nanda receives some photographs of her from the event, dropped at her doorstep by an unknown person. Initially, she ignores the matter, but is soon annoyed as she gets another set of pictures of her walking the streets and being in a restaurant, proving that someone has been stalking her. Her investigations into the stalker fails. One night, she shares a taxi with a Malayali stranger, who initially lies about him being a poorly educated villager trying for a job in Bangalore, and later admits of being the stalker. He introduces himself as Raghupathi, a commercial advertising photographer, who got interested in Nanda's features in an artistic perspective. Later, Nanda decides to get the film negatives from him, and visits the ad agency he mentioned, only to find that he had lied; the real Raghupathi is also a Malayali, but not the stalker. Soon she receives a phone call from the stalker, who apologizes and give a new introduction as Mohan Tharakan, owner of a leading architecture firm. Nanda sets up an appointment to meet him, again to find that it was yet another lie; the real Mohan Tharakan, another Malayali, shows irritation on Nanda's cluelessness. Nevertheless, she gets the film negatives from another stranger, who directs her to a restaurant, which he says is owned by the stalker. Nanda and Vimala go to the restaurant to find that the owner is yet another person. Nanda breaks down in the trauma of being stalked and pranked around multiple times. Seeing her upset, the restaurant's Malayali owner accepts his involvement in the prank, and directs her to the real location of the stalker. Eventually, at an exclusive party, Nanda finds the stalker, who is revealed as Narendran, an MIT graduate and lead architect in Mohan Tharakan's company. As Narendran starts to show off being smug and trying to be cute, Nanda slaps him in front of the crowd and walks out. Throughout the sequence, a blossoming love affair is being built into Nanda's vulnerable responses to events and Narendran's male confidence. The movie then runs then runs through usual song- and-dance sequences on Narendran-Nanda falling in love, them running and biking around Bangalore, and eventually getting engaged, etc. The story takes a turn when Narendran falls from a building and meets his death. A depressed Nanda escorts Narendran's body to his village in Kerala. To her surprise, in Narendran's house she finds someone looking exactly like Narendran, who we learn as his identical twin, Krishnan Unni. Initially, Nanda even thinks that Narendran is not dead and the death incident was yet another prank. We learn that Unni is secretly in love with Bhadra, an orphan girl who lives in his house as a servant. Since they knew that their relationship would never be approved by Unni's family they were hoping that Narendran would interfere and smooth things between them and family in order to get married. Nanda and Bhadra become friends. Things go topsy turvy as Unni's mother and uncle decide to move a marriage proposal to get Unni and Nanda together. Even though shocked at first, Nanda gradually begins to feel positive about this. In the meantime, Unni's and Bhadra's relationship is revealed and everyone except Nanda who is ignorant of this blames Bhadra for wishing for someone who is completely out of her league. They fire Bhadra and ask her to leave. Heart broken, Bhadra attempts to commit suicide by making the serpent bite her in the Sarpa Kavu. Unni's uncle refuses to treat Bhadra, hoping that she would die and clear the way for Unni's and Nanda's marriage. Seeing this Unni furiously grabs Nanda and drags her to Narendran's room where his photographs are hung. Unni asks if Nanda could easily forget Narendran and replace him with Unni just because they look alike. She is speechless and having realized her mistake begs Unni's family to treat Bhadra. They give her some medicines and wait for Bhadra to open her eyes, not sure whether she'll survive or not. While everyone is waiting for Bhadra to wake up, Nanda is seen begging Narendran that if God wants someone's life let Him take hers and not Bhadra's. After a long time Bhadra opens her eyes. Everyone is happy and they go to see Nanda in Narendran's room only to find her dead. Narendran's ghost is seen, who intends to take Nanda with him, clear to an astonished Unni. It is assumed that finally Unni and Bhadra get together with their family's approval.

The most common labeling convention, the NPK or N-P-K label, shows the amounts of the chemical elements nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Common labeling conventions The NPK analysis label Fertilizers are usually labeled with three numbers, as in 18-20-10, indicating the relative content of the macronutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), respectively. More precisely, the first number (\\"N value\\") is the percentage of elemental nitrogen by weight in the fertilizer; that is, the mass fraction of nitrogen times 100. The second number (\\"P value\\") is the percentage by weight of phosphorus pentoxide in a fertilizer with the same amount of phosphorus that gets all of its phosphorus from P2O5. The third number (\\"K value\\") is analogous, based on the equivalent content of potassium oxide . 22 October 2014 For example, a 15-13-20 fertilizer would contain 15% by weight of nitrogen, and the same amounts of phosphorus and potassium as a mixture of 13% by weight of , 20% , and 67% of some inert ingredient. Other labeling conventions In the U.K., fertilizer labeling regulations allow for reporting the elemental mass fractions of phosphorus and potassium. The regulations stipulate that this should be done in parentheses after the standard N-P-K values, as in \\"15-30-15 (15-13-13)\\".UK Fertilizers Regulations 1990, Schedule 2 Part 1, Para. 7. In Australia, macronutrient fertilizers are labeled with an \\"N-P-K-S\\" system, which uses elemental mass fractions rather than the standard N-P-K values and includes the amount of sulfur (S) contained in the fertilizer. Converting nutrient analysis to composition The values in an NPK fertilizer label are related to the concentrations (by weight) of phosphorus and potassium elements as follows: * consists of 56.4% elemental oxygen and 43.6% elemental phosphorus by weight. Therefore, the elemental phosphorus percentage of a fertilizer is 0.436 times its P value. * consists of 17% oxygen and 83% elemental potassium by weight. Therefore, the elemental potassium percentage is 0.83 times the K value. The N value in NPK labels represents actual percentage of nitrogen element by weight, so it does not need to be converted. So, for example, an 18‚àí51‚àí20 fertilizer contains by weight *18% elemental nitrogen, *0.436 √ó 51 = 22% elemental phosphorus, and *0.83 √ó 20 = 17% elemental potassium. As another example, the fertilizer sylvite is a naturally occurring mineral consisting mostly of potassium chloride, KCl. Pure potassium chloride contains one potassium atom (whose atomic mass is 39.09 g/mol) for every chlorine atom (whose atomic mass is 35.45 g/mol). Therefore, pure KCl is 39.09/(39.09 + 35.45) = 52% potassium and 48% chlorine by weight. Its K value is therefore 52/0.83 = 63; that is, a fertilizer that gets all its potassium from and has the same potassium contents as pure KCl would have to be 63% . Pure KCl fertilizer would thus be labeled 0-0-63. Since sylvite contains other compounds that contribute no N, P, or K, it is usually labeled 0-0-60.

Crip shoots the town marshal Isaac Webb (Ward Ramsey) and takes ten men as hostages, killing some to ensure the four are unmolested. The gang leaves town with $11,200 from the Bank of Paradise and a female hostage Helen Caldwell (Zohra Lampert) who entered the bar because her alcoholic Uncle Billy (Royal Dano) was one of the captives. Prior to these events, Marshal Webb had sent for a friend and former gunfighter Banner Cole (Audie Murphy) to be his deputy. He takes Webb's place in leading a posse to rescue Helen and bring the men to justice. Cole is a loner with a big reputation as a gunman. He rides into a town marked by the gang's rampage, and is enraged to discover that the townspeople have put Webb on a table next to the three dead bodies of those murdered by the four. The doctor (Forrest Lewis) said at first they thought Webb was dead himself, then realized he couldn't be moved. Webb's last act is to deputize Cole, telling him to do the right thing, not out of hate, but out of liking people, as the townsfolk are good people who have been badly hurt. Cole agrees only out of liking Webb. He makes his original plan for hunting down the four by himself clear by turning down the offer of Webb's handcuffs by saying \\"I won't be needing any.\\" However, town elder Benson convinces Cole to follow Webb's wishes and organize a posse. The men of the town gather but enthusiasm wanes when not as many able bodied men as expected volunteer to go up against the killers, some men leaving because the posse doesn't outnumber the killers by ten to one. Cole's frank assessment of the situation scares others off with Cole saying \\"If they're afraid of words they shouldn't go.\\" Cole's posse eventually consists of the aged former Army Captain Jeremiah Brown (Robert Keith), who wishes to lead the posse himself in the manner of his long ago Army days; Uncle Billy; Burt Hogan (Frank Overton), who wishes to revenge his brother Burl (Allan Lane) murdered by the four; Jock Wiley (Paul Carr), a young gunhand with no experience, seeking to establish his reputation; Seymour Kern (John Saxon), a bank employee who has just arrived on a special assignment from the New York parent office and is browbeaten into joining, both to look after the bank's missing money and avoid taunts of cowardice from the bank manager (Ray Teal); and Johnny Caddo (Rudolph Acosta), an Indian who merely thinks that joining is \\"the right thing for a man to do.\\" Cole doesn't want any of the inexperienced men to come with him but he has no choice. The posse discover Helen who has been left behind tied up near a rattlesnake that Cole is able to remove from Helen's vicinity. Helen has been raped and is unwilling to return to the town to face the shame of being vilified by the population. Cole orders the willing Uncle Billy to return her by force if necessary. Captain Brown demonstrates his aged incompetence by disobeying Cole's orders and opening fire and nearly murdering four cowhands who he mistakes for the four killers. Cole has to wound Jeremiah to stop his shooting spree and orders him back to town with the cowhands who have been waylaid by the killers. Cole's distrust of his own posse begins to subside when he is impressed by the determination of the inexperienced Seymour who has never ridden a horse or used a firearm before and the quiet Johnny Caddo's acceptance of the prejudicial treatment he gets from the posse. The posse tracks the four to a farmhouse and surrounds it until Hogan makes a noise starting a gunfight. Cole kills one of the outlaws. The boasting Wiley is unable to actually kill a man and is killed as he freezes, allowing the remaining three to escape. Hogan begins shooting the corpse of the outlaw that Cole himself killed telling himself and the posse that Hogan himself killed the man who killed his own brother. When the men note that all the witnesses agree that it was actually Hash who had murdered his brother, Hogan refuses to listen and leaves the posse to return to town. Cole, Caddo, and Seymour continue tracking the party to the desert but realise that the outlaws have doubled back and are intending on returning to shoot up Paradise. The outlaws attempt an ambush and Cole kills Leo. A second ambush results in the death of Caddo, causing Cole to remark what a good man he was. Eventually Cole and Seymour track the remaining 2 outlaws to a farmhouse near Paradise. The farmhouse is the home of Helen Caldwell and Uncle Billy. Crip kills Uncle Billy, and Seymour wings Hash, whilst Helen finishes him off with a six gun, then in distress rides the buck board away towards town. In the confrontation Seymour is badly injured and his horse killed. Cole goes after Crip and in the ensuing gunfight, Cole is injured and Crip is killed. With no horses left, the injured Cole carries the badly injured Seymour over his shoulder and walks into town. When the townsfolk try and help he remarks with disdain. \\"Touch this man and I'll kill ya\\". Both men survive and are patched up. Some of the townsfolk tell Cole his services are no longer required as he is less of a peacemaker and more of a gunman. But others defend Cole and say that the townfolk don't want Cole as they are ashamed at not acting themselves. Cole remembers the echo of Marshall Webbs words that some people are good and to put down roots, and decides to stay on as sheriff. He and Helen look as if they may well start a family together.

Coleman later directed Audie Murphy in an episode of his Whispering Smith TV series and the feature Battle at Bloody Beach. Coleman filmed at Lone Pine, California with one location being the aptly named Rattlesnake Hill where thirty rattlesnakes were removed before filming could commence.http://www.lonepinefilmhistorymuseum.org/featurestory1002.asp Coleman surrounded Murphy with a variety of up and coming young stars as well as experienced professionals. Zohra Lampert was a New York method actress whose adlibbing frequently confused Murphy, but the two worked out their scenes together.p.168 Herzberg, Bob Shooting Scripts: From Pulp Western to Film 2005 McFarland It was one of several Westerns John Saxon appeared in during the 1960s. Huffaker's screenplay deviated from his novel by having Murphy's character as an outsider gunfighter rather than the Marshal's established deputy. His script emphasises the similarity between Cole's voluntary exclusion from society with Helen's sudden involuntary exclusion with her rape. Helen attempts suicide then later talks about becoming a prostitute. She is talked out of both by Cole with the two eventually finding a place in society together. Huffaker stated that when writing a screenplay for the Medal of Honor awardee Audie Murphy, he had to put Murphy's character in \\"a situation where he has to do something bigger than life. So it really kind of fit him in a way\\".p.167 Ibid Through his viewing the actions of Caddo, Kern and Helen more than make up for the negative traits in the townspeople, Cole ends the film saying \\"There is always someone or something worthwhile. We just have to look hard enough\\".p.32 Loy, R.

She was the first head of the Criminal Cases Review Commission from 2004 to 2009. and head of the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) from 2009 to 2012, a position from which she resigned following a heavily politicized scandal. Career Born in Oslo, Janne Kristiansen graduated cand. jur. from the University of Oslo in 1979 and worked for a number of years as a high-profiled defence attorney. She was the head of Forsvarergruppen av 1977 (a group of defence lawyers working to promote the principles of the Rechtsstaat and rule of law) between 1985 and 1990. Kristiansen worked as a public defender in Borgarting Court of Appeal from 1986 and in Moss District Court from 1990. Janne Kristiansen has participated in the making of several Norwegian Official Reports, such as NOU 2003.18 on national security and NOU 2003.21 on \\"Crime fighting and privacy - the police and public prosecutors' processing of information\\". As head of the Criminal Cases Review Commission between 2004 and 2009 she oversaw the decisions on the applications to appeal the criminal trials of Fredrik Fasting Torgersen and Arne Treholt. Janne Kristiansen presenting the PST's annual threat assessment for Norwegian society for 2010 She was appointed to the position as director of the Norwegian Police Security Service on 25 September 2009. There were three other applicants, and Minister of Justice Knut Storberget had specifically asked her to apply. In the period between her appointment and her accession in November, Roger Berg was acting director. As head of the PST Kristiansen was juxtaposed with the director of the National Police Directorate as one of the two top leaders of the Norwegian Police Service. During her time as head of the PST she oversaw the arrests of three men with residencies in Norway suspected of planning a terror attack on the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. In addition the terror attacks on the government quarters and Ut√∏ya on 22 July 2011 happened during her PST leadership. She resigned as director on 18 January 2012, after accidentally revealing Norwegian intelligence assets in Pakistan, with her deputy Roger Berg succeeding her as acting leader. Forced resignation as head of PST Janne Kristiansen resigned as PST leader on 18 January 2012 following an open hearing of the parliament's 22 July Committee (not to be confused with the 22 July Commission) that same day where she had been summoned to answer questions about Norwegian security and intelligence work. This unfolded after she had answered a direct question from Member of Parliament Akhtar Chaudhry (Socialist Left Party) during the parliament's (Storting) questioning of her. The question was whether Norway has cooperation with Pakistan in the intelligence arena, and Kristiansen's reply was interpreted as a confirmation that the Norwegian Intelligence Service (military intelligence) had in fact a presence in that country. Both the two major news agencies in Norway, however, have written that representatives from the Norwegian Armed Forces have confirmed the presence of the Intelligence Service abroad on a number of previous occasions. This would make it uncertain whether confidential information was revealed during the hearing. In March 2012 police investigations of Kristiansen were dropped by the Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs.

However, in October 2003 it was reported that the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry with responsibility for Competition, Gerry Sutcliffe had declined to consent to the transfer of ownership of Northcliffe because of the strength of Northcliffe's titles in the Bristol and Bath area.

He made two appearances for Wales, one as an emergency goalkeeper. Playing career Roberts was born at Wrexham and, on leaving school, found employment at Bersham colliery, and played football for the local Rhostyllen village side. Described as a \\"hard- working player and a sound defender\\", Roberts was one of the first signings made by Wrexham Olympic after that club's formation. He took part in a North v South trial match in 1886 which led to his selection for the match against Ireland on 27 February, helping his country to a 5‚Äì0 victory. Despite this result, Alfred Davies was preferred for the matches against England and Scotland. Roberts' second international appearance came the following February when he was called in as an emergency goalkeeper in the absence of Robert Mills-Roberts, who had temporarily \\"retired\\" from football following injuries to both wrists shortly before the preceding international against England, in which he conceded four goals. Roberts also conceded four goals against the Irish and his international career was over, with Davies being recalled at right-back for the next international. James Trainer subsequently took over as the Wales national team goalkeeper, a position he retained for the next twelve years. In 1888, Wrexham Olympic was disbanded and Roberts joined Wrexham. With his ability to \\"kick and head the ball well\\", Roberts became the Wrexham captain, a position he retained until his retirement from football in 1892. In 1891, he captained his team to the final of the Welsh Cup, losing 5‚Äì2 to Shrewsbury Town.

He arrived in San Diego in 1833, where he worked for Captain Henry D. Fitch and became a Mexican citizen. In 1840, Alexander embarked on a scouting expedition for a suitable tract of land for a cattle ranch for Fitch and came to the Russian River Valley.

The press undertakes to provide undergraduate and post-graduate students with hands-on experience of textual transmission under the guidance of an academic supervisor. The scholarly volumes published by the press are works from the genre of literary juvenilia‚Äîthe early works of known writers‚Äîand are printed in a format that includes a preface, introduction, note on the text, end notes, textual and contextual appendices, and illustrations.  History  Juvenilia Press was founded in 1994 by Professor Emerita Juliet McMaster, a distinguished 19th Century literary scholar, at the University of Alberta. Starting as a classroom enterprise, Juliet McMaster and her students produced a saddle-stitched pamphlet edition of Jane Austen's Jack and Alice, a story Austen wrote at about age thirteen. From this simple start an offer to edit a previously unpublished early writing of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu transformed the classroom exercise into a working press. In 2001, the Juvenilia Press moved to UNSW where it has remained under the general-editorship of Scientia Professor Christine Alexander who was on the Juvenilia Press Board from its inception.  Current General Editor  Christine Alexander is an eminent nineteenth-century scholar, with expertise in Romanticism and Victorian literature, textual transmission and critical editing, juvenilia, the Bront√´ family and Jane Austen. Christine Alexander's discovery and critical editing of over 100 unpublished manuscripts and a similar number of visual art works pioneered research in two major areas of Bront√´ studies. Her groundbreaking study of The Early Writings of Charlotte Bront√´ (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1984) won the prestigious British Academy Rose Mary Crawshay Prize; her major 3-volume scholarly Edition of the Early Writings of Charlotte Bront√´ (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987, 1991) opened new horizons in Bront√´ Studies; her co- authored The Art of the Bront√´s (CUP, 1995) was the first visual arts book in the field; and she has co-authored the definitive reference work on the Bront√´s and their cultural context: The Oxford Companion to the Bront√´s (OUP, 2001; pb 2006; anniversary edition 2018. Christine Alexander was an ARC Senior Research Fellow from 1993 to 1998, was awarded a Commonwealth of Australia Centenary Medal for Service to Australian Society and the Humanities in the Study of English Literature in 2003 and was appointed a Scientia Professor of The University of New South Wales in 2007. She is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and a Fellow of the Royal Society of NSW. She is currently joint general editor of the Cambridge Edition of the Novels and Poems of Charlotte, Emily Bront√´.  Pedagogy and the Publication Process Pedagogy is at the heart of the Juvenilia Press. Each volume edited by established scholars and their student/s includes an introduction on an authors creative background and their early writings in relation to their adult works. A note on the text discusses the nature of the original handwritten manuscript and the technical irregularities of young authorship, including errors in spelling and punctuation. As part of the process, students give consideration to textual criticism and actively observe the impact of the practical application of their editing approach to the manuscripts they are working with. Since the students must collective agree on their editorial policy, the often-heated debate that occurs as a result of these considerations forms an integral part of this pedagogical exercise. Other inclusions within a volume are the textual and contextual annotations. Textual annotations form part of the apparatus of the editorial policy and serve to allow the reader to map the changes made to the original copy-text. Contextual annotations are crucial to the research exercise and students are encouraged to err on the side of generosity; in particular they allow us to observe social, cultural and political influences on the young author. Thus, valuable documentary evidence including books and magazines the young author may have read, an awareness of political and social change, aesthetic and personal experience and other historical and geographical detail emerges. Finally, the volumes include illustrations, both photographic and originals, that provide an opportunity for student artist and designers to contribute to the volumes; and several publications of unpublished manuscripts have allowed students in the fields of media and the performing arts (drama, dance and music) to showcase their talents in premier performances.  Recent Editions  The most recent edition of juvenilia published by the Juvenilia Press is The History of England & Cassandra's Portraits by Jane Austen. The History of England is an outrageous parody of the schoolroom history book written \\"By a partial, prejudiced, & ignorant Historian\\". Together with her elder sister Cassandra, the fifteen-year-old Jane Austen reduces the heroic to the everyday, vigorously endorses Mary, Queen of Scots, and denounces Elizabeth I. This edition explores the collaboration between the sisters and the way Cassandra's illustrations extend the textual allusions to family and friends, revealing some surprises.

Tan, is a Chinese Indonesian sociologist. Tan obtained her bachelor's degree from the University of Indonesia, later receiving a scholarship to study at Cornell University. After finishing her doctorate at University of California, Berkeley, Tan returned to Indonesia and wrote extensively on economics and Chinese Indonesians. She is Roman Catholic. Biography Tan was born on 11 June 1930 in Jakarta, Indonesia, to a \\"probably fifth generation\\" Chinese father and second generation mother; she was the third of five siblings. As a child and teenager, she studied foreign languages, including Dutch, English, French, and German, speaking Dutch with her father and Indonesian with her mother. Tan studied for her bachelor's degree at the Department of Sinology at the University of Indonesia. In her third year, she entered a scientific writing competition that was organized by the Catholic Scientific Circle, winning the competition with her sociological field study. Tan later wrote that that was one of the factors that interested in studying sociology formally; the contemporary focus on Chinese literature bored her. When G. William Skinner arrived in Jakarta to study Chinese Indonesians, Tan was chosen as one of his three apprentices. Using the opportunity to study fieldwork and research methodology, Tan spent 18 months in the position. Based on her work with him, Skinner chose Tan to receive the Cornell Southeast Asia Training Fellowship. Tan later graduated from the University of Indonesia in 1959. In January 1959, Tan arrived in Ithaca, New York, to begin her studies at Cornell University. Despite slight culture shock, Tan enjoyed her studies. She received her Master of Arts in sociology in 1961, with her thesis based on her studies with Skinner. The thesis was later published in 1963 as The Chinese of Sukabumi: A Study in Social and Cultural Accommodation. After graduation, Tan returned to Jakarta to teach sociology at the Catholic University of Jakarta, later becoming a researcher with the Center for Economic and Social Research of the Indonesian Council of Sciences (ICS, later renamed Indonesian Institute of Sciences) in 1963. The ICS sent her to further her studies at the University of California, Berkeley, in August 1963. During her studies at Berkeley, Tan participated in sit-ins as part of the Free Speech Movement, only stopping when warned that she could be deported if arrested. Tan took her oral examination with Wolfram Eberhard, Herbert Blumer, Robert Blauner, Neil Smelser, and Daniel Lev as her examiners. After passing, Tan began work on her dissertation. Tan wrote her dissertation under the guidance of Eberhard, Blauner, and Lev, with approval given on 13 June 1968. Tan became the first Indonesian to receive a PhD in sociology from Berkeley as well as the first female Indonesian with a doctorate in sociology. The dissertation, Social Mobility and Assimilation: The Chinese in the United States, was later published in Taiwan in 1971. In August 1968, Tan returned to Indonesia. Within a few months, she had become head of a subdivision at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. In the early 1970s, she became involved in discussions for the economic development of Indonesia. In an article in Tempo, Tan argued for development to use local materials, manufacturers, and equipment. Afterwards, Tan later took numerous jobs as a lecturer. From 1968 to 1997, Tan taught women‚Äôs studies at the University of Indonesia. During the same period, she taught at the Jakarta Police Academy. From 1997 ‚Äì 2001, Tan became the head of the research department at the Catholic University of Jakarta. She currently works as a lecturer on Police Practices at the University of Indonesia. Recognition Tan has received six honorary medals from the government of Indonesia. Atma Jaya University opened the Mely G. Tan reading room in her honour in 2008.

Thanks to censorship by Christian imperial authorities, no known copies of this book exist, only references to it in books attacking it. The book During his retirement in Sicily, Porphyry wrote Against the Christians (ŒöŒ±œÑ·Ω∞ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩ·ø∂ŒΩ; Adversus Christianos) which consisted of fifteen books. Some thirty Christian apologists, such as Methodius, Eusebius, Apollinaris, Augustine, Jerome, etc., responded to his challenge. In fact, everything known about Porphyry's arguments is found in these refutations, largely because Theodosius II ordered every copy burned in A.D. 435 and again in 448. Porphyry became one of the most able pagan adversaries of Christianity of his day. His aim was not to disprove the substance of Christianity's teachings but rather the records within which the teachings are communicated. According to Jerome, Porphyry especially attacked the prophecy of Daniel because Jews and Christians pointed to the historical fulfillment of its prophecies as a decisive argument. But these prophecies, he maintained, were written not by Daniel but by some Jew who in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes (d. 164 BC) gathered up the traditions of Daniel's life and wrote a history of recent past events but in the future tense, falsely dating them back to Daniel's time. :Daniel was right. Finally what he had told up to Antiochus contained true history; if anything was guessed beyond that point it was false, for he had not known the future. (quoted by Jerome) The first part of Daniel, with the exception of the dream in Daniel 2, is historic, not prophetic. Porphyry, attacking only the prophetic portion, declares it to be merely a late anonymous narrative of past events, purporting to have been predicted long before by Daniel. Thus Porphyry's scheme was based on the supposed spuriousness of Daniel's prophecies. Porphyry devised his own interpretation where the third ‚Äúprophetic kingdom‚Äù was Alexander, and assigned the Macedonian Ptolemies and Seleucids to the fourth kingdom. From among these he chose ten kings, making the eleventh to be Antiochus Epiphanes. In this way he threw his main strength against the book of Daniel, recognizing that if this pillar of faith be shaken, the whole structure of prophecy must tremble. If the writer was not Daniel, then he lied on a frightful scale, ascribing to God prophecies which were never uttered, and making claim of miracles that were never wrought. And if Daniel's authorship could be shown to be false, then Christ Himself would be proved to bear witness to an imposter. (Matt. 24: 15.) Porphyry's thesis was adopted by Edward Gibbon, the English deist Anthony Collins, and most Modernist scholars. Augustine and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian Socrates of Constantinople, assert that Porphyry was once a Christian.

He achieved fifteen victories in aerial combat, four of them in a single action on 12 June 1918. A grazier between the wars, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1940 and was killed in a plane crash the following year. Born in New South Wales but raised in Western Australia, Phillipps joined the Australian Imperial Force as an infantryman in April 1915, seeing action at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Wounded twice in 1916, he transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) and was accepted for pilot training in May 1917. As a member of No. 2 Squadron in France, Phillipps flew mainly S.E.5 fighters, and was awarded two Military Crosses and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions. He finished the war a major, commanding No. 6 (Training) Squadron in England. Returning to Australia in 1919, he left the AFC and was managing a rural property when he enlisted in the RAAF soon after the outbreak of World War II. At his death he was ranked squadron leader, commanding No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School at Archerfield, Queensland.

After his father died, Phillipps' mother took him to live in Perth, Western Australia. Educated at Hale School, he studied to be an accountant and was practising on a pastoral property in the Kimberley when war broke out in 1914. World War I 28th Battalion alt=Man in military uniform and pith helmet sitting on a camel in front of the Sphinx and Pyramid Phillipps enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in April 1915 and was assigned to the 28th Battalion, an infantry unit raised the same month at Blackboy Camp, Western Australia. He successfully applied for a commission and left for Egypt aboard HMAT Ascanius on 9 June as a second lieutenant. After training in Egypt, he departed with his unit for Gallipoli aboard the transport Ivernia on 4 September. He was promoted to lieutenant on 25 October.Australian Military Forces, Phillipps, Roy Cecil, p. 10 The 28th Battalion, which had been sent to Gallipoli late in the campaign as reinforcements, was not heavily engaged on the peninsula, and suffered relatively few casualties before the withdrawal in December 1915.Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, pp. 99‚Äì100 In March 1916, Phillipps was deployed to France with the 28th Battalion for service on the Western Front. He participated in a raid against the forts of Armenti√®res on the night of 6/7 June, and saw action during the Battle of Pozi√®res in July. On 5 August, he was shot through the thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to captain on 12 August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to the thigh the following month, near Gueudecourt. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2 March 1917.Australian Military Forces, Phillipps, Roy Cecil, pp. 10‚Äì13 Australian Flying Corps Unable to take any further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would normally have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as adjutant of No. 2 Squadron.Franks, SE5/5a Aces of World War 1, pp. 42‚Äì43 After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty- five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 177‚Äì178, 181‚Äì182 The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 30 Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his wings, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to No. 32 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Ypres, but he escaped injury; by the time he completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols. Phillipps married Ellen Robinson, daughter of Western Australia's Attorney-General, at St Mary Abbots in Kensington, London, on 8 September 1917. Rejoining No. 2 Squadron within the month as a flight commander, he was initially engaged mainly in low-level strafing and bombing missions in DH.5s as his unit, attached to the British Third Army, took part in the Battle of Passchendaele. During the subsequent Battle of Cambrai, on 22 November he recorded his first aerial victory when he turned the tables on a German fighter that had attacked him from above, forcing it to land.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 183‚Äì184, 190 He was recommended for the Military Cross on 3 December, the award being promulgated in The London Gazette on 4 February 1918, and the full citation appearing on 5 July: alt=Three-quarter view of military biplane on landing ground No. 2 Squadron converted to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s in January 1918.

Later that month, Phillipps rotated back to England in accordance with Royal Air Force policy, which required pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 282 In October, he was promoted to major and posted to command No. 6 (Training) Squadron at Minchinhampton; the unit was primarily responsible for training new pilots for service with No. 2 Squadron.

US Attorney for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz has labeled the group and its claims \\"incredibly racist and unfair.\\"  History APT was founded by Charles Jacobs, Boston College political science professor Dennis Hale, and Egyptian exile and Muslim dissident Ahmed Subhy Mansour. Jacobs was previously the co-founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group in 1993, and the David Project in 2004. In October 2013, APT took out newspaper ads in the Boston Globe, Boston Herald, Newton TAB, Boston Metro, and Jewish Advocate, noting the presence of anti-Israeli materials being incorporated into the Newton Public Schools curriculum. The school system's use of the ‚ÄòArab World Studies Notebook‚Äô was sharply criticized, including claims that Muslims had discovered America in 889. The source had been criticized earlier by the American Jewish Committee for its proselytizing approach to Islam, and by Native American groups for other claims, including that Muslims become chiefs of Algonquin tribes in the 17th century. In 2016, the APT released a documentary on the BDS movement called Hate Spaces: The Politics of Intolerance on Campus. The film tracks the history of Students for Justice in Palestine and its ties to Middle Eastern donors. It includes scenes of antisemitism under the pretence of anti-Zionism on campuses like Northeastern University. It suggests that university professors take funding from anti-Zionist donors out of cynicism rather than ideology, which influences their perspective on Israel in class. Opposition to Islamic Society of Boston APT has been a major critic of the Islamic Society of Boston, and of the construction in 2009, in the city's Roxbury neighborhood, of the $15.6 million Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, which includes a mosque. APT asserts that the group is directed and controlled by extremist leaders and contributors. The Islamic Society of Boston rejected the charges. In 2007 Islamic Society of Boston had dropped a defamation lawsuit filed against the David Project and other groups, over revelations that the city of Boston had sold land to the mosque at far below market value. The mosque's fundraiser, who oversaw the land sale, was Mohammad Ali-Salaam, Deputy Directory of the Boston Redevelopment Authority. In a 2009 op-ed, the APT's Hale and Jacobs wrote that the new Islamic Center was \\"paid for largely by the Saudis, and run by what federal authorities describe as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood.\\" They added that \\"it is way past time for sensible citizens to demand answers to questions about the leaders of the new Islamic Center in Roxbury.\\" Mosque leader Yusuf Vali replied that the vast majority of construction donors were U.S. based, and added that \\"no donations were accepted if the donor wanted to have any decision-making influence (even if benign).\\" Boston mayor Thomas Menino defended the Islamic Center, as did William A. Graham, dean of Harvard Divinity School, who said fear of the Islamic Center of Boston was \\"highly exaggerated.\\" The mosque opened despite APT's protests.\\"Controversial mosque opens despite protest\\", The Jewish Advocate', July 3, 2009, accessed February 2, 2010] Following the April, 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon, Jacobs renewed his argument that the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center and its affiliated mosques in Cambridge and Roxbury are tied to extremists. Boston Marathon bombing suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev both worshipped at the Cambridge mosque. In a USA Today article, Jacobs stated, \\"...[T]his mosque has a curriculum that radicalizes people. Other people have been radicalized there.\\"  Anti-Muslim criticism  APT has been heavily criticized for anti-Muslim biases and activities since its inception. In 2011, a group of seventy Rabbinical community leaders together published a letter in The Jewish Advocate calling upon the group's President, Charles Jacobs, ‚Äúto discontinue his destructive campaign against Boston's Muslim community, which is based on innuendo, half-truths and unproven conspiracy theories.‚Äù The Jewish religious leaders also called ‚Äúupon members of our community to reject the dangerous politics of division that Mr. Jacobs fosters.‚Äù In a 2015 article in the New York Times, US Attorney Carmen Ortiz labeled APT's claims about the Muslim community \\"incredibly racist and unfair.\\" The group's tax returns reveal that it is funded by some of the most notorious anti-Muslim hate groups in the United States, such as the Middle East Forum, which has been labeled \\"part of the inner core of the U.S. Islamophobia network.\\" Individual members of the organization have similarly been criticized for professing bigoted perspectives toward Muslims. Charles Jacobs was a main figure in the CBS article \\"The Great Islamophobic Crusade,\\" while Ahmed Subhy Mansour is infamous within the Muslim community for having supported former Congressman Tom Tancredo's proposal for bombing Mecca. The US State Department has called Tancredo's statement \\"insulting and offensive.\\" Outside of his academic career, Dennis Hale has published numerous articles in blogs and online opinion sites arguing that Muslims only feign indignation to insults against the Prophet Muhammed and their religion in order ‚Äúto induce, in infidels, a habit of deference to Islam, the more public the deference the better‚Äù and claiming that ‚ÄúPalestinian Arabs only pretend that they want to be a people with their own nation.

Moore's young wife had been stricken and worried that she would lose her looks. He wrote the words to reassure her. Origins of the melody The tune to which Moore set his words is a traditional Irish air, first printed in a London songbook in 1775.Songs of Yale. New Haven: Yale Glee Club, 2006. p. 150. The website http://www.contemplator.com/, used in a later reference in this article, claims its first printing was in 1737. It is occasionally wrongly credited to Sir William Davenant, whose older collection of tunes may have been the source for later publishers, including a collection titled General Collection of Ancient Irish Music, compiled by Edward Bunting in 1796. Sir John Andrew Stevenson has been credited as responsible for the music for Moore's setting.William Davenant, 1606-1668. , accessed Feb. 3rd, 2010. It is thought that after Moore's wife, Elizabeth, was badly scarred by smallpox, she refused to leave her room, believing herself ugly and unlovable. To convince her his love was unwavering, Moore composed the ‚ÄòEndearing‚Äô poem which he set to an old Irish melody and sang outside her bedroom door. He later wrote that this restored her confidence and re-kindled their love. Lyrics The lyrics, as originally published in 1808 in A Selection of Irish Melodies, are as follows: Other uses of the melody Other than \\"Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms\\", the tune is perhaps best known as the melody to \\"Fair Harvard\\", the alma mater of Harvard University. A seventeenth-century folk song, Matthew Locke's \\"My Lodging is in the Cold, Cold Ground\\", was set to this tune some time after its original setting to a different, also traditional, air.My Lodging It Is On the Cold Ground. http://www.contemplator.com/england/lodging.html, accessed Feb. 3rd, 2010. Simone Mantia, a pioneer of American euphonium music, composed a theme and variations on the melody, which remains a staple of the solo euphonium literature. The first verse, as originally written, was sung by the character Alfalfa in a 1936 episode of MGM's The Little Rascals entitled Bored of Education. The tune, with the Endearing Young Charms title, also became a staple of Warner Brothers cartoons, appearing first in the 1944 Private Snafu short \\"Booby Traps\\". Subsequent uses included the 1951 Merrie Melodies animated cartoon Ballot Box Bunny, 1957 Looney Tunes short Show Biz Bugs (which reappeared in the 1981 package film), 1965 and 1994 Road Runner cartoons Rushing Roulette and Chariots of Fur respectively, and finally in a new twist on the gag, with Slappy Squirrel's 1993 introductory episode, \\"Slappy Goes Walnuts\\", from Animaniacs. Variations were also done in the 1963 Andy Griffith Show episode \\"Rafe Hollister Sings\\", and the 2010 South Park episode \\"Crippled Summer\\".http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/307810/ukulele-solo In its cartoon appearances, the song is often the cue for a classic \\"bomb gag\\" wherein the playing of the first line of the song sets off a rigged explosion on the final note. However, the target often misses, forcing the perpetrator to play it himself and fall for his own trap. The gag is so well known that it is often called \\"The Xylophone Gag\\". Little Virgie (Shirley Temple) sings the song to her father (John Boles) in the 1935 film The Littlest Rebel. It is used in the film The Informer by John Ford. The first line appears in some versions of Dexys Midnight Runners' \\"Come On Eileen\\" as an introduction played by a solo fiddle. A short version of the tune also appears at the end of some versions of the song. Roger Quilter's setting of the song was included in the Arnold Book of Old Songs, published in 1950. Debbie Reynolds and Barbara Ruick sing the first stanza in the 1953 film The Affairs of Dobie Gillis. Walter Huston plays the melody on harmonica in the film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Joni James sings what is widely considered the best rendition of the song in a medley on her album Irish Favorites (1960). Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). The song is performed at a Christmas party of the Adams Family at the beginning of \\"Chapter VIII: John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State\\" of The Adams Chronicles (1976). An instrumental version of the song plays around the midpoint of the 1963 Twilight Zone episode \\"Passage on the Lady Anne\\". Meredith Baxter performs a stanza of the song during a fundraiser for the Steven's public television station and goes into labor as she sings the high F in the episode \\"Birth of a Keaton, Part 1\\" of Family Ties (1984).

The riot was led by anarchists and communists, and was eventually crushed by the Argentine Federal Police under General Luis Dellepiane, commander of the 2nd Army Corps, and the intervention of the Argentine Army, Argentine Marine Corps and Argentine Navy. Background From 1902 until 1909 the FORA (Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina, founded by Italian immigrant Pietro Gori, an Italian anarchist of international renown) waged a long campaign of general strikes against both employers and anti-labour legislation. In May 1904, a clash between workers and police left two dead and fifteen injured. In 1907, the feminist-anarchist league was established in Buenos Aires. On 17 January 1908, an anarchist bomb planted in a Buenos Aires train killed 35-year-old Salvador Stella and wounded several other passengers near Constituci√≥n Railway Station.El mortifero atentado anarquista en el Tren de los Obreros By the end of the decade, police crackdowns and worker militancy had incited each to greater heights. Ultimately on May Day, 1909, a giant gathering marched through Buenos Aires and was broken up by police, resulting in 12 killed and 100 wounded. It was reported at the time that anarchists had provoked the violence. Argentine President Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta narrowly himself escaped death when an anarchist bomb was thrown at him while he was driving in Buenos Aires on 28 February 1908. Government officials were again thrown into panic by a 19-year- old anarchist, Ukrainian immigrant Sim√≥n Radowitzky. With a hand-held bomb he killed the city's police chief, Ram√≥n Falc√≥n, and his aide, Alberto Lartigau, who were driving through Callao street in Buenos Aires on 15 November 1909. On 16 October 1909, bombs exploded at the Spanish consulate in the city of Rosario, injuring an anarchist and damaging the building. A result of Falc√≥n's assassination was the formation of the self-styled \\"Patriotic students\\" organisation (Juventud Autonomista) in late 1909. On 25 May 1910, in an effort to disrupt the Argentine centennial celebrations in Buenos Aires, an anarchist gave a bomb to an unsuspecting boy to carry into a cathedral. The bomb exploded prematurely killing the boy and costing another both arms. On 28 June 1910 another bomb exploded in the Teatro Col√≥n and 20 theatre-goers were injured. As a result, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies passed a bill providing for capital punishment for those anarchists responsible for causing death. On 9 July 1916, an attempt to assassinate President Victorino de la Plaza was made by a gun-wielding self-confessed anarchist. The attempt was made while reviewing troops during an Argentine independence centennial celebration. On 9 February 1918, violent strikes took place across Argentina and regular troops were rushed to the affected areas after anarchists wrecked trains, destroyed tracks and burned carriages laden with wheat. Violent clashes The conflict began as a strike at the Vasena metal works, a British owned plant in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. The strike at first attracted no attention, but on 3 January the picketing workers fired on and wounded three policemen who were escorting wagonloads of metal to the Vasena factory. On 4 January, a mortally Police NCO (Vicente Ch√°vez) succumbs to his wounds. On 7 January an unrelated event took place: the maritime workers of the port of Buenos Aires voted a general strike for better hours and wages. That same day, at Vasena metal works, the police, who had surrounded the strikers, fought it out with the striking workers after they overturned and set fire to the car of the police chief Elpidio Gonz√°lez, who had arrived to broker a deal with the union leaders, and the militant workers shot and killed Army Second Lieutenant Antonio Marotta, commander of the detachment protecting the police commander.Volvi√≥ nuevamente el Jefe de Polic√≠a Dr. Gonz√°lez y fue desconocida su autoridad, un grupo de exaltados incendi√≥ el auto y le dio muerte a su custodio el subteniente Antonio Marotta. La √©tica por delante, Ra√∫l Jos√© Balbin, p. 22, Editorial Dunken, 2015 Five workers were killed and twenty wounded in the resulting clashes. A student, Pascual Arregui, of the Manifestaci√≥n Patri√≥tica (Patriotic Manifestation) vigilante movement is also killed in this action. That night, militant workers gathered in Pueyrred√≥n Street, shoot and kill Army Sergeant Ram√≥n D√≠az.La Semana Tr√°gica de 1919: Precedida por un Estudio de los Antecedentes de la Inmigraci√≥n y Rebeli√≥n Social, Tomo II, Enrique D√≠az Araujo, p.111, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, 1988. In nearby Corrientes Street the commander of a rifle platoon, Second Lieutenant Agust√≠n Ronzoni is shot and killed along with an innocent male civilian when surrounded and attacked by workers seeking revenge for their earlier losses. A rifle platoon from the Argentine Army is ambushed in Lavalle Street by hidden gunmen firing from inside houses.Semana Tr√°gica: cr√≥nica de una rebeli√≥n proletaria A night patrol under the command of Army Sergeant Bonifacio Manzo is also ambushed near the Constituci√≥n-M√°rmol Farm Estate. In the meantime, a company of the 7th Infantry Regiment is forced to use their Vickers machine-guns in order to keep the demonstrators at bay in Buenos Aires.The Tragic Week of January, 1919, in Buenos Aires: Background, Events, Aftermath, John Raymond H√©bert, p.137, Georgetown University, 1972. A company of riflemen is also forced to come to the rescue of a police detachment holding out from rooftops that had been completely surrounded in the night fighting.Semana Tr√°gica: cr√≥nica de una rebeli√≥n proletaria Paramedics and ambulance drivers, transporting the badly wounded and injured in the hours of darkness to nearby hospitals, are forced to carry pistols in order to defend themselves from the out of control mobs.The Tragic Week of January, 1919, in Buenos Aires: Background, Events, Aftermath, John Raymond H√©bert, p.146, Georgetown University, 1972 At the break of dawn, the 3rd Infantry Regiment is forced to deploy around the Vasena factory to prevent a huge crowd numbering in their thousands from burning down the building along with the 400 workers trapped inside that had refused to take part in the violent protests.Los Talleres de Vasena, pr√≥ximos al Riachuelo, en cuyo interior segu√≠an desempe√±√°ndose 400 obreros, con custodia de de agentes y bomberos, fueron atacados por m√°s de 10.000 personas que pretend√≠an incendiarlos junto con sus ocupantes, y se hizo necesaria la intervenci√≥n del Regimiento 3 de Infanter√≠a, para liberar a los sitiados. Historia de la Polic√≠a Federal Argentina: 1916-1944, Adolfo Enrique Rodr√≠guez, p.37, Biblioteca Policial, 1978. The next day, Wednesday 8 January, the waterfront strike began: all ship movements, and all loading and unloading, came to a halt. On Thursday 9 January, funerals were held for the five workers who had been killed by the police. A procession of 150 mourners, some of them armed, followed the funeral coaches, and as they passed, they attacked property and burned an automobile, before reaching Lacroze, a British-owned tram station, which they attacked. The group then broke into the Convent of the Sacred Heart, at Yatay Street and Corrientes Avenue, and set the church on fire. As the group were attacking a store the police caught up with them, fired into the procession, and killed and wounded numerous demonstrators. Mobs went on the rampage all over the city. Groups overturned and burned streetcars and robbed sports shops for the guns and ammunition inside. In the afternoon, at 3pm, 3,000 people stormed Lacroze Station. Violence also erupted in the Congress, where members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies reportedly threw notebooks at each other, rather than taking action. The funeral procession stopped a suburban train at a railroad crossing and broke every window in the carriages. At the Vasena Workshop, angry crowds pushed garbage wagons against the doors to break them down in an attempt at lynching the British managers who were besieged inside. The British Minister appealed to the President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen for help. Yrigoyen gave the order to shoot to kill, but as the toll of dead and wounded mounted, the mobs became more frantic and destructive. On the night of 9‚Äì10 January, the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (Federaci√≥n Obrera Regional Argentina or FORA) met to consider police action and voted for a general strike for 24 hours throughout the city of Buenos Aires. That night, reinforcements in the form of a rifle platoon from the 4th Infantry Regiment, including a Vickers machine-gun detachment, were sent to help defend the 28th Police Station that was on the verge of being overrun. In all 30,000 officers and men of the Argentine Army would take part in the fighting and subsequent mopping-up operations in Buenos Aires in January 1919.Aproximadamente 30 000 hombres hab√≠a destinado el ej√©rcito para la operaci√≥n: Regimientos 1, 2, 3 y 4 de Infanter√≠a, 2 de Artiller√≠a, 2 y 10 de Caballer√≠a, 1 de Ferroviarios, 2 de Obuses y las Escuelas de Tiro y Suboficiales. La Semana Tr√°gica de Enero de 1919, Julio Godio, p. 51, Hyspam√©rica, 1986 On Friday 10 January, Private Luis Demarchi from the 8th Cavalry Regiment is shot and killed defending the Once de Septiembre Railway Station.Recordando a una v√≠ctima olvidada de la Semana Tr√°gica That day there were no newspapers; markets, stores, hotels and bars were closed, and transportation and communication networks (including the telephone lines) were stopped. On the night of 10‚Äì11 January, two policemen, Corporal Te√≥filo Ram√≠rez and Agent √Ångel Giusti, were reported killed defending their police stations as thousands of strikers tried to storm 8 police stations and seize their armouries as well as the police headquarters building in downtown Buenos Aires.Los d√≠as 10 y 11 las comisarias 2a., 4a., 6a., 9a., 21a., 24a. y 29a. repelieron intentos de asaltos.

In the meantime, 30 gunmen using the cover of darkness, attempt to ransack the armoury of the 8th Infantry Regiment in Campo de Mayo Army Barracks but the attackers are forced to retreat by the defenders in the form of a rifle platoon under Lieutenant Horacio Orstein.Semana Tr√°gica: cr√≥nica de una rebeli√≥n proletaria In the fierce fighting, police reinforcements in the form of vigilantes from the Argentine Patriotic League, emerged. Targeting the city's sizable Jewish population, the right wing League sought pogroms, and brought an ever-growing list of dead and wounded Jews to the newspaper columns. Mobs were running the streets, shouting \\"death to the Rusos,\\" a reference to Argentine Jews, who were mainly Russian, and identified in the minds of those in the League and the like-minded as anarchists and Bolsheviks. The Russian Jewish sections of Buenos Aires were invaded, and terrified Jews were dragged from their homes, beaten, shot and killed; some escaped by pleading they were Italians. Food shortages in the city became acute, and eggs that were selling for 90 cents a dozen in the morning reached 3 pesos (US$1.35) by evening. The railroad union voted to stop trains all over the country in a sympathy strike. The union ordered its members back to work, and issued a statement disclaiming all responsibility for the killings. The Montevideo police had informed the authorities of Buenos Aires that they had uncovered a Communist plot to seize both sides of R√≠o de la Plata with the taking of the capitals of Argentina and Uruguay. On Sunday the police informed the press that they had broken into a private apartment where 40 persons, all of them Russian Jews, were in session as the \\"First Soviet of the Federal Republic of Argentine Soviets.\\" On 11 January, strikers in the suburb of Barracas tried to seize the local police station but were forced to retreat after a 4-hour gunbattle, leaving behind several dead when firemen armed with rifles and army reinforcements from the 4th Infantry Regiment arrived.Semana Tr√°gica: cr√≥nica de una rebeli√≥n proletaria Placing the city under martial law, President Yrigoyen appointed General Luis Dellepiane as the commander of riot control forces, after which disturbances subsided. The 5th and 12th Army Cavalry Regiments arrived on 12 January, and 300 marines and a mountain artillery regiment also entered Buenos Aires. On the morning of 13 January 1919, a group of anarchists attempted to seize arms and ammunition from a local police station but were forced to retreat after coming under fire from a naval infantry detachment from the cruiser ARA San Martin. Another 600 naval infantry reinforcements also arrive from the cruisers ARA Belgrano, ARA Garibaldi and ARA Buenos Aires that lay anchor in D√°rsena Norte.Semana Tr√°gica: cr√≥nica de una rebeli√≥n proletaria The role of young army lieutenant Juan Domingo Peron, future president of Argentina, as commander of a Vicker's machine-gun detachment is disputed by historians. Casualties The leftist Vanguardia newspaper claimed that over 700 deaths were recorded on Tragic Week, as well as 2,000 injured. The leftist La Protesta newspaper claimed that 45,000 were arrested.FRAGMENTOS DE CENSURA Y REPRESI√ìN According to the Argentine Federal Police Grouping (Agrupaci√≥n de la Polic√≠a Federal or AGPFA) Report the real number of arrests were 3,579.El Juda√≠smo y la Semana Tr√°gica: La Verdadera Historia de los Sucesos de Enero de 1919, Federico Rivanera Carl√©s, p. 204, Instituto de Investigaciones sobre la Cuesti√≥n Jud√≠a, 1986 Professor Patricia Marchak estimates the real number of workers killed at more than 100. La Naci√≥n newspaper reported the number of workers killed in the uprising at around 100 and 400 injured. In his official report, Police chief Octavio A. Pinero from the 9th Police Station, claims there were 141 killed in the uprisings and 521 wounded.Octavio A.

The Argentine Army suffered five killed and around one-hundred wounded/injured. The vigilante forces supporting the Army and Police units suffered one killed (Pascual Arregui) and several wounded/injured. The United States embassy reported that 1,500 people were killed in total, \\"mostly Russians and generally Jews,\\" and that many women were raped. Aftermath On 24 December 1927, anarchists planted bombs at two U.S. bank branches in Buenos Aires resulting in the multiple injuries of twenty bank staff and customers. The Italian Consulate in Buenos Aires was bombed on 23 May 1928, and seven were killed and nearly 50 wounded in the anarchist bombing. On 24 December 1929, 44-year-old Italian-born anarchist Gualterio Marinelli was killed in his attempt to assassinate Argentine president Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen (who had ordered the army to suppress the metalworkers' strike of 1919) but he manages to wound two policemen. On September 6, 1930, Yrigoyen was deposed in a military coup led by General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu. The Uriburu regime shut down Anarchist and Communist presses and made it difficult, if not impossible, for anarchists to spread their ideals. Uriburu ordered the mass deportation of Spanish and Italian workers that had joined the anarchists and the changing political, economic and social conditions \\"led to the decline of this movement, particularly in its manifestation within the labor movement\\". Nevertheless, on 20 January 1931, three anarchist bombs went off at three strategic places on the Buenos Aires railway network, killing three and wounding 17. On 29 January 1931, Severino Di Giovanni, mastermind of the railway bombings, was ambushed in downtown Buenos Aires and captured in a gun-battle with police, killing two officers and a five-year old girl, then turned the gun on himself.Anarquistas y mandatarios del G20, el temor a que la historia se repita Neverteless, Di Giovanni was stabilized and, after a brief period of recovery and interrogation, was executed in the grounds of the National Penitentiary on 1 February 1931.

The cause of the dark streaks in the clouds is not yet known. The possibility of life on Venus is a subject of interest in astrobiology due to its proximity and similarities to Earth. To date, no definitive proof has been found of past or present life on Venus. Theories have decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying the planet and it became clear that its environment is extreme compared to Earth's. However, there is ongoing study as to whether life could have existed on the Venusian surface before a runaway greenhouse effect took hold, and related study as to whether a relict biosphere could persist high in the modern Venusian atmosphere. With extreme surface temperatures reaching nearly and an atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth, the conditions on Venus make water-based life as we know it unlikely on the surface of the planet. However, a few scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the temperate, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004). \\"Venus clouds 'might harbour life'\\". BBC News. Retrieved 30 December 2015. In September 2020, research was published that reported the presence of phosphine in the planet's atmosphere, a potential biosignature.  Surface conditions  Main article: Observations and explorations of Venus Because Venus is completely covered in clouds, human knowledge of surface conditions was largely speculative until the space probe era. Until the mid-20th century, the surface environment of Venus was believed to be similar to Earth, hence it was widely believed that Venus could harbor life. In 1870, the British astronomer Richard A. Proctor said the existence of life on Venus was impossible near its equator,Proctor, Richard A., Other Worlds Than Ours: The Plurality of Worlds Studied Under the Light of Recent Scientific Researches. New York : J.A. Hill and Co., 1870. s. 94. but possible near its poles. Science fiction writers were free to imagine what Venus might be like until the 1960s; see Venus in fiction. Among the speculations on Venus were that it had a jungle-like environment or that it had oceans of either petroleum or carbonated water. However, microwave observations published by C. Mayer et al. in 1958 indicated a high-temperature source (600 K). Strangely, millimetre-band observations made by A. D. Kuzmin indicated much lower temperatures. Two competing theories explained the unusual radio spectrum, one suggesting the high temperatures originated in the ionosphere, and another suggesting a hot planetary surface. In 1962, Mariner 2, the first successful mission to Venus, measured the planet's temperature for the first time, and found it to be \\"about 500 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit).\\" Since then, increasingly clear evidence from various space probes showed Venus has an extreme climate, with a greenhouse effect generating a constant temperature of about on the surface. The atmosphere contains sulfuric acid clouds. In 1968, NASA reported that air pressure on the Venusian surface was 75 to 100 times that of Earth. This was later revised to 92 bars, almost 100 times that of Earth and similar to that of more than deep in Earth's oceans. In such an environment, and given the hostile characteristics of the Venusian weather, life as we know it is highly unlikely to occur. Past habitability potential Scientists have speculated that if liquid water existed on its surface before the runaway greenhouse effect heated the planet, microbial life may have formed on Venus, but it may no longer exist.Bruce Dorminey, \\"Venus Likely Had Past Life; Next Step Is Finding It\\", Forbes, 28 March 2016. Assuming the process that delivered water to Earth was common to all the planets near the habitable zone, it has been estimated that liquid water could have existed on its surface for up to 600 million years during and shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment, which could be enough time for simple life to form, but this figure can vary from as little as a few million years to as much as a few billion. Recent studies from September 2019 concluded that Venus may have had surface water and a habitable condition for around 3 billion years and may have been in this condition until 700 to 750 million years ago. If correct, this would have been an ample amount of time for the formation of life, and for microbial life to evolve to become aerial. There has been very little analysis of Venusian surface material, so it is possible that evidence of past life, if it ever existed, could be found with a probe capable of enduring Venus's current extreme surface conditions, although the resurfacing of the planet in the past 500 million years means that it is unlikely that ancient surface rocks remain, especially those containing the mineral tremolite which, theoretically, could have encased some biosignatures.  Suggested panspermia events  It has been speculated that life on Venus may have come to Earth through panspermia. \\"Current models indicate that Venus may have been habitable. Complex life may have evolved on the highly irradiated Venus, and transferred to Earth on asteroids. This model fits the pattern of pulses of highly developed life appearing, diversifying and going extinct with astonishing rapidity through the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, and also explains the extraordinary genetic variety which appeared over this period.\\"  Cataclysmic events  Between 700 and 750 million years ago, a near- global resurfacing event triggered the release of carbon dioxide from rock on the planet, which transformed its climate. In addition, according to a study from researchers at the University of California, Riverside, Venus would be able to support life if Jupiter didn't alter its orbit around the Sun. Present habitability of its atmosphere Atmospheric conditions Although there is little possibility of existing life near the surface of Venus, the altitudes about above the surface have a mild temperature, and hence there are still some opinions in favor of such a possibility in the atmosphere of Venus. Venus as a Natural Laboratory for Search of Life in High Temperature Conditions: Events on the Planet on March 1, 1982 , L. V. Ksanfomality, published in Astronomicheskii Vestnik, Vol. 46, No. 1, 2012 . The idea was first brought forward by German physicist Heinz Haber in 1950. In September 1967, Carl Sagan and Harold Morowitz published an analysis of the issue of life on Venus in the journal Nature. In the analysis of mission data from the Venera, Pioneer Venus and Magellan missions, it was discovered that carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide were present together in the upper atmosphere. Venera also detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud cover. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it can be produced by volcanism. Sulfuric acid is produced in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor. The re-analysys of Pioneer Venus data in 2020 has found part of chlorine and all of hydrogen sulfide spectral features are instead phosphine-related, meaning lower than thought concentration of chlorine and non-detection of hydrogen sulfide. Solar radiation constrains the atmospheric habitable zone to between 51 km (65 ¬∞C) and 62 km (‚àí20 ¬∞C) altitude, within the acidic clouds. It has been speculated that clouds in the atmosphere of Venus could contain chemicals that can initiate forms of biological activity. Potential biomarkers Unknown absorbers It has been speculated that any hypothetical microorganisms inhabiting the atmosphere, if present, could employ ultraviolet light (UV) emitted by the Sun as an energy source, which could be an explanation for the dark lines (called \\"unknown UV absorber\\") observed in the UV photographs of Venus. The existence of this \\"unknown UV absorber\\" prompted Carl Sagan to publish an article in 1963 proposing the hypothesis of microorganisms in the upper atmosphere as the agent absorbing the UV light. In August 2019, astronomers reported a newly discovered long-term pattern of UV light absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of Venus and its weather, that is caused by \\"unknown absorbers\\" that may include unknown chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere. In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence that suggests Venus is currently (within 2.5 million years from present) volcanically active, and the residue from such activity may be a potential source of nutrients for possible microorganisms in the Venusian atmosphere. Phosphine Research published in September 2020 indicated the detection of phosphine (PH3) in Venus's atmosphere that was not linked to any known abiotic method of production present or possible under Venusian conditions. A molecule like phosphine is not expected to persist in the Venusian atmosphere since, under the ultraviolet radiation, it will eventually react with water and carbon dioxide. PH3 is associated with anaerobic ecosystems on Earth, and may indicate life on anoxic planets. Related studies suggested that the detected concentration of phosphine (20 ppb) in the clouds of Venus indicated a \\"plausible amount of life,\\" and further, that the typical predicted biomass densities were \\"several orders of magnitude lower than the average biomass density of Earth‚Äôs aerial biosphere.‚Äù , no known abiotic process generates phosphine gas on terrestrial planets (as opposed to gas giants) in appreciable quantities. The phosphine can be generated by geological process of weathering an olivine lavas containing inorganic phosphides, but this process requires an ongoing and massive volcanic activity. Therefore, detectable amounts of phosphine could indicate life. In a statement published on October 5, 2020 on the website of the International Astronomical Union's commission F3 on astrobiology, the authors of the September 2020 paper about phosphine were accused of unethical behaviour and criticized for being unscientific and misleading the public. Members of that commission have since distanced themselves from the IAU statement, claiming that it had been published without their knowledge or approval. The statement was removed from the IAU website shortly thereafter.

BepiColombo, launched in 2018 to study Mercury, flew by Venus on October 15, 2020 and will perform a second flyby on August 10, 2021. Johannes Benkhoff, project scientist, believes BepiColombo's MERTIS (Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer) could possibly detect phosphine, but \\"we do not know if our instrument is sensitive enough\\". Re-analysis of the in situ data gathered by Pioneer Venus Multiprobe in 1978 has also revealed the presence of phosphine and its dissociation products in the atmosphere of Venus. In October 2020, a reanalysis of archived infrared spectrum measurement in 2015 did not reveal any phosphine in Venusian atmosphere, placing an upper limit of phosphine volume concentration 5 parts per billion (a quarter of value measured in radio band in 2020). 21 October 2020, the review of data processing used in original publication of September 2020, has revealed an interpolation error resulting in multiple spurious lines, including the spectral feature of phosphine. Re-analysis of data with the fixed algorithm do not result in the detection of the phosphine.

This operator algebra amounts to the deformation quantization of the corresponding Poisson algebra. It is due to Maxim Kontsevich.M. Kontsevich (2003), Deformation Quantization of Poisson Manifolds, Letters of Mathematical Physics 66, pp. 157-216. Deformation quantization of a Poisson algebra Given a Poisson algebra , a deformation quantization is an associative unital product ‚òÖ on the algebra of formal power series in , subject to the following two axioms, :\\\\begin{align} f*g &=fg+\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\hbar)\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}[f,g] &=f*g-g*f=i\\\\hbar\\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\}+\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\hbar^2) \\\\end{align} If one were given a Poisson manifold , one could ask, in addition, that :f*g=fg+\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\hbar^kB_k(f\\\\otimes g), where the are linear bidifferential operators of degree at most . Two deformations are said to be equivalent iff they are related by a gauge transformation of the type, :\\\\begin{cases} D: A\\\\hbar\\\\to A\\\\hbar \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\hbar^k f_k \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\hbar^k f_k +\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge1, k\\\\ge0} D_n(f_k)\\\\hbar^{n+k} \\\\end{cases} where are differential operators of order at most . The corresponding induced ‚òÖ-product, ‚òÖ‚Ä≤, is then :f\\\\,{*}'\\\\,g = D \\\\left ( \\\\left (D^{-1}f \\\\right )* \\\\left (D^{-1}g \\\\right ) \\\\right ). For the archetypal example, one may well consider Groenewold's original \\"Moyal-Weyl\\" ‚òÖ-product. Kontsevich graphs A Kontsevich graph is a simple directed graph without loops on 2 external vertices, labeled f and g; and internal vertices, labeled . From each internal vertex originate two edges. All (equivalence classes of) graphs with internal vertices are accumulated in the set . An example on two internal vertices is the following graph, :Kontsevich graph for n=2 Associated bidifferential operator Associated to each graph , there is a bidifferential operator defined as follows. For each edge there is a partial derivative on the symbol of the target vertex. It is contracted with the corresponding index from the source symbol. The term for the graph is the product of all its symbols together with their partial derivatives. Here f and g stand for smooth functions on the manifold, and is the Poisson bivector of the Poisson manifold. The term for the example graph is :\\\\Pi^{i_2j_2}\\\\partial_{i_2}\\\\Pi^{i_1j_1}\\\\partial_{i_1}f\\\\,\\\\partial_{j_1}\\\\partial_{j_2}g. Associated weight For adding up these bidifferential operators there are the weights of the graph . First of all, to each graph there is a multiplicity which counts how many equivalent configurations there are for one graph. The rule is that the sum of the multiplicities for all graphs with internal vertices is . The sample graph above has the multiplicity . For this, it is helpful to enumerate the internal vertices from 1 to . In order to compute the weight we have to integrate products of the angle in the upper half-plane, H, as follows. The upper half-plane is , endowed with a metric :ds^2=\\\\frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}; and, for two points with , we measure the angle between the geodesic from to and from to counterclockwise. This is :\\\\phi(z,w)=\\\\frac{1}{2i}\\\\log\\\\frac{(z-w)(z-\\\\bar{w})}{(\\\\bar{z}-w)(\\\\bar{z}-\\\\bar{w})}. The integration domain is Cn(H) the space :C_n(H):=\\\\\\\\{(u_1,\\\\dots,u_n)\\\\in H^n: u_i e u_j\\\\forall i e j\\\\\\\\}. The formula amounts :w_\\\\Gamma:= \\\\frac{m(\\\\Gamma)}{(2\\\\pi)^{2n}n!}\\\\int_{C_n(H)} \\\\bigwedge_{j=1}^n\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\phi(u_j,u_{t1(j)})\\\\wedge\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\phi(u_j,u_{t2(j)}), where t1(j) and t2(j) are the first and second target vertex of the internal vertex . The vertices f and g are at the fixed positions 0 and 1 in . The formula Given the above three definitions, the Kontsevich formula for a star product is now :f*g = fg+\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\left(\\\\frac{i\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\right)^n \\\\sum_{\\\\Gamma \\\\in G_n(2)} w_\\\\Gamma B_\\\\Gamma(f\\\\otimes g). Explicit formula up to second order Enforcing associativity of the ‚òÖ-product, it is straightforward to check directly that the Kontsevich formula must reduce, to second order in , to just :f*g = fg +\\\\tfrac{i\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\Pi^{ij}\\\\partial_i f\\\\,\\\\partial_j g -\\\\tfrac{\\\\hbar^2}{8}\\\\Pi^{i_1j_1}\\\\Pi^{i_2j_2}\\\\partial_{i_1}\\\\,\\\\partial_{i_2}f \\\\partial_{j_1}\\\\,\\\\partial_{j_2}g - \\\\tfrac{\\\\hbar^2}{12}\\\\Pi^{i_1j_1}\\\\partial_{j_1}\\\\Pi^{i_2j_2}(\\\\partial_{i_1}\\\\partial_{i_2}f \\\\,\\\\partial_{j_2}g -\\\\partial_{i_2}f\\\\,\\\\partial_{i_1}\\\\partial_{j_2}g) +\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\hbar^3) References Category:Mathematical quantization ","title":"Kontsevich quantization formula"},{"id":"26049978","text":"Scarampi is the name of a prominent Ghibelline family of Asti and its environs in north-west Italy.

The equivalent width of a spectral line is a measure of the area of the line on a plot of intensity versus wavelength. It is found by forming a rectangle with a height equal to that of continuum emission, and finding the width such that the area of the rectangle is equal to the area in the spectral line. It is a measure of the strength of spectral features that is primarily used in astronomy. Definition Formally, the equivalent width is given by the equation W_\\\\lambda = \\\\int (1 - F_\\\\lambda / F_0) d\\\\lambda. Here, F_0 represents the continuum intensity on either side of the absorption (or emission) feature, while F_\\\\lambda represents the intensity across the entire wavelength range of interest. Then W_\\\\lambda represents the width of a hypothetical line which drops to an intensity of zero and has the \\"same integrated flux deficit from the continuum as the true one.\\" This equation can be applied to either emission or absorption, but when applied to emission, the value of W_\\\\lambda is negative, and so the absolute value is used. Applications The equivalent width is used as a quantitative measure of the strength of spectral features. The equivalent width is a convenient choice because the shapes of spectral features can vary depending upon the configuration of the system which is producing the lines. For instance, the line may experience Doppler broadening due to motions of the gas emitting the photons. The photons will be shifted away from the line center, thus rendering the height of the emission line a poor measure of its overall strength. The equivalent width, on the other hand, \\"measures the fraction of energy removed from the spectrum by the line,\\" regardless of the broadening intrinsic to the line or a detector with poor resolution. Thus the equivalent width can in many conditions yield the number of absorbing or emitting atoms. For example, measurements of the equivalent width of the Balmer alpha transition in T Tauri stars are used in order to classify individual T Tauri stars as being classical or weak-lined. Also, the equivalent width is used in studying star formation in Lyman alpha galaxies, as the equivalent width of the Lyman alpha line is related to the star formation rate in the galaxy. The equivalent width is also used in many other situations where a quantitative comparison between line strengths is needed.

She and the rest of her class were re-classified as corvettes in 1884. Design Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, the hull was of composite construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts with wooden planking. This class of composite sloops was unique in having an internal steel deck over the machinery and magazines for protection. Propulsion was provided by a horizontal compound-expansion steam engine of driving a single screw. All the ships of the class were built with a barque rig. Earlier ships of the class had been built with two 6-inch/100-pounder (81cwt) breech-loading guns and ten 5-inch/50-pounder (38cwt) breech-loading guns, but Hyacinth and three of her sisters had eight breech-loading 6-inch/100-pounder (81cwt) Mk II guns instead of the mixed 5-inch and 6-inch armament. This was complemented by a single light gun and four (or more) machine guns. Construction Hyacinth was built at Devonport Dockyard, with the keel laid on 30 August 1880. She was launched on 20 December 1881, and the cost of her hull came to ¬£52,500. Machinery provided by Humphreys and Tennant was fitted at a cost of ¬£14,500, and she was commissioned on 27 January 1884. Career The Satellite class were reclassified as corvettes in 1884. Designed for low-level policing duties, Hyacinth, in common with her sister ships Heroine and Caroline, was sent to the China Station. Between 1886 and 1892 Hyacinth conducted annual cruises in the Pacific, showing the flag and providing protection and reassurance to British citizens of the far-flung maritime Empire. She travelled as far afield as New Zealand, Cook Islands, Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, Tahiti and Hawaii. On 27 September 1888 the Vice- Consul of Rarotonga, Mr R Exham, prompted by rumours of incipient French intervention in the Cook Islands proclaimed a protectorate over the Southern Group, that is, Rarotonga, Mangaia, Aitutaki, Atiu, Mauke, Mitiaro and Takutea.

Construction Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, her hull was of composite construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts with wooden planking. She was fitted with a 2-cylinder horizontal compound expansion steam engine driving a single screw, produced by John Elder & Co. She was rigged with three masts, with square rig on the fore- and main-masts, making her a barque-rigged vessel. Her keel was laid at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 15 December 1875 and she was launched on 28 December 1876. Service After official commission into the Royal Navy on 17 July 1877, Condor joined the Mediterranean Fleet in 1879, remaining there until at least 1886. HMS Condor was under the command Lord Charles Beresford and had the was correspondent Frederic Villiers, and Moberly Bell of The Times, on board as a guests. Over and above its three main guns the ship had a Gatling gun mounted on the main-top.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.289 The three standard guns (one 12-pounder and two 64-pounders) were supplemented by three recently added 7 pounders.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.296 Bombardment of Alexandria Early in 1882 Egypt was struggling to resist a wave of nationalism and independence from Britain under the banner of \\"Egypt for the Egyptians\\". After rioting in Alexandria, during which Europeans were killed, Admiral Seymour aboard HMS Invincible in company with a fleet of 15 ironclads under his command, was ordered to go to the area in June 1882. He arrived at Alexandria in order to protect the lives and property of British subjects, and safeguard access to the Suez Canal. Local native forces began work to improve the fortifications, and when they failed to respond to Seymour's ultimatum to stop work on 6 July. A second ultimatum on 10 July was more specific that a bombardment would begin on the morning of 11 July unless the harbour defences were relinquished. Foreign ships were asked to leave the harbour, including a large French fleet which moved to Port Said.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.288 Seymour (on HMS Invincible) signalled to HMS Alexandra to commence firing at the Ras-el-Tin fortifications at 7:00 a.m. on 11 July 1882, followed by the general order to attack the enemy's batteries. The offshore squadron at first conducted the attack while underway, but this proved difficult, and by 9:40, Sultan, Superb and Alexandra had anchored off the Lighthouse Fort and concentrated their fire on the heavily armed Ras-el- Tin battery. By 12:30, Inflexible had joined the attack and the fort's guns were silenced.Goodrich, Caspar F (Lt Cdr), Report of the British Naval and Military Operations In Egypt 1882, Navy Department, Washington, 1885, p.30 The Bombardment of Alexandria, 11 July 1882, from Le Monde Illustr√© The larger ships began an attack on the Fort Mex battery but Temeraire ran aground. This enabled Condor, commanded by Lord Charles Beresford, to go to her assistance. She was refloated around 8am and resumed the attack. While the offshore squadron was engaging the forts at long-range, the in-shore group, Monarch, Penelope were engaging the main harbour and eastern forts including the Maza- el-Kanat battery. However, Fort Marabout to the west, had a raking view across the approaches to the harbour and was equipped with heavy guns capable of jeopardising the entire attack. Beresford stated he would attach Fort Marabout to divert their fire from the main group. Condor sailed to within 400m of Fort Marabout and began furiously firing at the fort. This great proximity had a strange advantage because the guns in the fort could only awkwardly be repositioned to point downwards.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.299 After two hours of exchanging fire, with Fort Marabout much disabled, Admiral Seymour ordered the smaller gunships, HMS Bittern, HMS Cygnet and HMS Decoy to move in to finish the affray.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.302 When Fort Marabout's guns were disabled, the flag lieutenant Hedworth Lambton on Invincible signalled \\"Well Done, Condor.\\" Condors action allowed the ships to finish off Fort Mex. Fate Condor later served in the campaign in the Eastern Sudan in 1885 and was based at Suakin. After a short career, Condor was sold to Mr George Cohen in August 1889.

He was also Deputy United States Marshal for the Arizona Territory 1878, and a noted gunslinger.  Early life  John Hicks Adams was born in Edwardsville, Illinois, on June 13, 1820. His father, John Adams Sr., was elected Sheriff of Madison County in 1838. John Jr., was appointed Deputy Sheriff; his duties included collecting taxes and taking care of court business. In December 1841, John married Mathilda Pomeroy. Their first child, May Hanna was born one year later on December 21, 1842. In May 1847, during the Mexican American War, Adams joined Company J, 5th Regiment of the Illinois Volunteers. During the march south, the commander of his company, Captain Niles, died and John was promoted to Captain of Company J, the rank he continued to maintain throughout his year and half of active duty. John served most of his time in the Southwest, fighting Indians. Captain Adams was discharged from the service on the October 12th, 1848.

John stayed in the gold country mining, until September 1851, when he returned home. A year later in the spring of 1852, he again started for California, but this time he was accompanied by his family. They settled in Georgetown, where John continued mining, when in 1853 they moved to a farm near Gilroy.  Career as County Sheriff  John started his political career by running for and winning the office of Santa Clara County Supervisor for Gilroy and Almaden Township in the September election of 1861. In 1863, John ran for Sheriff, beating William Aram by more than 500 votes. With the passing of Sheriff Kennedy on February 6, 1864, the Board of Supervisors appointed Adams (who would have been sworn in as Sheriff in March) to finish out Kennedy's term.

Soon afterward, a band of Confederate partisan rangers, known as Captain Ingram's Partisan Rangers from the San Jose area robbed two stage coaches in the Bullion Bend Robbery near Placerville. During the pursuit Deputy Sheriff Staples of El Dorado County was gunned down when he surprised them at a rooming house the next day. Information filtered to Sheriff Adams that the Confederates were holed up in a shack near Almaden. Sheriff Adams and a posse of Deputies surrounded the shack, and demanded their surrender. The robbers failed to obey the order and tried to escape. A shoot-out ensued, like one in a western movie. All of the Confederates were either captured or killed in the volley of shots. Sheriff Adams was wounded when a bullet struck his pocket watch and glanced into his ribs.Boessenecker, John, Badge and Buckshot, Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1988. p.138-139 Later that year and the next Adams pursued another gang of \\"partisan rangers\\", the Mason Henry Gang who had rapidly degenerated into a vicious gang of outlaws, committing robberies, thefts and murders in the southern San Joaquin Valley, Santa Cruz County, Monterey County and Santa Clara County preying on stagecoaches, ranchers and others especially if they were known Union men in the vicinity. Adams pursued the gang with the help of two companies of Native California Volunteer Cavalry from Camp Low during the summer of 1865. But no one could locate their hideout at Loma Prieta. In June, 1865, a posse of nine soldiers and five citizens led by Sheriff Adams searched the area around the Panoche Valley in what is now southern San Benito County in search of the gang after receiving a reliable tip that they were planning a raid on the ranches there. However a system of spies set up by the secessionists had warned the band of their approach, when Sheriff Adams arrived at Panoche, Mason and Henry were already retreating towards Corralitos.

Career Early career Warburton was elected at the 1977 election as the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Sandgate, succeeding Harold Dean who had held the seat for the ALP since 1960. In 1982, following a string of poor election results under Ed Casey, a leadership contest lead to fellow opposition frontbencher Keith Wright defeating Casey in a secret ballot. Warburton was appointed deputy opposition leader in Wright's shadow cabinet, despite having served only five years in parliament. Warburton became a member of the then dominant Trades and Labour Council faction, an affiliation he retained during his later career. Leader of the Opposition In 1984, Wright resigned from the Legislative Assembly to stand for election to federal parliament. Warburton was elected by caucus as the new Labor leader in Queensland on 29 August 1984. Warburton was often portrayed in the media as being an \\"old style\\" Labor leader; uncomplicated and honest. Peter Bowers, a columnist with the Sydney Morning Herald declared that Warburton was \\"...a straight up and down politician, no charisma, no nonsense\\". Labor approached the 1986 election being given little hope of taking power, given the continued existence of the Bjelkemander, despite continued disunity and infighting between the Liberal and National parties that formed government. Warburton's policies included the introduction of random breath testing in Queensland, and a ban on uranium mining in Queensland, an idea that would become longstanding Labor party policy. Warburton also made overtures to the Liberals, offering to form a coalition government with them in order to break the National Party's grip on power. However, on polling day, the National party won a resounding victory that enabled them to govern in their own right, and Labor lost two seats, despite polling more votes than the Nationals. Warburton hung on as leader of the opposition after this defeat, but eventually handed over the party leadership to Wayne Goss in 1988. Minister in the Goss Government Warburton stayed on the opposition frontbench at the invitation of Goss, and when Labor won power for the first time in over thirty years at the 1989 election, he was appointed as Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial relations. In 1991, he switched portfolios and became Minister for Police and Emergency Services, a post he held until he retired from Parliament in 1992. Lawn bowler In addition to his political career, Warburton was also an enthusiastic participant in the sport of lawn bowls. Death Warburton died on 5 August 2018 on the Sunshine Coast. At the time of his death he was the only surviving ALP leader who did not become Premier and the last surviving Opposition Leader who had led his party during its 32 years in Opposition between 1957 and 1989.

Biography  Longinus came from the region of Isauria, in Asia Minor. His father was called Kodisa (as attested by his brother's patronimic \\"Tarasicodissa\\"), his mother was Lallis or Lalis, his wife was a Valeria and he had a daughter called Longina. When his brother, the Emperor Zeno, was deposed by Basiliscus and pursued by the Imperial army in Isauria (475), Longinus was captured by the Isaurian general Illus and held prisoner for a decade. Illus, who had been a supporter of Basiliscus but later had passed on Zeno's side, used Longinus to keep Zeno under control. In 483, when Zeno requested Longinus' liberation, Illus refused and started the rebellion that led to his death. After being released in 485, Longinus started a military career, being elevated to the post of magister militum praesentialis (485) and holding the consulate twice, in 486 and 490. He led a military campaign against the Tzans and lavishly donated to the people of Constantinople, paying for four new dancers to the factions of the hippodrome to replace the older ones. On the death of Zeno in 491, Longinus was one of the possible candidates for the succession, but his Isaurian origin, which had already caused problems to Zeno, disadvantaged him: Ariadne, Zeno's widow, chose Anastasius I, a senior official. Longinus then instigated a revolt in Isauria, known as the Isaurian War. Anastasius forced him to take vows and sent him into exile in Thebaid (Egypt), later defeating the rebel army (492) led by Longinus of Cardala and finally suppressing the revolt six years later, with the death of the last leader of the rebels, Longinus of Selinus. Longinus' mother retired to a monastery at Brochthi in Bithynia at the news of the exile of her son.

MRN works with organisations across the UK, aiming to strengthen the voice of migrants in discussion and debates. The overall mission of MRN is to ensure recognition of migration as a key component of economic progress and development, in the creation of culturally rich and diverse societies, and in the promotion of human, political, social and economic rights and gender equality. Background The need for a permanent network of migrant organisations in the UK was first identified through the discussions and research undertaken by the Barrow Cadbury Trust funded project entitled 'Migrant Community Organisations in the UK (MCOP)'. The project explored the possibility for closer and better collaboration between different groups working in the field of migration to strengthen the voice of migrants in the UK. Especially since such organisations often have limited funding, and have been set up to support what are often beleaguered communities with high numbers of refugees and asylum-seekers and/or significant numbers of irregular migrants. The outcome of the MCOP's work was set out in the report \\"Migrant Voices, Migrant Rights\\" published by the Barrow Cadbury Trust. In response to the recommendations of the report, the Migrant Rights Network (MRN) has been established as a permanent network of organisations working to support the development of migrants' rights across the UK. The network's main goal is to develop strategies which will increase the involvement of 'migrant voices' in national policy debates, and enhance cooperation across a wide range of civil society organisations to achieve this end.

Although her hand in marriage was sought for the heirs to the thrones of both the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire, neither alliance occurred. Family H√©l√®ne d'Orl√©ans as a young girl (1885) H√©l√®ne was the third of eight children born to Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, and Infanta Maria Isabel of Spain. Her father was a grandson of Louis Philippe I, King of the French, and had been heir-apparent to the throne from 1842 until the exile of the dynasty in 1848. Like her two elder siblings, she was born in exile at York House in Twickenham England, shortly before the law of banishment against the dynasty was repealed. Repatriating to France at the end of June 1871, the family took up residence in Paris at the Hotel Fould on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, as guests of their uncle, Henri, Duke of Aumale, whose wealth and properties in France had not been confiscated in 1852, unlike those of the other Orl√©ans princes. On 21 December 1872 the National Assembly enacted a law of restitution, authorising restoration of approximately 40 million of the eighty million francs worth of property which had formerly belonged to the House of Orl√©ans, although the actual re-acquisition of that wealth would take several years. Meanwhile, a close friend of the Count and Countess of Paris, Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari, placed at their disposal the ground floor and gardens of the H√¥tel Matignon on the rue de Varenne in Paris. Along the adjacent rue de Babylone the Duchess had a two-story town house built to accommodate the Orl√©ans children, their governesses and tutors, which served as H√©l√®ne's home from 1876 until her father was again exiled. In 1883 the last legitimate prince in the male-line of Louis XV, Henri, Count of Chambord, died childless leaving, in the eyes of French royalists excepting recalcitrant legitimists, the Count of Paris as heir to the Bourbon crown of France. However, celebrations in Paris in the spring of 1886 prior to the marriage in Lisbon of H√©l√®ne's eldest sister Am√©lie to Carlos of Braganza-Coburg, Prince Royal of Portugal, evoked such clear expressions of monarchist support for the House of Orl√©ans that on 22 July the French Republic took the precaution of banishing the heads of France's former ruling dynasties, the Orl√©ans and Bonapartes, from the country. Nearly all of the Orl√©ans promptly left France, with H√©l√®ne and her parents going on to visit Tunbridge Wells in England and then travelling to Scotland before taking up residence in October at Sheen House in East Sheen, England. In 1890 they moved on to Stowe House in Buckingham, England. Potential matches H√©l√®ne of Orl√©ans - Duchess of Aosta, 1903 Most of H√©l√®ne's siblings had married well, including Am√©lie, Queen of Portugal, Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans (who married Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria) and Isabelle, Duchess of Guise, and H√©l√®ne's parents had hopes that she would marry an heir to a throne. Those hopes were fanned by the fact that H√©l√®ne was considered a great beauty for the day, and one contemporary source stated that she was \\"the personification of womanly health and beauty, distinguished as a graceful athlete and charming linguist\\". Relationship with the Duke of Clarence The Duchess of Aosta Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (\\"Eddy\\") was the eldest son of the future Edward VII and grandson of then reigning Queen Victoria. During the spring and summer of 1890, Eddy and H√©l√®ne were allowed to become acquainted at the homes of Clarence's sister Princess Louise, Duchess of Fife in Sheen and in Scotland, and, with the encouragement of their mothers, H√©l√®ne and Eddy fell in love.Pope-Hennessy, pp. 196-199. On 29 August, Clarence obtained permission to meet alone with his grandmother at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and brought H√©l√®ne with him. Marriage to a Roman Catholic would have entailed constitutional forfeiture of Eddy's claim to the British throne, pursuant to the Act of Settlement, but H√©l√®ne offered to become an Anglican. When Queen Victoria expressed surprise at H√©l√®ne's offer, H√©l√®ne wept and insisted that her willingness to do so was for the sake of love. Moved by the couple's desperate plea for her help, Victoria agreed to support them but warned that she thought there were many obstacles likely to render success unlikely. This included her expectation that H√©l√®ne's father would not consent to his daughter's change of faith. Clarence offered to renounce his succession rights if necessary, writing to his brother: \\"You have no idea how I love this sweet girl now, and I feel I could never be happy without her\\". His mother agreed with the match, as did his father. However Queen Victoria's fears of insurmountable opposition from multiple sources proved accurate. Her prime minister, Lord Salisbury expressed objections to the alliance to the Queen in writing at length on 9 September. H√©l√®ne's father refused to countenance the marriage, was adamant she could not convert and informed the Queen of his decision. He granted permission, nonetheless, for H√©l√®ne to personally beseech Pope Leo XIII for a dispensation to marry Clarence, but the pope confirmed her father's verdict and the courtship ended. Clarence never got over his feelings for H√©l√®ne and their relationship is commemorated at his tomb at Windsor Castle by a bead wreath with the single word \\"HELENE\\" written upon it. Queen Victoria wrote to her grandson recommending another of her grandchildren, Princess Margaret of Prussia, as an alternative, but nothing came of that suggestion, and Clarence told his grandmother that his love for another cousin, Alix of Hesse (a match for which the Queen had long hoped) had gone unrequited. An engagement to Princess Mary of Teck was later arranged, but Clarence died before their wedding could take place. Other potential suitors Although acknowledging his parents' desires for a French alliance in his diary, the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (a first cousin of Clarence) never pursued their choice, H√©l√®ne, as he was already in love with Alix of Hesse and secured their permission to marry her in 1894.Queen Victoria (1975). Advice to my granddaughter: Letters from Queen Victoria to Princess Victoria of Hesse. Simon and Schuster. p.81. In 1892, while travelling in Egypt with her brother Philippe, H√©l√®ne met Ernst Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, who decided that he would marry her, to the fury of his sister, the German Empress Augusta Victoria. German diplomatic pressure put an end to Ernst Gunther's hopes, which were probably fruitless in any event as H√©l√®ne showed no interest in his advances. Later, family members pushed for a marriage with the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Although the Emperor Franz Joseph did not favour the match he said that he would not oppose it, and Franz Ferdinand himself did not say no but deferred a decision. In the meantime, he met his future wife and never considered H√©l√®ne again.Hanson, The Wandering Princess, 77, 84.85, 88-89 Marriage and children On 25 June 1895, at the Church of St. Raphael in Kingston upon Thames, H√©l√®ne married Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Aosta (1869‚Äì1931). He was at the time second in line to the Italian throne. The wedding was attended by Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel of Italy, the Prince and Princess of Wales and others of the British royal family. The wedding breakfast was held at Orleans House. The couple had two sons: * Prince Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta (21 October 1898 - 3 March 1942) * Prince Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta who briefly reigned as King Tomislav II of Croatia. (9 March 1900 - 29 January 1948) Widowed in 1931, Princess H√©l√®ne was married for a second time in 1936 to Colonel Otto Campini. Avocations The Dowager Duchess of Aosta in her final years, 1946 In 1892 H√©l√®ne travelled with her brother Philippe to Egypt and Palestine, the first of many trips outside of Europe. After the breakdown of both her health and her marriage, H√©l√®ne began frequent trips to Africa which lasted up to ten months at a time. She travelled down the Nile, into the Congo, and through much of East Africa, as well as crossing the Sahara. During these trips she became known as a big-game hunter, a reputation bolstered by articles she wrote for Harper's Weekly and later full-length travel books which were illustrated with photographs she had taken. In 1913-1914 H√©l√®ne undertook a round-the-world trip which she recorded in another travel book.Hanson, The Wandering Princess, chapter 7 onwards. War-time Nurse When the Italo-Turkish war broke out, H√©l√®ne trained as a nurse and went aboard the hospital ship Memfi, where she cared for wounded soldiers and those suffering from disease. During World War I, H√©l√®ne became the head of the Italian Red Cross nurses and spent much of her time on or near the front lines. She was remembered for greatly improving sanitary conditions in the military hospitals and elevating and professionalising the role of women nurses. For her service, H√©l√®ne was awarded the Italian Silver Medal for bravery, the Romanian Regina Maria Cross, the French Croix de Guerre, and the Insignia of a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. Her war- time diary was later published with an introduction by Benito Mussolini to aid the Italian Red Cross.Hanson, The Wandering Princess, 220-221, 227 Ancestry References Sources  Category:1871 births Category:1951 deaths Category:House of Orl√©ans Category:Duchesses of Aosta Category:Princesses of France (Orl√©ans) Category:Princesses of Savoy Category:Italian princesses Category:Princesses della Cisterna Category:People from Twickenham Category:Dames of the Order of Saint Isabel Category:Dames of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa Category:Dames of the Order of the Starry Cross Category:English people of French descent ","title":"Princess H√©l√®ne of Orl√©ans"},{"id":"26050650","text":"Dona Maria Am√©lia (; 28 September 1865 ‚Äì 25 October 1951) was the last Queen consort of Portugal as the wife of Carlos I of Portugal. As the eldest daughter of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, and his wife, Princess Marie Isabelle d'Orl√©ans, she was a \\"Princess of Orl√©ans\\" by birth. Family Am√©lia's paternal grandparents were Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, and Duchess Helena of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her maternal grandparents were Prince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, and the Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain. The Dukes of Orl√©ans and Montpensier were siblings, both sons of Louis- Philippe I, King of the French, and Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies. Marriage and issue On 22 May 1886, Am√©lia married Carlos, Prince Royal of Portugal. He was the eldest son of King Lu√≠s I of Portugal and Maria Pia of Savoy. He was at the time the heir apparent to the throne. The bride was almost twenty-one years old and the groom about twenty-three. The marriage had been arranged by their families after several attempts to arrange a marriage for her with a member of the Austrian or Spanish dynasties. At first, the marriage was not popular and Queen Maria Pia was expecting to marry Carlos to Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, Princess Mathilde of Saxony, Princess Viktoria of Prussia or Princess Victoria of Wales. However, Am√©lia and Carlos came to live quite harmoniously with each other. They had three children: * Lu√≠s Filipe, Duke of Braganza (21 March 1887 ‚Äì 1 February 1908). * Infanta Maria Anna of Portugal (born and deceased on 14 December 1887). * Manuel II of Portugal (15 November 1889 ‚Äì 2 July 1932). Queen consort The Queen wearing the left Am√©lia played an active role as a queen, and somewhat softened the growing criticism towards the monarchy with her personal popularity, though she did receive some criticism for her expenses. She was active in many social projects, such as the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis and the foundation of charity organisations, sanatoriums and drugstores. She was considered less formal than her mother-in-law Maria Pia, learned Portuguese well and was described as calm and mild. She was interested in literature, opera and theatre, was a diarist and also painted. During the absence of her spouse in 1895, she acted as regent. In 1902, she made a cruise on the Mediterranean Sea that was much criticised for its luxury. In 1892, Pope Leo XIII gave a Golden Rose to Am√©lia. On 19 October 1889, King Lu√≠s died and Carlos succeeded him on the throne. Am√©lia became the new Queen consort of Portugal. However her husband became known for his extramarital affairs while the popularity of the Portuguese monarchy started to wane in the face of a bankrupt economy, industrial disturbances, socialist and republican antagonism and press criticism. Lisbon regicide Illustration of the Lisbon Regicide On 1 February 1908, the royal family returned from the palace of Vila Vi√ßosa to Lisbon. They travelled in the royal train to Barreiro and from there took a boat to cross the Tagus River. They disembarked at Cais das Colunas in the principal square of downtown Lisbon, the Terreiro do Pa√ßo. On their way to the Palace of Necessidades, the carriage carrying Carlos and his family passed through the Rua do Arsenal. While crossing the square and turning to the street, several shots were fired from the crowd by at least two men (Alfredo Lu√≠s da Costa and Manuel Bui√ßa), among others. The King died immediately, his heir Prince Dom Lu√≠s was mortally wounded and Infante Dom Manuel was hit in the arm, yet Queen Am√©lia was surprisingly unharmed after trying to defend her youngest son, the new king Manuel II, with the flower bouquet she kept in her hand. The two assassins were shot on the spot by members of the royal bodyguard and later were recognized as members of the Portuguese Republican Party and of their masonic left-wing organisation Carbon√°ria. About twenty minutes later, Prince Luis Filipe died and the next day Manuel was acclaimed King of Portugal, the last of the Braganza dynasty. Manuel II of Portugal was deposed by a military coup, later known as the 5 October 1910 revolution, which resulted in the establishment of the Portuguese First Republic. Queen Am√©lia left Portugal with the rest of the royal family and went into exile. She lived most of her remaining life in France. During World War II the Portuguese government invited her to return to Portugal, but she declined the offer. She visited Portugal for the last time in 1945.

Through the use of GPU-based volume rendering techniques it allows high frame rates on standard graphics hardware to support interactive volume exploration.  History  Voreen was initiated at the Department of Computer Science at the University of M√ºnster, Germany in 2004 and was first released on 11 April 2008 under the GNU general public license (GPL). Voreen is written in C++ utilizing the Qt framework and using the OpenGL rendering acceleration API, and is able to achieve high interactive frame rates on consumer graphics hardware. It is platform independent and compiles on Windows and Linux. The source code and documentation, and also pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Linux, are available from its website. Although it is intended and mostly used for medical applications, any other kind of volume data can be handled, e.g., microscopy, flow data or other simulations.  Concepts  The visualization environment VoreenVE based on that engine is designed for authoring and performing interactive visualizations of volumetric data. Different visualizations can be assembled in form of so-called networks via rapid prototyping, with each network consisting of several processors. Processors perform more or less specialized tasks for the entire rendering process, ranging from supplying data over raycasting, geometry creation and rendering to image processing. Within the limits of their respective purposes, the processors can be combined freely with each other, and thereby granting a great amount of flexibility and providing a uniform way of handling volume rendering. Authors who need to implement a certain rendering technique can confine their work basically on the development of new processors, whereas users who only want to access a certain visualization simply need to employ the appropriate processors or networks and do not need to care about technical details.  Features  Visualization * Direct volume rendering (DVR), isosurface rendering, maximum intensity projection (MIP) * Support of different illumination models (Phong reflection model, toon shading, ambient occlusion) * Large (out-of-core) data visualization (using an OpenCL octree raycaster) * Streamline-based vector field visualization * Multimodal volume rendering * Geometry rendering with support for order-independent transparency * Flexible combination of image processing operators (depth darkening, glow, chromadepth, edge detection) * Visualization of time-varying as well as segmented 3D datasets * Support for 1D and 2D transfer functions/CLUTs * Configurable views for building more complex applications (triple view/quad view/tabbed view/splitter) * Plotting Volume Processing * Isosurface extraction * Efficient basic 3D-image processing for very large (out-of-core) volumes * Very large volume analysis (connected components, vessel network analysis) * Interactive volume segmentation (random walker-based, vesselness filtering, basic thresholding) * Interactive volume registration (manual or landmark-based) Interaction * Configurable application mode for improving usability for domain experts * Axis aligned and arbitrarily aligned clipping planes * Editors for 1D and 2D transfer functions * Inspection of intermediate results * Distance measurements Data I/O * Support for several volume file formats (e.g. DICOM, TIFF stacks, HDF5, RAW) * High-resolution screenshot and camera animation generation with anti-aliasing * FFmpeg-based video export * Python scripting for offline image processing and visualization * Geometry in/export (e.g. for Additive Manufacturing)  See also  * Volume rendering * Volume ray casting  References   External links  * Voreen website Category:Free data visualization software Category:Free 3D graphics software Category:Free software programmed in C++ Category:3D imaging Category:Free DICOM software Category:Free bioimaging software Category:Science software that uses Qt Category:Science software for Linux ","title":"Voreen"},{"id":"26050711","text":"Xoser is a genus of moths belonging to the subfamily Tortricinae of the family Tortricidae.

Story Honest and diligent Police Inspector Amar (Dharmendra) is a middle-class man living in Bombay. In his attempt to arrest bandit Sher Singh (Amrish Puri), he and Inspector Dayal (Raza Murad) are attacked. Amar survives, but Dayal gets his legs crushed under a truck and is, as a result, unable to walk without a wheelchair. Subsequently, Amar arrests local politician Jagannath Prasad (Kader Khan), who gets released without being charged while Amar gets reprimanded, and decides to resign. Shortly thereafter, Sher Singh hijacks a bus and holds the passengers as hostages in exchange for 25 of his jailed associates. Dayal's granddaughter, Seema (Mandakini), is amongst them, and Dayal asks Amar for assistance. Amar, along with ex-convict, Qasim Ali (Shatrughan Sinha), and Karan (Karan Kapoor), a drug-dealer, manage to rescue them, but differences crop up among the trio and they part ways. Then Amar finds out that Qasim and Karan have masterminded a plan to facilitate the escape of the 25 convicts, and decides to confront them.

These concerts were broadcast by radio across the Soviet Union. At the age of 16, he left his hometown to study at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. There, his first teacher was the bass Mark Reizen, the second Georgian barytone and People's Artist of the Georgian SSR, David Gamrekeli. Immediately after having finished his studies, young Morozov received a contract as a leading baritone to the Kirov Opera (today's Mariinsky Theater) and changed two years later to the leading opera house of the Soviet Union: the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. Here he sang the great parts of Russian and Italian repertoire such as the title role in Eugene Onegin, Lionel in The Maid of Orleans (with Makvala Kasrashvili in the title role), Yeletzki in The Queen of Spades, Robert in Iolanta all by Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov's Misghir in The Snow Maiden (also recorded as CD), Andrey Bolkonsky in Prokofiev's War and Peace, Conte di Luna in Il trovatore, G√©rmont in La traviata, Rodrigo in Don Carlo all by Verdi, Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Silvio in Leoncavallos I Pagliacci (on DVD with Galina Kalinina and Vladimir Atlantov). Morozov also sang many rare and new operas like Rodion Shchedrin's Dead Souls: the main part of Chichikov. Morozov used to be a frequent partner in concerts of the soprano Elena Obraztsova on TV. In 1991 Igor Morozov was awarded by Boris Yeltsin with the highest title for artists in Russia, the title \\"Narodni Artist Rossii\\" (= People's Artist of the USSR) Since his very successful debut as Onegin at the Wiener Staatsoper, Igor Morozov has also been singing in many famous opera houses and festivals in Western Europe and the United States: Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Deutsche Oper Berlin and Staatsoper Unter den Linden Berlin, Staatsoper Hamburg, Cologne, Bayerische Staatsoper Munich, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Opernhaus Z√ºrich, Teatro Massimo Palermo, Bregenzer Festspiele, Salzburger Festspiele, Bostonmusic festival, Houston Grand Opera with conductors as Lorin Maazel, Anton Guadagno, Carlo Franci, Pinchas Steinberg and partners like Edita Gruberova, Vesselina Kasarova, Francisco Araiza, Giuseppe Giacomini, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Matti Salminen the leading roles in operas like Mazeppa (Tchaikovsky), Rigoletto, Nabucco, Simon Boccanegra all by Verdi, Kovaliov in Shostakovitch's The Nose. He has become a well known singer for different works of Shostakovitch (Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, Michelangelo Suite, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District). In Germany, Austria and Switzerland his name is usually spelled \\"Igor Morosow\\". Woody Allen chose his interpretation of \\"Iago's Dream\\" from Verdi's Otello for his film Match Point. Morozov is also very busy singing works by composers from Russia and the Ukraine that are little known out of their home country: Georgi Sviridov (among others: \\"My father is a farmer\\" recorded with the composer as pianist), Anton Rubinstein, Mikola Lysenko, Arthur Louri√©, Semyon Gulak-Artemovsky.

Lying on the Sandveld of the West Coast, the river runs past Eendekuil, Het Kruis, and Redelinghuys. The river mouth is located at Elands Bay. Its tributaries include the Hol River, Kruismans River and the Krom Antonies River. It falls within the Drainage system G and the Management Area. The river is the only known habitat of the endangered Verlorenvlei redfin. Around 30 km northwest of Redelinghuys, a marshy lake feeds the river. In the winter, it is kilometers long, and the water is concealed under the green reeds. In summer, the lake runs dry. 500 species of birds have been spotted here. The lake is popular with bird watchers and anglers alike. One of the country's few freshwater lakes by the coast, Verlorevlei Lake is an important breeding and feeding ground for pelicans, flamingoes, and other bird and fish species. Many species of plants are also found there. Cattle graze on the shores and water is pumped out for irrigation. Simon van der Stel visited in 1685 on his journey to Namaqualand, and he was under the impression that the river was a tributary of the Olifants River. Ensign Johannes Tobias Rhenius saw the lake as \\"lost\\" in the reeds in 1724, giving it its name (\\"verlore\\" is Afrikaans for \\"lost,\\" \\"vlei\\" for \\"lake\\").

Synopsis The 13 minute film Oblique (2008) is an articulation of identity in transition. The entire film was shot on a train moving through a continuous mass built from cities and their adjoining regions. The characters are traveling in the suspended generic space of the train through regions composite of old and new economies and old and new social realities: Newly built outer are√¶ around the cities, construction sites, institutional and office buildings, transitory places, between growth and collapse, marked by quasi-contradictory processes of economic progress and development of slums. On the train coach itself, a targeted but sometimes absurd narrative plays itself out as a linguistic reaction to the time and place. Urban environments, and their heterotopic sites, are locations for Knut √Ösdam's investigations into social design, patterns of behavior and modes of subjectivity, with a particular focus on spatial identity's disorder and pathologies. √Ösdam perceives a city as a machine of desire, its geography as a system of desire and its architecture as a generator of desiring practices. Usage and perception of public urban spaces, their structures of political power and authority occupy a central place in the artist's studies of identities.

Origins and history This grade II listed building was built in 1862‚Äì3 for Josslyn Francis Pennington, 5th Lord Muncaster, and it is thought that this was the third church built on this site. It was built in an imitation of a 13th-century Gothic style to the designs of the architects W.G. Habershon and A.R. Pite. The building is of ashlared stone with a tiled roof. It has a west tower with a broach spire, a five-bay nave with south porch, a short chancel with a polygonal apse, and a north vestry. The church was declared redundant in 1990 and is now maintained by the Yorkshire Wolds Heritage Centre. It was restored in 2006 with substantial grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and LEADER + East Riding. Help was also given by the Normandby Charitable Trust, the Gilbert Bayes Trust and the Hull and East Riding Charitable Trust. The church and its churchyard contain works by two of England‚Äôs most accomplished sculptors, Sir George Frampton and Gilbert Bayes, and has stained glass windows by Robert Anning Bell. The church stands on the site of a much larger priory church belonging to the medieval priory of Augustinian or Black Canons founded at Warter by Geoffrey Fitz Pain in 1132. Warter was not a wealthy priory but it did hold the lordships of Warter, Seaton Ross, Wheldrake, Preston in Holderness, Waxholme, Fraisthorpe and Auburn, the church at Lund and the hospital of St Giles at Beverley, all in the East Riding, as well as the churches of Barton and Askham in Westmorland. When the priory was suppressed in August 1536 there were 12 canons. Two of them, the sub-prior and the kitchener, attempted to re- establish the monastery following the great rising against the government of Henry VIII of England, known as the ‚ÄúPilgrimage of Grace‚Äù. For this they were arrested and executed as traitors at York in February 1537. In the late 17th century the priory estate was acquired by the Pennington family of Muncaster Castle in Cumberland, who built Warter Hall, subsequently Warter Priory, which stood a mile to the south-west of the village. Following a government report which was most critical of the run-down state of the village, the Penningtons, now the Lords Muncaster, began rebuilding the village and this rebuilding was continued by Charles Henry Wilson, a wealthy Hull shipowner and Liberal MP who had purchased the estate in 1878. Wilson was created Lord Nunburnholme in 1906 and died the following year. From 1907 to 1929 the village, as part of the estate, was controlled by the Dowager Lady Nunburnholme. In 1929 the estate was purchased by George Vestey and then in 1968 by the Marquis of Normanby. Warter Priory was demolished in 1972 and in 1998 the estate was purchased by Malcolm Healey. Warter has several notable buildings including a row of thatched cottages and Manor House Farm built in 1732 using stone from the demolished medieval priory. Church interior Robert Anning Bell‚Äôs stained- glass window in memory of Gerald Valerian Wilson There are works in the church by Sir George Frampton and Robert Anning Bell. Frampton created a marble monument to Lady Isabel Wilson, who was the daughter of the 7th Duke of Roxburghe and the wife of Guy Greville Wilson. She died in childbirth in 1905, at the age of 26. Frampton was also the sculptor of the monument to Charles Henry Wilson who became 1st Lord Nunburnholme. In the monument there are references to the Wilson shipping firm. There is also a small plaque by Frampton dedicated to Gerald Valerian Wilson. There are stained-glass windows designed by Robert Anning Bell, one depicting Lord and Lady Nunburnholme with a border of sailing ships and the arms of the city of Kingston upon Hull and the other dedicated to Gerald Valerian Wilson, the Nunburnholmes' son who died at the age of 23 in 1908. There are also several monuments and inscriptions in the church to members of the Pennington family. In 2011, two stained glass lunette windows by Robert Anning Bell, which had been in storage since 1966, were placed in the nave of the church following restoration. They had originally been in a mausoleum built in the churchyard to house the remains of Lady Isabel Wilson, which also contained her marble effigy. One of the windows depicts Lady Isabel and her dead baby being carried to heaven by six angels watched by her husband. The other window depicts the personifications of Lady Isabel's virtues ‚Äì Courage, Hope and \\"Love to the Death\\" ‚Äì surrounded by child-angel musicians. Churchyard Gilbert Bayes' bronze monument in remembrance of Gerald Valerian Wilson On the north side of the churchyard is the private burial ground of the Wilson family, the Lords Nunburnholme. There are two signed bronze sculptures by Gilbert Bayes, a pupil of Sir George Frampton and a key figure in the \\"New Sculpture Movement\\". One, commemorating the 1st Lord Nunburnholme who died in 1907, is in the form of the figure of Victory with a laurel wreath, while the other, nearer the church, is in memory of his youngest son, Gerald Valerian Wilson. It represents a standing angel, with a nimbus, reading the Book of John. The smaller details of these memorials were stolen many years ago. The two sculptures originally stood in the Italian Garden of Warter Priory and were moved to St James' in 1929. They stand near a table-top tomb to the 2nd Lord Nunburnholme and a grave slab to Edith, Countess of Chesterfield, daughter of the 1st Lord Nunburnholme. A classical mausoleum was added to the side of the church to contain Sir George Frampton‚Äôs memorial to Lady Isabel Wilson, the wife of Guy Greville Wilson, who died in 1905. It was demolished in 1966 and the memorial moved inside the church. Its site is now marked by a grass-covered mound. A brief glimpse of the mausoleum may be seen in the Yorkshire Film Archive film \\"The East Riding\\" at 04.29 (YFA 1414). The remainder of the churchyard is being conserved as a wildlife habitat.

She was also the first non-Soviet ship to transit the Northern Sea Route. History Uikku, built in 1977 by Werft Nobiskrug GmbH in Rendsburg, Germany, was the last ship of a series of four arctic product tankers ordered by a Finnish oil and petroleum products company Neste Oyj in the 1970s. The ships were given names after Finnish seabirds and the silhouettes of their namesake birds were painted on the side of the ships' superstructure. Lunni (Atlantic puffin) and Sotka (Aythya) were delivered in 1976 and Tiira (tern) and Uikku (grebe) in the following year. Until the 1990s the ships were used mainly to transport oil products in the Baltic Sea. In 1993 Uikku was chartered to a newly founded Arctic Shipping Services to ship petroleum products in the Arctic Ocean. The new shipping company, based in Murmansk, was a joint operation between two Russian companies, Murmansk Shipping Company and Primorsk Shipping Company, and a Finnish company Nemarc Shipping Oy, which in turn was a joint venture shipping company owned by Neste and Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards. The ship's propulsion machinery was modernized for navigation in the harsh ice conditions of the Arctic Ocean in 1993 and her ice-strengthening was increased in 1998.Final public report of the ARCDEV project, Transport Research Knowledge Centre.H√§nninen, S: Ship based observations onboard MT Uikku during the winter 2003 , 11/2003. In the following years Uikku operated in the Baltic Sea in winter and in the Northern Sea Route during summer months.Juurmaa, K et al.: New ice breaking tanker concept for the arctic (DAT) . Kvaerner Masa-Yards, 1995. In 1997 Uikku became the first merchant ship under non-Soviet flag to navigate the entire Northern Sea Route. In the following year she took part in Arctic Demonstration and Exploratory Voyage (ARCDEV), a research project funded by the European Union to determine the feasibility of year-around navigation in the Northern Sea Route. Uikku, accompanied by a Russian nuclear- powered icebreaker NS Rossiya to open the way and a research icebreaker Kapitan Dranitsyn to provide facilities to 70 researchers from different countries, carried a cargo of gas condensate from Ob river estuary to Europe.Arctic Demonstration and Exploratory Voyage, Projects & Analysis, Transport Research Knowledge Centre. Fortum sold Uikku, mainly due to her age exceeding 25 years, to Murmansk Shipping Company in 2003. She was renamed Varzuga (–í–∞—Ä–∑—É–≥–∞) after the Varzuga River. As Fortum is a state-owned company, the selling of two oil tankers capable of navigating in severe ice conditions resulted in a written question to the Parliament of Finland by Representative Pentti Tiusanen about whether the ships should be retained in Finnish control as they could be used to lighten a grounded oil tanker in harsh winter conditions.KK 137/2003 vp, Pentti Tiusanen /vas The ship has since been used for oil transportation in the Arctic Ocean. Along with her sister ship Indiga (ex-Lunni), sold to Russians at the same time, she has been involved in transporting oil from an oil terminal in the Ob Bay of the Kara Sea through the Kara Gates, the strait between Vaygach and Novaya Zemlya, to FSO Belokamenka in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea.Bambulyak, A and Frantzen, B: Oil transport from the Russian part of the Barents Region, Status per January 2009, page 41. Retrieved on 2010-02-05. Incidents On 19 July 2010 Varzuga collided with her sister ship Indiga while being assisted by two nuclear icebreakers in difficult ice conditions. The bow of Varzuga and the stern of Indiga were damaged, but neither vessel lost seaworthiness and there were no spills.Arctic oil tankers collided . BarentsObserver, 2010-07-19. Design Uikku and her sister ships were designed to be able to navigate in the ice conditions of the Baltic Sea independently without icebreaker assistance and maintain a moderately high speed in ice. For this purpose they had more power than an average Baltic tanker and were normally required to use only 50-75% of the full engine power in ice ‚Äî in normal operation only one of the two main engines was coupled to shaft, with the other remaining in reserve for difficult ice conditions.Gallin, I. et al. Ships and Their Propulsion Systems - Developmentsr in Power Transmission. Lohmann & Stolterfoht GmbH, Witten, West Germany. . The highly raked stem, similar to those in traditional icebreakers, was designed to break the ice by bending it downwards under the ship's weight. The ships were also equipped with an air bubbling system to reduce friction between the hull and ice.Mulherin, N et al.: Development and Results of a Northern Sea Route Transit Model, pp. 15-17. Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), 1996. Retrieved on 2010-02-05. To prevent pollution in case of grounding the ships were also built with double hulls and conformed to the IMCO regulations in respect of segregated ballast tanks even though they were regarded only recommendations back then. Modernization Uikku was extensively modernized by Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards' Helsinki New Shipyard in 1993 and became the first merchant ship to receive a newly developed electronic azimuth thruster, Azipod. Before her retrofitting the only ship equipped with such propulsion was fairway maintenance vessel Seili owned by the Finnish Maritime Administration. Her original MaK 12M551AK main engines (2 √ó 5737 kW), reduction gearbox, shaft generators, controllable- pitch propeller and rudder were removed and replaced with W√§rtsil√§ Vasa marine generating sets and an 11.4 MW electric propulsion unit. Being one of the early designs the Azipod unit in Uikku was of the so-called \\"pushing\\" type with an aft-facing propeller instead of the more efficient \\"pulling\\" set-up usually used in modern Azipod-equipped ships.Photograph of Lunni 's Azipod unit , Aker Arctic Technology Inc. Upgrading the propulsion machinery dramatically improved her manoeuvering and icebreaking capabilities, especially when running astern. Even though the ship's stern wasn't originally designed or shaped for icebreaking, ice resistance astern in level ice was only 40% of that of when running ahead despite the icebreaking bow. The modernization of Uikku also further proved the feasibility of Azipod in icebreaking ships and the double acting tanker (DAT) concept as navigation in the severe ice conditions in the Northern Sea Route sometimes required the ship to be turned around and run astern to break through ice. The refit also increased her speed from 14.5 to 17 knots despite the propulsion power remaining roughly the same. Uikkus sister ship, Lunni, was similarly modernized in the following year. In 1998 the ice-strengthening of Uikku was upgraded and increased for the severe ice conditions in the Arctic Ocean, making her hull strength exceed the demands for Finnish-Swedish ice class 1A Super. The hull was also instrumented with strain gauges for the ARCDEV research voyage.

In 1897 a summer theatre was initiated in Bad Aussee, with Jarno as its first director. Two years later he gave up the job and moved to Vienna to take over as the leader of the Theater in der Josefstadt. In Vienna, Jarno could carry out his ideas about modern drama. He brought plays by Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Arthur Schnitzler and George Bernard Shaw onto the stage. Jarno worked in Vienna until 1923. During this time, he married the actress Johanna Niese. The German-language premiere of Ferenc Moln√°r's suburban legend Liliom (1913) featured Jarno in the title role and made the play a worldwide success. In 1905, Jarno bought the F√ºrst-Theater and lead it in parallel with the Theater in der Josefstadt. In 1926 he assumed leadership of the Renaissance-B√ºhne theatre in Vienna.

Only one was constructed and was flown by Philip Wills at competitions in Europe between 1935-7. Development The sole Buxton Hjordis was a high-performance sailplane designed by G.M \\"Mungo\\" Buxton and built in 1935 by Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd. It was a single-seater of all-wood construction. Its straight-tapered, cantilever wing was pedestal-mounted and was without flaps or airbrakes. The fuselage was circular in cross section with the cockpit immediately in front of the wing leading edge and a wheel-less, single-skid main undercarriage. Aft, the fuselage tapered to carry a very small triangular fin, on which was mounted a much taller, wide chord rudder of rounded triangular shape and with a vertical leading edge. The horizontal tail was small and essentially all elevator apart from a leading-edge hinge. Buxton began the design of a development, the Hjordis 2 which was completed and built by Slingsby Aviation as the King Kite. Operational history The Hjordis first flew on 27 June 1935. It had been designed and built for the well-known British glider pilot, Philip Wills, and he flew it at the British National Gliding Competitions at Sutton Bank in September 1935.Flight 12 September 1935 p.297-8 He also flew it at the International Competition held between 14-47 July 1937 at the Wasserkuppe, Germany.Flight 15 August 1937 p.81 At that time it was registered as G-GAAA. The following year it went to South Africa as ZS-23. The name Hjordis is a character in Norse mythology, the mother of Sigurd/Siegfried.

Thus a supra- regional association which surpassed the existing secessions came into existence for the first time. Its founders were determined to get rid of the restrictions imposed by the national cultural authorities. Their aim was to ensure the freedom of art, to offer a public forum for different artistic trends and to support young artists. These intentions were taken into account at annual exhibitions which took place in various German cities and sometimes in foreign countries.  History  The Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund organized first exhibition on June 1 to October 31, 1904 and the second on May 2 to October 6, 1905, inaugurating at the same time its showrooms in the new exhibition building, \\"an extensive general view of the existing modern forces in Germany\\", as a contemporary reviewer put it. In 1936 the exhibition in Hamburg was closed by the National Socialists and the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund was closed at the same time. Until then the general public had been offered a remarkable spectrum of 20 exhibitions on a high artistic level. Nearly all German artists who occupied a high rank in the artistic world within the first three decades of the last century were members of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund and they made use of the platform to display their artistic ideas undisturbed by any governmental interference. The boost and the breakthrough of modern art is closely connected to the history of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. In 1905, Max Klinger acquired the Villa Romana in Florence on behalf of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund as a place for cultural exchange which testifies to the high politico-cultural commitment of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. In 1950, some former members of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund ‚Äì Karl Hofer, Willi Baumeister, Karl Hartung and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff ‚Äì re-established the group. They picked up the thread of the interrupted tradition of modern art, remembered the resolutions of the founding years and advocated again the freedom of art. They influenced the cultural and political life of post-war Germany by resuming the annual exhibitions and by taking numerous political initiatives. And this holds true today, too. The Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund is a member of various institutions which support artists, fight for copyrights and social security such as Kunstfonds, Verwertungsgesellschaft Bild-Kunst, Privatinitiative Kunst, Internationale Gesellschaft f√ºr Bildende Kunst (IGBK), and the section Fine Arts in Deutscher Kulturrat. Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund is sustaining member of the Villa Romana in Florence. Already in 1974 a fee for the artists taking part in exhibitions was introduced. At the suggestion of its chairman at that time, Georg Meistermann, the Collection of the Federal Republic of Germany was founded which supports artist and helps to bring art within the reach of the public. A first extensive exhibition took place in the Multihalle Mannheim 1976 based on new founding structure. In the course of the discussion on the establishment of the German national foundation, the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund organized a colloquium, as a result of which the \\"Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle des Bundes\\" was conceived and realized. The extensive annual exhibitions have offered many artists a podium and we must not forget that it was the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund which was the first institution to show works of art of artist from the German Democratic Republic in 1990. In 2003 the Association of German Artists celebrated its 100th anniversary as one of the oldest and most renowned associations of artists in Europe. Today about 600 visual artist are members of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund which makes it unique in its composition and in the important role it plays in the dialogue between artists and the public. By cooperating in governmental committees, boards of curators and panels which play an advisory role in the debating of bills, the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund looks after the interests of many artists in Germany. Just to name two, it is represented in the Sachverst√§ndigenkreis f√ºr Kunst am Bau of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs and in the Bundesakademie f√ºr kulturelle Bildung Wolfenb√ºttel. Besides the commitment to current politico-cultural debates there is above all the keen interest in our members‚Äô works of art and in the mutual exchange of ideas in studio talks and discussions. Numerous events in our project room initiated in 2001 bear witness to this priority. Both members and international guests are invited to contribute to these events. The Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund also arranges exhibitions, symposia and colloquia on a national basis. Conceptions, ideas and means of expression undergo perpetual changes in the world of art. The huge variety implies traditional sculptural works, paintings as well as context-related works and action-based art which stimulates and accompanies communication. Male and female artist tackle current problems with a lot of creativity. They contribute to the framing of social change and its consequences.

Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 489. Geography Drama is a semi-clustered village in a level area near the right bank of the Krka River that is subject to seasonal flooding. Towards the north, toward the river, there are wet meadows and tilled fields in an area known as Kljuƒçi. The area to the west known as Brod (literally, 'ford') is reminiscent of the ford that existed here before the bridge was built in 1910. The grassy areas south of Brod are known as Mihovica and Roje. East of Drama there are fields and the Kozarje meadows, where there are intermittent springs that feed Curek Creek. History The hamlet of Otok (literally, 'island') was formerly an island in the Krka River until its course was regulated, and traces of the old river channel can still be seen. In the first century AD, a Roman fortification stood at the site, along the road from Emona to Neviodunum. There are remains of a moat in Drama that controlled access to Otok from the south. In the 9th century AD, the area came under Croatian control, and was then controlled by the Dra≈°kovec family, which had its castle in Mihovica as lesser nobles subordinate to the lords of Vi≈°nja Gora. This was followed by a succession of owners, including the Andechs, Babenberg, and Spanheim families, Ottokar II of Bohemia, and the Habsburgs. A treaty of 1074 with the Patriarchate of Aquileia indicates that the Bishopric of Freising founded a parish here, which was transferred to ≈†kocjan in 1492. Along with Klevev≈æ and Pre≈æek, Otok was one of three major properties of the Bishops of Freising in Lower Carniola.Kos, Milko, & Pavle Blaznik. 1963. Srednjeve≈°ki urbarji za Slovenijo: Urbarji freisin≈°ke ≈°kofije. Ljubljana: SAZU, p. 72. It was mentioned as a market in 1251, a judge was mentioned in 1254, a court was established in 1257, a castle mentioned in 1261, and a toll station in 1301. Coins minted there between 1200 and 1240 bore the name Gutenwerth. Otok suffered under Croatian and Hungarian attacks, and latter Ottoman raids. It was plundered by Ottoman forces in 1469, and then destroyed and burned in 1473, from which it never recovered.Zadnikar, Marijan. 1982. Romanika v Sloveniji: tipologija in morfologija sakralne arhitekture. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 227. The Bishops of Freising moved their offices to nearby Hrva≈°ki Brod, also transferring the name Gutenwerth to the new location. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Drama served as a river port for the surrounding countryside until the road from Novo Mesto to Sisak was built at the end of the 18th century. A road linking Dobrava pri ≈†kocjanu to ≈†entjernej was built past the village in 1968.

Ford claims that it weighs less and costs less than double wishbone and multi-link suspension arrangement. The kingpin offset compares favorably to that of double wishbone suspensions (20-30mm vs 40mm). The main advantage of RevoKnuckle compared to MacPherson struts is the reduction in torque steer, especially for high powered front-wheel drive (FWD) applications.
