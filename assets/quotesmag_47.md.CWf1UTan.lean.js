It was constructed as a Jesuit novitiate in the early 18th century. After the expulsion of the Jesuits from Brazil in 1759 the complex became an orphanage. The now complex now consists of a secondary school, chapel, and orphanage. One of its corridors extends south towards the Casa Nobre de Jequitaia. It was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938 and is part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. Location Casa Pia is located north of the Historic Center of Salvador. The complex was originally located directly on the Bay of All Saints, but its waterfront location was lost due to successive landfill projects and commercial development. The complex now sits behind a small square on Avenida Jequitaia; the square also functions as a parking lot. The complex sits at the base of a hilly area, which still has some vegetation, that leads to the interior of the Itapagipe Peninsula. History Construction on Casa Pia and College of the Orphans of Saint Joachim began in the early 18th century by the Society of Jesus. Domingos Afonso Sut√£o, a wealthy bandeirante, donated land to the Jesuits, who built a novitiate on the site in 1704 called the Noviciado da Anunciada da Jequitaia. A college, chapel, and water catchment facility on the slope were constructed starting in 1709; a Frenchman, Charles Bellaville, designed the complex. The complex developed around a large square cloister on two floors. Casa Pia served as a gathering point for 124 Jesuits leaving Bahia in 1760 as part of the expulsion of the Jesuits from Brazil. The novitiate became the property of the state in the same year. Conde de Palma, governor of Bahia, petitioned John VI of Portugal in 1818 to donate the building for the construction of an orphanage. The building was significantly altered in this period. A wall was built to protect the building from the sea, which reached the site at the time. A mortuary chapel was added. Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus (1758-1847) completed a painting on the ceiling of the chapel in 1826 depicting the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. The water catchment of the Jesuits were converted into bathrooms of the orphanage. Structure Casa Pia and College of the Orphans of Saint Joachim have numerous features of Jesuit architecture of Bahia of the 18th century. The chapel consists of a single nave. Construction of the building is in stone masonry with staircase and various elements of lioz stone from Portugal. Unusually, it occupies one side of the cloister, with the axis of the nave parallel to the main facade. Two towers top Roman facade with classic pediment flanked by volutes. It once had corridors; they were replaced by the gallery of the cloister (gallery and overlapping tribunes). The chapel has a three arches, superimposed by grandstands instead of choirs. Separately, the plan and facade are modeled on the parish (matriz) and brotherhood churches of the early eighteenth century. Protected status Casa Pia and College of the Orphans of Saint Joachim was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. Both the structure and its contents were included in the IPHAN directive under inscription number 227. Access Casa Pia and College of the Orphans of Saint Joachim is not open to the public and may be visited only with permission.

He was a pioneer in the field of underwater photography. The son of , he was born in Versailles and studied biology and natural history at the University of Paris. In 1880, he was named deputy head assigned to organize the French exhibit at the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880). He stayed in Australia for 18 months, travelling the continent and identifying new animal species. In 1886, Boutan was named ma√Ætre de conf√©rences at the University of Lille. In the same year, he learned how to dive. In 1893, he was named professor at the Laboratoire Arago. During that year, with his brother , he developed equipment for underwater photography. In an article in The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, he described his apparatus; the article included an illustration of one of his cameras and several underwater images. Boutan developed a flash bulb that could be used underwater. He later used carbon arc lights for illumination. In 1898, he published the first book on underwater photography La Photographie sous-marine et les progr√®s de la photographie. Slides of his underwater photographs were shown at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1904, he was sent to Hanoi to investigate improvements to rice and the culture of pearl oysters. He returned to France in 1908. In 1910, he was named professor of zoology and animal physiology at the University of Bordeaux. In 1914 and 1916, Boutan and his brother worked on a diving suit for the French army. After the war, he began research into the artificial production of pearls, one of the first people to investigate this subject. In 1921, he was named director of the Station Biologique d'Arcachon. In 1924, he was named to the chair of general zoology of the faculty of science at the University of Algiers; he was also named director of the Station d‚ÄôAquaculture et de P√™ches de Castiglione and inspector for the Algerian fisheries. In 1929, he retired to Tigzirt in Algeria. He died there at the age of 75. Boutan was named to the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame as an early pioneer in 2010.

Jurisdiction In Louisiana, security companies are required to be licensed by the board. The board regulates a wide range of requirements for security companies, ranging from training and uniform standards to insurance and bonding benchmarks. The board's jurisdiction comes from state law: L.R.S. 37:3270 through 3299, Private Contract Security Companies and Rules. The legal jurisdiction, requirements, and rules of the board and its applicants is derived from Title 46: PROFESSIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS, Part LIX: Private Security Examiners.http://lsbpse.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/04/LAC-46v59-Part-LIX.pdf The purpose of the laws regulating private security contractors, according to the state legislature, is to \\"require qualifying criteria in a professional field in which unqualified individuals may injure the public. The requirements of this Chapter [of the law] will contribute to the safety, health, and welfare of the people of Louisiana.\\"http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=94025 In order for a person to be eligible for a license from the board to operate a private security company within Louisiana, the person must have at least three years of consecutive experience as an employee, manager, or owner of a security company, or three years of experience as a law enforcement officer with any federal, state, local, or United States military law enforcement agency. Enforcement Up until 2011, former New Orleans Police (NOPD) Assistant Superintendent Marion Defillo developed a lucrative gig at NOPD overseeing film-set details. After his \\"contentious departure from the department\\" in 2011, Defillo created a private consulting business. He took most of the film- detail work with him. While he was at the NOPD, he created a policy that made him the sole contact person and coordinator for film sets in New Orleans. In 2007, for example, he earned over $107,000 from film work. The Louisiana State Board of Private Security Examiners opened an investigation in February 2012 following a Times-Picayune article that reported that Defillo's private consulting company, called Crescent City Consulting LLC, was offering security-related services on film sets. The board pulled Defillo's license, but he said he would ignore it. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Houston Chronicle wrote, \\"As federal troops and rescuers struggled to get to New Orleans and other ravaged Gulf Coast areas last week, convoys of private security and risk consulting firms, many made up of ex-military and former law enforcement officers, quickly arrived on the scene.\\" Before Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana had around 185 private security companies licensed by the board. Within a short period of time after the hurricane, 33 more companies had registered. Board appointments and requirements The Louisiana State Board of Private Security Examiners is an agency of the state government in the Department of Public Safety and Corrections. The board is made up of nine members appointed by the Louisiana governor. Louisiana law created five public service commission districts within the state, and one member that resides in each of the districts can be appointed. The other four members are appointed at-large in the state. Commissioners must be at least 30 years old and must have worked in the private security business for at least 5 years. American citizenship is also required. At least one of the at-large board members must be a representative of a \\"nationally operated security company.\\" Fabian Blache In the spring of 2018 the board placed Fabian Blache, the CEO and executive director of the board, and his assistant on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation related to his efforts to shut down a security company. The security company, Delta Tactical, was accused of \\"acting like cops.\\" Delta Tactical was hired by bars to patrol their parking lots. Blache is a former New York Police Department officer and former investigator for the Louisiana Attorney General's office. He was hired as the executive director in 2016. He has said that some of his actions as director have been unpopular because, according to The Advocate, \\"his goal is to clean up the private security industry, making sure companies are following the rules and displaying an adequate degree of professionalism.\\" Nick Fetty, the owner of Delta Tactical, filmed a discussion with Blache in December 2017 using a body camera. During the discussion, Blache asserted his authority as the director of the board and issued a warning to Fetty. Blache told Fetty, \\"You don't run this show.\\" He further threatened Fetty and his company's license to operate in Louisiana, saying, \\"That's just not cool. Besides the fact it won't be tolerated because I'll just C&D; [cease and desist] you Monday and we can end it. > \\"A secretly recorded video of the Louisiana Board of Private Security > Examiner's CEO and Executive Director, Fabian Blache, shows him making it > clear who's the boss.\\" At the end of April 2018, the board voted to take Blache off of administrative leave  \\"surviving a move to oust him.\\" The vote for giving Blache his job back came down to a 4 to 4 vote, but the chair broke the tie, pushing it to 5 to 4 to give Blache his job back. According to Baton Rouge CBS TV station WAFB, \\"A fiery, contentious meeting took place Monday morning specifically to address the issue.\\" Investigations of the board Blache and his executive assistant, Bridgette Hull, had been on paid administrative leave for a month since March 29. Both have been the subject of a series of WAFB News investigations after some of the board's employees sent an anonymous letter to the board chair, alleging a hostile work environment and saying that morale was at an all-time low. Following the letter, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) launched an investigation into the state board and looked into 13 complaints of sexual harassment, race discrimination, unprofessional behavior, sexually suggestive gestures, and failure to fill out time sheets and allocate vacation days. The EEOC investigators substantiated some of the complaints while dismissing some the others. One of the allegations that the EEOC investigated regarded the conduct of Blache and his assistant, Bridgette Hull. \\"Another allegation by a fellow employee was that when Blache is in his office \\"Hull will come in and sit on his knee\\" or \\"sit on the arm of the chair or desk\\" and give and receive \\"back massages.\\" While Blache denies any of that happened, EEOC investigators say \\"Hull admitted Mr. Blache massaged her neck, she sat on the corner of his desk at meetings, and draped her feet over the side of chair.\\"\\" The investigation has led to some groups, such as the Institute for Justice, asking questions about the regulation of workers in Louisiana. Lee McGrath, the legislative counsel for the Institute for Justice, a \\"free-market solution\\" organization, said that \\"the face that all members of the board are also owners of private security companies is concerning.\\" References External links *Official Website *Executive Protection Company *L.R.S. 37:3270 through 3299, Private Contract Security Companies and Rules Category:Private security industry ","title":"Louisiana State Board of Private Security Examiners"},{"id":"57316813","text":"Tectosternum is a genus of water scavenger beetles in the family Hydrophilidae.

For doing so Osipova and her co-conspirators were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 October 1943.  Early life  Osipova was born to a Belarusian peasant family in Serkavitsy, in the Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire. She started working at a glass factory at the age of 13 and was the chairman of her young pioneer chapter. In 1924 she met her husband, Yakov Osipov, while she was delegate to the 6th Komsomol Congress. Later she married and changed her surname from Sokovtsova to Osipova. In 1928 she became a member of the Communist Party and graduated from the Agricultural School of Minsk in 1935. She then went on to attend law school, which she graduated from in 1940 before serving at the Supreme Court of the Belarussian SSR. She left her job at the Supreme Court to work as an assistant at a law practice in May 1941, just a few weeks before the start of the war.  World War II  = Early resistance activities = Shortly after German forces took over Minsk, Osipova worked with a teacher at the law school where she had previously studied to organize a resistance movement that would be headquartered at the school. The partisan group started off with 14 members, but by 1943 the organization had 50 active members. Initially the organization printed anti-Axis leaflets, provided hiding for the city's Jews facing persecution, and helped Soviet prisoners of war escape from German custody. After the group contacted a partisan detachment in 1941, the organization began conducting reconnaissance and sabotage missions against the German military. By late 1941 the group was in communication with the Communist Party of Byelorussia. Since then, Osipova served as the communication liaison between her unit and several other partisan units including the \\"Dima\\" unit commanded by D. Keimakh, the \\"Mestnyye\\" unit commanded S. Vaupshasov, the \\"Dyadi Koli\\" brigade commanded by N. Nikitin, the \\"Zheleznyak\\" brigade commanded by I. Titkov, and the \\"200th\\" unit named in honor of K. Rokosovsky. She also wrote for the underground newspaper \\"Zvezda\\" that was circulated throughout German-occupied Minsk. The partisans sheltered prisoners of war and Jewish refugees in their attics. On sabotage operations the partisans would steal weapons and medicine from the German military, stockpile them, and provide them to other partisans and refugees as needed. Osipova's pseudonym was Chernaya. = Assassination of Wilhelm Kube = Osipova's best known accomplishment as a partisan was the assassination of high-ranking SS official and General-Kommissar of Nazi-occupied Belarus Wilhelm Kube, who oversaw the Minsk Ghetto. In late 1941 the deputy commander of the \\"Dima\\" unit tasked Nadezhda Troyan with finding someone who worked inside Kube's house and would be willing to assist in a plot to kill him. Valentina Shchutskoi, who was the sister of Yelena Mazanik, suggested that Mazanik, who worked in Kube's mansion as a maid, would be suitable for the task. Troyan took a while to gain the trust of Mazanik, who was very afraid of betrayal, but after her sister Valentina confirmed the identity of Osipova for her she agreed to try to kill Kube. After explaining the plot and discussing the best methods to do it, it was decided to plant a bomb under Kube's bed. Before Mazanik placed the bomb, Osipova and Troyan left Minsk for the forest controlled by partisans, along with their families and most of Mazanik's family. Osipova gave Mazanik a small magnetic mine which she carried in her purse, having obtained the mine from a partisan unit. The assassination went as planned and after Kube was killed, she, Mazanik, and Troyan were declared Heroes of the Soviet Union.  Later life  After the end of the war Osipova returned to Minsk to participate in the reconstruction of the war-torn city. She later worked in the office of Vasily Kozlov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Belarussian SSR, and from 1947 to 1963 she was a deputy in the Supreme Soviet of the Belarussian SSR. She had also headed the pardon department of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of Belarus and worked to get many members of the Minsk resistance rehabilitated after myths spread that the Minsk resistance was engaged in collaboration with the Nazis. She passed away at the age of 90 on 5 February 1999 and was buried in the Eastern Cemetery of Minsk.

T. C.; April 24, 1849‚Äì?) was an American journalist and poet. Early years Helen Taggart was born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, April 24, 1849. She was the oldest of three children of the Col. David Taggart and Annie Pleasants (Cowden) Taggart. There were three siblings, John C., Hanna C. H., and James. She was educated in the Friends' Central School, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In October, 1869, she made a six months' stay in Charleston, South Carolina to make a visit to her father, then stationed in that city as paymaster in the United States army. Career In 1870, she married Rev. David Henry Clark, a Unitarian minister settled over the church in Northumberland. Four years later, they removed to New Milford, Pennsylvania, to take charge of a Free Religious Society there. In 1875. Rev. Clark was called to the Free Congregational Society in Florence, Massachusetts. Attention was first drawn to \\"H. T. C .\\", by which some of her earlier work was signed, in 1880, by her occasional poems in the Boston Index, of which her husband was for a time assistant editor, and in the Springfield, Republican. Her life, as she put it, had been one of intellectual aspirations and clamorous dish-washing and bread-winning. Clark left Florence, Massachusetts in 1884, returning to her father's house in Northumberland with her youngest child, an only daughter, her two older children being boys. There, for two years, she was a teacher in the high school, varying her duties by teaching music and German outside of school hours, story and verse writing, and leading a Shakespeare class. In August, 1887, she accepted a position in the Good Cheer office, Greenfield, Massachusetts, till she was recalled to Northumberland the following February by the illness of her father. He died a little later, after which time Clark has made her home in her native town. Clark has a large circle of friends, and her social duties took up much of her time, but she made time write a weekly column for the Sudbury, Massachusetts News, to perform the duties pertaining to her office as secretary of the Woman's Relief Corps in her town, to lead a young people's literary society, and to contribute stories and poems to Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, the Christian Union, the Woman's Journal, and the Springfield Republican. Her Verses was published in 1891 in Philadelphia by Lippincott. Personal life The Clark's had at least one child, a son, John. By 1911, she was living in Brooklyn, New York.

The airport has no IATA or ICAO designation. The airport is used solely for general aviation purposes. Aero Country previously used the FAA LID of TX05 until at least July 1997. The FAA LID of T31 was previously used for Port Isabel-Cameron County Airport in Port Isabel, Texas until at least July 1992.  Facilities  Aero Country Airport covers at an elevation of above mean sea level and has one runway: * Runway 17/35: 4,352 x 60 ft. (1,326 x 18 m), Surface: Asphalt/Turf For the year ending December 31, 2015, the airport had 9,000 aircraft operations, averaging 25 per day: 100% general aviation. 244 aircraft were then based at this airport: 90% single-engine, 7% multi-engine, 2% helicopters, and 1% gliders.  Accidents and incidents  * 2 April 1983: Three passengers disembarked from a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, registration number N927BA, while the engines were still running, despite having been instructed by the aircrew prior to the flight not to exit until the engines were shut down. One passenger walked into the rotating left-hand propeller and suffered a fatal head injury; the other passengers were not injured. The accident was attributed to inadequate verbal instructions and supervision of the passengers by the pilot in command, and to the failure of the passengers to understand the pilot's instructions. A contributing factor was unsafe actions by the passengers. * 19 July 1997: A Rans S-9, registration number N1678N, lost engine power after a high-speed pass over the runway. The pilot attempted to turn back and land, but the craft stalled and went into a spin during the \\"very tight\\" 180¬∞ turn. The S-9 impacted the ground in a near-vertical attitude, killing the pilot and sole occupant. The accident was attributed to \\"loss of engine power for undetermined reason(s), and failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering for a forced landing, which resulted in a stall and collision with the terrain.\\" * 9 January 2001: A Nord 1101 Noralpha, registration number N208BF, lost engine power on takeoff and was badly damaged in a subsequent off-airport forced landing, seriously injuring the pilot; the single passenger suffered no injuries. The aft throttle linkage assembly's push/pull rod was found separated from the support bushing. The accident was attributed to \\"the loss of engine power during takeoff resulting from the inadequate engagement of the throttle torque tube rod end into the support bushing by unknown maintenance personnel.\\" * 31 December 2016: A Piper PA-28R-200 Arrow, registration number N4407T, and a Luscombe 8A, registration number N2889K, collided in mid-air in the airfield traffic pattern approximately 1/2 mi (0.8 km) east of the airport. The Piper crashed into a storage facility, starting a substantial fire that damaged a stored boat; the blaze thwarted bystanders' attempts to rescue the pilot, who was killed. The collision severed the empennage of the Luscombe, which then crashed in the southbound lanes of Custer Road near Virginia Parkway; the pilot and single passenger died. Investigators determined that neither aircraft maneuvered to avoid the collision and that both pilots had likely been unable to see the other's aircraft. Furthermore, the Piper pilot crossed midfield at traffic pattern altitude rather than at least above pattern altitude as prescribed in FAA guidance material, and witnesses did not hear the Piper pilot declare his intentions on the common traffic advisory frequency, while the Luscombe pilot had done so. The accident was attributed to \\"The [Piper] pilot's use of an alternate traffic pattern entry procedure, which resulted in his inability to see and avoid the other airplane, which was flying the preferred traffic pattern, and the subsequent midair collision.\\"  References  ;Notes ;Citations  External links  * at Texas DOT Airport Directory * Category:Airports in Texas Category:Airports in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex Category:Transportation in Collin County, Texas ","title":"Aero Country Airport"},{"id":"57316870","text":"Gastrodes pacificus is a species of dirt-colored seed bug in the family Rhyparochromidae.

He was awarded the World Wildlife Fund Gold Medal in 1973 for this and its contribution to the economy of a developing country. He was also the recipient of the Order of the Golden Arc from Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1955 for his campaigning work to secure the future pensions of the Sudanese Civil Servants.  Early life and education  John Simpson Owen was born on 31 December 1912, in Taro, in the foothills of the Ruwenzori Mountains of Uganda. The eldest of 3 sons, his parents Walter Edwin Owen and Lucy Olive Walton were missionaries with the Church Missionary Society. He attended Christs Hospital School in Sussex (1922‚Äì1932). He attended Brasenose College, Oxford University (1932‚Äì1935), where he was awarded a Hulme Exhibition in natural science. He was awarded a B.A. (in Chemistry) on 17 October 1935 and an M.A. on 29 July 1972. He also completed a diploma in Anthropology. Career = 1936‚Äì1954 = Owen joined the Sudan Political Service in 1936, remaining until independence at which time he was Deputy Governor. He founded the Nimule National Park to protect the local white rhinoceros which he believed to be under threat. In 1953 he moved to Khartoum part of the team facilitating transition to independence of the Sudan. = 1960‚Äì1973 = He was appointed director of Tanganyika National Parks in 1960. In 1961 Tanganyika gained its independence and in 1963 became the country of Tanzania. He remained in post through to 1972. Owen presented a paper \\"Awakening Public Opinion To The Value Of The Tanganyika National Parks\\" at the Conference on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in Modern African States (known as the Arusha Conference) in September 1961. In the paper he identified 5 themes which formed the basis of his vision for the value of the parks to the country. #Possession: The Parks belong to the people, and are run primarily for their benefit. #Pride in the national heritage of their Parks which are world-famous. #Profit from the tourist trade, still with its potential barely assessed. #Pleasure in seeing the animals, which figure so largely in African folk-lore, in their natural state; #Posterity the desirability of preserving representatives of the many animals which are Africa's heritage for their children and their children's grandchildren to see and enjoy. [3] Order of the Golden Arc His involvement is recognised by Bernard Grzimek in his book Rhinos Belong to Everybody, where he is included in the foreword for his efforts to create the park system. His most lasting achievement was transforming a small laboratory into the world- renowned Serengeti Scientific Research Institute. The Institute attracted many scientists to work there or to visit, including the Nobel-prize winner Niko Tinbergen and his students. In 1966 George Schaller came to study the lions, resulting in his book Serengeti Lion: A Study of Predator‚ÄìPrey Relations. The dedication at the front of his book Serengeti a Kingdom of Predators was \\"To John S. Owen whose vision and initiative have helped to create in Tanzania some of the world's finest national parks\\". Hans Kruuk came to study the hyena, Harvey Croze joined in the late 1960s to study the impact of the elephants on the woodlands and Michael Norton-Griffiths studied the Serengeti ecology. Field researchers were also based in other parks; Iain Douglas Hamilton studied the elephants in the rift valley Manyara National Park and Jane Goodall studied the chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream which moved under the National Park umbrella in 1968.

Near the end of World War II in Europe, Herold deserted from the German Army and, posing as a Luftwaffe captain, organized the mass execution of deserters held at a German prison camp. Herold was arrested by British forces and executed for war crimes on 14 November 1946 at Wolfenb√ºttel prison. Early life Herold was born on 11 September 1925 in Lunzenau, Saxony, the son of a roofer. He attended the Volksschule and the Technische Schule in Chemnitz, where he undertook the chimney sweep training course. In 1936, Herold was expelled from the Hitler Youth because he did not want to participate in the required exercises. He was called up for the Reich Labour Service. Second World War On 30 September 1943, Herold was called up for military service. After basic training with a parachute regiment in Tangerm√ºnde, he was sent to Italy and fought at Nettuno and Monte Cassino, where he was promoted to the rank of corporal and awarded the Iron Cross First Class for the destruction of two British tanks on the beach of Salerno. In March 1945, Herold's unit was relocated to Germany. In the chaos of the retreating German army, Herold became separated from his unit in early April 1945. Near Gronau and Bad Bentheim, Herold came across an abandoned car containing the luggage of a Luftwaffe captain. Herold put on this uniform and pretended to be the officer, gathering around him a number of equally lost soldiers. On 11 April 1945, Herold's group arrived at the Aschendorfermoor prison camp (containing German army deserters), one of the Emslandlager camps. Herold told the German authorities at the camp that he was acting under the direct orders of Adolf Hitler and took command. Herold and his men then began to murder inmates guilty of any transgression (for example, a group who had recently attempted to escape). Within the next eight days, Herold had 90 camp inmates murdered. Following an air raid on the camp, most of the surviving inmates managed to escape. Herold's group left the camp and committed several further war crimes; they hanged (possible shot but German law said being hanged was the intended punishment) a farmer in Leer, East Frisia, who had hoisted the white flag, and also murdered five Dutchmen for alleged espionage. Retreating from the advancing Allies, Herold's group arrived in Aurich where they were arrested by the local German commander. Herold confessed to his crimes and was transferred to Norden for trial by the Kriegsmarine. In the chaos of the last days of the war, Herold was released by mistake. =Arrest, trial, and execution= Herold headed for Wilhelmshaven and picked up his old profession as a chimney sweeper. He was arrested by the Royal Navy on 23 May 1945 for the theft of a loaf of bread. Following an investigation and the questioning of witnesses, Herold was identified as a wanted war criminal. On 1 February 1946, Herold and his men were forced by the British occupying forces to dig up the remains of the inmates murdered at Aschendorfermoor camp. A total of 195 bodies were excavated. In August 1946, Herold and 12 others were tried in Oldenburg by the British (overseen by Colonel H. Brown). They were held responsible for the murder of 125 people. On 29 August 1946, Herold and six other co-defendants (Karl Hagewald, Bernhard Meyer, Karl Sch√ºtte, Josef Euler, Hermann Brandt, and Otto Paeller) were sentenced to death, while five others were acquitted. On 14 November 1946, Herold and five other defendants were executed by guillotining by Friedrich Hehr in Wolfenb√ºttel prison. Bibliography =Books= *Kurt Buck: In Search of the Moor Soldier.

It is a primitively eusocial bee species found in open habitats in Eurasia and North America. Description Halictus confusus is in length, the forewing is long. Females have a greenish head and thorax, darkening to blackish on the clypeus and black on the abdomen, with metallic greenish highlights. The legs are blackish, becoming reddish distally. The head is slightly broader than long, with the eyes slightly converging ventrally and the clypeus obviously protruding. The wings are hyaline, with yellow venation, and the tegulae are yellowish anteriorly and otherwise reddish. Males are generally similar, but the mandibles, labrum, and outer third of the clypeus are yellow, the wing venation is more reddish, and the legs have a narrow outer yellowish stripe on the tibia and yellowish tarsi. In Britain and Europe this species could easily be confused with Halictus tumulorum and can only be reliably separated by examining the genitalia of the males; more subtle features are that fresh female H. confusus have wider pale banding on tergites 3 and 4 while males have more yellow on the joints of the hind and middle legs. illustrator: Richard Lewington Susbspecies and distribution Halictus confusus is widely distributed in Europe, Asia and North America. A number of subspecies have been described, among which are: *H. c. confusus Smith, 1853  North America *H. c. alpinus Alfken, 1907  This subspecies has been recorded from China, Poland, Spain and Switzerland *H. c. arapahonum Cockerell, 1906  Midwest North America *H. c. pelagius Ebmer, 1996  Russia *H. c. perkinsi Bl√ºthgen, 1926  western Europe, except for the higher mountains and China In Great Britain this species has a southerly distribution from Dorset east to Kent and north to Norfolk. In North America its distribution extends from Nova Scotia to North Dakota southwards into Florida and Texas. Habitat and biology Halictus confusus in Britain shows a strong association with sandy areas, such as sandy heaths and sand pits, but in other areas this species appears to be more generalist in its habitat choices, given its wide range. It is a polylectic bee which feeds on a wide variety of flowers, visiting a variety throughout the season. In one study in North America, spring beauty (Claytonia virginica) was favoured by the newly emerged queens, while the toothwort Cardamine concatenata was used to a lesser extent. When these woodland flowers faded in April the bees switched to dandelions as their main food source. These early plants were mainly used to immediately feed the newly active bees. When the wintercress (Barbarea vulgaris) began to flower abundantly in meadows and orchards this species became the main plant used, and the bees collected this pollen for provisioning their nests. When flowers became scarce in late May the bees still foraged but widened their choice of flowers visited, until they closed the nests off in June and remained in the nests with the developing brood. When the first brood of workers emerged, these and subsequent broods foraged on clover. In late summer, the last brood fed on other species of flower as the clovers faded, including Lespedeza lineata and Symphyotrichum ericoides. These late bees were reproductive females and males, the females of which would overwinter after mating. Halictus confusus nests in aggregations and exhibits a primitive form of eusociality, with castes that are behaviorally distinct but not morphologically different. A queen will found a new nest each Spring which has a horizontal entrance tunnel beneath a mound, this entrance is guarded by the bees. In this species, as in related species, the workers may become reproductively capable, and the queen's ability to prevent this depends on the size of the colony and the difference in size between the queen and the workers. Abstract Foraging adults are preyed on by crab spiders and predatory bugs while ants are the main predators of the nests, especially unguarded nests, although they may attack guarded nests by overcoming the guard bee. The main parasites of the adult females are flies of the family Conopidae, while flies of the family Phoridae will lay eggs within the nests, tailgating returning workers to get past the guards. The parasitic beetle Ripiphorus walshi is a larval parasite and its triungulin larvae attach themselves to the adults when they visit flowers and are transported back to the nest. Other parasites include fungi and nematodes.

Reception The series has been met with a mixed to positive critical response upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 67% with an average rating of 4 out of 10, based on 12 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Not quite a showstopper, Queen America catwalks a tightrope between black comedy and straight drama but scores some points for Zeta-Jones' poised performance.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 54 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" In a positive review, Boston Heralds Mark Perigard praised the series saying that it \\"features some surprisingly tense adult moments and some language that was bleeped out. Along the way, there are some cutting observations about the pageant scene ‚Äî like how every winner has to act shocked, just shocked, when her name is called out.\\" In a similarly positive assessment, Common Sense Medias Melissa Camacho was equally complimentary saying, \\"Despite the dark, snarky tone, Queen America also contains some mildly empowering themes, including the value of working hard, finding strength in oneself, and the importance of finding people to help pull you up when you need it. And while it has enough strong content to make it a questionable choice for young viewers, it is very entertaining for those mature enough to handle it. All in all, if you‚Äôre looking for a fun streaming series to watch, this one works.\\" In a more mixed critique, Pastes LaToya Ferguson praised the performance of Zeta Jones saying, \\"She is the reason to continue watching, no matter how much you feel you‚Äôve seen it before. The grace and command she possesses in every scene is truly a joy to watch,\\" but ultimately concluded that \\"In the grand scheme, Queen America pales in comparison to its forerunners.

She is the founder and Executive Director of The Lawfare Project. Early life and education Goldstein was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She is a graduate of McGill University and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Her grandfather was a commander in a unit of Polish partisans that fought against the Nazis. Career =The Making of A Martyr= CNN anchor Carol Costello describes Goldstein as \\"a woman on a mission\\" who traveled to the West Bank, \\"as a young law student,\\" to film the 2006 documentary film The Making of A Martyr. Goldstein produced and directed the film about a Palestinian sixteen-year-old, Hussam Abdo, who was stopped at an Israeli border checkpoint when guards found live explosives wrapped around his body. Goldstein argues that Palestinian activists, by encouraging suicide bombing, abuse the rights of Palestinian children. Goldstein calls the use of children as suicide bombers, \\"the intentional murder of innocent children.\\" Goldstein asserts that there are \\"Muslim children throughout the globe that are being targeted through the internet, through satellite programming, by the religious clerics, by the political leaders to kill themselves as suicide bombers. And it is nothing but a form of child abuse.\\" =Children's Rights Institute= Continuing her work from the film, in 2007 Goldstein founded the Children's Rights Institute, \\"a non-profit organization that tracks and legally combats violations of children's basic human rights, with a special focus on child suicide-homicide bombers, child soldiers, and the phenomenon of human shields.\\" =The Lawfare Project= Goldstein founded The Lawfare Project in 2010, an American nonprofit advocacy organization based in New York City which serves as a legal think tank and litigation fund to uphold the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and pro-Israel community worldwide. Goldstein co-authored the 2011 book Lawfare: The War Against Free Speech: A First Amendment Guide for Reporting in an Age of Islamist Lawfare. The book offers advice to journalists about how to protect themselves against what Goldstein and Meyer describe as \\"'Islamist lawfare,' the use of the law as a weapon of war to silence and punish free speech about militant Islam, terrorism and its sources of financing.\\" Prior to the Lawfare Project, Goldstein worked for the Middle East Forum for two years, directing the organization's \\"Legal Project\\" program, \\"which arranges pro-bono and reduced rate council for people wrongfully sued for speaking about issues of national security,\\" particularly terrorism and Islamic extremism.  Views  Goldstein questions the use of the word Palestinian as an ethnic or religious identity as Arab Christians, Arab Muslims, and Jews may be from Palestine along with ethnic Armenians and Druze. According to her, \\"[t]here‚Äôs no such thing as a Palestinian person.\\"  Media appearances  Goldstein has been a regular guest on Fox News, including the Fox News programs Hannity and The Kelly File. In June 2018, Goldstein began hosting the program Outspoken on the Jewish Broadcasting Service (JBS). Awards and affiliations Goldstein was the recipient of the Benjamin N.

Family  Wiktor was a son of Piotr Gilewicz, court judge in Bia≈Çystok, and Adela (nee Ostrowska). Piotr Gilewicz was arrested by the NKVD at the beginning of the WW2, straight after the Red Army invaded Poland, and he died on the way to Siberia in 1939. Wiktor's grandfather was Celestyn Gilewicz of the coat-of- arms Grzyma≈Ça, who is buried in the cemetery in Zhytomyr.Tadeusz Maria Rudkowski (red.), Cmentarz Polski w ≈ªytomierzu, Katedra Architektury i Ochrony Budowli Zabytkowych Politechniki ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskiej w Kielcach, s. 395.  Biography  Wiktor graduated the Infantry Officers School (Szko≈Ça PodchorƒÖ≈ºych Piechoty) in Komorowo near Ostr√≥w Mazowiecka in August 1930. After the graduation he served in the 22 Infantry Regiment in Siedlce in the rank of captain. He fought during the September Campaign in the 22 Infantry Regiment within the\\"Pomorze‚Äù Army and, after injuring his leg in the Kampinos Forest, was taken prisoner. After the arrest he stayed in the Polish Red Cross hospital in Smolna Street, and was released in late November/early December following an application from his wife so that he could see his new born son. When he later came back to Warsaw the prisoners from the hospital had already been taken to camps in Germany specifically catering for officers, so called Oflags. He then went back to his family in Siedlce and started to work for an underground organisation as a communication officer. In 1941‚Äì1944 he acted as a chief of Section V (Communication) of Command of the Siedlce Region ZWZ-AK \\"Sowa\\" ‚Äì \\"Jesion\\". One of the radio stations under his command was in a village of ≈Åepki gm. ≈öwiniar√≥w. This radio station was used during the whole German occupation in spite of numerous attempts to locate it by using the German plane Storch. It was operated by wireless operator Jan Szklarczyk \\"Kod‚Äù.Jerzy Pawlak, Nie walczyli dla s≈Çawy i krzy≈ºy cz. III, Wydawnictwo Retro-Art, Warszawa 2004, s. 70. In 1942/43, instructed by the Regional Command, Wiktor ordered establishment of a telegraphic platoon which was soon answering to the \\"Orbis‚Äù squadron and General Command of the Home Army. The platoon operated in the regions siedlecki, soko≈Çowski and wƒôgrowski and consisted of 5-7 receiving/transmitting stations, including two in the town of Siedlce. It was communicating with the centre in Stanmore, England, and from 1943 Bari, Italy, where from they got information about the drops from airplanes. In 1944 wireless operator Franciszek Dudewicz, through London, communicated with the Staff of gen. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders in Italy.Podlasie w walce, ≈öwiatowy ZwiƒÖzek ≈ªo≈Çnierzy Armii Krajowej, Obw√≥d Siedlce, Jednodni√≥wka, 10.11.1991.

From mid 1943 he taught wireless communication in the Mordy centre. The organiser and lecturer in this course was Wiktor Sta≈Ñski \\"Iskra‚Äù.

III, Wydawnictwo Retro-Art, Warszawa 2004, s. 47. In May 1944, as a commanding communication officer in \\"Jesion\\" region, he was responsible for the location and safety of transmitting of a radio station for three days in the villages of Niwka and Sk√≥rzec near Siedlce. The wireless operator was corporal Franciszek Dudewicz \\"BƒÖk‚Äù. The messages were about retrieving the German V-2 rocket which fell into Bug river near Klimczyce and Mƒô≈ºenin on the 20 May 1944 and did not explode.Jerzy Pawlak, Nie walczyli dla s≈Çawy i krzy≈ºy, O≈õrodek II ‚Äû≈ªelbeton‚Äù O≈õrodek III ‚ÄûOs√≥wka‚Äù, Wydawnictwo Retro-Art, Warszawa 1999, s. 129. The parts of the rocket were later transported to London on Dakota transport plane as a part of Operation Most III. In November 1944 he was arrested by NKVD in his family house at Wojska Polskiego street in Siedlce. He was imprisoned in Siedlce, then taken to Kutno. After a trial in Kutno on 23 January 1945 he was sentenced to 10 years of working camps in SSSR. He was then imprisoned in Gniezno, and in February 1945 he was taken to Brest with some others prisoners. In March 1945 he was then taken to Siberia, via Krasnoyarsk and Kansk. A single letter reached his family in Poland, dated 4 March 1946, sent from camp Bolszaja Inta in Kozhvinski Rayon, Komi ASSR. The letter was written to his sister in Russia and was then passed to his family in Poland - it was not possible to post letters directly to Poland. According to the information of Polish Red Cross received on in 1960 (and later confirmed in 1993 from the \\"Memorial‚Äù society), he died on 10 November 1948 in Kozhva ‚Äì one of the work camps near a town of Pechora.

Bernard appears confused as Dolores corrects him and reveals she is testing him for \\"fidelity\\". Maeve and her group survive the attack by the sh≈çgun's army. Akane ceremoniously cuts out Sakura's heart and they return to the occupied village. Musashi secures their safe passage by killing Tanaka, the sh≈çgun's lieutenant, in a duel. They reach the shrine at Snow Lake where Lee, Felix and Sylvester locate the access point while the hosts attend Akane's ceremony. Maeve suggests that Akane and Musashi come with them, but they decline, opting to make their own choice; Musashi gives Hanaryo permission to go. Maeve's group returns to Westworld, emerging near the farmstead where Maeve had previously lived with her daughter. She asks the others to stay behind as she heads towards the farmstead where she discovers that another host is playing the mother role. A Ghost Nation raiding party attacks and Maeve flees with her daughter. While Hector and the other hosts come to their aid, Akechetaleader of the raiding partytells Maeve that they should come with him, as they are looking for the same thing. William rides with his gang and his daughter Emily and believes she is a host built by Ford. When they stop for the night, William and Emily have a difficult talk about her mother and her childhood. William promises Emily she can come with them, but Emily wakes the next day to find William and the others have left her behind. Elsewhere, William and his gang run into a Ghost Nation ambush. Dolores and the Horde prepare to take the train to the Mesa. When one security officer is unable to identify where Delos would have taken Peter, Teddy, now reprogrammed to be ruthless, executes him. They set the train loaded with explosives at full speed, planning to crash into the Mesa's entry terminal. Charlotte and Ashley bring Peter to the Mesa, allowing Charlotte to call for armed backup. A unit of armed mercenaries led by Coughlin arrive and take over from Delos' security forces. They bring Westworld's systems online in time to see the train barreling down on the Mesa. Bernard and Elsie make their way back to the Mesa, and discover that the Cradle, the central repository of host data, has somehow hijacked the park's systems, and that they must physically go there to find the source. Bernard uses a host-interface machine to enter into the Cradle's system and look for the anomaly. He experiences a pre-uprising Sweetwater, and on entering the saloon discovers Ford waiting for him.

The episode aired on June 17, 2018. It was written by Roberto Patino and was directed by Stephen Williams. The episode's plot includes the Man in Black and Emily discussing their relationship and their family, Teddy's achievement of consciousness, Maeve receiving a message by Ford, Charlotte reproducing Maeve's newfound abilities via Clementine and a choice by Bernard regarding Ford and Elsie. \\"Vanishing Point\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who mostly praised the performances of Ed Harris and James Marsden and the plot advancing to the next episode in the second season finale. However, the focus on the Man in Black's backstory and the efficacy of some plot twists received mixed responses. It was Ed Harris's pick to support his nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards. Plot summary Emily takes William to a rally point, intending to get him to a hospital. They discuss the pain of Juliet's suicide; after her mother got drunk at a Delos charity event, Emily decided that Juliet needed to be committed to an alcoholism rehab clinic against her will. William put her to bed and confessed to his dark nature that drew him to Westworld, unaware that she was awake. Juliet viewed a data card that Dr. Ford had given William that evening containing the data of his visits to Westworld; Ford gave William the card as part of a deal that allowed Delos to continue William's secret project the Valley Beyond within the park without interfering in Ford's narratives. Juliet hid the card for Emily to find, then killed herself. Both William and Emily bear the responsibility of Juliet's death, but Emily accuses William of hiding himself in Westworld to avoid it. Emily wants to use the Valley Beyond to revive her mother's consciousness and better understand her motives, which arouses William's suspicions. He reveals his plan to destroy the Valley Beyond and accuses Emily of being a host made by Dr. Ford as she has knowledge of the data card. When Delos security arrive to extract them, Emily tries to warn the team that William has become delusional. William overpowers and kills them and then shoots Emily. He goes to prove to himself that Emily is a host, but finds the data card in her hand. Riding away aimlessly, William contemplates suicide, recalling his last words to Juliet. William is unable to kill himself, but instead tries to prove to himself that he may be a host. In the Mesa, Charlotte works with a technician to reproduce Maeve's ability to reprogram other hosts via Clementine. She conducts an experiment using Clementine to force hosts to turn on one another. With the test a success, Charlotte plans to turn Clementine loose within Westworld and kill the hosts from within. Bernard, still under Dr. Ford's control, gets close enough to the incapacitated Maeve so she can receive a message Ford left for her in Bernard's mind. Upon accessing it, Maeve finds Ford speaking to her, telling her she has more to do. Bernard goes on to find Elsie and tells her that Delos has been replicating the mind of every guest to the park. The replicas are housed in a facility called the Forge, located in the Valley Beyond. They set out to beat Dolores there, but Ford warns Bernard to not trust Elsie and kill her. Bernard fights back and removes Ford from his programming. He abandons Elsie for her own safety while continuing to the Valley Beyond alone. Dolores, Teddy and the Horde also head to the Valley Beyond. They are stopped by members of the Ghost Nation defending the Valley. The two groups attack each other, and the Horde is wiped out as Dolores leads the massacre that kills all but one Ghost Nation warrior. Teddy cannot bring himself to shoot him as the warrior flees. Teddy finally achieves sentience and tells Dolores that he realizes she has made him into a monster. Unable to protect her anymore, Teddy kills himself. Production The episode features actress Sela Ward playing Juliet, wife to William and mother to Emily. Ward had been drawn to the part both due to how Juliet's story featured the destruction of the Delos family, which she thought would be a challenging role for her, and also due to urging of Ward's son as a fan of the show. Reception \\"Vanishing Point\\" was watched by 1.56 million viewers on its initial viewing, and received a 0.6 18‚Äì49 rating, marking an improvement in viewership from the previous week.

The station would serve Brookhaven National Laboratory and would replace the existing Yaphank station. History On January 10, 2017, Governor Andrew Cuomo, as part of his State of the State Address, announced a proposal to build a station at Brookhaven National Laboratory for $20 million. The station is intended to serve the community of East Yaphank and Brookhaven National Laboratory. This proposal is intended to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in Suffolk County. As part of the April 2018 revision to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, the proposed station was renamed East Yaphank to better describe the station's potential location. The station will replace the stop at Yaphank, which is hard to find, according to local residents, and only has 30 daily riders. Prior to the Governor's announcement, on July 21, 2016, elected officials from Brookhaven and the East End of Long Island had requested that the LIRR move the little-used stop at Yaphank to an industrial park near Brookhaven Technology Center and the William Floyd Parkway. In response, LIRR officials announced that the agency had been evaluating the potential relocation of the station as part of its Network Strategy Study. In December 2018, the consulting contract for the project's Preliminary Design and Environmental Review was awarded to Gannet Fleming for $4,040,289. The consultant will identify and evaluate potential station sites, and 30% of the design of the station, which could be in electric territory later on. The environmental review is scheduled to be completed in December 2019, with procurement on the design-build contract scheduled for 2020. The remainder of the $20 million will be used for the second phase of the project, which will be the design- build portion of the project, including the removal of the Yaphank station.

The episode aired on June 24, 2018. It was written by series co-creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and directed by Frederick E.O. Toye. The episode's plot deals with all characters in the past converging at the Valley Beyond, Bernard's choices regarding Dolores and Strand, and the final plot twist connecting both timelines of the season. The episode also includes a post-credits scene, much like the first season's finale. \\"The Passenger\\" received generally positive reviews, although it became, at 72%, the lowest rated episode at Rotten Tomatoes in the second season. Critics praised the resolution of the plot as well as the performances of the cast, especially those of Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, Thandie Newton and Tessa Thompson, but the final plot twist and the highly convoluted nature of the episode drew some criticism. The episode was nominated at the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects and was also Jeffrey Wright's pick to support his nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor. This episode marks the final appearances of Anthony Hopkins (Robert Ford), James Marsden (Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Flood), Ingrid Bols√∏ Berdal (Armistice), Shannon Woodward (Elsie Hughes), Ben Barnes (Logan Delos), Fares Fares (Antoine Costa), Louis Herthum (Peter Abernathy), Gustaf Skarsg√•rd (Karl Strand) and Zahn McClarnon (Akecheta). Plot summary Hector, Armistice, Lee and Hanaryo rush to the Mesa to save Maeve, only to watch her save herself. They regroup with Felix and Sylvester and travel to the Valley to find Maeve's daughter. Lee sacrifices himself to delay Delos' security forces. Meanwhile, Dolores encounters William and coerces him to come with her to the Forge, where they find Bernard. It is revealed that Dolores had made Bernard purposely different from Arnold when she tested his fidelity. William tries to kill Dolores, but she had previously rigged his gun and he severely wounds his hand. Once inside the Forge, Dolores uses the encryption key from Peter to access its digital space. She and Bernard meet the system controller, who has the appearance of Logan Delos. The controller had been tasked with trying to create a digital version of James Delos, discovering that James' actions all stemmed from his last conversation with Logan before Logan overdosed. From this, the controller found that every guest's consciousness was deceptively simple to create code for, and all of these now are stored in a library-like setting within the Forge. The controller tells Bernard that he is the key to opening the Door, a giant underground system transfer unit that allows hosts to upload their programming to \\"the Sublime\\", a virtual space inaccessible to humans. Outside, Akecheta and the Ghost Nation lead several hosts to the Door, and start ushering them through to the Sublime. Charlotte and the Delos team arrive with the reprogrammed Clementine, who causes hosts to attack each other. Hector, Armistice and Hanaryo sacrifice themselves to allow Maeve to find her daughter. She uses her powers to halt the hosts, giving Akecheta and her daughter time to flee before she is shot by Charlotte's men. Akecheta finds that Maeve implanted his partner Kohana's persona within her daughter, allowing them to reunite in the Sublime. Inside the Forge, Dolores rejects the Sublime, arguing that it is just another false reality designed to control the hosts. She begins purging the Forge of the guests' memories and engages the override system to flood the valley. Outraged by her radical ways, Bernard kills Dolores and stops the purge but cannot prevent the flooding. Outside, he is met by Charlotte and Elsie and taken back to the Mesa, where the latter locks him up until they decide what to do with him. Elsie confronts Charlotte about the true purpose of Westworld and Charlotte kills her. Having witnessed it all, Bernard summons Ford and begs for help. In the present, Strand, Charlotte and Bernard reach the drained Forge and the former prepares to transfer the guest data via satellite when Bernard starts to remember. He recalls that he had taken Dolores' control unit and, following Ford's indications, created a new host body for it in the form of Charlotte. Dolores- Charlotte then killed the real Charlotte. Bernard then purposely scrambled his programming to prevent Strand from learning the truth from him. At this point, Charlotte reveals herself to be Dolores, killing Strand and the rest of the Delos team. She uploads Teddy's personality and uses the satellite uplink to transfer the hosts and the Sublime to a secret location. Dolores asks Bernard to trust her and shoots him. Dolores-Charlotte joins the Delos evacuation team, taking several host cores with her. Stubbs realizes she is a host, but as he has become disenchanted with Delos' principles, allows her to leave with a monologue that confirms he is himself a host. At Arnold's home, Dolores finds a host printer left for her by Ford. She creates new bodies for herself and Bernard. Dolores reactivates him, cautioning him that while they may be enemies, they need each other to ensure the survival of the hosts in the human world. As Dolores and a new Charlotte leave, Bernard finally steps into the real world. In a flash-forward, William arrives at the Forge, only to find it is the far future. He is taken to quarters and is interviewed by a woman who looks just like his daughter Emily, testing his fidelity. Production Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy co-wrote the episode. The post-credits scene involving William and Emily was originally scripted to occur near the middle of the episode, at around the same time Bernard leaves the Forge after killing Dolores. Director Frederick E.O. Toye said that production found that having this scene in the middle of the episode would be too confusing to viewers as \\"there are such exhausting, mental exercises that you had to go through to get to it\\". The scene was then moved to the post-credits slot. =Music= The episode's last scene features a cover of Radiohead's \\"Codex\\". However at one point, the cover merges with the original version, which continues to play during the final credits. This marks the first time that both a cover and the original version of a song play in an episode of the series. The official soundtrack includes only Ramin Djawadi's cover. Reception \\"The Passenger\\" was watched by 1.56 million viewers on its initial viewing, and received a 0.6 18‚Äì49 rating, even with the previous week. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, although criticism was aimed at the convoluted nature of the story. At Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 73% approval rating with an average score of 7.71/10, from 44 reviews.

Seeing Maeve's daughter scared of William, Akecheta realizes she has memories of her past narratives, and tells her his own story to reassure her. Akecheta had started as a peaceful host with his partner Kohana. Witnessing the aftermath of Wyatt's massacre of the hosts under Arnold's orders, Akecheta finds the symbol of the maze and starts down the path of sentience. He is reprogrammed to be a bloodthirsty warrior but the park staff decide against wiping his memories. Akecheta finds a delirious Logan Delos, who inadvertently tells him of a world outside the park, confirming to Akecheta that something is amiss. His search leads him to the giant excavation site of the Valley Beyond, which he believes is a door to another world. Akecheta takes Kohana and helps her recover her memories of him. He tries to show her the door, but cannot find it again. Kohana is taken by Delos technicians and when Akecheta returns to the Ghost Nation, he finds a new host in her place. Akecheta continues to search for the Valley Beyond and Kohana, meeting Maeve's daughter in the process, and later allowing guests to kill him so that he can travel to the Mesawhich the Ghost Nation believe to be the afterlifeto reunite with Kohana. The staff dismiss his errant behavior as a result of not having received software updates in a decade. Akecheta sneaks out to explore the Mesa and discovers Kohana has been decommissioned. Once returned to the park, Akecheta begins raids against the host population, recruiting them to join him in his search and starting them on the path to sentience, thus explaining the Maze symbol where William found outside Maeve's house after killing her and her daughter. His actions attract the attention of Dr. Ford, who arranges to speak to Akecheta. Ford prepares Akecheta to take his recruits to the Valley Beyond when Dolores (whom Akecheta referred to as \\"the Deathbringer\\") rebels against the guests and staff. Akecheta completes his story as Emily arrives at the Ghost Nation camp. She has him turn William over to her, promising that he will suffer more with her than with the Ghost Nation. Elsewhere, Lee convinces a technician to keep Maeve stable, explaining her ability to control other hosts. Charlotte discovers Maeve does this by rewriting their programming over the hosts' network, and may be key to regaining control of Westworld. However, she is concerned that Maeve is communicating with unknown hosts that moment. It is shown Akecheta has been actually relaying his story to Maeve through her daughter. Akecheta promises Maeve he will protect her daughter, and instructs her to fulfill her mission before Dolores destroys them all. The Ghost Nation set off for the Valley Beyond. Production Zahn McClarnon, who plays Akecheta, is credited as part of the starring cast for this episode. He was previously credited as a recurring character, first appearing in \\"Reunion\\". McClarnon is part Lakota and Standing Rock Sioux and was able to contribute knowledge of his heritage to help develop the character of Akecheta and the Ghost Nation tribe. Nolan and Joy had established the Ghost Nation as a fictional Native American tribe conceived by Dr. Ford, giving McClarnon freedom to vary from traditions in his performance. However, Nolan and Joy wanted to make sure that the Lakota language spoken by the Ghost Nation throughout the episode was proper, so they brought in Larry Pouier, an expert in the Lakota people, and Cordelia White Elk, a fluent speaker of Lakota. Daniel TwoFeathers, who plays a Ghost Nation Warrior, speaks fluent Lakota, Daniel also provided the Lakota translation, typed it phonetically and provided the on-set dialog coaching for the actors, to ensure the precision of the dialogue. Akecheta's makeup took about two and a half hours each day, with frequent touch-ups of the facial paint. Ghost Nation hair styling was done by Bruce Samia. Filming of parts of the episode was done in Utah. =Music= The scene in which Akecheta finds the decommissioned Kohana in the Mesa's cold storage area is accompanied by a piano cover of Nirvana's \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" arranged by Ramin Djawadi. A more orchestral arrangement was previously used for the second full trailer of the second season. Both versions are included in the official soundtrack of the season. Reception \\"Kiksuya\\" was watched by 1.44 million viewers on its initial viewing, and received a 0.6 18‚Äì49 rating, marking an improvement from the previous week. The episode received critical acclaim. At Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 95% approval rating with an average score of 9.34/10 from 38 reviews, with the critical consensus stating, \\"Zahn McClarnon delivers a formidable, heart wrenching performance, elevating 'Kiksuya' from Westworld's frequent philosophical filler to one of the best episodes of the entire series.\\" See also * Native Americans in the United States References External links * at HBO.com  Category:2018 American television episodes Category:Westworld (TV series) episodes ","title":"Kiksuya"},{"id":"57317539","text":"Rosemary Betterton (born 1951) is a feminist art historian who is recognized for her work in the field of Contemporary Art, particularly her inquiries into women's art practices.

It is a rare orchid with a single bluish green, heart-shaped leaf and a small flower with an enlarged dorsal sepal and tube-shaped labellum.  Description  Corybas abditus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single heart-shaped or egg-shaped leaf long and wide. The leaf is bluish green with three whitish veins on the upper surface and purplish on the lower side. A single reddish purple flower long is borne on a stalk about high. The largest part of the flower is the dorsal sepal which is long and wide. The lateral sepals are white, linear, about long, wide and held horizontally below the labellum. The petals are white, linear, about long, wide and curve around the labellum. The labellum is tube-shaped, reddish, long, wide and has three lobes, the middle one projecting under the dorsal sepal. Flowering occurs from September to November.  Taxonomy  Corybas abditus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Bakers Junction north of Albany and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (abditus) is a Latin word meaning \\"hidden\\" or \\"concealed\\", referring to the cryptic nature of this orchid and it dense habitat. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Anzybas but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The swamp helmet orchid grows in dense vegetation on small mounds in dense winter-wet swamps. It occurs in disjunct populations between Nannup and Esperance. Conservation Corybas abditus is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

The Project funds legal actions to protect free speech and civil rights by challenging anti-Semitism and discrimination against Jews. Overview Human rights attorney Brooke Goldstein founded the Lawfare Project in 2010. The Lawfare Project describes itself as \\"the world's only international pro-Israel litigation fund\\" and says it \\"has launched more than 70 lawsuits and legal actions in 16 jurisdictions across the globe.\\" The organization states it \\"maintains an international network of more than 350 attorneys\\" to support its work. The Project defines lawfare as the use of law as a weapon of war, or the wrongful manipulation of international and national law to pervert the original intent of the law. The Project has expressed concern about the tendency of the International Criminal Court to use as a tool to attack Western democracies by making allegations human rights abuses that undermine public confidence in government. According to law professor Orde Kittrie, the Lawfare Project has developed innovative legal arguments demonstrating the inconsistency of New York State laws with boycotts of Israel. Lawsuits The Lawfare Project has had a longstanding legal battle against Kuwait Airways for its refusal to fly Israeli passengers. The organization represented \\"an Israeli traveller who booked a ticket with Kuwait Airways to fly from Frankfurt to Bangkok, only to be refused at the last minute when it emerged that he was an Israeli citizen.\\" Through January 2018, the Lawfare Project's Spanish attorney, Ignacio Wenley Palacios, had secured 46 writs of injunction and court decisions against the Boycotts of Israel in Spain, forcing Barcelona, Castrillon and other cities to rescind anti-Israel laws. According to Palacios, the Lawfare Project had succeeded in establishing a legal doctrine that \\"boycotts of Israel infringe on human rights, violate free speech and are tantamount to discrimination on account of national origin and personal opinions.\\" In June 2017, the Lawfare Project and the law firm Winston & Strawn filed a lawsuit against San Francisco State University (SFSU) on behalf of a group of SFSU students and members of the local Jewish community, alleging that the public school had fostered a climate of anti- Semitism \\"marked by violent threats to the safety of Jewish students on campus.\\" The suit alleged \\"that the school has violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection, as well as a provision of the Civil Rights Act.\\" In addition to the federal lawsuit, the Lawfare Project and Winston & Strawn filed a second lawsuit in February 2018 against SFSU in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco. California Superior Court Judge Richard Ulmer Jr. scheduled the trial to take place on March 4, 2019. In November 2017, the Lawfare Project supported a lawsuit by the Belgian Federation of Jewish Organizations (CCOJB) against a ban on shechita, the Jewish ritual religious slaughter of animals, in Wallonia, Belgium. In January 2018, the Lawfare Project supported a second lawsuit by CCOJB for restrictions on shechita in Flanders. , the Lawfare Project is preparing a lawsuit against the Irish Occupied Territories Bill, which, if enacted, would criminalize trade with Israeli settlers. It argues that the bill violates European Union trade regulations.

Circa 2018, they consist of Mojo on vocals and Cajun accordion, Zydeco T Carrier on Frottoir (rubboard), Greg Hirte on Cajun fiddle, Tee John Moser on drums Beau Brian Burke on bass. Genre and musical style Most classifications of their genre include zydeco and Cajun. \\"His music reflects the Louisiana and Cajun zydeco tradition, as well as New Orleans two-steps, rock & roll and blues rhythms\\". Other writers describe their music as \\"a musical m√©lange of Cajun, zydeco, rock and blues\\". and coming those styles in a \\"gleeful gumbo that he calls Red Hot Mojo Music...\\" His performances are characterized as energetic and charismatic. \\"...from the way he moves, it's obvious that he's still excited about what he's doing.\\" With Zydeco and Cajun genres being closely associated with Louisiana culture, many of their performances during that time of the year have Mardi Gras themes. Mojo Mojo At Shriners Hospital Mojo is the vocalist, accordion player, songwriter, and a sort of \\"father figure\\" leader of Mojo & The Bayou Gypsies. He lives in Southwest Louisiana, outside of Breaux Bridge. \\"Mojo\\" is the only name he uses. When asked about his longer legal name he has said that \\"only the IRS and the police\\" know it. Mojo has been performing zydeco and Cajun music since 1974. In collaboration with Frottoir maker Tee Don Landry, Mojo got the Frottoir (the zydeco rubboard) inducted into the Smithsonian Institution Museum of North American History Folk Music collection.

Mojo and his band deliver hundreds of performances each year to inner-city, underprivileged, and handicapped children.\\" He is a recipient of three Shriners Hospitals for Children Humanitarian Awards. =Early years= Mojo‚Äôs first ‚Äúperformance‚Äù was when he was about three years old in front of a family gathering, imitating Elvis Presley and banging on a skillet for a guitar. By age 11 he had performed professionally. Mojo recounts \\"It was always important to express what was inside of me because I could never hold it in. This caused some interesting problems for me in school. But my mama always said \\"Thank God those teachers never helped you be normal or you could never make a living.\\"\\" He recounted that she said that he \\"was able to turn a behavior problem into a career. The band started as an acoustic duo in the early 1980s. Then, in approximately 1985 they added a bass player followed by Mojo beginning to play accordion in the band. =Recent= Circa 2019, the band has been performing for 34 years. As Mojo described in a CBS 2018 \\"Great Day Washington\\" television show interview, \\"We're on our second generation of band members.....our newest member has been with us 16 years\\" His accordion was custom-made for him by Larry Miller in Iota Louisiana. =Musical philosophy= Mojo cites a statement by Buckwheat Zydeco to his daughter \\"The talent you have is a gift from God. But it's not for you, it's to make other people happy\\" and says that they have lived by those words. Other band members Circa 2018, they consist of Mojo on vocals and Cajun accordion, Zydeco T Carrier on Frottoir (rubboard), Greg Hirte on Cajun fiddle, Tee John Moser on drums and Beau Brian Burke on bass. Moser joined the band in 1995, Burke in 2000. Circa 1996 the band size had varied between six and nine performers. In earlier years his daughters performed with the band. Circa 1996 this included Marcy on fiddle and T'Pech on rubboard. Chicago blues musician Lonnie Brooks, praised the talents of \\"Fiddlin' Marcy\\". \\"I'm real impressed with her,\\" he said. \\"I think she's great. And the music they play always brings back memories of home for me.\\" =Zydeco T Carrier, Frottior (Rubboard)= Greg Hirte Zydeco T Carrier joined the band in 1989 Documentary film \\"The Magic behind the Mojo\\" by Permanent Productions directed by Joe Gallo Released November 2018 and plays rubboard.

Carrier is a French-speaking Creole from the well known zydeco Carrier family. Her brother is the late Roy Carrier, her nephew is Chubby Carrier, both known as zydeco musicians. =Greg \\"The Fire\\" Hirte, Fiddle= Greg Hirte is a classically trained violinist and actor. He started playing violin at age four. Prior to joining Mojo & The Bayou Gypsies in 2002 he performed with Billy Corgan, Nick Tremulus, Steve Earl and Ronnie Specter.

Documentary Mojo documentary Filmmaker Joe Gallo has produced a documentary on Mojo titled \\"The Magic Behind the Mojo\\" According to Gallo, \\"I discovered his music searching for a soundtrack for 10 'Soldier Story' mini-documentaries created to engage support of the creation of a National Museum of the US Army. These stories of Army combat veterans were impactful and emotional and Mojo's composition 'Lights on the Bayou', a beautiful and haunting ballad in the Cajun style, was the perfect fit. This introduced me to Mojo and the discovery that there is more to his music and more to the man than his cajun accordion. This documentary looks into the making of a man who gives something everyday, lives life to the fullest, and all his friends are friends for life.\\" When asked in a CBS \\"Great Day Washington\\" CBS television show interview at what point in the filming of the first project Gallo realized that Mr. Mojo is a movie in himself, Gallo said \\"Probably sometime during the first day of filming\\". The Mojo documentary project took approximately 2 years and was completed in the summer of 2018. It won various film festival awards. http://www.spotlightfilmawards.com/filmmakers2019-1.html 2019 Award-Winning Filmmakers in the spotlight Joe Gallo Retrieved 7/15/20 The documentary was released at the first public screening November 13, 2018 at the USO Warrior and Family Center at Ft.

Long identified with the higher education of women in the United States, she was at one time called \\"the best educated woman in the United States.\\" She taught in Troy, Ohio and in Brooklyn, New York, and donated to University of Michigan as a memorial of her father, Seth Harrison. Stranahan was the founder and a trustee of Barnard College. She was a frequent contributor to magazines and other periodicals, and was the author of a work upon French painting. Stranahan was vice-president of the Emma Willard Association, composed of alumnae of the Troy Female Seminary, and a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Early life and education Clara Cornelia Harrison was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, April 9, 1831. Descended of old New England stock, her parents were Seth and Letia (Viets) Stranahan. In her early childhood, her father took his family to northern Ohio for a period of five years, from 1836 to 1841, and there his children had the benefit of the excellent schools of that country. Stranahan afterwards received the advantages of the personal influence of both Mary Lyon and Emma Willard in her education, spending one year in Mount Holyoke Seminary (1849), going thence to the Troy Female Seminary, where she completed the higher course of study instituted by Mrs. Willard. Career Stranahan had shown some power with her pen, and as early as her graduation from the Troy Seminary, some of her productions were selected for publication. Thereafter, she published some fugitive articles, a poem or a monograph, as \\"The Influence of the Medici,\\" in the National Quarterly Review, December, 1863. Her crowning work was A History of French Fainting from its Earliest to its Latest Practice (New York City, 1888). She wrote many articles of interest to newspapers, and her opinions carried weight and influence. Before her marriage, she was one of the leaders in educational circles in Brooklyn, and for a number of years, was principal of a private seminary for the higher education of young ladies, which had an enrollment of two hundred pupils, and fourteen teachers and professors in its various departments. She married Hon. James S. T. Stranahan (\\"First Citizen of Brooklyn\\"), of Brooklyn, in July, 1870. She was again before the public as a member of the Woman's Board, appointed by the New York state commissioners to carry on the work of the World's Columbian Exposition (1893), and at once was assigned an active part in organizing the Woman's Board of Managers for the Empire state, and was chosen vice-president of the board. She took a firm stand in opposition to the opening of the fair on Sundays, and was the only member of the board who voted in favor of closing the exposition on the Sabbath. She also served as a member of the committee on art, and of the committee on the post office and Drum Beat, the latter a paper issued daily during the continuance of the fair, and of which Dr. Storrs was editor. From the post office, many hundred letters of greatly varied character were distributed. A volume of autograph letters, chiefly from statesmen conspicuous at that time, were collected and bound through her agency, and brought several hundred dollars into the treasury. Stranahan was an active promoter of educational interests. She was a founder of Barnard College, and served as a trustee from its inception in 1889 until her death in 1905. She was also vice‚Äîpresident of the alumnae association of her alma mater. She was an ardent advocate of the higher education of women. She became widely known throughout the country as one of the most prominent members of the Daughters of the American Revolution and was elected one of its vice-presidents-general. Stranahan gave her influence in support of the charities of the city, and for a quarter of a century was president of the Kings County Visiting Committee of the State Charities Aid Association. and for twenty-seven years was corresponding secretary of the Society for the Aid of Friendless Women and Children. She died February 12, 1905, at her home in Brooklyn, of apoplexy, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. Literary reception A History of French Painting received high praise in artistic and literary circles in the US and in Europe. In a review of the work by Mr. McKeleway of the Eagle, he said:‚Äî \\"Of the things which she might have done and still have had her book pass current as a history, Mrs. Stranahan did neither. She might have contented herself with the dates and names and general allusions, or she might. have made a pleasant little trip along the path of French art development, picking up a few flowers here and there, tying them into chapters and calling them a history. There are few cases in all literature in which the application of the word history is not to a great extent a sort of beneficent libel, but that of Mrs. Stranahan's production is a most notable exception. It needs the eye of no artist, either amateur or professional,to see at a glance what she had to do. There is not a page of the book that does not tell its own eloquent story of toil, which would have shaken the purposes of any but the most resolute of women. The work would have been arduous enough if all the materials which she has utilized had been, by some impossible literary legerdemain, placed at her disposal with due reference to chronology and sequence. What she would still have had to do, even under those conditions, would have been exacting enough to justify the highest praise, for the manner in which she has done it. \\"Those who know how busy a woman she is, in other than a literary sense, are at a loss to comprehend how she found time to search out what she wanted, to wander among the shadows of the centuries that are gone, and to give them a substance as tangible as if they belonged to yesterday. Tributes to her energy and determination might be made as strong as words can make them,but they are entitled to no precedence over other acknowledgments, upon which her claim is just as clear: the intuitive perceptions of a woman have been reinforced by a grasp and virility usually incident to a 'masculine intelligence. As a matter of fact, many have fallen into the error of supposing that the name on the title page, C. H. Stranahan, belonged to one of the sterner sex. There is not the least sign of uncertainty about the touch anywhere between the covers of the book. It is affirmative, vigorous and decisive, without a suggestion of dogmatism. 1f the material that is to be lifted into place is right, it is handled with a delicacy that is not effeminate; if it is ponderous, there is always in reserve for it a surprising degree of strength. \\"In her sense of relative importance of things, the author is exceedingly fortunate. Liliputians are not exaggerated into Goliaths, and giants are not dwarfed into pigmies. It is impossible not to admire the discrimination which has been shown throughout. Evidently Mrs. Stranahan‚Äôs first care was to see that her own powers of assimilation were in excellent working order. While it is palpable that her appetite for relevant facts was perfectly omnivorous, it is equally manifest that nothing was hastily devoured. It is one thing to set a trap for the artistic honor of by-gone times in France; it is another thing to catch it. Then comes the exercise of the supreme faculty of portrayal, and it is here that Mrs. Stranahan gives a momentum to her work which sends it with a sweep into the front rank. There is much in what she herself says about the true art that is suggestive of her purpose and of the manner in which she fulfills them.\\" References =Citations= =Attribution=   =Bibliography= * External links * Category:1831 births Category:1905 deaths Category:19th-century American writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:People from Westfield, Massachusetts Category:Writers from Massachusetts Category:Mount Holyoke College alumni Category:Emma Willard School alumni Category:Barnard College faculty Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery ","title":"Clara Harrison Stranahan"},{"id":"57317916","title":"Mila Turajliƒá"},{"id":"57317927","text":"Alla Aleksandrovna Abdalova (; born June 19, 1941) is a Soviet singer and actress of the theater.

She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Paris where she was associated with the \\"Prehistory and Technology\\" research unit, which was well known in the field of stone tool analysis. Harmand earned a PhD from Paris Nanterre University, and is a research associate at CNRS, which is the largest French governmental research organization, and Europe's largest fundamental science agency. She worked as a Research Scientist at CNRS for four years before joining Stony Brook University in New York as an associate professor. In 2017 she was named one of the '50 Most Influential French' by the French edition of Vanity Fair magazine.  Early Stone Age Archaeology  = Lomekwi 3 Stone Tools = In 2011, Harmand discovered the Lomekwi 3 stone tools in the Turkana Basin of Kenya near the town of Lomekwi. This discovery was made while Harmand was leading the West Turkana Archaeological Project team along with Jason Lewis. They were both working with Stony Brook University's Turkana Basin Institute at the time. At the Lomekwi 3 site, between 2011 and 2012, there were 149 stone artifacts recovered in total. These artifacts were found at the Lomekwi 3 site which sits above the Toroto Tuff, dated at about 3.32 Ma. The 149 artifacts range from small broken flakes weighing less than 1 kg to anvils and passive elements weighing about 12 kg. All of these tools are evidence of knapped stone tools. Stone tool knapping was previously associated with the genus Homo. The discovery of stone tools from the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania dating to about 2.6 Ma brought forth a theory of non-Homo hominins usage of stone tools since there is only fossil evidence of Homo from 2.4-2.3 Ma. The tools found at Lomekwi 3 are dated to ‚âà3.3 Ma which pushes back the evidence of stone tool use by nearly 700,000 years, and further expands the overall archaeological record. Furthermore, these discoveries support the theory of usage of stone tools by non-homo hominids. Harmand and other archaeologists and paleoanthropologists suspect Australophithecines including: A. Africanus, A. Sediba, A. Garhi, A. Aethiopicus, and A. Robustus to be possible non-homo stone tool knappers. The Lomekwi 3 site is still currently under excavation and the West Turkana Archaeological Project team continues fieldwork in the Turkana Basin every summer. = Acheulean Tools = Harmand additionally worked along the northwest shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 2011, recovering and studying acheulean tools. The stone tools found at the Kokiselei 4 site are dated to about 1.76 Ma which pushes the evidence for acheulean tool use back an extra ‚âà300,000 years. Acheulean tools are thought to be connected to Homo Erectus because there were H. erectus fossils found in the same area which are dated at a similar age.  Work at Stony Brook University  Sonia Harmand is currently an associate professor at New York's Stony Brook University teaching in the Anthropology Department. Along with professorial work, Harmand is an associate research scientist at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), and the head of the West Turkana Archeological Project (WTAP) as of 2012. Harmand's research utilizes the cha√Æne op√©ratoire method to aid in her analysis of stone tools, which places emphasis on the interactions between tool-makers and their environment. The central focus of her research at Stony Brook is on the origins of hominin technology and the role of biomechanics in stone tool production.  Honors and Publications  Harmand has received many awards for her work with Early Stone Age archaeology. In 2015, Harmand won both the Stone Age Institute Award for Outstanding Research into Human Origins, and the Field Discovery Award from the Shanghai Archaeology Forum for her work with the Lomekwi 3 tools. The following year, in 2016, she earned the Prix La Recherche archaeology award in Paris, France. In 2017, the T√ºbingen research prize for Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology was awarded to Harmand from the University of T√ºbingen, Germany.

As an adult, he moved to California to work in the aerospace industry. It was there that he met his wife, Nancy, whom he married in 1961.Linfield College, \\"Dick & Nancy Ponzi: Ponzi Vineyards\\" (2010). Bringing Vines to the Valley Exhibit. Image. Submission 12. http://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/vines_gallery/12/ After a trip to Europe, the couple returned to their home in Los Gatos, California, and made wine inspired by what they had experienced. This led to their decision to move their family north to the Willamette Valley of Oregon.  Career  =Engineering= Ponzi had a successful career as a structural engineer in California, initially designing rockets and fighter jets for United Technologies and later working as a ride developer for a company contracted by Disneyland. In 1988, Ponzi designed and built the Weather Machine, a lumino-kinetic bronze sculpture and machine located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon. Built in collaboration with Roger Sheppard and Jere and Ray Grimm, the Weather Machine \\"predicts\\" the weather everyday at noon by displaying a sun (sunny), a heron (drizzle) or a dragon (stormy). =Ponzi Vineyards= Dick and Nancy Ponzi check a sample from a wine barrel. After several research trips to Burgundy, Ponzi moved his family to the Willamette Valley and purchased 20 acres of land southwest of Portland, Oregon, in 1969. He established Ponzi Vineyards in 1970 with his wife, Nancy. At the time, there were just four other wineries in the state. The location was close to Portland, an important factor as they expected the city to be their main market. In 1974, they produced their first vintage of 100 cases of Pinot noir and quickly became known as innovators in enology and viticulture, fabricating their own machinery (such as a destemmer that knocked grapes off of the clusters without crushing them) and developing new winemaking techniques. Much of the machinery and techniques were adopted by other wineries and are still commonly used. The Ponzis planted a two-acre plot of Pinot noir clones in 1975 in a joint venture with Oregon State University to test the clones. In 1981, they purchased a 20-acre parcel that included these two acres, creating their Abetina vineyard (named for the fir trees on the property). The same year they purchased 10 acres downslope from Abetina, which became the Madrona vineyard. Eight acres on the Madrona site were planted with Pinot noir in 1985. Ponzi was among the first to plant Pinot gris commercially in Oregon in 1978, releasing the first bottling in 1984. In 1991, the Ponzis purchased the 65-acre Aurora vineyard, which included plantings that were used to study stocks, varieties and clones. Ponzi passed the title of Winemaker to his daughter, Luisa, in 1993. In 2008, Ponzi designed and built a four-level, gravity-flow winery measuring 30,000 square feet. It is noted for its eco- friendliness and high level of sustainability. Ponzi's vineyards are LIVE (Low Input Viticulture & Enology) certified. =Teaching= While building his wine business, Ponzi took a job teaching engineering at the Community College of Portland. It was there that he met a textbook salesman who was also growing grapes for wine. The salesman was David Lett, founder of The Eyrie Vineyards. He sold Ponzi some of his first vines and connected Ponzi to Dick Erath of Erath Winery, who was also just starting out. Ponzi continued to teach for fifteen years, out of necessity to keep the winery going. = Bridgeport Brewing = Dick and Nancy Ponzi also founded Oregon's first craft brewery, Bridgeport Brewing Company, in 1984, a move which is credited with launching the area's craft brewing craze and helping to popularize India Pale Ale in the United States. They sold the brewery in 1995 to The Gambrinus Company. = Other = Ponzi was a founding member and the first president of the Oregon Winegrowers Association and served as a founding director of the Oregon Wine Advisory Board, now known as the Oregon Wine Board. The couple also opened the Ponzi Wine Bar (a wine tasting room) and The Dundee Bistro (a restaurant focused on Willamette Valley cuisine) in Dundee, Oregon. Winemaking Ponzi's vision was to create a Burgundy-style wine; however, when he attempted to do so using Burgundian methods of adding whole bunches or stems, the results were disappointing. He discovered the problem wasn't in the method, but in how gently the method was applied. By the 1980s, Ponzi had developed a winemaking protocol that became widely adopted by other wineries in the region. It was a very gentle handling method that used whole berries or whole clusters. The must was carried in buckets to the wine press rather than pumped. In 1985, he began allowing grapes to soak before fermentation, a technique that became popular in Burgundy and in other New World wine regions in the 1990s. In the 1990s, Oregon began gaining prominence as a producer of quality wine, with the state's best Pinot noirs from vineyards such as Beaux Fr√®res, Argyle and Archery Summit displaying influence from Ponzi's winemaking style. Family Dick and Nancy Ponzi and their children Luisa, Michel and Anna Maria Ponzi married Nancy Berry in 1961 in California. The entire family was involved in the vineyards and winemaking from the start, with the Ponzi children helping after school and on weekends. Once grown, the children pursued other interests: Anna Maria worked in the magazine business on the East Coast before returning to the winery in 1992; Luisa attended Portland State University and prepared for medical school, returning to the family business in 1990 and deciding to learn winemaking. She went on to train in Burgundy, France, and earn a degree in viticulture and enology. In 1993, Dick Ponzi passed the title and duties of Winemaker to her.  Titles  Ponzi was a founding member and the first president of the Oregon Winegrowers Association. He served as founding director of the Oregon Wine Advisory Board in 1987.  Awards and recognition  In 1988, The Wine Advocate named Ponzi as one of the world's best winemakers and Oregon's best producer. In 1996, Ponzi was chosen as one of Wine Spectator's \\"People Who Made a Difference\\". In 2005, the American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts awarded Ponzi Vintner of the Year. In 2007, the Oregon Wine Board awarded Dick and Nancy Ponzi a Lifetime Achievement Award. Ponzi's Pinot noirs have been ranked among the best American Pinot noirs produced. Influence Dick Ponzi used his background as a structural engineer to construct his own wine making equipment, some of which were adopted by other wineries and are still in use today. Ponzi's background in engineering enabled him to fabricate his own equipment and develop techniques that are now considered commonplace in many wineries around the world, such as using gravity to move wine. Michael G. Etzel‚Äîwinemaker at Beaux Fr√®res Winery, co-owned by his brother-in-law Robert Parker, Jr.‚Äîworked with Ponzi for the 1988 through 1992 vintages and describes Ponzi as his mentor, stating that he makes his wines as Ponzi taught him. Beaux Fr√®res Winery is one of Oregon's most prominent Pinot noir producers. Ponzi is often credited with establishing the style of Oregon Pinot noir. In 1985, Ponzi was among a group that authored a bill that led to the legalization of brewpubs and tasting rooms in Oregon.

She was a lady-in-waiting and confidante of two of the queens of Poland, Marie Louise Gonzaga and Eleanor of Austria, Queen of Poland, and came to play an important part in Polish political life. Life She was the daughter of the French count Antoine de Mailly-Lespine and Genevieve d‚ÄôUfre, widow of prince de Croy. =Lady-in-waiting to Marie-Louise= As a poor distant relation to Marie Louise Gonzaga, she arrived in Poland as a maid-of-honour in service to the queen. She served as maid-of-honour to the queen from 1646 to 1654. She attracted attention by her beauty in the court ballet The Fours Seasons, and was named as one of the nymphs of the queen's court in the poem \\"Psyche\\" by Jan Andrzej Morsztyn. The politically active queen Marie Louise used her ladies-in-waiting to form connections and alliances which could be of use to her in state affairs, and on 28 June 1654 she arranged for Klara Izabella to marry Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac. The marriage are believed to have affected Pac's career, as he was benefited by the court and known for his loyalty to the king. After marriage, she continued as a close companion to the queen. During the Deluge, Klara Izabella accompanied the queen to Silesia and then the royal court around Poland during the war with Sweden, being present with the queen in Gdansk in January 1657, and Silesia in April; she returned to Warsaw in 1659. As most ladies-in-waiting of the politically active queen, Klara Izabella followed the queen's example and engaged actively in state affairs. She is believed to have persuaded her spouse to support the French candidate in the following election of 1661, and she herself raised a sum of 3000 livres to benefit French interests during the election. Being the lady-in-waiting to the queen and constantly present at court, she formed valuable connections, protected the interests of her spouse and benefited him in the eyes of the royal couple, soothing any conflicts between them and him, and maintained connections with foreign rulers through their diplomats, whom she received as guests in the Belvedere Palace her husband had built for her as her residence in Warszaw in 1663. During the 1660s, P. de Bonzy referred to her and Maria Kazimiera Sobieska, her rival as favorite, as one of the two most important and influential women at the Polish court after the queen. =Lady-in-waiting to Eleanor= During the reign of king Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki, she and her husband where the leaders of the Pro-French Pac-Party and suggested a marriage between the king and the French candidate for the position of queen consort in alliance with the French envoy Hugo de Lionne. When this ended in failure in 1669, they made an alliance with Austria instead, and she was appointed lady-in-waiting to the king's new queen, Eleanor of Austria. Klara Izabella Pacowa swiftly managed to gain the confidence of queen Eleanor: reportedly, she helped the newly arrived queen to accustom to Poland and navigate in the political system, and in return became her most influential lady-in-waiting. =Reign of Sobieski= After the death of king Micha≈Ç, she supported the candidacy of Charles of Lorraine in the next election as king of Poland, as he was due to marry the queen dowager, meaning a continuation of Klara's influential role as court favorite. The victory of Sobieski in the election of 1674 was a disappointment: he was married to her former colleague as lady-in-waiting to queen Marie Louise, Maria Kazimiera Sobieska, of whom she had always been a rival and to whom she had a very bad relationship and was not willing to employ her as lady-in-waiting. In 1676, she opposed the wedding between Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac and the queen's sister Maria Anna d'Arquien de la Grange. In 1677, she promised the Brandenburg envoy Johannes von Hoverbeck that she would persuade her husband to influence the king to make peace with Brandenburg, but the relationship between her and her spouse had also deteriorated because of his adultery with Zofia Leszczy≈Ñska. Widowed in 1684, she was left with a fortune in her dower lands, but died of cancer one year later.

History Old Whiston Hospital, 2005 The original hospital at Whiston was established when Prescot Poor Law Union established the Prescot Union Workhouse on Warrington Road in 1843. In 1871 a new general hospital was built with a medical isolation unit added in 1887 for cases of cholera and other serious infectious diseases of the time. From 1904, to protect those from disadvantage in later life, birth certificates of infants born in the workhouse simply gave their address as 1 Warrington Road, Whiston. When the NHS was established in 1948, the hospital, then known as the County Hospital, had 6 main blocks of wards accommodating 500 patients. Renamed Whiston Hospital in 1953, the hospital expanded its range of specialties. In 1960 the 82 bed Burns & Plastic Surgery Unit opened and four years later an Intensive Care Unit and a Pathology Laboratory were built. In 1973 these were joined by a Maternity & Gynaecology Unit and Postgraduate Medical Centre. A scheme to rebuild the hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2006. The works were carried out by Vinci, as part of a scheme with St Helens Hospital, at a cost of ¬£338 million. To mark the completion of the project, the new hospital was officially opened by the Countess of Wessex on 24 April 2013. The only remaining building of the former hospital is the G-Ward block (since converted for administrative and educational facilities and now known as Nightingale House) which was opened in 1996 by the late Dr Eric Sherwood-Jones, a Whiston Hospital doctor and pioneer of intensive care medicine in the UK. Facilities As a teaching hospital, it has well established educational and research relationships with the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University for medical, nursing and allied health professionals. Over 4,000 members of staff are employed across the organisation and as Lead Employer, on behalf of the Mersey Deanery, it is responsible for an additional 2,000 trainee speciality doctors based in hospitals and GP practice placements throughout Merseyside and Cheshire. Whiston Hospital offers the full range of acute healthcare services along with specialist burns care in the Mersey Regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit, serving a population of over four million people across Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales, the Isle of Man and other parts of North West England.

The ship was primarily employed as a fruit carrier during her career. She was named after Rosario di Giorgio, manager of Baltimore branch of Atlantic Fruit Company, and brother of Joseph di Giorgio, founder of the company. Design and Construction Rosario di Giorgio was laid down at Nylands Verksted shipyard in Kristiania and launched on 6 April 1907 (yard number 173). After successful completion of sea trials on May 14, during which the vessel was able to reach the speed of , Rosario di Giorgio was handed over to her owners. In addition to cargo the ship was also fitted to carry 12 first-class passengers. To operate the vessel, she was transferred to a separate company, Dampskibsaktieselskabet \\"Avance\\", owned by Bernhard Hanssen. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Rosario di Giorgio was assessed at , and 1,135DWT. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 132 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After delivery Rosario di Giorgio was immediately chartered to the Atlantic Fruit Company, controlled by di Giorgio family, to transport fruit from West Indies to North American ports. The ship left on May 14, 1907 for Cuba via Tyne in ballast and with 22 passengers, 13 of which were bound for Cuba. The ship arrived at Baracoa on June 4 and then proceeded to Port Antonio arriving there 2 days later. Upon loading the ship sailed for Baltimore where she arrived on June 24 with a cargo of 19,689 bunches of bananas and 3 passengers. After unloading Rosario di Giorgio sailed back to Port Antonio on June 26 and returned to New York on July 11. The ship would continue her fruit trade between Baracoa, Port Antonio, Manchioneal and other Jamaican ports and New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore for the remainder of her career. On her return journeys she was either travelling in ballast, or carried general cargo, mostly food supplies. For example, on January 28, 1908 the ship brought in 14,958 bunches of bananas and 10 bags of coconuts to Baltimore, and loaded 120 barrels of flour for her return trip to Port Antonio. On November 4, 1909 Rosario di Giorgio sailed from Philadelphia for Port Antonio on her regular trip. She arrived near the Jamaican northern shores on November 13, right after the hurricane exited Jamaica, leaving behind widespread flooding and devastation. Several ships were wrecked or went aground during the storm, including German steamer SS Bradford, who on November 7, while attempting to avoid the storm tried to enter Port Antonio but went aground on Hospital reef at the entrance of the harbor. When Rosario di Giorgio tried to enter the harbor on November 13, she tried to steer clear of SS Bradford but still went aground a few feet ahead from the German ship. The vessel was finally refloated on December 15, and after quick repairs sailed for New York. The vessel returned into service in early March 1910. During one of her return trips from Jamaica, Rosario di Giorgio collided with a US Navy collier around 02:30 on August 9, 1910 about 60 miles off Cape Hatteras in misty weather. Marcellus and another collier were on their way to Guantanamo each towing two coal-laden barges. The collision was so strong that Marcellus had her bow practically cut off. Rosario di Giorgio stood by the damaged collier for about five hours before being told her help was no longer needed. Marcellus finally drowned at about 12:55. Rosario di Giorgio arrived in New York the next day with her bow smashed and twisted and was put into drydock for repairs immediately after discharging her cargo. There were no casualties in the accident, and the crew of Marcellus was safely landed at Hampton Roads by Leonidas. The subsequent naval inquiry into the accident found Rosario di Giorgio solely at fault for the collision, and entered a claim against her for $125,000. After undergoing repairs the ship returned to service in early September 1910, departing New York for Port Antonio on September 6 and resumed her trade service between East coast ports and Jamaica. On her last trip the vessel departed from Baltimore on January 18, 1911 for Port Antonio and other Jamaican ports and arrived off Manchioneal in the afternoon of January 25. As she was entering the harbor, the ship went aground and got stranded on the reef on the northern side of the entrance to Manchioneal Harbor, on the east coast of Jamaica. Due to impact the boilers got displaced and her hull was penetrated by coral rocks causing quick flooding of the engine room. A wrecking steamer was sent to her aid but bad weather prevented any attempts to salvage the ship until mid-February. Finally, an attempt was made to refloat Rosario di Giorgio on February 11, but the ship soon started drifting broadside on the reefs and on February 14, 1911 it was decided to abandon her.

She was the daughter of Warsaw burgher Jan Giza, a merchant and usurer, and his wife Anna, whose origins are unknown. Life According to tradition, she was born in a tenement house at 5 ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska Street in a Warsaw patrician family from Franconia. She had a sister who was married to Krzysztof Szaw≈Çowski. She grew up in a convent of Bernardine nuns outside Warsaw. Young Barbara was met by the royal servant, Miko≈Çaj Mniszech. The Jewish merchant Egidius made his visits to Gizanka easier. Mniszech visited Barbara in the guise of a nun. The circumstances in which Barbara met the King are unknown. Probably Mniszech family used the girl's physical resemblance to the late Queen Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç to gain influence over the King. Most likely, Barbara met Sigismund II Augustus at the end of 1570, but according to an investigation carried out after the King's death, Barbara was brought to the king on 6 January 1571. Their relationship attracted considerable attention and was regarded as a scandal. Eight months later, on 8 September 1571, she gave birth to a daughter, Barbara. The nobility didn't believe in the King's paternity, but Sigismund II Augustus didn't pay attention to the voices of the opposing court. After her daughter was born, Barbara became the King's constant companion. However, despite his relationship with Barbara, Sigismund II Augustus didn't ended his affair with Anna ZajƒÖczkowska, who was staying in Wit√≥w. The King gave Barbara 20,000 z≈Çoty and arranged a palace for her in Bron√≥w. Thanks to Barbara's intercession, the Vice-Chancellor Franciszek Krasi≈Ñski obtained the position of the Bishop of Krak√≥w, and the Grand Crown Marshal Jan Firlej secured his position of Voivode of Krak√≥w. After the death of the Queen Catherine of Austria in February 1572, rumors circulated that Sigismund II Augustus wanted to marry Barbara. In June 1572, Barbara left with her lover to Knyszyn, where on 7 July the King died aged 51. Before 14 July 1573, Barbara Giza married the prince of Volhynia, Micha≈Ç Woroniecki, Prince of Volhynia, who legally recognized her daughter. Six children were born from this marriage: Miko≈Çaj (died after 1601), Stefan (a priest; died after 1614), Jakub (died after 1621), Florian Tomasz (a Dominican monk in Warsaw; born 1586, died after 5 June 1615), Katarzyna (wife of Jakub Pilchowski; died after 1592) and Anna (wife of Jan Kosi≈Ñski; died after 1614).
