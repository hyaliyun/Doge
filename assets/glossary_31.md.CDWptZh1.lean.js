Amritsari papad is famous throughout India, and is also exported abroad. Like papad elsewhere in India, Amritsari papad is made from seasoned dough, usually of hulled urad daal flour, seasoned liberally with salt, black pepper, heeng (asafoetida), cumin, coriander, pomegranate seeds, and sometimes garlic. The proportions are highly variable, leading to a large variety in taste and pungency. The dough is rolled into wafer thin discs the size of a small plate, and sun-dried to prepare raw papad. Flours from other sources such as lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca or potato, are sometimes used. Dried papad will keep for several months without refrigeration. Although now done by machines, papad was traditionally rolled out by hand, requiring a fair amount of force because of the dryness of the dough  indeed, In Hindi and Punjabi, \\"papad belna\\" (rolling out papad) is still a metaphor for any laborious or arduous task. Papad is prepared by roasting in an oven or on an open flame, and because it is so thin and dry, takes but a fraction of a minute to be done. In Punjab, it is typically served as an accompaniment to a meal after roasting in an oven or on an open flame, but elsewhere in India it is also eaten as an appetizer or snack, with toppings such as chopped onions, carrots, chutney or other dips and condiments. Papad is a low calorie food but has a high sodium content. Amritsari Vadiyan Amritsari Vadi (plural: vadiyan) is also made similarly from dough prepared from a paste of ground urad dal, with salt, black pepper, heeng, red chili, coriander seeds, salt, cumin seeds etc. added to it. Paste is shaped by hand into half round 5 cm balls, and spread out on sheets for sun-drying. Like papad, dried vadis can be kept for months. Dried vadis are cracked into bite sized pieces and added to curries and vegetable dishes. These give the dishes a smoky and piquant taste.Amritsari Vadi Until recently, the traditional papad and vadiyan makers of Amritsar were concentrated in a famous street known as the Papad Vadiyan Bazaar near the Golden Temple. The Bazaar was suffused with the pungent aroma of the spices used to make papad and wadiyan, and visitors to the bazaar often remembered the smell as an unforgettable experience. After the implementation of the Galiara Project begun in 1988, aimed at beautification of the Golden Temple surroundings, these papad makers were spread out in the surrounding area.

It is found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprotroph on the rotting wood of deciduous trees, including trunks and roots. It can also grow on wood buried near the surface, making it seem as if it is fruiting in grass. Taxonomy The fungus was originally described by Wilhelm Gottfried Lasch in 1828, as a member of the genus Agaricus. After being shuffled to several different genera in its taxonomic history, it was transferred to Pholiota by Rolf Singer in 1951. Description The fungus makes fruitbodies with straw-yellow to beige caps measuring in diameter. The crowded gills on the cap underside have an adnate attachment to the stipe. Initially pale yellow, they turn brownish in age as the spores mature. The mushroom makes a brown spore print. Spores are smooth, thin-walled, somewhat bean-shaped (subphaseoliform), and measure 6‚Äì8 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 ¬µm.

Jones, age 72, was the oldest person on Georgia's death row at the time he was executed. During his time on death row, he became a published writer of essays and articles, as well as completing two book-length manuscripts of historical fiction and autobiography. He was also a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.  Crime and sentence  Jones was first sentenced to death on October 17, 1979 for his involvement in the felony murder of Roger Tackett on June 17 of that year during a robbery of a Tenneco convenience store, of which Tackett was the manager. Jones was convicted in relation to this murder along with Van Roosevelt Solomon (December 1, 1943 - February 20, 1985), who was executed in 1985 by electrocution at age 41. In 1989, a federal court ordered Jones to be re-sentenced because the jurors who had convicted him had improperly brought a Bible into the deliberation room. He was re-sentenced to death in 1997. In January 2016, Jones' attorneys asked the Butts County Superior Court to stop his execution by challenging the state's injection drug secrecy law, and arguing that the death penalty was too harsh a punishment for his crime. Both arguments were rejected by the court. On February 2, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit voted 6-5 not to hear Jones' challenge of Georgia's drug secrecy law. Jones was executed early on February 3, 2016 by lethal IV injection, ten days before his 73rd birthday. The executioner team struggled for an hour to insert the IV into Jones' veins, spending 24 minutes trying to get it into a vein in his left arm, another eight minutes trying his right arm and then they asked a doctor in attendance to insert it into Jones' groin which took 13 minutes. Jones was pronounced dead at 12:46 AM.

Along with Regular Army Training Regiments (ATR), they provide Basic Training to Army Reserve recruits, except those joining 4 PARA. Reserves recruits are selected at an Army Recruit Selection Centre. They then undertake a short basic training course known as ‚Äòalpha', over four weekends or a residential week. The alpha course is followed by a 15.5-day residential 'bravo' course to achieve trained soldier status. These generic courses teach essential elements of the Regular Common Military Syllabus 2014 (CMS 14). Recruits will then attend Initial Trade Training courses as stipulated by their cap badge / Corps. The Honourable Artillery Company currently runs its own alpha course twice a year. The current ATUs include: * Army Training Unit North, at Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Strensall (part of York Garrison) * Army Training Unit Northern Ireland, at Ballykinler Training Centre * Army Training Unit Scotland, at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh * Army Training Unit West, at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter and Maindy Barracks, Cardiff = Army Personnel Centre = The Centre is located in Glasgow.

It is Pahang's first Sekolah Menengah Agama Persekutuan (SMAP) and Malaysia's third, after Sekolah Menengah Agama Persekutuan Labu and Sekolah Menengah Agama Persekutuan Kajang. SUPERB was the first residential school which implemented the Ministry of Education's Tahfiz Model Ulul Albab program (in 2014), in which students undergo the Tahfiz program with five years of study. With the TMUA, SMAP Bentong aims to produce students with outstanding academic and co-curriculum records. The program will be implemented in other SBPs.  History  Construction of SM Agama Persekutuan Bentong began on 10 April 2008, and was completed in October 2011 at a total cost of RM 56.6 million. The school covers an area of . The acronym SUPERB was coined by Khairil Azwar Razali, the school's first head of its English-language department. SMAP Bentong began operation on 11 June 2012, with 20 teachers, eight staff members, and its initial batch of students. The following year, SM Agama Persekutuan Bentong received two more batches: Predominate 1317 and Valours 1314. With the three batches, SMAP Bentong received several awards and certificates.  Location  SMAP Bentong is in the FELDA settlement of Mempaga. The nearest towns are Karak and Bentong, 30 minutes away by road.  Motto  The school's motto is \\"Melangkaui Kecemerlangan\\" (\\"Exceeding excellence\\"). It was suggested by Khairil Azwar Razali when he coined its acronym, SUPERB.  School principles  SM Bentong emphasizes three main principles: agama (religion), ilmu (knowledge) and amal (good deeds). The integration of these three principles is considered vital.  Badge  The school badge has a black-and-white background, reflecting the state colors of Pahang. The image of the Quran on a rehal indicates SM Bentong's religious affiliation as Malaysia's third Sekolah Menengah Agama Persekutuan (SMAP). The atomic symbol reflects the integration of science and information and communications technology (ICT) in the curriculum. The ivory (gading) color indicates student aspirations to pursue their studies to the university level () and the students' spirituality, strength, optimism and quality. The school principles (agama, ilmu and amal) are at the badge's center.  Song  The school song is in Malay: > Menjunjung tinggi wawasan Al-Quran, Penuh inspirasi menjadi terbilang, SMAP > Bentong SUPERB nilai pendidikan, Ilmu dijana untuk umat cemerlang, (chorus) > Keteguhan ilmu, iman dan amal, Keupayaan pendidik berwawasan, Obor insan > sepanjang zaman, SMAP Bentong SUPERB terus ke hadapan, Berdiri bangsa kerana > ilmuwan, SMAP Bentong SUPERB menyahut cabaran, Modal insan penuh ketakwaan, > Untuk generasi masa hadapan.

It has three approaches: * Quranic: Enables students to memorize all 30 chapters (juzu') of the Quran and understand its contents in five years of secondary-school study. * Encyclopedic: Provides a foundation for students to master a variety of sciences and languages, making the students a reference source for their peers. * Ijtihadik: Produces students who can express opinions to solve problems, maximizing creative higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). Students can participate in extra- curricular activities such as horseback riding, swimming and archery. The implementation of the TMUA) in selected schools, under the supervision of the Education Ministry, is expected to produce 10,920 students who have memorized the Quran by 2021. It will provide an alternative to parents who want their children to be huffaz and hold professional positions.

Description Har cheong gai is regarded as one of the most popular family fried chicken dishes in Singapore, and is made with fermented shrimp paste (har cheong) and a host of other spices and ingredients. The shrimp paste used is not the darker Malaysian style paste used for rojak sauce, but the pinkish grey southeastern Chinese style. The recipe for har cheong gai differs from other fried chicken recipes in that the marinade and the batter are not separate; rather wheat flour and potato or corn starch is added to the marinade, creating a seasoned batter. Depending on the recipe followed this is done at the very startor just prior to frying after the chicken has been allowed to marinate, in both cases the chicken is often allowed to marinate overnight,  Har cheong gai burger  A har cheong gai burger is a chicken sandwich from Singapore.

When he joined for engineering,http://epaper.newindianexpress.com/527086/The-New- Indian-Express-Kochi/23062015#page/20/2 cinematography and the film industry was in the back of his mind. His passion for photography grew when he spent his free time during his studies in his uncle's studio. It wasn't until Madathil went to IAB Digital Studio at Coimbatore where his passion for cinematography shined. This was where Madathil became a cinematographer.http://cinematographervenugopaalan.blogspot.in/ While there, he learnt film developing and other related jobs during his free time. This interest drifted him away from engineering and into cinematography. A strict father was totally troubled with his son's attitude. He was not at all interested in his son entering the film industry, but the adamant son finally got the permission from his father and went to Chennai to do a course in photography. Cinema career After his course, his father 's close friend Mr. M. T. Vasudevan Nair introduced him to Mr. Jayanan Vincent. He was appointed as Vincent's assistant for the next film \\"Uyaranagalil\\". Unfortunately, before he could step into the film industry, Madathil's father died. He put a temporary full stop to his ambitions and returned home. After a long interval he returned to the film industry as an assistant for M T Vasudevan Nair's \\"Anubandam\\". This was a turning point in Madathil's life. He also worked as an independent cameraman for the Tamil film \\"Pournami Rojakkal\\". His first independent Malayalam film was Mr. Kaladharan's \\"Ellarum Chollunnu\\". He was also given the freedom to work with His Guru for the film \\"Oh Fabby\\". The most unexpected and memorable momenthttp://akpa.in/content/inauguration-photography-ostentation-mr- venugopal-cine-cameraman was the release of the film \\"Jayanan Vincent and Venugopal\\".

Early life Macmillan Brown was the younger of two daughters of John Macmillan Brown, one of the founding professors of Canterbury University College, Christchurch, and Helen Connon, the principal of Christchurch Girls' High School and first woman graduate with honours in the British Empire. She and her sister Millicent initially lived in a large Fendalton mansion. They were taught by a governess and also had lessons from their mother. However, when Macmillan Brown was five years old her mother died suddenly, and as a result, the girls were raised by their governess. Their father moved the family home to the hill suburb of Cashmere and, apart from her time spent overseas, Macmillan Brown lived there with him until his death. Education Around 1915, Macmillan Brown began studying at the Canterbury College School of Art, and four years later moved to Sydney to study at the Julian Ashton Art School. Around 1922, Macmillan Brown went to England and studied art at the Slade School of Fine Art and the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. She also travelled to Italy and spent a year in Florence. Career Around 1927, Macmillan Brown was a founding member of a group of Canterbury artists known as The Group. These were artists who wanted to move away from the traditions of the art world, and start a modernist movement. She exhibited and worked with The Group until 1936, when she left New Zealand. Her work was included in a 1947 retrospective exhibition by The Group. Macmillan Brown was a lifelong friend of the writer Ngaio Marsh (both grew up in the suburb of Cashmere). A sketch of Marsh by Macmillan Brown is held at the Macmillan Brown Library at the University of Canterbury, and an oil painting at the Ngaio Marsh House. Personal life After her father's death in 1935, Macmillan Brown left New Zealand and went to England to marry Antonio Notariello. Notariello was an Italian opera singer and although the pair had known each other for some years (Notariello had lived in Christchurch from 1923 to 1926), Macmillan Brown's father had not approved of a marriage between them. The couple married in Bournemouth, England, in November 1936. They had two daughters, Antonietta and Felicity. Antonietta is a professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and Felicity is a concert violinist. Notariello died in 1975.

The building is an excellent example of Romanesque Revival Style.Ceremonial Hall of the Prague Chevra Kadisha  History  The present Ceremonial Hall has replaced an older building serving the same purpose. It was constructed by A. Gabriel a J. Gerstel between 1906 and 1908. Its appearance, including the details like the bases and capitals of columns, the grille and the door, holds strictly to the Romanesque Revival style. As long as the Prague Jewish Burial Society used the space, the morgue was in the basement, on the first floor there was a room for the ritual purification of the dead (taharah) and on the second floor there was a meeting room, where the Society held its meetings as well as annual banquets. Since World War I the Burial Society has not used the hall for its original purpose. In 1926 the Society rented the building to the Jewish Museum in Prague, which has used it ever since.  Today  In 1997 the Ceremonial Hall was reconstructed. The exposition which was opened there at the time is linked with the original usage of the space, introducing visitors to Jewish rituals held over the dying and the deceased (thus the exposition about the important milestones of Jewish life from the Klausen Synagogue is continued there), providing them with information about the Old Jewish Cemetery and other cemeteries in the Czech lands and the institution of the Prague Jewish Burial Society.  Jewish Burial Society cycle of paintings  An important monument left by the Burial Society to posterity is a cycle of fifteen paintings, depicting rituals and customs performed by the Burial Society. An anonymous author fulfilled the order of the Society from around the year 1772 and followed the Baroque painting style. However, the motive of the Society, which hired him, originated probably from the new, enlightened, age: in keeping with the enlightened ideology it was supposed to show an important social role, which the Society had maintained for centuries. The paintings also depict the final period of the history of the Old Jewish Cemetery which makes the cycle even more valuable.

He advocates for an economic school of thought that brings together ethics, environmental preservation, and society.  Peasantry and agrarian capitalism  Abramovay defended his PhD thesis (\\"Paradigms of agrarian capitalism in question\\") in 1991. The thesis received the \\"Best Doctoral Thesis\\" Award from the VII University Thesis and Scientific Works Competition in 1991, promoted by the National Association of Graduate Programs and Research in Social Sciences (Anpocs). Abramovay maintains that it is around the family establishment that agriculture is socially structured in advanced countries. Both in economically developed nations of recent colonization (USA and Canada), and in others with secular peasant traditions (Continental Europe) an atomized sector operates in millions of productive agricultural units orchestrated by the planning, command and control of the State and professional organizations. Abramovay says: \\"Despite its individual base, it is difficult to imagine a more socialized economic activity\\". After realizing that there is no theory of the agrarian question in Karl Marx and questioning the stated Marxist paradigm, the author presents scholars who deal with the \\"functioning of this particular organism, which is the peasant unit\\". The existence of the \\"peasantry\\" presupposes a set of social ties given by tradition, by the community, by personalized relations of dependence and equality, and incomplete and partial integration in the market. Based on economic sociology, Abramovay argues that \\"where capitalism is implanted, where the market begins to dominate social life, where economic rationality takes over the behavior of individuals, community ties end up losing their aggregating power and peasants see the objective bases of their own social reproduction vanish\\".  Sociology of markets  In the 1990s, Abramovay refined the field of rural sociology with research on sustainable agriculture, the ‚Äúsocial capital of the territories‚Äù and the social construction of alternative agricultural markets based on an analysis of social networks and relationships. In the 2000s, Abramovay's studies moved between forms of market organization, the role of civil society in local development, the emergence of an environmental responsibility discourse in the corporate environment and the need for a methodological break to understand the markets in their social dimension. According to Abramovay, the main feature of the new economic sociology is to study markets not as abstract mechanisms of balance, but as social constructions. For Abramovay, markets came to be seen as forms of social coordination characterized by conflicts, dependencies, structures and unpredictabilities that are very distant from the canonical image enshrined in Walras' general equilibrium theory. Contemporary economic sociology has the characteristic of conceiving markets as results of specific, rooted, socially determined forms of social interaction, and not as premises whose study can be done in a strictly deductive way. Departing from Stefano Zamagni, Abramovay argues that markets can be seen as real and living social relationships. Market relations assume the permanent attempt to seek recognition by the other and, therefore, involve, to some degree, reciprocity in that recognition. As professor of economic sociology at the University of S√£o Paulo, Abramovay has been responsible for disseminating the works of Harrison White, Mark Granovetter, Richard Swedberg and thinkers in the tradition of Karl Polanyi.  Digital economy and data ethics  Since 2015, Ricardo Abramovay's publications have focused on the impacts of digital transformation for the economy and society. In \\"hybrid economy of the 21st century\\", Abramovay argues that the Internet economy provides a reinvention of productive arrangements, coupled with a knowledge economy, making specific configurations for these new markets. In 2018, Ricardo Abramovay founded the Center for Ethics, Technology and Digital Economies at the Institute of Energy and Environment of the University of S√£o Paulo. The Nucleus is composed of students from different disciplines. In 2019, Ricardo Abramovay published two essays with activist and lawyer Rafael Zanatta. In \\"Data, addictions and competition\\", published in Advanced Studies, Abramovay analyzes the interrelationship between platform design, retaining users' attention and maximizing the extraction of value by their personal data. Abramovay and Zanatta argue that discussions about orchestrating economic behavior and discriminating prices by profiles can generate a renewed antitrust agenda. In \\"Open personal data\\", Abramovay and Zanatta analyze the work of thinkers like Roberto Mangabeira Unger and Jaron Lanier and propose data sharing arrangements in digital markets, conceptualizing personal data as a common good and shared economic asset to promote economic democracy.

The West Indies won the match by 4 wickets, thus becoming the first team to win the ICC World Twenty20 twice. The match recorded the highest attendance ever for an ICC World T20 Finals. Background Prior to the tournament, there were concerns that some of the West Indies players may withdraw from the tournament with a dispute over pay, with a possibility of a second-string team being sent. West Indies captain Darren Sammy had exchanged letters with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) expressing his concerns regarding the payment players were due to receive for taking part in the tournament. Sammy went on to say that \\"...we want to play and will represent the West Indies to the best of our abilities\\". Before this match England and the West Indies had played each other in two ICC finals ‚Äì the final of the 1979 World Cup at Lord's and the final of the 2004 Champions Trophy final at the Oval ‚Äì both of which the West Indies won. This was also the first final between two previous champions ‚Äì England won the 2010 World T20 for their first ICC world championship while the West Indies won the 2012 World T20. Both teams were drawn into Super 10s Group 1 alongside Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and South Africa. They played each other in their opening game on 16 March at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, with the West Indies winning by six wickets with 11 balls to spare. West Indian opener Chris Gayle scored an unbeaten 100 runs off 47 balls, including 11 sixes, becoming the first player to hit two T20 International centuries. Immediately before the men's final, the West Indies won the women's tournament with an eight-wicket victory over three-time defending champions Australia, also at Eden Gardens, which gave them the chance to be the first to win both the men's and women's World Twenty20 on the same day. Road to the Final =England= Despite having been the 2010 World T20 champions, England had not advanced past the group stage of the previous year's World Cup and had included only one member of their 2010 champion squad ‚Äì Irish-born batsman and captain Eoin Morgan. Despite selecting a relatively inexperienced team, England did include players who had World Cup experience and had won Ashes series. They were also in the midst of a limited overs overhaul that eventually brought them victory in the 2019 World Cup on home soil, with members who eventually played in both tournaments including batsmen Joe Root and Jason Roy, all-rounder Ben Stokes, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, fast bowler Liam Plunkett and leg-spinner Adil Rashid. After their loss to the West Indies, England beat South Africa with the highest successful run chase (229) in World T20 history before beating Afghanistan and then Sri Lanka to reach the semifinal. In the semifinal they came up against unbeaten New Zealand in Delhi. New Zealand made a strong start to be 89 for 1 after 10 overs, before tight bowling by Stokes and Chris Jordan kept them to 153. Opener Roy scored 78 off 44, a Man of the Match performance, to lead England to a seven-wicket victory with 17 balls remaining. =West Indies= Despite subpar performances in Test and ODI play, the West Indies were confident heading into the tournament and entered the final as the second-ranked T20 team behind only India. Much of this was due to the number of players with IPL experience and that the majority were part of the 2012 champion squad. Off-spinner Sunil Narine and all-rounder Kieron Pollard were notable exceptions, but the Windies still fielded power-hitting all-rounders Chris Gayle, Andre Russell and Marlon Samuels in addition to captain Darren Sammy among others. After prevailing against England, they defeated Sri Lanka in a rematch of the 2012 final and then South Africa. They suffered an upset loss to Afghanistan in their final group match, but with first place in the group already secured. In the semifinal they came up against the hosts India in Mumbai, and India batted first with Virat Kohli's unbeaten 89 off 47 propelling India to 192/2 in their 20 overs. In reply, Gayle was bowled for just 5 and Samuels was dismissed soon after to leave the West Indies in trouble at 19/2. However, power hitting saw the West Indies home, with Russell‚Äôs six off Kohli with two balls to spare clinching a win by seven wickets. Late replacement Lendl Simmons led the chase, surviving being caught twice off no-balls to score an unbeaten 82 off 51 balls and earn Man of the Match. Match details =Match summary = The West Indies started well with Badree bowling Roy for a duck with just the second ball and fellow opener Alex Hales being caught off Andre Russell in the second over. Morgan was caught at slip by Gayle off Badree to leave England at 3/23 after 4.4 overs. Root helped England climb back into the game with 54 off 36, but he was caught playing an uncharacteristic paddle sweep off Carlos Brathwaite. Dwayne Bravo then took two wickets in three balls dropping England from 110/4 to 111/7. Batting deep, England managed to finish at 155/9 after their 20 overs. Root was a surprising choice to bowl the second over of the West Indian innings but immediately dismissed both Gayle and fellow opener Johnson Charles. David Willey subsequently had Simmons out LBW for a golden duck leaving the West Indies 11/3 in the third over. A partnership of 75 between Bravo and Samuels kept the West Indies in the game and they were still in with a chance with 45 runs needed from the last four overs. Tight bowling left them nineteen runs behind going into the final over, but Brathwaite hit four consecutive sixes off the first four balls from Ben Stokes to seal the win. Only three West Indian batsmen reached double figures: Samuels, Brathwaite and Bravo. Samuels finished with an unbeaten 85 off 66, the highest score in World Twenty20 final history. Brathwaite broke the record for the most runs by a single batsman in the final over of a successful chase (Brathwaite's 24 beating Michael Hussey's 22 for Australia off Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal in the 2010 semifinals in St. Lucia). Samuels earned Man of the Match for his 85 not out for his second World Twenty20 final Man of the Match and his second final half century. Victory meant that the West Indies had won their fourth ICC world championship after the 1975 and 1979 World Cups and the 2012 World Twenty20. They also became the first to win two men's World Twenty20s and the first to win both the women's and men's tournaments on the same day. = Match officials = * Umpires : Rod Tucker (Australia) and Kumar Dharmasena (Sri Lanka) * TV umpire : Marais Erasmus (South Africa) * Match referee : Ranjan Madugalle (Sri Lanka) * Reserve umpire : Bruce Oxenford (Australia) =Post match= At the presentation ceremony, man of the match Marlon Samuels dedicated his award to Shane Warne, saying \\"I answer with the bat, not the mic\\". This was in response to an ongoing war-of-words between the two players that dates back to an altercation at the 2013‚Äì14 Big Bash League. West Indies captain Darren Sammy criticised the WICB during the presentation speech, saying \\"I'm yet to hear from our own cricket board (during the tournament). That is very disappointing\\". England captain Eoin Morgan said that \\"we let ourselves down with the bat and probably fell about 40 short\\" and defended Ben Stokes bowling in the final over saying \\"it's not his fault\\". Following the conclusion of the match, the ICC named its World Twenty20 team of the tournament. This included two players from the West Indies team (Andre Russell and Samuel Badree) and four players from the England team (Jason Roy, Joe Root, Jos Buttler and David Willey). In Saint Lucia, the Beaus√©jour Stadium was renamed the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, following the West Indies win. On 25 April, the ICC reprimanded some of the West Indies players for their comments at the post- match interviews saying that \\"certain comments and actions were inappropriate, disrespectful and brought the event into disrepute\\".

Arlin originally worked as an engineer and later foreman for the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company when he was hired as a part-time announcer by KDKA, the nation's first commercially licensed radio station, in Pittsburgh in 1920. On November 2, 1920, Arlin made history as the radio's first announcer when he read over-the-air the returns to the 1920 presidential election between Senator Warren G. Harding and Governor James M. Cox. Arlin was soon hired full-time at KDKA. During his tenure at KDKA, Arlin became the first to announce radio broadcasts of a baseball game (August 5, 1921), tennis match (August 6, 1921), football game (October 8, 1921), and a boxing match (September 14, 1923). Arlin also interviewed many celebrities on the air, including Babe Ruth, Will Rogers, Lillian Gish and William Jennings Bryan. He spent five years at KDKA, where he was nicknamed the \\"Voice of America\\". Listeners on several continents could hear KDKA and Arlin's broadcasts, and The London Times called him \\"the best known American voice in Europe\\". Early life and education Harold Wampler Arlin was born December 8, 1895 in La Harpe, Illinois to parents Byron Addison Arlin (1862-1918) and Emma (n√©e Wampler) (1865-1944). His father was a farmer. Arlin also had an older sister named Lora. The Arlins moved to Carthage, Missouri shortly after Harold's birth. Arlin graduated with a degree in engineering from the University of Kansas in 1917 and soon after moved to Pittsburgh where he obtained a job as an electrical engineer for the Westinghouse Electric Company. Radio =KDKA= 1920 presidential election returns KDKA 1020 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania received its broadcasting license on November 2, 1920, making the station the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Dr. Frank Conrad, friend and fellow Westinghouse engineer as well as one of the founders of KDKA, invited Arlin and several others engineers from Westinghouse to a tour of the KDKA studios which, at the time, were in a shack on the roof of a Westinghouse plant. Whilst on the roof, another friend invited Arlin to say a few words into a microphone nearby. Arlin did, and because his voice proved clear, crisp, resonant, friendly and appealing, Arlin was hired as a full-time announcer, making him the first radio announcer in the world. The station's inaugural broadcast was the reading of the returns from the election held earlier that day. Arlin read the results on a makeshift microphone in a shack on the roof atop the K Building of the Westinghouse Electric Company \\"East Pittsburgh Works\\" in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Pirates vs. Phillies game On August 5, 1921, Arlin became the first person to announce a Major League Baseball game and the game itself was the first baseball game ever broadcast on radio. The teams playing that day were the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies from the historic Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. Arlin sat in a converted ground-level box seat at Forbes Field and provided play-by- play analysis of the game using a converted telephone as a microphone and some jerry-rigged equipment set up behind home plate. The game was broadcast over Arlin's KDKA. In the end, the visiting Phillies lost to the homebound Pirates 8-5. KDKA's broadcast of the Pirates vs. Phillies game provided the inspiration for other radio stations across the country over the next few years to broadcast games like baseball and other professional sports. Soon after, radio baseball began its rapid ascent in American culture. Before radio, fans turned to visual displays or structures that showed the progress of a game. These structures were usually manually operated by someone who was informed about the game through telegraph. Tennis and the West Virginia vs. Pittsburgh football game On August 6, the very next day after the baseball game broadcast, Arlin announced the first radio broadcast of a tennis match also over KDKA. Arlin announced the quarterfinals of the match which began on the 4th. Australia took on Great Britain at the Allegheny County Club in Pittsburgh for the prestigious Davis Cup. Australia beat Great Britain 3-2 and went all the way to the finals only to lose to Japan 4-1. KDKA again made history in the fall of 1921 when they broadcast the first live radio broadcast of a college football game. On October 8, Arlin, from the same box seat at Forbes Field used to broadcast the Pirates vs. Phillies game two months earlier, provided play-by-play to listeners at home of the Backyard Brawl rivalry game between the University of Pittsburgh Panthers and the West Virginia University Mountaineers. Pittsburgh won the game 21‚Äì13, after West Virginia's George Hill returned a kick-off for a touchdown on the final play of the game. Dempsey vs. Firpo fight On September 14, 1923, heavyweights Jack Dempsey and Luis √Ångel Firpo fought for the champion heavyweight title in what has been called the boxing match of the century. The fight marked the first time a Latin American fighter would challenge for the world Heavyweight title and was the first boxing match broadcast over the radio. Dempsey had been champion since 1919, and Firpo was one of the top heavyweights of the world, nicknamed \\"El Toro de las Pampas\\" (\\"The Bull of the Pampas\\"). 80,000 fans paid to see the fight live. Dempsey won the fight and Arlin did a recreation of the events over the radio from a wire report sent to him from the ringside in New York City. Just as Arlin told listeners, \\"Firpo threw a terrific right, knocking Dempsey out of the ring\\", his in to New York broke. Another announcer, standing by for such an emergency, grabbed the nearest piece of copy and began reading \\"...with hogs up two cents a pound...\\".Rotarian, p. 62 =Other= Arlin goes international That same year, Arlin announced the first short-wave broadcast to Great Britain. This gave Arlin more range and notoriety and popularity throughout the world. Arlin's voice soon could be heard on the short-wave radio broadcasts to the cities of Johannesburg, South Africa and Melbourne, Australia. His newfound recognition was noted in an article from The London Times that called Arlin \\"the best known American voice in Europe\\". In 1924, Arlin was voted most popular radio announcer and in 1925, he helped organized the Radio Announcers of America. Celebrity interview Harold Arlin is also believed amongst many historians to be the first to utilize the celebrity interview. There are no immediate available sources to dispute this claim. During his time at KDKA, Arlin interviewed on the air humorist Will Rogers, actress Lillian Gish, orator/politician William Jennings Bryan and baseball legend Babe Ruth. Arlin later recalled in an interview conducted in 1952 that Ruth had such a terrible case of \\"mike fright\\" that Arlin had to take the script out of his hands and read it himself. Later years and retirement Arlin left KDKA and radio altogether in 1925. Arlin also left Pittsburgh taking his wife and children and moving to Mansfield, Ohio the following year. Arlin also returned to engineering becoming the personnel manager for Westinghouse's Mansfield manufacturing plant. Arlin also became very active and productive in the city of Mansfield. In his later years, Arlin accepted positions on Mansfield's Chamber of Commerce, Board of Education, local Boy Scouts, Community Fund and served as president of the city's Rotary Club from 1934 to 1935 and attended the Rotary International Convention in Nice in 1937.Rotarian, p. 64 Personal life =Marriages, children and family= Arlin was married three times. His first wife was Emily Pace. Pace was born in 1897 to Arthur Pace and Emily (n√©e Riley) in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. Arlin and Pace were married in 1920 and had three children together; Ralph Wampler Arlin (October 13, 1921-June 25, 2006), Edward Arlin and Dorothy Hershey. The two remained married for 34 years until Pace's death at age 56 on September 14, 1954. There are no available records of his second marriage. His third marriage was to Ida Lee Dean. They were married sometime in the early 1970s and remained so until Arlin's death. Edward S. \\"Ed\\" Arlin was born on July 8, 1924 in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Mansfield Senior High School in 1942, served as an Ensign in the United States Navy during World War II before returning home and graduating from the University of Cincinnati. Ed Arlin was also a member of the 1946 University of Georgia National Football Championship team. Ed retired from Portage Electric Products of North Canton, Ohio and was a former partner and co-founder of Norwalk Thermostat in Norwalk, Ohio where he moved to in 1958. Arlin was married for 60 years to E. Joan Beard and the two had six children. Ed Arlin died on November 12, 2011 age 87 at the Fisher-Titus Medical Center in Norwalk. Dorothy Hershey was born Dorothy Arlin on April 7, 1926 in Mansfield. Like her brothers, Hershey graduated from Mansfield Senior High School. She later attended and graduated from Miami University. She was employed by Norwalk City Schools as a substitute teacher in the late 1950s and was head of the drapery department at Hills Interiors in Norwalk from 1960 to 1980. Hershey was a member of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA) for 80 years, serving as the Norwalk Girl Scout neighborhood chairman from 1956 to 1968. She was also a member of the Norwalk First United Methodist Church. Hershey was married for 55 years to Howard A. Hershey, the athletic director at Norwalk High School, who preceded her in death. The Hersheys had two children together; Lura Magi and David Hershey. Hershey died on October 13, 2013, at Stein Hospice Care Center in Sandusky, Ohio. Arlin's grandson Steven Ralph Arlin, more commonly known as Steve Arlin, is a former professional baseball player, a major league pitcher with the San Diego Padres and Cleveland Indians for six seasons from 1969 to 1974. =1952 presidential election= On November 4, 1952, Arlin temporarily returned to radio, announcing his first radio broadcast in twenty-seven years. The broadcast was sponsored by Westinghouse, Arlin's former employer, and was the results from the presidential election held that day between former General Dwight D. Eisenhower and former Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson. Like the Harding-Cox election returns 32 years before, Arlin read the results over the air to an entire nation of listeners. Republican Eisenhower won the election and was President of the United States until 1961. =Pirates vs. Padres baseball game= In 1972, Arlin announced his first professional baseball game in more than 50 years. The game was between the Pirates and the Padres. Arlin's grandson Steve was pitcher for the Padres at this time. Announcer Bob Prince invited Arlin to come back to the broadcasting booth. Prince and Arlin announced the game together as the Padres won. For announcing the game, Arlin received a certificate and a pair of shoes which, according to his grandson Steve, \\"...he wore [them] all the time.\\" Death Arlin and his third wife Ida Lee split their time between Norwalk, where they lived during the warm months and Bakersfield, California, where they lived during the winter months. Arlin was in Bakersfield when he suffered a major heart attack on March 2, 1986. He spent ten days in a Bakersfield hospital until he was discharged on March 12. Arlin returned to his winter home where he died of complications on March 14. Arlin was 90 years old. Arlin was buried next to first wife Emily on March 19 in Mansfield Cemetery, Mansfield, Ohio. Arlin Field in Mansfield is named in his honor.

Ilan Shor, a 28-year-old Moldovan businessman and the current mayor of Orhei, \\"masterminded\\" the scam. Shor was chairman of the board at Banca de Economii (Savings Bank) up to November 28, 2014. Funds worth $1 billion were transferred to United Kingdom and Hong Kong shell companies used to conceal the real owners of assets,The billion-dollar ex-council flat, BBC News (7 October 2015) then deposited into Latvian bank accounts under the names of various foreigners. The total loss from the scheme was equivalent to 12% of Moldova's GDP. A carousel borrowing scheme was applied, loans at one bank were paid off with loans from another. The massive expansion of bank lending was funded with heavy borrowing from Russian companies. During the parliamentary hearings on the bank fraud, the Moldovan Information and Security Service deputy director, Vadim Vrabie, declared that President Nicolae Timofti knew since 2013 about the robbery at Banca de Economii, Banca SocialƒÉ and Unibank. Prior to 2012 In 2005-2008 the financial-banking legislation was substantially modified by the Parliament specialized commission headed by Oleg Reidman, as well as the regulations of the National Bank of Moldova on the supervision of the banking sector and the tracking of financial flows. These changes weakened the banking system and exposed it to risks of fraudulent activities. In 2007-2009 the Banca de Economii (Savings Bank) have expanded their lending activities, with a significant number of the credits given at the time being not reimbursed later in 2011. In June 2012, the Moldovan Anticoruption Center was requested to investigate the involvement of institutions registered in Moldova in money laundering schemes on regional and international level, following the Sergei Magnitsky cause c√©l√®bre. August 2012 - November 2014 During this period, the three banks were the subject to significant shareholder change. Commencing August 2012, ownership of Unibank was transferred to nominees as well as political figures and individuals close to Ilan Shor. In 2013 Ilan Shor bought into the ownership of Banca de Economii. In order to facilitate an increase in lending to Moldovan entities, the banks have apparently coordinated to increase the available liquidity. The money from the State Health Insurance Company was also used. In June 2012, the State Health Insurance Company, headed by Mircea Buga, deposited MDL 140 million in the accounts of Unibank. The State Health Insurance Company was not able to withdraw the deposits of MDL 115 million from Unibank until January 2015. The fact caused an MDL 102 million debt to the hospitals and an acute shortage of medications in the winter of 2014-2015. The banks have expanded their lending massively, far more than their capital reserves should have allowed. According to a report of the International Monetary Fund, the normative capital of the Banca de Economii (Savings Bank) decreased ten-fold in 2012, whereas the share of overdue credits increased by about 1 billion lei. The market value of its shares depreciated from 30 to 14 lei in a year. The three banks involved in fraudulent activities were audited by Grant Thornton office in Moldova, affiliated to the global Grant Thornton in 2010, 2011, and 2013. None of the reports indicated any problems in the banks' activities. One of the company's partners is Olesea Bride, who is married to St√©phane Christophe Brid√©, Moldovan minister of economy, and former managing partner of Grant Thornton Romania-Moldova. November 2014 In the week preceding the 2014 Moldovan parliamentary election more than $750 million were extracted from the three banks in just three days, between November 24 and 26. A van belonging to Klassica Force, a company owned by Shor, while transporting 12 sacks of bank files, was stolen and burned on November 27. Records of many transactions were deleted from the banks' computers.On November 26, 2014 the banks went bankrupt and were later placed under special administration of the National Bank of Moldova. On November 27, the Moldovan Government, headed by Prime Minister Iurie Leanca, secretly decided to bail out the three banks with $870 million in emergency loans, covered from state reserves. This created a deficit in Moldovan public finances equivalent to an eighth of the country's GDP.  Kroll Report  On January 28, 2015 the National Bank of Moldova hired the U.S. investigative consultancy Kroll to conduct an investigation of the fraud. The auditors reviewed transactions at the three banks with missing funds in November 2014. The report documents how companies tied to Shor gradually took control of the banks and then allegedly issued massive loans to affiliated companies. It concluded the three banks transferred at least 13.5 billion lei to five Moldovan companies affiliated with the Shor group, controlled by Ilan Shor, between November 24 and 26. The Kroll report, although confidential, was leaked to the public by Andrian Candu, the speaker of the Moldovan Parliament, in May 2015. Involvement of Moldovan Banks Moldovan banks have long been notorious for being involved in the region‚Äôs largest money laundering schemes, known as The Russian Laundromat going far beyond the 2014 theft of $1 billion. Russian and Ukrainian state officials, regional organized crime groups, and regional businesses have long used Moldovan banks to launder tens of billions of dollars and move them into Europe. Between 2010 and early 2014, organized criminals and corrupt politicians in Russia moved US$20 billion in dirty funds through offshore companies, banks, fake loans, and proxy agents. The process was certified as clean by judges in the Republic of Moldova and money was spread across Europe. Involvement of Latvian Banks A number of Latvian banks were involved in the scam. The Latvian banks named in the report are ABLV Bank, PrivatBank and Latvijas Pasta Bank. Two senior Latvian politicians, Ainars Latkovskis (head of the Saeima's Defense, Internal Affairs and Anti- Corruption Committee) and Solvita Aboltina (head of the National Security Committee) were summoned to the US last fall and told in no uncertain terms by officials at the State Department and Treasury that Latvia needed to clean up its act. In November 2015 the Latvian banking regulator passed the harshest sentence on money laundering yet: a 2,016,830 euro fine for Privatbank, dismissal of its CEO and the responsible board member, as well as individual fines for board members. Investigation of Pasta Bank and ABLV Bank are still ongoing. ABLV Bank and PrivatBank were among the six banks named by the Latvian authorities in July 2012 to have received funds directly or indirectly from the $230 million illegal tax refund exposed by the late Sergei Magnitsky. Political implications in Moldova The scandal is politically sensitive as it involved prominent politicians and business people, including Vlad Filat, the former Prime Minister of Moldova and founder of the pro-European Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova. The $1 billion bank fraud has compromised the pro-European Government and contributed to the declining popularity of the EU among Moldovans. An April 2015 poll found that 32% of Moldovans favoured joining the EU, a decrease of 46 percent compared to 78% in 2007. In March 2015, Emma Tabarta, the vice governor of the National Bank, as well as Artur Gherman, president of the National Commission for Financial Markets, were dismissed. The decision was taken in Parliament, behind closed doors, in a meeting that lasted more than eight hours. Moldova‚Äôs central bank governor Dorin Dragutanu resigned in September 2015, accusing politicians of interfering into the investigation of the fraud. Valeriu Strelet government was dismissed by Parliament in October 2015, after less than three months in office. As a response to the $1 billion disappearance the grass-roots citizens' movement Dignity and Truth () was established in February 2015.Moldova anger grows over banking scandal, BBC News (14 September 2015) The movement organized a series of street demonstrations, flash mobs, sit-ins, and pickets, known as the 2015 Moldovan protests. The protests organized by the Dignity and Truth movement were joined by the pro-Russian sympathizers, who formed a distinct camp. Both camps demand the conviction of corrupt oligarchs and early elections. Political implications in Latvia Kristaps Zakulis, who for four years has headed Latvia's financial regulator the Financial and Capital Markets Commissions (FKTK) handed in his resignation amid mounting criticism that he was not tough enough on money-laundering in the country's boutique banking sector in January, 2016. Criminal prosecutions left As of late October 2015 at least 44 criminal cases regarding non-performing loans allowed by the three banks were initiated and 20 of them are currently being reviewed. Ilan Shor was placed under house arrest on May 6, 2015 and has been charged with \\"abuse of office while managing a bank.\\" However, it did not prevent him from running for the public office of the mayor of Orhei in June 2015. In February 2019 Ilan Shor was elected member of the parliament. Vlad Filat was stripped of his immunity and handcuffed in parliament on October 15, 2015. On October 18, 2015 Filat was placed in preliminary detention for 30 days, the detention period being extended for 30 more days on November 11. On October 22, 2015, Denis Urechi, the manager of ProAcvaCom, was found guilty of submitting to Banca de Economii (Savings Bank) faked land assessments to obtain a loan equaling US$1.9 million back in October 2011. Ion Rusu, the manager of Caravita Co. Business Estate Investments was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for using the companies to launder funds and commit fraud. Rusu confessed that he made fictitious transactions with the intent to hide the origin of US$3.12 million stolen from the Moldovan Savings Bank. Rusu is brother-in-law to Vlad Filat, former Prime Minister of Moldova, and has claimed Filat is the real owner of the two companies. A court in Chisinau on June 27 found Vlad Filat guilty of abuse of office and corruption. He was sentenced to nine years in jail on corruption charges, stripped of a state award, and barred from holding public office for five years. Veaceslav Platon, a former member of Parliament of Moldova, was extradited to Chisinau from Ukraine in August 2016 after Moldovan prosecutors charged him with participating in the scheme to defraud Moldovan banks of US $1 billion. He is charged with stealing more than $40 million from Banca de Economii. In September 2016, 15 former or acting judges and 3 court bailiffs were arrested by the officers of the National Anti-corruption Center, being accused of being involved in The Russian Laundromat scheme. One judge and one bailiff were searched at their homes.  Reactions  Petras Au≈°trevicius, MEP, commented on the confidence crisis affecting Moldova: \\"To steal a billion dollars! ... You need plenty of bags to move that money around ... I hope that the name of the persons involved will be made public. ... Corruption in Moldova is a political disease, a disease that became systemic and that affects all levels of power ... it is eroding the country from the inside\\". Pirkka Tapiola, the European Union‚Äôs ambassador to Moldova, said at a news conference in Chisinau: \\"I do not have an answer for you on how it is possible to steal so much money from a small country.\\" Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee said: \\"I call upon the Administration and the Congress to investigate whether assets of the national banks of countries of the former Soviet Union are not being plundered and used, knowingly or unknowingly, to benefit terrorist organizations.\\" Romania offered Moldova emergency economic aid and a loan of $65 million. Romanian Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos said that to get the money, Moldova will have to reform its justice system, fight corruption, sign a draft agreement for a loan from the International Monetary Fund, and appoint a new central bank governor. In response to the $1 billion bank fraud, the EU, International Monetary Fund and World Bank have frozen their financial assistance to Moldova.

This entails providing ringing equipment to qualified ringers, and curating all ringing data. SAFRING communicates with ringers and interested parties through annually publishing one or two issues of a newsletter, Afring News, and by maintaining a list server. SAFRING holds national training courses, annually if there is sufficient demand. SAFRING liaises with the provinces who have the responsibility of issuing permits. SAFRING has a strict code of ethics to ensure the safety of birds handled. SAFRING acknowledges the importance of bird ringing in that it has been described as the most important tool in ornithology in the 20th century. History Bird ringing in South Africa started in 1948 when the Southern African Ornithological Society (SAOS) initiated a bird ringing scheme under the leadership of Dr EH Ashton. The first birds to be ringed were 31 Cape Vultures Gyps coprotheres, ringed on 1 August 1948 at Kranzberg by a team of birders and mountaineers. A year later one of these, ring C00086 was found near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, the first recovery of a southern African bird ring. Bird ringing was initially organized by an NGO (Southern African Ornithological Society, SAOS) and the ringing effort steadily increased and by the 1960s the cost and complexity of administering the scheme exceeded the resources of the SAOS. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) coordinated a deal whereby the four provincial conservation departments became the major sponsors of the National Unit for Bird Ringing Administration (NUBRA), in 1971, based at the University of Cape Town. The unit became part of the Avian Demography Unit, Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Cape Town, in 1991, which became the Animal Demography Unit, and moved to the Department of Zoology, University of Cape Town, in January 2008. In 2008 SAFRING organised a wide variety of events to celebrate its 60th anniversary of bird ringing in South Africa.Underhill, L.G., Oatley, T.B. and Berutti, A. 1995.

Originally performed by prominent Georgian ballet dancers Vakhtang Chabukiani and Vera Tsignadze, Gorda was revived in 2016 by Nina Ananiashvili. History Gorda originally premiered on December 30, 1949 at the Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater. A \\"Public Hearing\\" (the heading instead of \\"premiere\\") was attended by artists, musicians and choreographers; Vakhtang Chabukiani‚Äôs new performance was positively appraised and 30 December eventually became Gorda premiere day. Otar Egadze and Vakhtang Chabukiani worked on the ballet libretto, based on Daniel Tchonkadze‚Äôs tale of \\"Surami Fortress\\". According to libretto, ballet was named Dardia, but the staging team decided to change the name and make more emphasis on the name of young sculptor. Eventually, the ballet was titled after the main character ‚Äì Gorda. By then, Vakhtang Chabukiani was already an acclaimed dancer and choreographer who worked on new ballets after his arrival to Tbilisi. Andria Balanchivadze‚Äôs Heart of Mountains and Grigol Kiladze‚Äôs Light were staged. It was clear that he aimed at staging ballets based on Georgian motifs, as he was persistent with the classical heritage. Production design of the performance was by young Pharnaoz Lapiashvili; the conductor was Didim Mirtskhulava. Gorda‚Äôs main part was performed by Vakhtang Chabukiani, Javara by Vera Tsignadze, Irema ‚Äì IrineAleksidze, Mamia- Zurab Kikaleishvili. While first staging of ballet, Tamar Chabukiani‚Äôs (Alalme), Maria Bauer‚Äôs (Indian Dance) and Maria Grishkevich‚Äôs (NegrosDance) performances were outstanding. In 1951, the ballet received a USSR award and in 1957 a new choreographic version premiered (Gorda ‚Äì Zurab Kikaleishvili, Irema- Vera Tsignadze, Javara - Liliana Mitaishvili, Mamaia ‚Äì Revaz Magalashvili). In 1973, a fire destroyed the entire repertoire of scenery and costumes. Several performances required restaging, including Gorda. In 1974, one more premiere was presented at Labor Union Culture Palace. This place eventually became haven for artists abandoned without a theater. In 1985 new choreographic version of Gorda was staged at Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater. Production design was by Ivane Askurava, conductor was Revaz Takidze; leading parts were performed by Zakaria Amonashvli and Nukri Magalashvili (Gorda), Ala Abesadze and Victoria Laperashvili (Irema),Lia Bakhtadze (Javara). ZurabKikaleshvili was the last to restage Gorda in 1996. Leading parts were performed by theater soloists Vasil Akhmeteli (Gorda), Yuri Sorokin (Mamia), Lia Bakhtadze (Javara), Ketevan Mukhashavria (Irema). The last performance of this version was in 2002. Since 2004, Nina Ananiashvili is artistic director of the theater. After appointment, she made important decision for Georgian ballet and theater- to restore Vakhtang Chabukiani‚Äôs artistic heritage. The first performance staged was A. Krein‚Äôs Laurencia (choreographic version by Nukri Magalashvili. 2007). Nina Ananiashvili staged her own choreographic version of Laurencia at Minsk Opera and Ballet State Academic Theater (2014). The following step was Gorda. New libretto versions and ballet choreographic version were created by Nina, who herself led ballet restaging works. Creative team worked on Gorda‚Äôs production - Liliana Mitaishvili and Lali Kandelaki, Ekaterine Shavliashvili (assistant to the choreographer), Revaz Takidze (conductor), David Monavardisashvili (production design), Ana Kalatozishvili (costume designer), Jesper Keningsboro (production design), Studio \\"Opio\\" (video animations). Leading parts were performed by theater soloists Lali Kandelaki, Nino Samadashvili, Nutsa Chekurashvili, Ekaterine Surmava, David Ananiashvili, Yonen Takanoand Frank van Tongeren. In 67 years, David Toradze‚Äôs Gorda is back to modernized, restored Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater stage. It is first ballet premiere at renovated stage. The most recent Gorda premiere was held on February 12, 2016.  Synopsis  = Act one = Young sculptor Gorda carves into the rock image of the secretly beloved princess.

Irema catches a sight of her image at the rock. Princess falls in love at first sight with young man and presents him rescued falcon. Nobleman Mamia is in love with Irema and envies the success of rival. The king, admired with the agility of a young man invites participants of the hunt to royal palace.

But suddenly they are informed about sad news-it is the third time that fortress is crumbling, which serves the only bulwark against the invasion of foreign intruders. The king sends Gorda and Mamia to renowned prophetess for an advice. Oracle turns out to be Javara who recognizes the loved one. Javara is delighted as the revenge has come. She gives Mamia an arrow (which struck eagle). \\"The only way to build indestructible fortress is to immure son of the owner of the arrow in the wall\\" ‚Äì says the oracle. Mamia leaves, Javara stops Gorda, who did not recognize her, and reminds about herself. King commands to examine the arrow. Arrow turns out to belong to Gorda. Badri‚Äôs parents are in despair.

The launch happened after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on 6 January and as the United Nations Security Council was deciding on sanctions to be placed on the country following the nuclear test. The launch was also timed to celebrate the 74th birthday of the late leader Kim Jong-il on February 16. Pre- launch On 2 February 2016, North Korea sent a notification to the International Maritime Organization stating that the country was going to launch a Kwangmyongsong earth observation satellite with a launch window of 8‚Äì25 February between 22:30 UTC and 03:30 UTC given. The notification also included the drop zones for the first stage, the payload fairing and the second stage of the rocket, which was similar to the areas designated for the launch of Kwangmyongsong-3 Unit 2. On 6 February 2016, North Korea sent another notification to the International Maritime Organization stating that the launch window had been changed to 7‚Äì14 February. Launch Order on launching the satellite, signed by Kim Jong-un The satellite was launched on 7 February 2016 at 00:30 UTC into roughly a sun-synchronous orbit well suited for an earth observation satellite, using an Unha launch vehicle at Sohae Space Centre in Cholsan County, North Phyongan Province. Regarded as sending a message to both neighboring China as well as the United States, the launch also took place on the eve of the Chinese New Year and the Super Bowl in United States.North Korea's 'successful' satellite in orbit - ARS Technica, 2/10/2016, 12:41 AM It was initially claimed by U.S. officials that the satellite was \\"tumbling in orbit\\" and that no signals had yet been detected being transmitted from it.North Korean satellite \\"tumbling in orbit,\\" U.S. officials say - CBSnews.com, 8 February 2016 However, it was later reported the tumbling had been brought under control and the orbit stabilized. This indicates that the satellite has established communication with North Korea. The head of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command stated that Kwangmyongsong-4 was almost twice as large as Kwangmyongsong-3, and South Korean officials estimated the mass as . On February 22, Russian news agency TASS reported the statement by Colonel Andrei Kalyuta of Russia's National Space Monitoring Center that, based on the orbit of the satellite, it was in line with the declared purpose. Satellite tracker and astronomer for Leiden Observatory Marco Langbroek captured images of the satellite on February 28; on examining long exposure images, the satellite was either not tumbling or in a very slow tumble. This was also evident by the stability of the brightness of the Sun's reflection when the satellite passed the camera frame. Bob Christy of Zarya website shared results of observing orbital periods of the satellite, it indicated the satellite was not tumbling and was under control as controlled reduction in altitude of the orbit was detected. North Korea Tech, an affiliate of 38 North, reported on findings made by Langbroek and Christy. Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Jonathan Mcdowell concluded satellite was at least partially operational based on visual information and observation of the satellite's gravity boom being deployed. Post-Launch North Korea registered the satellite with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs on May 9. In addition to claiming North Korea was planning a moon mission, Hyon Kwang-il, director of the scientific research department at NADA, said the satellite had completed 2,513 orbits and had transmitted 700 photographic images in the day following its launch. The satellite passes over North Korea four times a day and continues to transmit data. However, international experts, such as astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, have not confirmed any transmissions from the satellite. In May 2017, North Korea released satellite images of THAAD site in Seongju county, South Korea. Reactions Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper extra informing Japanese readers about the launch The North Korean government organized a fireworks display on February 7, 2016, in commemoration of the launch. South Korea, Japan, the United States and other countries have accused North Korea of testing a ballistic missile (Unha is the satellite launch version of Taepodong-2) capable of hitting the United States. However, some experts at the time believed North Korea was still a decade away from having the capability to successfully deliver a nuclear weapon by means of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and the launch showed slow, but continuous, progress. The director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency stated the launch was not a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. The launch was strongly condemned by the UN Security Council. It prompted South Korea and the United States to announce that they would explore the possibility of deploying Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), an advanced missile defence system, in South Korea, which is strongly opposed by China and Russia.

town or large village in Aswan Governorate, Egypt. It is located in the Nile Valley about north of Kom Ombo and north of Aswan. The village has a population of about five thousand people. There are rock carvings near the village that are believed to date back to the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt, about 1550 BC. Community structure Silwa Bahari is a typical rural community in Upper Egypt. Official statistics show that there are 1223 families in the village, each with an average of four members. Descent in Silwa Bahari is patrilineal and the heads of the households belong to one of nine tribes. The families are units that typically include parents, married sons and their spouses, and unmarried children. Each family house, which may have an outer gate opening into a courtyard, has a single main door which all the occupants use to access their own particular quarters. The families are held together by property and the ownership of land. A widowed woman lives with her brother if she transfers her land to him or allows him to cultivate it. On the death of a householder, either his sons divide his property between them, or they agree to co-operate in the joint working of the land. Rock art Silwa Bahari is the site of ancient petroglyphs situated in a wadi east of the Nile. Some of these illustrate the change in climate experienced by Egypt in the last ten thousand years as they show animals such as elephants, white rhinoceroses, gerenuk and ostriches, a fauna akin to that of present day East Africa. On the basis of the design of various watercraft depicted, the art has been provisionally dated to the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt, about 1550 BC.

Its main assets are in Argentina, Spain, Italy, China, USA and Switzerland. Its founders and only shareholders are PhD in Biochemistry Silvia Gold and Psychiatrist Hugo Sigman. Grupo Insud operates in the Life Sciences, Agribusiness, Information & Culture, and Nature & Design business segments. Its core business is pharmaceuticals, followed by agroforestry. Background In 1977, Silvia Gold and Hugo Sigman created Chemo, a startup established with the aim to produce medicines. This marked the beginning of the holding group. Over the years, the group diversified its business, expanding to other areas, such as agribusiness, cultural industries, nature and design. In 2010, Insud was established, with the goal to integrate and represent the different business interests pursued by Gold and Sigman under a single brand. The acronym INSUD stands for Innovation, Sustainability and Development. Business areas =Life sciences= Pharmaceuticals is the first and core business of Grupo Insud, representing 80 percent of its revenues. Through its companies Chemo, Exeltis and mAbxience, the Group takes part in all the links of the pharmaceutical industry chain. The Group is a shareholder of the following pharmaceutical companies: Elea, Biog√©nesis Bag√≥, Sinergium Biotech, Chemotecnica S.A and Inmunova. Chemo is the Group‚Äôs first company, founded by Silvia Gold and Hugo Sigman in 1977, in Barcelona, Spain. It manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and generics. It owns 16 manufacturing sites and nine R&D; centers worldwide. Exeltis manufactures and markets branded pharmaceutical products. It has a catalog of more than 300 medicinal products spanning a range of therapeutic lines, including Women‚Äôs Health, Respiratory and Cardiology. mAbxience is the Group‚Äôs biotech company. It is engaged in research, development and manufacturing of biosimilars. It has two production plants: in Buenos Aires, Argentina (pharmADN), and in Le√≥n, Spain, both compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). =Agribusiness= Grupo Insud‚Äôs second largest activity is value-added primary production in the agricultural and forestry sectors. Pomera Maderas is a forestry-industrial company that owns and runs eucalyptus and pine plantations in Argentina and Paraguay. Its operations are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). It produces solid wood. Additionally, it works in the genetic improvement of vegetable species with the goal to create more productive forested areas and decrease pressure on native forests. Garruchos Agropecuaria has farms across Argentina and combines agricultural and cattle-raising activities. Caba√±a Los Murmullos is a cattle ranch that produces breeders, of the Aberdeen Angus and Polled Hereford breeds, for sale, herd improvement and participation in trade shows. =Information and culture= The Group has a footprint in the cultural industry with publishing companies Capital Intelectual and Clave Intelectual, and film production company K&S; films. Capital Intelectual is a publishing company focused on the dissemination of culture and social analysis, based in Argentina. Its publications promote reflection and debate on science, politics, literature, philosophy, sport, and psychology. It has published renowned authors, including Aldo Ferrer, Manuela Carmena, Dante Caputo, Juan Carlos Dist√©fano, Jorge Fernandez D√≠az, Leonardo Padura, Rodolfo Braceli, Alejandro Fabbri, Vicente Muleiro, Sergio Sinay, Pedro Brieger, and Mempo Giardinelli. The company also publishes the South Cone edition of Le Monde diplomatique. The Dipl√≥ was first issued in Argentina in July 1999. The monthly offers a selection of articles translated from the French edition, as well as articles, interviews and reviews by local authors. The South Cone edition is directed by political analyst and journalist Jos√© Natanson. Clave Intelectual is the imprint of Grupo Insud in Spain, established in 2011. It has a clear focus on Spanish-speaking America and reflects the main current-affairs topics, integrating variants of a common language and different cultural, social and geographic nuances. K&S; films is the Group‚Äôs film production company. It was established in 2005, when Hugo Sigman partnered with his friend Oscar Kramer, a producer with an extensive track record in the Argentine film industry, and they started a project for the integrated production of feature films. Today, with more than ten years of experience, K&S; films works both in Argentina and abroad, acquiring publishing rights, developing scripts, making international coproductions and supporting new Argentine talents. Some of its best known films are: The Clan (2015), Wild Tales (2014), Seventh Floor (2013), The Last Elvis (2012), Chronicle of an Escape (2006), On Probation (2005), The Dog (2004), Kamchatka (film) (2001), and Burnt Money (2000). =Nature and design= Grupo Insud has sustainable businesses in the field of nature and design, including Puerto Valle Hotel, in the Iber√° Wetlands; Solantu, a brand of designer objects made of native woods and caiman skins, and Yacar√© Por√°, a caiman farm located on the premises of the hotel, which leads a program of sustainable preservation and production of the species. Yacar√© Por√° is the exclusive caiman farm of Solantu, located on the premises of Puerto Valle Hotel. Its main purpose is the preservation of caiman species in the Corrientes wetlands. Through the ranching technique, the eggs are collected from the wild and breeding occurs under controlled conditions on the farm. Thus, Yacar√© Por√° can significantly increase the number of specimens in the area and help raise awareness with the population. Additionally, the use of a limited amount of caiman skin for Solantu collections guarantees the economic viability of the entire project and the investment in scientific research for conservation of the species in the long term. Research and development Through an extensive global network, Grupo Insud carries out multiple Research and Development (R&D;) projects to create high value-added products. In the Life Sciences, the company has, through its firm Chemo, nine R&D; Centers globally. Additionally, it has a technological platform for research, development and production of monoclonal antibodies. In the field of Agribusiness, the main areas of focus for its agricultural and forestry activities are genetic improvement and sustainable production. Pomera Maderas produces solid wood and has a program for genetic improvement of vegetable species. Caba√±a Los Murmullos is actively engaged in cattle genetics. Additionally, Grupo Insud promotes public-private partnerships through the R&D;+I (Research, Development and InnovationPublic Private Consortium) model, fostering effective interaction between basic research and applied research. This model enables articulating scientific research from the public sector with the technological, productive and commercial capabilities of the private sector. One of the most prominent findings of the consortium is Racotumomab (Vaxira¬©Scientists develop first lung cancer ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô, Financial Times, 2013), a therapeutic vaccine for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. This development was led jointly by Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Instituto de Oncolog√≠a Roffo, Hospital Garrahan, Conicet (National Council of Scientific and Technical Research) of Argentina and Universidad de Buenos Aires, in collaboration with CIM (Center for Molecular Immunology of La Habana) and Laboratorio Elea. The therapeutic vaccine is available in Argentina and has earned the Consortium the Innovation Award to Applied Research (Premio Innovar en Investigaci√≥n Aplicada).

They were originally intended for suburban passenger service in Berlin, and for use on branch lines. Due to their poor running qualities, they were demoted to shunting and short-distance goods train service. Between 1906 and 1909, one hundred locomotives were built, of which 80 were still in service with Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1923, and 78 in 1925 when they were renumbered in class 89.0 as 89 001 to 078; but due to their poor performance, they were soon sold to private railways. After World War I, ten locomotives were ceded to Poland, where they became PKP class TKh3. In 1938, two locomotives were taken back into stock when Lokalbahn AG was nationalised; rather than restoring the locomotives' old numbers, they were allocated new ones: 89 1001 and 1002. The same thing happened in 1941 with the nationalisation of the (MFWE) (89 1003 and 1004).

Built in 1833-34 and repeatedly enlarged, the hotel was a major fixture in the city, and one of the nation's early high-class hotels. Now converted into apartments. Description and history It is located on the south side of Bangor's downtown area, at the southeast corner of Main and Union Streets. The U-shaped building occupies a slightly irregular city block, and is bounded on its southern sides by May Street and Gallagher Place. It is a four-story building, built out of brick and stone, with the ground floor of its early sections built out of granite blocks, with brick walls above. Porticoed entrances face both Union and Main Streets, with a stone arcade on the ground floor supporting a four-column porch on Union Street and a simpler balustraded portico with supporting square stone columns and pilasters facing Main Street. A small balcony with large Italianate brackets stands above the Main Street entrance on the third floor. The hotel was built in 1833-34 by group of Bangor businessmen, seeking to create a public accommodation similar to that of the Tremont House in Boston, Massachusetts, an 1829 hotel that was then regarded as one of the pinnacles of luxury accommodation. The main building has retained its exterior despite a significant number of later alterations and enlargements. Originally built in a U open to the south, the inside of the U was in 1869 filled in with a billiard hall, and wings were added to the east and south. Many of the additions have since been torn down as part of the building's conversion to apartments, replaced by residential wings that now give the building an east-facing U shape. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972.

Missed Olympic qualification He missed the Olympic qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics by less than one second, when he came in as number four at the finale qualification race for the Olympics. Denmark and all other nations were not allowed to have more than two boats in the men's and women's single sculler and double lightweight sculler. But because or the new rule of diversity, Denmark gained another place for one of their boat for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio; this happened when Belgium won two competition in the men's single and double scullers at the final qualification race, but were only allowed to take one of the two boats to Rio. It was therefore up Belgium to decide, whether Denmark should have the men's single sculler or double sculler to the Olympics.

Life McLachlan was born in Dublin, son of the poet Leland Bardwell, and studied at the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama (1982‚Äì6), the Royal Irish Academy of Music (1989‚Äì97), and Trinity College Dublin (BA 1988), where he received a Ph.D. in musicology in 1999 for a study of the relationship between analysis and compositional technique in the post-war avant-garde. He has also studied privately with Robert Hanson (1989‚Äì90) and Kevin Volans (1994‚Äì5). He now lives in Inishowen, County Donegal. He has written numerous articles for The Journal of Music in Ireland (2000‚Äì10; now the online Journal of Music). He was executive director of the Association of Irish Composers (AIC; 1998‚Äì2012), and in 2007 he was elected to Aosd√°na. McLachlan was the featured composer in the RT√â National Symphony Orchestra's \\"Horizons\\" series in 2003 and 2008. He has also represented Ireland at international festivals, including the ISCM World Music Days in Slovenia in 2003 and Croatia in 2005. In 2006, his work Grand Action was commissioned as a test-piece for the AXA Dublin International Piano Competition.Biography paraphrased from Adrian Smith, \\"McLachlan, John\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, edited by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 654‚Äì5; and the composer's website, see 'External links'. Music McLachlan's musical aesthetic is largely shaped by a desire to impart a sense of narrative and expectation to his music without recourse to pastiche rhetorical devices. A critic wrote of a recording of McLachlan's piano piece Nine: \\"The style of each little piece sends one's imagination and musical memory reeling, some of them evoking French Impressionism, some jazzy in feel, some reminiscent of the miniatures for piano of Webern, and none of them in any way, shape or form derivative.\\"Rafael de Acha, in: Music for All Seasons, 2015. Much of his music is structured in contrasting and suddenly changing block-like sections of homogeneous material. The material within these sections is propelled by a rigorous focus on subtle rhythmic and melodic permutations, which result in both surface opacity and gradually increasing tension.

It is named for the river bordering the area in south Alabama where the prototype strain was discovered. It is abbreviated TEN, TENV, and TSV in the scientific literature. Ecology Tensaw virus has been isolated from mosquitoes in southwest Alabama, southeast Georgia, and central and south Florida. Host mosquitoes include Anopheles crucians, Psorophora ciliata, Psorophora confinnis, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Aedes atlanticus, Aedes mitchellae, Culex nigripalpus, and Mansonia perturbans. Disease The virus produces clinical disease and death in suckling and adult mice but not in hamsters, guinea pigs, or rabbits. Antibodies or virus have been detected in dogs, raccoons, cattle, and humans, but no evidence of infection has been found in sentinel chickens or wild birds. Serum samples from humans in south Florida have tested positive for neutralizing antibodies to Tensaw virus, but clinical disease from Tensaw virus infection in humans had not been reliably demonstrated as of 2006. Evidence that Bunyamwera serogroup viruses in North America are associated with congenital defects such as macrocephaly and/or microcephaly in humans suggests the possibility that Tensaw virus and other viruses of the family Bunyaviridae may have teratogenic potential in humans.

It started within Nagaur as a feud between two brothers, Mujahid Khan and Shams Khan. Shams Khan was defeated and took aid from Rana Kumbha the ruler of Mewar. Shams Khan was able to take Nagaur from his brother with the help of the Rana, but he refused to fulfill his promise to demolish a part of the battlements of the fort. This resulted in another war in which Rana Kumbha won and annexed Nagaur. Background Feroz Khan, Sultan of Nagaur died in 1455.Briggs's Ferishta, vol IV, p. 40 He belonged to the family of Kings of Gujarat Sultanate, and was originally a governor of the province of Nagaur, under the Delhi Sultanate. He had however thrown off his allegiance to Delhi and become independent. On his death, his elder son, Shams Khan, succeeded him, but his younger son, Mujahid Khan, deposed him and prepared to take his life. Shams Khan fled to Rana Kumbha for shelter and help.Bayley, 1970, p. 148 Kumbha who had long had designs on Nagaur, gladly embraced this opportunity of carrying them out, and agreed to place Shams Khan on the throne of Nagaur on the condition that he acknowledged Kumbha's supremacy by demolishing a part of the battlements of the fort of that place. Shams Khan accepted the terms.Briggs's Ferishta, vol IV, p. 41Sarda, 1917, p. 53 Battle Rana Kumbha marched with a large army to Nagaur, defeated Mujahid, who fled towards Gujarat, and placed Shams Khan on the throne of Nagaur, and demanded of him the fulfillment of the condition. But Shams Khan humbly prayed to the Maharana to spare the fort, for otherwise his nobles would kill him after the Maharana was gone. He promised to demolish the battlements himself later on. The Maharana granted this prayer and returned to Mewar. No sooner, however, had Rana Kumbha reached Kumbalgarh when he got the news that Shams Khan instead of demolishing, began to strengthen the fortification of Nagaur. This brought Kumbha on the scene again with a large army. Shams Khan was driven out of Nagaur, which passed into Kumbha's possession. The Maharana now demolished the fortification of Nagaur and thus carried out his long-cherished design.Sarda, 1917, p. 54 Battle with Qutb-ud-din Shams Khan fled to Ahmedabad, taking with him his daughter, whom he married to Sultan Qutb-ud-din Ahmad Shah II. Bayley, 1970, p. 149 & Briggs's Ferishta, vol IV, p. 41 The Sultan thereupon espoused his cause and sent a large army under Rai Ram Chandra and Malik Gadday to take back Nagaur.Bombay Gazetteer, vol 1, p. 242 Rana Kumbha allowed the army to approach Nagaur, when he came out, and after a severe engagement, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Gujarat Sultanate army, annihilating it. Only remnants of it reached Ahmedabad, to carry the news of the disaster to the Sultan.Sarda, 1917, p. 56 Aftermath Rana Kumbha took away the treasury of Shams Khan a large store of precious stones, jewels and other valuable things. He also carried away the gates of the fort and an image of Hanuman from Nagaur, which he placed at the principal gate of the fortress of Kumbalgarh, calling it the Hanuman Pol.Sarda, 1917, p. 55 References Sources  Brigg, Col., translation of Ferishta's history of the Mahometan dynasties, 3 vol. * Category:History of Rajasthan Nagaur Category:Rajput rulers Nagaur Nagaur ","title":"Battle of Nagaur"},{"id":"49311599","text":"Jasper Parrott, Executive Chairman of HarrisonParrott, pictured in 2019 Jasper ParrottInternational Who's Who.

Club career  The 21 years old has never played for any shaabiya team, but went straight into the Al Quwa Al-Jawiya‚Äôs youth system in his early teens and broke into the first team aged just 16 in 2011-12. Fahad followed in his father Talib Rahim and elder brother Ali‚Äôs footsteps when he joined the Blue Falcons. Growing up he would sit on the sidelines listening attentively to his father‚Äôs advice to Ali. Fahad was supervised by the goalkeeping coach Hashim Khamis, the ex-Iraq and Al-Jawiya goalkeeper, maintaining that the man the Al-Jawiya supporters knew as Al-Tayara (‚ÄúThe Airplane‚Äù) had been instrumental in his development, with the Jawiya faithful granting the old nickname of his mentor to their new keeper. At the start of 2014-2015 season Fahad was regarded as the club's third choice keeper behind Noor Sabri and Mohanad Qasim but the club's coach at the time, Nadhim Shaker, gave him his chance and he made the no.1 spot his. Fahad started his career with Iraqi giants Al Quwa al Jawiya and established himself as a first-team starter in the 2014-15 season.

The geology of Ceres consists of the characteristics of the surface, the crust and the interior of the dwarf planet Ceres. The surface of Ceres is comparable to the surfaces of Saturn's moon Rhea and Tethys, and Uranus's moon Umbriel and Oberon. The spectrum of Ceres is similar to that of C-type asteroids.http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~elv/icarus185.563.pdf However, since it also has spectral features of carbonates and clay minerals, which are usually absent in the spectra of other C-type asteroids, Ceres is sometimes classified as a G-type asteroid. Ceres's surface has an albedo of 0.09, which is quite dark compared to the moons in the outer Solar System. This might be a result of the relatively high temperature of Ceres's surface, the maximum temperature with the Sun overhead was estimated from measurements to be on 5 May 1991. In a vacuum, ice is unstable at this temperature. Material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of Ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer Solar System.  Internal structure  Diagram showing a possible internal structure of Ceres Ceres's oblateness is consistent with a differentiated body, a rocky core overlain with an icy mantle. This 100-kilometer-thick mantle (23%‚Äì28% of Ceres by mass; 50% by volume)0.72‚Äì0.77 anhydrous rock by mass, per William B. McKinnon (2008) \\"On The Possibility Of Large KBOs Being Injected Into The Outer Asteroid Belt\\". American Astronomical Society, DPS meeting No. 40, #38.03 contains up to 200 million cubic kilometers of water, which would be more than the amount of fresh water on Earth. Also, some characteristics of its surface and history (such as its distance from the Sun, which weakened solar radiation enough to allow some fairly low-freezing-point components to be incorporated during its formation), point to the presence of volatile materials in the interior of Ceres. It has been suggested that a remnant layer of liquid water (or muddy ocean) may have survived to the present under a layer of ice. Measurements taken by Dawn confirm that Ceres is partially differentiated and has a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, the smallest equilibrium body known. Internal structure of Ceres.  Orientation  Ceres has an axial tilt of about 4¬∞,http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/DAWN/kernels/pck/dawn_ceres_v05.tpc a small part of its pole is currently not observable to Dawn. Ceres rotates once every 9 hours 4 minutes in a prograde west to east direction.  Craters  The craters exhibit a wide range of appearances, not only in size but also in how sharp and fresh or how soft and aged they look. Large number of Cererian craters have central pits, and many have central peaks. The central peak is like a snapshot, preserving a violent moment in the formation of the crater. By correlating the presence or absence of central peaks with the sizes of the craters, scientists can infer properties of Ceres‚Äô crust, such as how strong it is. Rather than a peak at the center, some craters contain large pits, depressions that may be a result of gases escaping after the impact. Surface of Ceres has a large number of craters with low relief, indicating that they lie over a relatively soft surface, probably of water ice. Kerwan crater is extremely low relief, with a diameter of 283.88 kilometers, reminiscent of large, flat craters on Tethys and Iapetus. It is distinctly shallow for its size, and lacks a central peak, which may have been destroyed by a 15-kilometer-wide crater at the center. The crater is likely to be old relative to the rest of Ceres's surface, because it is overlapped by nearly every other feature in the area.  Faculae  Several bright surface features were discovered on the dwarf planet Ceres by the Dawn spacecraft in 2015. The brightest spot is located in the middle of Occator crater, and is called \\"bright spot 5\\". 130 bright areas have been discovered on Ceres, which are thought to be salt or ammonia-rich clays. Scientists reported that the bright spots on Ceres may be related to a type of salt on 9 December 2015, particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite (MgSO4¬∑6H2O); the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays.  Canyons  Several long canyons are evident in this view. The large crater that extends off the bottom of the picture is in the center of the picture above. Also notice the bright spots, just visible on the limb at upper left. The first picture above shows them from overhead. Many long, straight or gently curved canyons has been found by Dawn. Geologists have yet to determine how they formed, and it is likely that several different mechanisms are responsible. Some of these might turn out to be the result of the crust of Ceres shrinking as the heat and other energy accumulated upon formation gradually radiated into space. When the behemoth slowly cooled, stresses could have fractured the rocky, icy ground. Others might have been produced as part of the devastation when a space rock crashed, rupturing the terrain.  Montes  True-color image of Ceres The best known mons on Ceres is Ahuna Mons, a cryovolcanoCeres takes life an ice volcano at a time, 2018-9-17 about 6 kilometers high and 15 kilometers wide at the base. It was discovered on images taken by the Dawn spacecraft in orbit around Ceres in 2015. Bright streaks run top to bottom on its slopes; these streaks are thought to be salt, similar to the better known Cererian bright spots. The low crater count on Ahuna mons suggests that the cryovolcano could be no older than 200 million years, and indeed models of plastic relaxation of ice at the latitude of Ahuna Mons is consistent with that age. There are twenty-two identified montes on Ceres. Most of these have relaxed substantially over time, and it was only after modeling of the expected shapes of old cryovolcanoes that they were identified. It has been calculated that Ceres averages one such cryovolcano every 50 million years. Yamor Mons (previously named Ysolo Mons), near the north pole, has a diameter of 16 km and is the only other Cererian with the shape of Ahuna Mons,, though old and battered, the cold temperatures at the pole have preserved its shape. Liberalia Mons is near the equator and has a diameter of 90 km.

Centered at the junction of Church Street, Kent Hill Road, and Vermont Route 30, the village was developed between the late 18th and early 20th centuries, and has a number of well-preserved unusual features, including sidewalks of marble from local quarries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and was enlarged to the west in 1997. Description and history Dorset is a town in northern Bennington County, in the Taconic Range of western Vermont. Its village center is in the western portion of the town, whose major north-south route, Vermont Route 30, traverses the valley of the Mettawee River. At its junction with Church Street and Kent Hill Road, Route 30 is on the east side of the river, with Church Street extending west, across the river, to West Road. These two roads form the heart of the district, which extends north and south from their junction. A cluster of wood frame commercial buildings are to be found there, along with a number of mainly 19th-century wood frame houses. Notable public buildings include the marble-faced Gothic Revival Congregational Church, and the c. 1800 Sykes Memorial Building of the Dorset Village Library. Some of the sidewalks along Church Street are faced in marble, quarried locally at some Vermont's oldest marble quarries. Extending westward along Church Street the village becomes more dispersed and residential, although there was once a gristmill adjacent to Prentiss Pond. The district also includes the Dorset Golf Links, one of the oldest golf courses in the nation (founded 1886). The town of Dorset was chartered in 1768, and it was at the tavern of Cephas Kent (about south of the village center), that the idea of Vermont's independence from the claims of New York and New Hampshire was first discussed in 1777. This was followed later in the year by the establishment of the Vermont Republic, which operated independently until becoming the fourteenth state in 1791. Dorset grew first as a mainly agricultural area, but received a significant boost when marble from its quarries became prized for a variety of projects nationwide. The lack of significant water power, and later of good rail connections, limited the village center's growth in the 19th century, and it was eclipsed in importance by East Dorset. When the historic district was first listed on the National Register in 1985, it only extended as far west as Prentiss Pond, roughly midway along Church Street. It was enlarged in 1997 to include the residential areas west of the pond to West Road, extending north and south along that road for a way.

It is one of the few remaining continuously operated cooperative parks in the country. A gathering place of the Finnish cooperative movement based on Finnish immigrants to the United States, the park served the ethnic political radicals who energized the Iron Range labor movement and Minnesota's Farmer‚ÄìLabor Party. The member-owned park is open to the public. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History In late 1928, the Mesaba Range Co-operative Federation began securing land for a park to accommodate large Finnish gatherings. One hundred and sixty acres, including a fifty-two-acre lake not shown on lumber company maps, were purchased for $2000. Forty Finnish American organizations purchased membership shares. Volunteers cleared land for a road, grounds, and building sites. The period of the park's founding was one of anti-Finnish sentiment. Signs across the Range read, \\"No Indians or Finns allowed.\\" The Finns' prominent role in the 1907 and 1916 Mesaba Range strikes had led to blacklisting. The Finnish cooperative movement was, in part, a response to this discrimination. In June 1929, as work progressed, an article in the Finnish-language newspaper Ty√∂mies (The Workman) announced that local Finns would celebrate in Chisholm for the last time without a progressive venue of their own. The park opened on September 22, 1929. In the spring of 1930, construction began on a caretaker's residence and a children's school. The park's centerpiece, a dance pavilion, was completed in June 1930. Early festivals featured plays, track and field events, swimming, and dances. In addition to sports, students at the North Star children's camp were given an introduction to working-class thought. The park became a gathering place for members of the Farmer-Labor party, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and the Communist Party of America. As a boy, Iron Ranger Gus Hall, a four-time Communist Party candidate for president, helped his father and others build the dance pavilion. Between eight and ten thousand people attended the park's 1936 summer festival. They heard speeches from Elmer Benson and John T. Bernard, Farmer-Labor candidates for governor and congressman, respectively. A dance that summer, featuring accordionist Viola Turpeinen, packed over one thousand people onto the dance floor in alternating shifts. In 1938, the creation of the House Un-American Activities Committee initiated the era of communist \\"witch-hunts,\\" blacklisting, and guilt-by-association persecution. During this period of fear, intimidation, and surveillance, whipped into a near-frenzy by the committees of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, it was difficult to belong to the park. FBI agents stationed outside the park collected the license plate numbers of those who entered. The park was stigmatized as the \\"Commie Park,\\" \\"the Happy Hippie Commie Camp,\\" and the \\"Red Park.\\" This \\"red-baiting\\" atmosphere, combined with the increasing Americanization of Finnish children and post-World War II patriotism, led to a decline in membership that seriously threatened the park's survival. Opening membership to individuals as well as groups in 1959 was a necessary response. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people spurred the park's revival. Many had no Finnish heritage and came from the anti-war, environmentalist, and feminist movements. Younger members affiliated with the respected Ty√∂mies newspaper, like Weikko Jarvi and Timo and Belinda Poropudas, helped bridge the generational, cultural, and trust gaps between the aging Finns and the diverse newcomers. The original socialist and communist politics of Mesaba Co-op Park have largely faded, replaced by a general spirit of progressivism. Additional land was acquired, bringing the park's total size to 240 acres. The main annual event remains the Juhannes, or Midsummer, festival. It features folk dancing, guest speakers, music, a Maypole, late-night bonfire, Finnish American mojakka stew, and an arts camp for children. The park also stands as a reminder of the many small Finn halls once dotting the Iron Range. As those halls closed, their contents, including lumber, chairs, a barrel stove, and stage drops and scenery, often found a new home at Mesaba Park.

Zahn started designing embroidery machines. As the director of the Vogtl√§ndische Maschinenfabrik (VOMAG) at a later stage, he played a major role in the technical perfection of the machines being produced there. The Plauen firm became one of the leading public limited companies in the engineering sector in Germany under his leadership.  Life  Zahn was born as the son of Christian Karl Zahn and his wife Johanna Louise (n√©e Jahreis). He attended school in M√ºnchberg and later went to the vocational college in Hof, Bavaria. He started a course at the Technicum Mittweida in 1876, but did not complete his studies. He found work as a technician at the Stickmaschinenfabrik Kappel in 1882. He gained a fundamental knowledge of engineering there. However, he saw better opportunities of promotion at the Hilscher knitting and embroidery machine factory and moved to this company in 1894. Working with Max Hilscher, he registered his first two German patents in 1895. But he had already moved to Plauen to work at the Vogtl√§ndische Maschinenfabrik (VOMAG) in the following year. Following a three-year period in what was the world‚Äôs largest automated embroidery factory, Feldm√ºhle AG in Rorschach in Switzerland, he returned to Plauen in 1900. VOMAG gave the gifted design engineer the creative freedom to boost his successful career. In 1904, when Zahn was already the deputy director of VOMAG, the supervisory board appointed him as the sole managing director. His many business trips not only generated orders, but also provided inspiration for improvements to VOMAG machines. Under his leadership, the company continued to expand its embroidery machines and web-fed printing press divisions. Zahn was married to Luise Seidel in his first marriage. This marriage was dissolved in 1913. He then married his long-standing friend Paula Grabner in December in London. The two relationships produced four children: Hans, Friedrich, Walter and Erna. Zahn died very unexpectedly after an operation on his intestines in a Leipzig hospital on 21 January 1914. He was buried at the Leipziger S√ºdfriedhof.  Achievements  As a result of his work as a design engineer at the Kappel embroidery machine factory, Zahn was familiar with the technology of a shuttle embroidery machine operating according to the system introduced by Isaac Gr√∂bli. During his time in Switzerland, he had got to know the further development work to produce automatic embroidery machines with a jacquard loom mechanism, which were controlled using a punched tape. At that time, the automatic machines were made in line with the patents of J. Arnold Gr√∂bli, a son of Isaak Gr√∂bli and brother of the mathematician Walter Gr√∂bli, by Kursheedt Manufacturing Co. in the USA for the automated embroidery factory in Rorschach. As Zahn had successfully worked on optimising the Gr√∂bli automatic embroidery machines in Switzerland, an exclusive licensing deal was signed between Feldm√ºhle AG in Rorschach and VOMAG in Plauen in 1900 to manufacture automatic embroidery machines. This marked the start of the Plauen engineering company‚Äôs rise to become the world‚Äôs largest producer of embroidery machines. At Zahn‚Äôs suggestion and in line with his outline sketches, a design team improved the Gr√∂bli automatic machines with an associated embroidery punch machine in 1908. After the expiry of existing patents and licenses, VOMAG supplied a technically advanced automatic embroidery machine, which had been developed in-house, starting in 1910. The machine was marketed very successfully as the ‚ÄúZahn system‚Äù and 2,000 of these machines were sold around the world in just 3 years. As an engineer, manager and director of VOMAG from 1904 onwards, Zahn had a major influence on the future direction of the Vogtland engineering company. Under his leadership, the firm perfected the construction of rotary printing press, a process started in 1899. VOMAG equipped the B.Z. am Mittag tabloid newspaper with what were the largest and fastest rotary printing presses at that time in 1908. The company presented the world‚Äôs first web-fed offset printing press.Andreas Krone, Heino Strobel: Gro√üauftrag f√ºr Berlin. In: Historikus, Heft 3, 2014, Hrsg. PbK, S. 8 in 1912. The company also considered making trucks, but this only started in 1915.  Honours  M√ºnchberg honoured its important son with an information board on the house of his birth in 2015. The city of Plauen has named a street after Robert Zahn. The Embroidery Machine Museum, Plauen, also promotes the memory of Robert Zahn. There is still a working model that uses Zahn system there.

It was published on August 28, 2012, by Knopf Books for Young Readers and is recommended for ages 14‚Äì18. Every Day is a New York Times bestseller. A prequel novella only available digitally titled Six Earlier Days was released on November 26 of the same year. A companion novel titled Another Day was released on August 25, 2015, and a sequel titled Someday was released in 2018. The story \\"Day 3196\\" was released as part of one of the exclusive international editions of Someday. Plot summary Every Day is about the story of A, a person who wakes up occupying a different body each day. As described by Frank Bruni of The New York Times, \\"A. doesn't have a real name, presumably because they don't have a real existence: they're not a person, at least not in any conventional sense, but they have a spirit, switching without choice from one host to the next and, for just 24 hours, replacing its consciousness with their own.\\" A has their own memories, but they are also able to tap into the memories of the person whose body they are occupying. The story begins with A waking up in the body of a teenage boy named Justin. Upon arriving to school, A meets Justin's girlfriend, Rhiannon, and feels an instant connection to her. Based on Justin's memories, A can tell that Justin and Rhiannon are having a rough time in their relationship, so in order to learn more about her, A invites her to the beach. The pair open up to one another, though A's sharing is limited and very carefully worded. A had never felt such a connection with anyone before, and so attempts to discover a way by which to stay in Rhiannon's proximity in days to come. A then does their best to convince Rhiannon that the day shared at the beach was not between her and Justin, but rather between her and A. A spends almost every day following this event trying to figure out the best way to approach Rhiannon, since they are luckily never more than just a car ride away. After going through some trouble, A is finally able to convince Rhiannon of who they are, and the phenomenon they experience every day. While she does believe A, and understands how hard it must be, she also realizes that a relationship with A would be impossible, even if she wished to be in one. As the story progresses, we follow A as they wake up in body after body, still chasing Rhiannon. Meanwhile, they are forced to contend with a boy whose body A inhabited early, and who tracks them down in order to gain answers as to who A is and how they were able to take over their body and mind, as well as a priest working with that boy, who gathers a following of people who inhabit the bodies of others. Characters * A: The narrator, who is a disembodied spirit, ghostly being. Every day, A wakes up in a different body, accessing that persons' memories and essentially becoming them for 24 hours before inhabiting another body involuntarily. They have no gender and go by the pronoun \\"they\\", and they have known no life other than the one they lead. A chose their own name as a small child but has never shared the story. A never inhabits the same body more than once and, despite having no body, has grown up and aged as they started as a baby and always inhabits hosts their age as years go by. Up until the story's beginning, A strives to respect the people they possess and sticks to their routines as closely as they can. A keeps a personal email where they write their thoughts. Other than this, they have no life of their own. A's fascination with Rhiannon means A begins to pursue their own goals more, causing them some moral conflict. * Rhiannon: A teenage girl who is Justin's girlfriend and A's romantic interest. At first she is understandably doubtful of what A claims to be their everyday life, but soon realizes that A is who they say they are. While she is happy to know someone like A, she also understands that being in a relationship with someone like A would be impossible. She follows A through many ups and downs in hopes of finding a way for A to stay with her permanently though the reality of that seems impossible. * Nathan Daldry: The body A inhabits after Justin's. While in Nathan's body, A goes to a party in order to come in contact with Rhiannon the day after they meet her. A is unable to make it back to Nathan's home before the 24 hours are over and leaves Nathan to wake up in his own body, in a car on the shoulder of a road. Nathan, who is a very reserved and religious guy immediately knows that something (namely \\"Satan\\" as he puts it) must have taken him over because he would not only never go to a party, he would certainly never spend the night in a car by the side of the road. On his computer, he discovers that A forgot to log out of their personal email so Nathan begins to email A, essentially harassing them to come forth and claim responsibility for what they have done. * Justin: Rhiannon's teenage boyfriend and the first body we see A possessing. Verbally abusive to Rhiannon and others. * \\"Father Poole\\": A priest who claims to want to help Nathan. In reality Poole is revealed to be a spirit like A but one who lacks respect for those they inhabit. The spirit inhabiting Poole can apparently stay in a body as long as he likes, and he offers to teach A but is rejected. No other data is given about this spirit's past or motivations. Critical reception Every Day has received many positive reviews like one from Kirkus Reviews which claimed, \\"Levithan's self-conscious, analytical style marries perfectly with the plot. His musings on love, longing and human nature knit seamlessly with A's journey. Readers will devour his trademark poetic wordplay and cadences that feel as fresh as they were when he wrote Boy Meets Boy (2003).\\" Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"It's the rare book that challenges gender presumptions in a way that's as entertaining as it is unexpected and, perhaps most important, that's relatable to teens who may not think they need sensitivity training when it comes to sexual orientation and the nature of true love. Every Day is precisely such a book ... A story that is always alluring, oftentimes humorous and much like love itself‚Äîsplendorous.\\" Frank Bruni of The New York Times had this to say of Every Day, \\"It demonstrates Levithan's talent for empathy, which is paired in the best parts of the book with a persuasive optimism about the odds for happiness and for true love. 'The only way to keep going,' he writes, 'is to see every person as a possibility.' For A., with their daily transformations, that's an absolute necessity. For the rest of us, it's still a fine idea.\\" Chelsey Philpot of The Boston Globe remarked, \\"The ending is abrupt and leaves you wishing for more explanations...But maybe it only feels that way because we're not ready to let A go. Through A's eyes readers get to experience what it would be like to be someone different but the same. As A explains to Rhiannon, '‚Ä¶when who you are changes every day you get to touch the universal more.'\\" Film adaptation In June 2017, it was announced that Every Day would be adapted into a feature film, with Angourie Rice starring as Rhiannon. Jesse Andrews, author of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, wrote the script while Michael Sucsy directed. Filming took place in summer 2017, for a 2018 release.

He was deputy director of the Institute of Archaeology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. One of the first scholars to introduce the discipline of archaeology to China, Liang is regarded as one of China's \\"first-generation archaeologists\\". He was the second son of the scholar Liang Qichao. Liang was married to Li Fuman, with whom he had one daughter. He died of a heart attack on 2 April 1954, at the age of 49. Life and career Liang was born on 13 November 1904 in Macau, the fourth child and second son of journalist and scholar Liang Qichao. He had eight siblings four brothers (Sicheng, Sizhong, Sida, and Sili) and four sisters (Sishun, Sizhuang, Siyi, and Sining). He completed his primary education in Yokohama, where his family had been exiled to, and graduated from Tsinghua University in 1924. He was enrolled into Harvard University, at which he studied archaeology and picked up English. At the time, the archaeology field in China was virtually nonexistent, thus Liang is considered as one of the \\"first-generation archaeologists\\" who introduced the discipline to the country. In 1930 he began research at the Yingjin River and was the first Chinese to publish a survey on it. Likewise, in 1931, he performed what is thought to be \\"one of China's first scientific excavations\\" at Qiqihar, which led to the unearthing of artefacts thousands of years old. In January of that year, Liang wed his cousin Li Fuman (ÊùéÁ¶èÊõº). Three years Liang's junior, Li was also a Tsinghua graduate. Liang's line of work was strenuous and often he had to \\"spend hours in the water\\" for field work, while having to forgo proper meals too. Praised for his disciplined work ethic, Liang was known for not letting discomfort or illness hinder his job. This, however, was not without its consequences; in 1932, Liang fell ill in the wilderness but refused to seek medical help until he ran an unbearably high fever. It was later found out that he had serious respiratory infection. Liang published a comprehensive report on the Chengziya site of the Longshan culture in 1934, titled Chengziya site excavation report (ÂüéÂ≠êÂ¥ñÈÅ∫ÂùÄÁôºÊéòÂ†±Âëä), which is regarded as one of his more notable publications as an archaeologist. His excavation of a tomb at Hougang (ÂêéÂ≤ó) in the same year, as part of a project which had begun in 1928, provided groundbreaking evidence of \\"large burials anywhere at Yinxu\\". Liang continued investigations at Yinxu till 1937, uncovering several other tombs, artefacts and worshipping structures dating back to the Shang dynasty. Liang was the first deputy director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, serving from 1948 until his death in 1954. He was succeeded by Yin Da. Death and legacy While resuming the excavation of royal tombs at Anyang, Zhou contracted tuberculosis. He died on 2 April 1954 in Beijing, at age 49; the cause of death was a heart attack. He had been working on a report on animal remains found at the Anyang site. He was survived by Li and his only child Liang Baiyou (Ê¢ÅÊüèÊúâ), who likened her father to Water Margin character Shi Xiu, in reference to his determination and tirelessness. An anthology of his anthropological papers, titled Papers on archaeology by Liang Siyong (Ê¢ÅÊÄùÊ∞∏ËÄÉÂè§ËÆ∫ÊñáÈõÜ), was published in 1959. In his 2015 book In Manchuria: A Village Called Wasteland and the Transformation of Rural China, Michael Meyer writes of Liang with high esteem, underscoring his title of \\"father of Chinese archaeology\\", a label which had previously been reserved for Liang's peer Li Ji.

Kenya held the first event in 1989, as well as the largest event in 2016, when a total of of ivory were incinerated. The conservationists, governments, and non- governmental organizations that endorse the strategy argue that it fosters public support for the protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty. Background Archaeological findings show human use of ivory to date back more than 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub. Hunting for ivory is responsible for significant reductions in elephant populations in several parts of Africa. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population decreased in size from 1.3 million to 600,000. Ivory became a billion-dollar market, with about 80% of the supply taken from illegally killed elephants. , according to a report by the Wildlife Conservation Society, about 96 African elephants are killed for their tusks every day. In 1986, CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) introduced a control system based on permits, registration, stockpiles, and monitoring. Shortly thereafter, the CITES Secretariat weakened regulations, effectively legalizing stockpiles of poached ivory. For example, countries such as Burundi and Singapore, which were not home to wild elephants, registered and of trafficked ivory, respectively. As uncovered by the Environmental Investigation Agency, the \\"control system\\" turned out to be easy to manipulate, ultimately increasing the value of ivory and empowering smugglers. At the October 1989 CITES convention in Geneva, representatives from Tanzania proposed an effective ban on the international ivory trade. After heated debates, the ban was enacted, and went into effect in January 1990. The ban proved effective for about a decade, and saw rising elephant populations, but starting in 1997 CITES began granting exceptions to the ban to allow countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia to sell a limited amount of ivory, as well as an exception to Japan to buy a limited amount, based on each country's declared confidence in their effective regulation and control. From 1998 to 2011, other countries were granted exceptions and illegal trafficking at least tripled. The majority of ivory in the 21st century has gone to growing Asian markets, including and especially China, where the material has been viewed as a status symbol sometimes known as \\"white gold\\". In 2015, Chinese officials expressed their intent to phase out the country's involvement with the ivory trade. Prices fell by nearly half in the year prior to a 2016 report, and at the end of that year China's State Council declared its intent to halt ivory-related commerce by the end of March 2017. History and events =Kenya and the first fires= In 1989 Richard Leakey, a paleoanthropologist and conservationist from the prominent Leakey family, was named head of Kenya's Wildlife Conservation and Management Department, the forerunner to today's Kenya Wildlife Service. Elephant hunting had been banned in 1973, but the ivory trade remained legal. By the 1980s, elephant poaching had become widespread due to the increasing price of ivory. In a May 1989 article, The New York Times described Tsavo National Park as \\"an elephant graveyard - piles of bleached white elephant bones - instead of an elephant habitat\\". Kenyan officials knew the value of the elephant to safari tourism, and wanted to persuade CITES to include the animal on its global endangered species list at its October 1989 meeting. When Leakey took the position, the organization had 12 tons of confiscated illegal ivory in its possession, which he was urged to sell in order to fund conservation efforts. Instead, he piled all of it together and, with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, set it on fire. Ivory does not easily burn, but the choice to use fire rather than other means to destroy it was intentional as Leakey wanted the event to produce powerful images for the global media. To make the destruction spectacular, Leakey worked with a Hollywood special effects professional to devise an innovative pyrotechnics technique using jet fuel and flammable glue. It was a successful publicity stunt, attracting international attention from the press while the fire burned for three days. It also proved influential among conservationists, encouraging others to dispose of their stockpiles in a similar manner and leading, in part, to the international ban on the ivory trade passed at CITES. Paul Udoto of the Kenya Wildlife Service called it a \\"desperate measure meant to send a message to the world about the destruction through poaching of Kenya's elephants.\\" Kenya has held two more ivory burns since 1989. The second was just two years later in 1991, destroying 6.8 tons. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki held the country's third event in 2011, destroying another five tons of ivory.  Largest fire  Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta watching 105 tons of ivory burn in April 2016 On 30 April 2016, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta set alight the largest ever pile of ivory for destruction in the Nairobi National Park. The pile consisted of 105 tonnes of elephant ivory from about 8,000 elephants and 1.35 tonnes of horns from 343 rhinoceroses. Estimates for the total black market value of the destroyed contraband range from $150 million to $220 million. The ivory was transported to the site in shipping containers then stacked into towers up to tall and in diameter. The ivory towers took personnel from the Kenya Wildlife Service ten days to build. The pyre also contained exotic animal skins. The amount of ivory destroyed equaled about 5% of the global stock. Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba was also in attendance. = More frequent events across four continents = , more than of ivory has been destroyed in high-profile events in 21 countries around the world. Much of this is due to the help of the Elephant Protection Initiative (EPI), which aids countries in burning their ivory stockpiles. The EPI was launched by the governments of Botswana, Chad, Ethiopia, Gabon and Tanzania in 2014. * United Arab Emirates and Zambia: The first countries to follow Kenya's lead were the United Arab Emirates and Zambia in 1992, destroying 12 and 9.5 tons, respectively. * Gabon: In 2012, Gabon burned the tusks and carved ivory it had been confiscating since 1985, adding up to about 4.8 tons. * Philippines: The Philippines, a country which the CITES Standing Committee noted as one of the major consumers of ivory in 2012, became the first such nation to destroy its holdings in June 2013. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the division coordinating the destruction, had planned to hold a \\"ceremonial burning\\", but environmental objections to the idea of legitimated open burning led them to instead crush all five tons by first running over them with a road roller, then pounding them with the bucket of a backhoe, and finally taking the bits that remained to an incinerator. A pallet of seized raw ivory prior to being crushed by the US Fish & Wildlife Service in November 2013 * United States: In November 2013, the United States employed an industrial rock crusher to pulverize six tons of amassed ivory. Although the US does not ban the domestic sale of ivory, it is illegal to bring ivory into the country. Its interest in destroying its ivory was also connected to research that found links between the ivory trade and threats to national security through terrorism and organized crime. The US government and American non-governmental organizations have been involved in multiple forms of anti-poaching measures, largely in Africa, and American diplomats are actively engaging other governments to take part in eroding the ivory market by destroying stockpiles. Another ivory crush took place in New York City's Times Square in June 2015. * China: China is the world's largest consumer of ivory, accounting for 70% of global demand . Many of the countries that have destroyed their ivory accumulated the stockpiles because of their location on the trade route between Africa and China. Given its prominent role in the market, China's decision to crush 6.1 tons of ivory in January 2014 was a major cause for celebration among conservationists. * France: France was the first European country to destroy its three tons of seized illegal ivory in February 2014, with tusks fed one-by-one along with other ivory goods into a pulverizer. * Hong Kong: In May 2014, Hong Kong began a systematic destruction of its 28-ton stockpile, which was scheduled to take place over the course of two years. In its announcement of the destruction, Hong Kong's Endangered Species Advisory Committee chairman, Wong Kam-sing, explained that, moving forward, \\"any future forfeiture of ivory will be similarly disposed of on a regular basis\\". Although the sale of ivory has not been banned entirely in Hong Kong, the commitment and actions it has taken are significant not just for being the largest stockpile destroyed to-date, but also because it has been the world's largest ivory market. Ivory burning in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, in April 2015 * Chad: 1.1 tons destroyed of ivory in 2014. * Belgium: 1.5 tons of ivory destroyed in 2014. * Ethiopia: In Ethiopia, where the size of the elephant population has decreased by 90% since the 1980s, officials issued a National Ivory Action Plan to address poaching and ivory trafficking. Among other strategies, the Plan includes the publicized destruction of seized ivory. The first such event took place in March 2015, in Addis Ababa, where the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority's 6.1-ton stockpile was burned. * Republic of the Congo: 4.7 tons of ivory destroyed in 2015. * United Arab Emirates: 11 tons of ivory destroyed in 2015. * Mozambique: 2.4 tons of ivory as well as 440 lbs of rhinoceros horn destroyed in 2015. * Sri Lanka: In January 2016, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian country to destroy its ivory (1.5 tons confiscated in 2012) and also the first to issue a formal apology for its role in the ivory trade. * Italy: In March 2016, the Italian government partnered with the Elephant Action League to burn a tonne of ivory, worth an estimated ¬£3.6 million GBP. * Vietnam: On 12November 2016, Vietnam destroyed nearly 2.2 tons of seized elephant ivory and 70 kg of rhinoceros horns.  Techniques  Destroying ivory by any practical means is difficult. Burning is the most common method of large-scale destruction of ivory. When Kenya burned 12 tons of it in 1989, it created a major media spectacle and inspired similar actions around the world. More recently, crushing methods have also been used, as well as combinations of crushing and burning. = Burning = When Kenyan officials decided to destroy their stockpile in 1989, they had to find a way to do so that would create powerful images. Leakey turned to fellow conservationist Kuki Gallmann, who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir I Dreamed of Africa. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, and the importance of producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable glue to coat the tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel. His plans were adopted, and when the Kenyan President held a torch to the waiting pile, \\"Flames flared up in a scalding blaze. [‚Ä¶] The ivory blackened and started burning, crackling. Deafening applause burst out from the crowd, while television crews from all over the world showed to every corner of the Earth this new sacrifice of Africa.\\" Ivory burning site in Kenya's Nairobi National Park Research performed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in 2008, found burning to be an inefficient and highly challenging way to destroy ivory when compared to crushing. Like human teeth, elephant tusks are resistant to burning. Simple burning typically just chars the outside; it requires extreme conditions over a long period of time to destroy ivory effectively. Using specialized equipment to burn a tusk at , its weight decreases by only each minute (an average African elephant tusk is about and can weigh as much as . For each of Kenya's burns, organizers used jet oil to increase the temperature and it still persists for about a week. When only the outside is affected, the inner ivory is still commercially viable. As there are not yet verified techniques for identifying ivory that was previously burned, some have expressed concerns regarding the possible use of some of the burned stockpiles. A rock crusher during the 2013 ivory crush in the United States Hollister, the original \\"burn architect\\" who invented the technique in 1989, was asked to lead the 2016 burn, which was many times bigger than the first. He acknowledged that ivory doesn't really burn: \\"we have to raise the temperature in the fires to such a degree that it actually disintegrates. We're going to create [that] by combining kerosene and diesel and compressed air, pushing it at very high pressure, about 16 bar, down a pipe.\\" The question of the effectiveness of the destruction ‚Äì even the possibility that some of the partially combusted ivory may find its way back to the black market ‚Äì is a touchy subject. \\"It's heresy to consider any other form of destruction, leave alone finding any other way to use the ivory or utilise wildlife resources.\\" = Crushing = Crushing can also be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines resolved to crush their five-ton stockpile, in part due to environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.  Justification, objections, and impact  = Messaging = Journalists and other on-lookers at the 2013 ivory crush in the United States Destroying ivory is a tactic endorsed by several governments, activists, and NGOs. Richard Leakey, who was responsible for the first major ivory destruction in Kenya in 1989, argues that these acts are primarily about sending a message to foster a public that sees the value in wildlife itself, not its byproducts, and thereby influencing the demand side of the market. In explaining the \\"enormous impact\\" that he saw after the 1989 event, Leakey said that \\"up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand to four thousand elephants a year, and a year later we were losing at most sixty.\\" Consumer research in China, the world's largest consumer of ivory, showed that many potential buyers have little understanding of the connection between the ivory trade and steep declines in elephant populations. High-profile government events bring the problem to large numbers of people and affirm a government stance for anyone who had been unclear. The events also aim to signal decreasing acceptance and popularity of ivory goods, making them less desirable by lowering their status and shaming individuals, organizations, and institutions who buy, sell, or own the goods. In China, prices fell by nearly half between 2015 and 2016, following the government announcement that it would begin phasing out its domestic ivory trade. According to Hongxiang Huang in a report by NPR, the decline was not likely due to conservation reasons, but because \\"[o]ne thing that proud Chinese people don't want to be, these days, is behind the times.\\" Advocates also believe that destroying ivory can influence the supply side of the ivory market by sending a strong, highly visible and well-publicized message that the ivory market is dangerous and futile. Similarly, those who would otherwise consider ivory as an investment opportunity may think twice if the market is so consistently disrupted. French Minister of Ecology Philippe Martin called the destruction of ivory \\"indispensable in the fight against trafficking of threatened species\\" and said that it sends \\"a firm message\\". In Botswana, which is home to almost half of the elephants in Africa, officials are opposed to destroying ivory stockpiles , and President Ian Khama publicly boycotted the 2016 Kenyan burn. Botswanan officials believe that burning tusks communicates that the animal does not have value. Instead, confiscated goods like ivory and rhinoceros horns are displayed to symbolize the value of wildlife conservation. An example of this was the 2015 unveiling of an elephant statue, made entirely of ivory tusks, at the country's main international airport in Gaborone. The remains of ivory sent through a rock crusher in New York in 2015 = Economics =  Scarcity  Several journalists and conservationists have challenged the logic of the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching. An example several commentators point to is a 2014 study funded by Save the Elephants that found that the price of ivory tripled in China during four years following 2011. It correlated that trend to an increase in poaching as well as an increase in the frequency of high-profile events in which stockpiles were destroyed. Research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research offer an alternative theory: that the increase in price and demand \\"likely originated\\" with CITES's experimental allowance of a legal sale of a large amount of ivory in 2008. More recently, however, Save the Elephants reported the cost of ivory in China has fallen by nearly half, following an announcement by the Chinese government that it would phase out its domestic trade. In Japan, the demand for ivory has decreased since 2012 as a result of new consumer awareness through education about the connection between buying ivory and the killing of elephants. Ultimately, Mathiesen describes the debate as \\"characterized by a lack of data\\", while Tom Milliken concluded in 2014 that the strategy needs to be closely monitored for effectiveness and that more data needs to be collected because there was not sufficient \\"proof that destroying supply leads to a decline in demand\\". A related concern expressed by Stiles is that perceived scarcity may lead countries still active in the ivory trade to create stockpiles of their own, owing to \\"the senseless system now in operation\\" in countries like the United States, Thailand, and China, whereby international ivory trade is considered illegal but domestic trade is permitted, ensuring at least some continued demand and, in Stiles's view, \\"guaranteeing extinction of the elephant\\".  Opportunity costs  Instead of destroying confiscated ivory, a government could choose to sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those on the supply side in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used to improve the quality of life for human citizens. Confiscated ivory could also be sold to pay for conservation efforts. Zimbabwe, for example, which has long opposed the ban on the ivory trade, publicly refuses to destroy its 70-ton stockpile. the country is home to 83,000 elephants, but with its current economic situation it cannot afford continuing conservation efforts. According to Environment Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, \\"To us, burning is not an option, we need the resources for sustainable wildlife conservation.\\" Economic research published in 2016 analyzed the efficacy of a one-time legal sale of ivory stockpiles to China and Japan, allowed by CITES in 2008. The idea was to try to flood the market, sinking prices and profitability, but the result was \\"catastrophic\\" according to one researcher, who attributes to it a significant, long-term increase in poaching due to factors like a reduction of the social stigma of ivory and providing a mechanism to obscure smuggling activities. Christopher Alden, who supported but did not take part in this analysis, specifically criticized requests from countries like Zimbabwe and Namibia to allow limited sales, due to the likelihood of them having a similar counterproductive outcome. = Corruption and security = Although the destruction of ivory is centered upon conservation, there are other considerations which affect institutions' decisions on the matter. When Hong Kong announced the destruction of its stockpile, it noted \\"the management burden and the security risk\\" inherent in the possession of large quantities of valuable material. For example, when the Philippines decided to burn its stockpile, only a fraction of what it had confiscated over the years remained, with at least six tons \\"lost\\" or stolen during the 2000s alone. Stockpiles of ivory have often been connected to theft and corruption, with multiple countries, including Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, and the Philippines, suffering \\"losses\\" of several tons. Keeping illicit goods on hand can also signal government plans or active involvement with the ivory trade. Destroying it removes the possibility of corruption as well as the costs associated with operating a secure place of storage. For Paula Kahumbu, CEO of Kenya's WildlifeDirect, maintaining stockpiles does too much to enable illegal trade to justify keeping it rather than destroying it. She told NPR that when an ivory dealer wants to obtain ivory, the most sensible way to do so is not to go hunting, which carries many risks, but to \\"raid a stockpile by bribing the guy who has the key\\". She gives examples of tusks being lost from vaults and even courtroom exhibits due to corruption. In the United States, research linking the ivory trade to terrorism and organized crime has tied the destruction of ivory stockpiles to national security, not just conservation.

The term was coined by scholar Deborah K. King in 1988 to account for the limitations of the double or triple jeopardy models of discrimination, which assert that every unique prejudice has an individual effect on one's status, and that the discrimination one experiences is the additive result of all of these prejudices. Under the model of multiple jeopardy, it is instead believed that these prejudices are interdependent and have a multiplicative relationship; for this reason, the \\"multiple\\" in its name refers not only to the various forms of prejudices that factor into one's discrimination but also to the relationship between these prejudices. King used the term in relation to multiple consciousness, or the ability of a victim of multiple forms of discrimination to perceive how those forms work together, to support the validity of the black feminist and other intersectional causes. Difference from double jeopardy The framework of multiple jeopardy was created as a response to the double or triple jeopardy assumption, which, as understood by King, correlates each mode of discrimination with individual and independent effects that, when added together, will create the full picture of the discrimination one faces. Deborah King likens this model to a mathematical equation: \\"racism plus sexism plus classism equals triple jeopardy\\". If, for example, it were to be understood that, as a result of racism, black people in the workplace face an earnings disadvantage compared to white men, and women in the workplace face an earnings disadvantage due to sexism, then double jeopardy would assume that a black woman would see an earnings disadvantage of no more or less than the sum of that faced by black people and women on their own. This assumption runs contrary to the idea of intersectionality by asserting that individuals do not face unique forms of discrimination as a result of the various aspects of their identity such as gender or race, and that discrimination can instead be predicted as the sum of the effects each of these aspects has on the way they are treated. By contrast, multiple jeopardy is founded on the idea that each mode of discrimination is multiplicative, and thus the relationship between racism, sexism and classism would instead be represented as \\"racism multiplied by sexism multiplied by classism\\". King uses this equation to argue that the institutional context behind the ways that race, sex, and class are treated in society can create unique types of discrimination that differ vastly from the discrimination associated with each of these factors, such that the discrimination experienced by a black woman is much more than just the sum of the discrimination that a black man and a white woman would experience. King illustrates this concept by recounting the ill treatment of black women during the era of slavery in the United States. At that time, black workers were subjected to demanding physical labor and brutal punishments. Black men and black women were both victims of this practice, but black women also endured subjugation exclusive to women; as Angela Davis explained in Women, Race, and Class, ‚ÄúIf the most violent punishments of men consisted in floggings and mutilations, women were flogged and mutilated, as well as raped.\\" King explains that while rape was a common punishment for women, the rape and impregnation of black women was used to strengthen and perpetuate the slave trade because it helped produce capital - being, in this case, more slaves. King concludes that the rape of black women in the era of slavery was critically differentiated from the rape of women as a whole because it existed as the product of contemporary, institutional racism, and could not have existed without relation to said racism.  Multiple jeopardy and multiple consciousness  Deborah King notes that prior scholars were skeptical of the idea that black feminists could be entirely invested in both the women's rights and black liberation movements, as a result of the racial and sexual politics within each movement. King disagrees, suggesting that black women, as victims of multiple systems of inequality, are able to perceive these systems in action and recognize how they operate together. This awareness is referred to as \\"multiple consciousness\\". King suggests that those who are affected by multiple jeopardy exhibit multiple consciousness, giving them a special understanding of the way different inequalities work together to create systems of discrimination in a way a person experiencing just one form of prejudice could not perceive on their own. While King suggests the relationship between multiple jeopardy and multiple consciousness, there are few studies explicitly examining the link between them. However, scholars have pointed to existing studies on discrimination to support this relationship, noting that, while women are more likely than men to report experiencing discrimination on the basis of gender, minority men are more likely than minority women to report experiencing discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity. This suggests a difference in one's ability to perceive forms of discrimination when they are victims of more than one system of discrimination. Multiple jeopardy and the matrix of domination Multiple jeopardy is related to the matrix of domination. This term, used by Patricia Hill Collins, refers to how each prejudice intersects and overlap with one another just as an inseparable link, creating an interlocking system of oppression. In the United States, domination can be seen in institutions such as schools, employment, housing, the government, and other social elements. The domination of the superior group affects those who are/have been socially oppressed due to the factors that have historically caused them disadvantages. The idea of multiple jeopardy feeds into the concept of the matrix of domination because it is these multiple factors - gender, race, sex, class, religion and other social/cultural identities - that have historically caused many disadvantages for certain groups of people.

As the name suggests, MALA uses a combination of two mechanisms to generate the states of a random walk that has the target probability distribution as an invariant measure: * new states are proposed using (overdamped) Langevin dynamics, which use evaluations of the gradient of the target probability density function; * these proposals are accepted or rejected using the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm, which uses evaluations of the target probability density (but not its gradient). Informally, the Langevin dynamics drive the random walk towards regions of high probability in the manner of a gradient flow, while the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings accept/reject mechanism improves the mixing and convergence properties of this random walk. MALA was originally proposed by Julian Besag in 1994, and its properties were examined in detail by Gareth Roberts together with Richard Tweedie and Jeff Rosenthal. Many variations and refinements have been introduced since then, e.g. the manifold variant of Girolami and Calderhead (2011). The method is equivalent to using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with only a single discrete time step. Further details Let \\\\pi denote a probability density function on \\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, one from which it is desired to draw an ensemble of independent and identically distributed samples. We consider the overdamped Langevin It√¥ diffusion : \\\\dot{X} = abla \\\\log \\\\pi(X) + \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\dot{W} driven by the time derivative of a standard Brownian motion W. (Note that another commonly-used normalization for this diffusion is : \\\\dot{X} = \\\\frac{1}{2} abla \\\\log \\\\pi(X) + \\\\dot{W}, which generates the same dynamics.) In the limit as t \\\\to \\\\infty, this probability distribution \\\\rho(t) of X(t) approaches a stationary distribution, which is also invariant under the diffusion, which we denote \\\\rho_\\\\infty. It turns out that, in fact, \\\\rho_\\\\infty = \\\\pi. Approximate sample paths of the Langevin diffusion can be generated by many discrete-time methods. One of the simplest is the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method with a fixed time step \\\\tau > 0. We set X_0 := x_0 and then recursively define an approximation X_k to the true solution X(k \\\\tau) by :X_{k + 1} := X_k + \\\\tau abla \\\\log \\\\pi(X_k) + \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\tau} \\\\xi_k, where each \\\\xi_{k} is an independent draw from a multivariate normal distribution on \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} with mean 0 and covariance matrix equal to the d \\\\times d identity matrix. Note that X_{k + 1} is normally distributed with mean X_k + \\\\tau abla \\\\log \\\\pi(X_k) and covariance equal to 2 \\\\tau times the d \\\\times d identity matrix. In contrast to the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method for simulating the Langevin diffusion, which always updates X_k according to the update rule :X_{k + 1} := X_k + \\\\tau abla \\\\log \\\\pi(X_k) + \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\tau} \\\\xi_k, MALA incorporates an additional step. We consider the above update rule as defining a proposal \\\\tilde{X}_{k + 1} for a new state, :\\\\tilde{X}_{k + 1} := X_k + \\\\tau abla \\\\log \\\\pi(X_k) + \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\tau} \\\\xi_k. This proposal is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm: set :\\\\alpha := \\\\min \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1 , \\\\frac{\\\\pi(\\\\tilde{X}_{k + 1}) q(X_{k}\\\\mid\\\\tilde{X}_{k + 1})}{\\\\pi({X}_{k}) q(\\\\tilde{X}_{k + 1}\\\\mid X_k)} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where :q(x'\\\\mid x) \\\\propto \\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\tau} \\\\ x' - x - \\\\tau abla \\\\log \\\\pi(x) \\\\_2^2 \\\\right) is the transition probability density from x to x' (note that, in general q(x'\\\\mid x) eq q(x\\\\mid x')). Let u be drawn from the continuous uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1]. If u \\\\leq \\\\alpha, then the proposal is accepted, and we set X_{k + 1} := \\\\tilde{X}_{k + 1}; otherwise, the proposal is rejected, and we set X_{k + 1} := X_k. The combined dynamics of the Langevin diffusion and the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm satisfy the detailed balance conditions necessary for the existence of a unique, invariant, stationary distribution \\\\rho_{\\\\infty} = \\\\pi. Compared to naive Metropolis‚ÄìHastings, MALA has the advantage that it usually proposes moves into regions of higher \\\\pi probability, which are then more likely to be accepted.

It petitioned the Grand Duke of Finland, Tsar Nicholas II to reconsider his February Manifesto issued earlier in the same year. University students went from village to village to collect more than half a million signatures, roughly one fifth of the then Finnish population, within eleven days. When the delegation, consisting of 500 men all around Finland, delivering the petition arrived in St Petersburg, the Tsar declined to see it. Thus, it failed to have any effect.

It has a long lasting hypotensive effect and may also regulate reproduction. It is part of the Urotensin II system and is one of the two endogenous ligands for rats, mice, and possibly humans.  Discovery  URP was discovered in rats when researchers were trying to locate urotensin II (UII), a neuropeptide that is a potent vasoconstrictor and increases REM cycles in the brain. The researchers designed antibodies using Goby UII as an antigen that would target the specific peptide sequence CFWKYC. When the peptide was observed using a mass spectrometer the scientists discovered this peptide was smaller than UII but had similar characteristics as well which is why it was called Urotensin II- related peptide.  Structure  The URP gene is located on the 3q28 chromosome of humans. The mature URP peptide is only 8 peptides long making it smaller than UII. URP is also the same across all vertebrates because it has the same cleaving site unlike UII whose cleaving sites vary among species making its sequence different for all species. URP has the same cysteine bridged hexapeptide ring with the sequence CFWKYC as UII. This is known as the core and is the major site of action on the peptide. Destruction of the core leads to immediate loss of biological activity. On the other hand, the amino terminus of URP doesn‚Äôt seem to contain any relevant information because it can be modified without any loss in pharmacological activity. Unlike UII, URP doesn‚Äôt have an acidic amino acid (either glutamic acid or aspartic acid) preceding its core. It is still a potent agonist for the UII- receptor which suggests that this acidic amino acid is not required for activation of the receptor. The peptide sequence for URP is: Alanine-Cysteine-Phenylalanine- Tryptophan-Lysine-Tyrosine-Cysteine-Valine  Receptor  URP is an agonist for the UII receptor which is a G protein-coupled receptor with the alpha subunit GŒ±q11. This activates PKC which then activates PLC which increases the intercellular calcium concentration. It is found in many peripheral tissues, blood vessels, and also the brainstem cholinergic neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT).  Tissue Localization  Prepro-URP which is the precursor to the mature URP peptide is found in various tissues including specific parts of the brain such as frontal lobe and hypothalamus, and other peripheral tissues such as heart, kidneys, lungs, placenta, ovaries, and testes. In humans the amount of UII and URP gene expression are comparable except in the spinal cord where UII gene expression is much higher. In rats the UII gene expression is higher than the URP gene expression throughout the entire body. However, when the brains of the rats were tested, only the URP peptide was found making it the primary endogenous ligand in the brain. Unlike humans and rats, URP gene expression is found in mice spinal cords.  Function  = Cardiovascular = When URP is injected into rats a long hypotensive response will be observed. UII is known as a vasoconstrictor meaning that even though both are agonists for the same receptor they can produce opposite effects = CNS = Axons that react to URP are primarily found in organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) and in the median eminence (ME). These axons are located near the hypothalamus and almost always contain the hormone Gondotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) which was found through in situ hybridization which provides information of the anatomical location URP mRNA. This means that URP might have an effect on reproduction which has not been discovered .  Binding between UII and URP  Since they are both ligands for the same receptor, an experiment was done to determine which ligand had a higher affinity. When the binding of the two were compared and tested, URP actually had higher affinity.

In 1966 she became the first woman to win the breed's World Grand Championship with the horse Shaker's Shocker. Life Betty Sain was born Elizabeth Fay Sain on November 20, 1942, in Manchester, Tennessee. Her parents were Virginia Wright Sain and H. Pearl Sain, and she was their second child. As of 2010, Betty Sain had retired from the horse industry and was living in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Career In 1962, the Sain family bought the weanling colt Shaker's Shocker from Tom Barham, of Lewisburg, Tennessee. Betty Sain trained the colt exclusively and started him under saddle herself. In 1964, she began showing him. In 1966, she entered Shaker's Shocker in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration and won the four-year-old junior stake. She was expected to compete in the four-year- old division again but instead chose to enter the open stake, making her the first woman ever to enter the World Grand Championship class. Sain and Shaker's Shocker placed first out of 13 horses. Sain was the first woman to win, and at age 23 was the youngest rider in the class. After his win, Shaker's Shocker was retired to stud at Sain Stables in Bell Buckle, Tennessee. Sain later exported horses to Israel, Mexico and several other countries, as well as many US states. She rode Shaker's Shocker at University of Tennessee football games. She raised goats as well as horses, and supported a controversial Tennessee law that would have enacted a bounty on the killing of coyotes. When a reporter denied that there were coyotes in Tennessee, Sain froze a dead coyote to preserve it, tied a bow around its neck and presented it to him. Legacy and recognition Although Sain was offered several book and movie deals, she turned them all down. In 2010, the Sain House at Webb School was given a Tennessee historical marker. In 2015, Betty Sain gave a presentation on her family's history, her own experiences with Shaker's Shocker and later horses, and an overview of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed at a meeting of the Bedford County Historical Society. The Tennessee Walking Horse National Museum in Wartrace has a permanent exhibit on Betty Sain and Shaker's Shocker.

An international co-production between the United States and China, the film was released in China in March 2018 with an intended North American theatrical release date of April 2018; it was quietly pulled from the schedule and was made available on Netflix on July 20, 2018. Plot Peng is a carefree goose whose flock is migrating in China. His attitude and demeanor is disapproved by leader Bing, who he and his flock abandon while Peng is asleep. Meanwhile, Chi and Chao, a pair of ducklings on their way to a mystical place called Pleasant Valley, ends up being separated from their flock due to a careless stunt from Peng. To hide from a sinister cat named Banzou, they end up sleeping with Peng after they see him fending off Banzou. Surprised by their presence, Peng ends up recklessly flying away from them before he breaks his wing with a gong. Flightless and frightened, Peng decides to use the ducklings to fend himself off from predators, and return safely to his flock. The ducklings reluctantly agree to go with him. After a series of misadventures, Peng starts to grow on the ducklings, however, before he agrees to help the ducklings reunite with their flock, he comes across his own flock, where Chi and Chao discover his true intentions. The two groups end up parting their own separate ways, as they try to get to their destinations. Peng attempts to fly one more time, but is soon knocked down by hermit squirrel Carl. Carl builds Peng a makeshift wing for him. Inspired, Peng decides to use the wing to head back to Chi and Chao. However, when the ducklings reunite with their flock, they soon realize that Pleasant Valley is actually a restaurant that serves ducklings. Peng rescues Chi and Chao, however, during their escape, they get separated again. Banzou returns and holds the ducklings hostage, Peng confronts Banzou, but becomes badly injured from fighting him. Chi and Chao light a rocket and launch him into the sky to his demise. Weakened, Peng tries to bring Chi and Chao back with his flock, but a snow storm makes him worse. The ducklings fly him towards the spring where the geese are, and Chao, remembering a honk Peng taught him calls for Peng's girlfriend Jingjing, who ultimately ends up rescuing him. The geese welcome the ducks to their flock, and Bing allows the ducks in the flock, having proven wrong of his judgment towards Peng. Peng introduces Jingjing to Chi and Chao, and tells her that might end up having more children.

The Battle of the Queens (in Aostan French, La bataille de reines; in Vald√¥tain dialect, La bataille de vatse; in Standard French, Le combat de vaches) is an annual Cow fighting tournament that takes place in the Aosta Valley. Cows compete for the title of Reina di corne (Vald√¥tain for Queen of horns).  History  The tournament is known to date back (at least) to 1858, which is when Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne wrote about it. Since 1958 it has been co-funded by the district council ().  Breeds  The favoured breed of cow for The Battle is the Valdostaine pie noire. Alpine cows such as these are believed to be relatively assertive, and less likely to refuse to fight than cows accustomed to the soft life in the flat lands.  Description  The event is conceptually similar to cow fighting contests held in the context of summer folk festivals in several of the Swiss valleys. The cows naturally fight in order to determine the hierarchy within the herd: provided the animals' horns have been properly trimmed little lasting damage ensues. Two cows push each other until one falls over or otherwise withdraws. The cow left standing is the winner.  Tournaments  Aosta Valley's Battle of the Queens is more than a single event, however. The overall contest takes the form of a series of elimination heats. Elimination heats take place in various locations in the Aosta Valley during the spring, summer and autumn. Traditionally the first contest of the season takes place at Combe de Vertosan, a small high valley located between La Salle and Avise, near Mont Blanc. In order to avoid injustice and maximise participation, the cows are weighed, using up to date electronic scales, on the morning of the contest, and then separated into three categories according to weight as follows: * Category 1 (heavyweight) above 571 kg * Category 2 (middleweight) 521 kg - 570 kg * Category 3 (lightweight) up to 520 kg Cow weights are not consistent through the year, and for the final three contest of the autumn (fall) the weight band thresholds are increased by 10 or 20 kg.  Combat final  The finals, called in French Combat final, traditionally took place on a Sunday in October at the Puchoz Stadium in Aosta. Today they take place in the newer Croix-Noire Arena which is located on the recently developed eastern edge () of Aosta, near Saint-Christophe.

Trained as a painter, she was one of the first artists to use holography as a medium and had her first solo show of holograms in 1969. She was appointed to the Order of the British Empire in 2000 for her service to art and has been called \\"the mother of British holography\\". Education and early career Margaret Benyon was born in Birmingham, England in 1940 and grew up in Kenya, where she attended Kenya High School. She studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, graduating in 1962. As a working artist in the early 1960s she sought to \\"question the abstract expressionists' assumption that the criterion of excellence in painting was that it should be treated as a flat surface\\". She employed techniques including \\"optical illusions, colour and so on\\", particularly the moir√© pattern, \\"to modulate the picture plane so that it no longer looked flat\\". She also created anaglyph paintings, which appeared three dimensional when viewed through special glasses with differently coloured lenses. Career in holography Benyon became interested in holography after reading a newspaper article about it in 1967. From 1968 to 1971 she held a fellowship in fine art at the University of Nottingham, where she began experimenting with holography as an artistic medium. Building on her already existing knowledge of photographic processing techniques, she taught herself holography by reading scientific journal articles. She was given after-hours use of a laboratory in the university's mechanical engineering department, where she made her first holograms. In 1969 the University of Nottingham art gallery displayed Benyon's holograms in what has been called the world's \\"first solo art holography show\\". She made the holograms for the show in a laboratory of the British Aircraft Corporation in Bristol, England. She later made use of the facilities at the National Physical Laboratory. In February and March 1970 Benyon had a solo show at the Lisson Gallery in London. The exhibition poster described it as the \\"first London expo of holograms and stereoscopic paintings\\". From 1971 to 1973 was a Leverhulme Senior Art fellow in the Department of Architecture and Building Science at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. During this period she had two more exhibitions in Nottingham and one in Edinburgh. Benyon spent the period between 1976 and 1981 in Australia. She taught at the Canberra School of Art and held a creative arts fellowship at the Australian National University in Canberra. Working in laboratories at the university's physics department and the Royal Military College in Duntroon, she continued creating holographic works. Some of her Australian work incorporated other media, such as drawing and painting. After her return to England in 1981 Benyon began working with pulse lasers in collaboration with scientist John Webster at the Central Electricity Generating Board. In 1983 she set up her own holography studio in Dorset, England. In the period between 1981 and 1993 she used the human body as the sole subject matter for her work, combining holography with techniques such as underpainting. Margaret Benyon earned a PhD from the Royal College of Art for a thesis entitled How is Holography Art? in 1994. She was appointed to the Order of the British Empire in 2000 \\"for services to art\\". Benyon has been called \\"the mother of British holography\\". Margaret Benyon returned to Australia in 2005. She continued to practice as an artist, while teaching at the College of Fine Arts at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. She died on 21 October 2016.

Brown, in understanding the origin and diversity of organismal form, function, and diversity by developing general models for the origin of allometry and scaling laws in biology. This research, shows how general scaling laws underlie organismal form, function, and diversity and can be used to 'scale up' biological processes from genes to cells to ecosystems.The Fourth Dimension of Life: Fractal Geometry and Allometric Scaling of OrganismsA general model for ontogenetic growth Allometric scaling of plant energetics and population density This work is also the foundation for the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. (2) Functional Plant Ecology and Trait- based biology ‚Äì Enquist has worked to develop Trait Driver Theory or TDT with Van M. Savage, Jon Norberg and colleagues. TDT provides a general theory of Functional ecology in that it provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness (see Coexistence theory) in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating Metabolic Scaling Theory how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then ‚Äòscale up‚Äô to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, TDT offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches and theory to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change. (3) Macroecology ‚Äì Enquist has worked extensively on assessing the large scale biogeographic and evolutionary drivers of differing facets of biological diversity including functional and phylogenetic diversity. This work has worked to developing novel theoretical and informatics approaches that build from scaling principles and functional biology. Some of this work has focused on forecasting and visualizing the fate of biological diversity and ecosystem functioning under differing climate change and land use change scenarios. This work includes building novel approaches to complex ecological problems ‚Äì utilizing integrative computation, big data, statistical, and visualisation tools to visualize and analyze biological data and to assess how climate change will influence the distribution of diversity and functioning of forests and ecosystems. His lab's research utilizes differing approaches including: developing theory and informatics infrastructure, field work, big datasets, scaling, empirically measuring numerous attributes of organismal form and function, utilizing physiological and trait-based techniques, and assessing macroecological and large-scale patterns. His collaborative group often works in contrasting environments including tropical forests, on elevation gradients, and in high alpine ecosystems.

She is considered by some to be the first female black journalist in Canada. Biography The daughter of free black Quaker parents, she was born Mary Elizabeth Bibb in Rhode Island around 1820. She studied at the Massachusetts State Normal School in Lexington (today Framingham State University), graduating in 1843. The principal of that school was Samuel Joseph May, who supported women's rights and education for black people. She was one of the first black woman teachers in North America and taught in schools in Boston, Albany, New York, and Cincinnati. She became involved in anti-slavery activities and, in 1847, met Henry Bibb, an escaped slave and abolitionist. She became Bibb's second wife in June the following year. After the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1850, the Bibbs moved to Canada West, settling first in Sandwich and then in Windsor. The couple frequently took fugitives into their home who had arrived in Windsor via the Underground Railroad. In 1851, they began publishing a newspaper called Voice of the Fugitive, the first major newspaper targeted at black Canadians. Mary and Henry Bibb were also part of the leadership of the Refugee Home Society, which helped former slaves settle in Canada, providing them with land and building schools and churches. Mary also taught school, educating both children and adults. In 1851, the Bibbs organized a North American Convention in Toronto on how free black Americans and Canadians should respond to the Fugitive Slave Act. On October 9, 1853, the office of the Voice of the Fugitive newspaper was mysteriously burned to the ground. Mary and Henry tried to revive it, but Henry died suddenly in the summer of 1854 at the age of 39.Daniel G. Hill, The Freedom-Seekers: Blacks in Early Canada (Agincourt, ON: Book Society of Canada, 1981), 201‚Äì202. Sometime after 1855, Bibb married Isaac N. Cary. She operated a store in Windsor from 1865 until 1871. After Cary's death, she returned to the US, to Brooklyn, New York, where she died in 1877. Legacy In 2005, Mary and Henry Bibb were declared Persons of National Historic Significance by the Government of Canada.

Distribution Triprismatoolithus is known exclusively from Sevenmile Hill, a fossil site at the Two Medicine Formation in Teton County, Montana. It is the oldest known fossil egg site at that formation, dating to 80 million years ago, the early part of the Campanian. History Fossil eggs are common from the upper part of the Two Medicine formation, but it was not until 2010 that paleontologists discovered eggs in the lower part, including Triprismatoolithus. They were discovered by two paleontologists from the University of Montana: Frankie D. Jackson and David J. Varricchio. It remained of uncertain classification (because no similar eggs were known) until 2012 when Agnolin et al. discovered similar eggs associated with Bonapartenykus, which they classified with Triprismatoolithus in a new oofamily, Arriagadoolithidae. Description The type specimen of Triprismatoolithus is a complete egg measuring 30 mm by 75 mm, but several other incomplete eggs and eggshell fragments are known. The eggs were paired, similar to Continuoolithus. The eggshell is between ranges from 525 to 850 Œºm thick. Triprismatoolithus is notable for having three structural layers, similar to birds and unlike most other non-avian dinosaur eggs.Laura E. Wilson, Karen Chin, Frankie D. Jackson, and Emily S. Bray. (2012). \\"Fossil eggshell: Fragments from the past\\" UCMP's online fossil egg exhibit. The second layer, known as the prismatic layer, is made up of closely packed calcite crystals, and exhibits irregular squamatic texture.F. L. Agnolin, J. E. Powell, F. E. Novas and M. Kundr√°t. 2012. \\"New alvarezsaurid (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from uppermost Cretaceous of north-western Patagonia with associated eggs.\\" Cretaceous Research 35(1):33‚Äì56 It is five times thicker than the mammillary layer. The surface of the eggshell of Triprismatoolithus is covered with low, rounded tubercles, similar to Arriagadoolithus. Classification Triprismatoolithus shares many unique characteristics with Arriagadoolithus, so they are classified together in the oofamily Arriagadoolithidae. Triprismatoolithus contains a single oospecies: T. stephensi. Paleobiology Triprismatoolithus has not been found associated with embryos or adult remains, so it is unknown precisely what kind of dinosaur laid the eggs. However, the closely related oogenus, Arriagadoolithus, was discovered closely associated with the alvarezsaurid Bonapartenykus, so it is likely that T. stephensi was also laid by an unknown alvarezaur or a closely related dinosaur. Arriagadoolithids, like elongatoolithids, prismatoolithids, and Continuoolithus, are laid in pairs, which is interpreted as evidence that oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and alvarezsaurs had two functioning oviducts, unlike birds which have only one.

(10 May 1913 ‚Äî 18 March 2008) was a Kittitian educator. She taught school in St. Kitts for 43 years before moving to the Virgin Islands, where she taught for another decade. She was the first woman in St. Kitts and Nevis to run for public office. For her contributions to education in the Caribbean, she was honoured with the Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth II and granted a life membership in the Caribbean Union of Teachers. A hospital in Molyneux, Saint Kitts, and the teaching excellence award of the St. Kitts Teachers‚Äô Union are named in her honour. Biography Mary Georgina McGregor Charles was born on 10 May 1913 in Phillips Village, Christ Church Nichola Town Parish, St. Kitts, to Henry and Francis Charles. She attended Leach Infant School in Phillips Village and then the Estridge Government School. She passed her Seventh Standard Exam at the age of 12 and enrolled in the pupil-teacher program. This was a system used widely in the Anglo-Caribbean which allowed students, usually between the ages of 14 and 17, to further their education at reduced tuition by teaching younger students. At the end of an additional three-years study, and passing an examination, pupil-teachers qualified as uncertified teachers. If they contracted for another three-year pupil-teaching term and passed their examination, the teachers became fully qualified. Career After successfully passing three such examinations, Charles obtained, in 1932, a scholarship to enroll in the two-year course offered by Spring Gardens Teacher Training College in Antigua. Returning to St. Kitts in 1934, she was unable to secure a paid position and worked as an unpaid teacher at Estridge Government School until the following year. At that time, she was hired as an assistant teacher at St. Paul‚Äôs Government School. She taught at St. Paul‚Äôs until 1945, when she accepted a position as the head teacher in Palmetto Point at the Trinity Government School. After three years, she returned to Estridge Government School as head teacher. She lived in Molineux and rode her bicycle daily to the school, for which she received a transportation allowance. In 1956, she was transferred as head teacher to the Cayon Government School, where she taught for the next 12 years. During this time, she also served as a school inspector. The following year, Charles' sister, Isa Isaac, died leaving five children in need of care. Charles took in the boys and raised them. She returned to Molineux in 1968, and retired from government service two years later. Charles served as a member of the Moravian Provincial Synod meeting, held in Antigua, as part of the St. Kitts delegation in 1969. and briefly taught at the George Moody Stuart Memorial School at the sugar factory, located in Golden Rock, Basseterre. Then in 1971, as the first woman candidate in St. Kitts and Nevis, Charles ran for election on the ticket of the People‚Äôs Action Movement. She didn't win and soon moved to the Virgin Islands. Charles taught in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, for 18 months and then moved to Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, where she continued to teach. In 1975, she married Valdemar Henrique George (1910‚Äì2000) and they made their home in Christiansted. George retired from teaching after 53 years in 1978 and the following year, she was made a life-time member of the Caribbean Union of Teachers. In recognition of her many years of service to education, George was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with the Order of the British Empire in the New Year‚Äôs Honours for 1985. The following year, a hospital in Molyneux was completed which was named in her honour as the Mary Charles Hospital. After her husband's death, George returned to St. Kitts.

Background The town of Mount Elba, located on the Saline River in present-day Cleveland County, Arkansas, was established in the 1830s and became a thriving southern Arkansas commercial center. With the construction of the road from Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, to Camden , Ouachita County in the 1830s, and the establishment of a nearby ferry by Simeon Goodwin in 1845, a trade center began to develop. In the 1850s a two story Masonic Lodge and a Masonic Female College. The town's businesses included the ferry crossing, a post office, two stores, three doctors, a school, and a blacksmith. The largest business, which employed five workers, was a nearby steam-powered sawmill that produced approximately 600,000 board feet of lumber annually. A levee built by slave labor, stretched from the ferry crossing to the south to protect the town and local plantations from flooding from the Saline River. Further down river from the town was a ford that could be used during period of low water. The town was located between the road from Pine Bluff to Princeton and the road from Pine Bluff to Warren.Mount Elba (Cleveland County)http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=7024 The village of Longview (also spelled Long View) was established around 1840, forty-three miles to the southeast of Mount Elba in Bradley County was also a port on the Saline River. Longview was also an important center of transportation for the counties both sides of the river, including Ashley, Drew, and Bradley counties. Local road networks brought travelers to and from the port. On the east side of the river, a branch of the Louisiana Trace led through Fountain Hill to the Pine Bluff and Monroe, Louisiana road. A north-south route passing through Longview connected Monticello, Fountain Hill and the Marie Saline landing on the Ouachita River. A road from the Mississippi river port town, Columbia, in Chicot County, passed through Longview on its way to Camden and served as a westward route to Texas. With the beginning of the Civil War, the port and ferry at Longview assumed even more importance because of the need to move troops from the west to the major theater of operations in the east. By the summer of 1864, the Confederates had constructed a pontoon bridge across the river to provide faster and more reliable crossings from the eastern part of Arkansas to the Camden and western areas of Arkansas and Texas. After the capture of Little Rock on September 10, 1863 by the Federal army commanded by Major General Frederick Steele, the Confederate army commanded by Major-General Sterling Price retreated to Arkadelphia and then to Camden where they went into winter quarters. The Camden Expedition was launched in cooperation with the Red River Campaign of 1864. U.S. planners envisioned two federal armies converging simultaneously, one force under the command of General Nathaniel Banks pressing northward up the Red River commencing at Alexandria, Louisiana and the other federal army under the command of General Frederick Steele driving southwestward from Little Rock Arkansas. The objective was to press the rebel army of General E. Kirby Smith back upon the rebel stronghold at Shreveport and defeat him. If successful, a somewhat vague second phase envisioned the two federal armies combining into one large force and continuing their offensive with a westward push into Texas. Prelude On March 23, 1864, Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele marched a combined 8,500-man force of infantry, artillery and cavalry from the Little Rock Arsenal. At roughly the same time, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks' army departed from New Orleans in conjunction with Rear Admiral David Porter's naval expedition. Steele and Banks were to push aside the enemy in their respective fronts, then combine forces to seize Shreveport. Steele would garrison that city while Banks forged ahead into northeastern Texas. To General Steele, who on March 27 was camped 20 miles from Arkadelphia, Confederate troops at Monticello were a threat to his rear area. Reporting to Major General W. T. Sherman, he wrote: \\"It is officially reported that a large force of the enemy is fortifying at Monticello. More than half of my cavalry are dismounted, and most of the rest very poorly mounted. Artillery horses and transportation in the same condition ... We have had to haul most of our forage 30 and 40 miles for months. On the 24th, Colonel Powell Clayton, the post commander at Pine Bluff received written instructions from General Steele. His orders stated that he was to remain at Pine Bluff to guard the rear of the Union army and to observe the enemy in the direction of Monticello and Camden and if he found them to be retreating, to press them with all his available force. In obedience to these orders, Colonel Clayton selected Lieutenants Greathouse and Young of the 5th Kansas cavalry. Both lieutenants had 40 picked and well mounted men and orders to penetrate the enemy's outer lines, hanging upon the flanks of his camps until they could obtain definite information of the enemy's movements. On the evening of the 26th, Lieutenants Greathouse and Young returned and expressed their opinion that Dockery's force was preparing to leave Monticello. The expedition to Mount Elba began on March 27, 1864 when the Union forces under Colonel Powell Clayton left the post at Pine Bluff on its mission to attack the Confederate forces commanded by Brigadier General Thomas P. Dockery camped at Monticello. Opposing forces =Union= 75px Colonel Clayton's force consisted of seven officers and 230 enlisted men from the 18th Illinois Infantry, a detachment of five officers and 260 men from the 28th Wisconsin Infantry, and 600 men, four mountain howitzers and two steel rifled guns from the 1st Indiana, 5th Kansas and 7th Missouri Cavalry (US) units. The infantry portion of the expedition was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Marks of the 18th Illinois and the cavalry portion was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wilton Jenkins of the 5th Kansas cavalry. In addition to the men and guns, Clayton's force also carried eight pontoons, mounted on wagon wheels, along with them to bridge streams as they came to them as well as a small wagon train of supplies. =Confederate= 75px General Dockery's forces consisted of his own brigade composed of the remnants of several regiments what had been paroled and declared exchanged following the Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Port Hudson in July 1863, and elements of Colonel Crawford‚Äôs Arkansas Cavalry Brigade, including his own 1st Arkansas Cavalry, Wright's 12th Arkansas Cavalry, Slemon's 2nd Arkansas Cavalry, McMurtrey‚Äôs Cavalry Battalions and Poe's battalion of the 11th Arkansas Mounted Infantry.Mark K.

Gen. Sterling Price's personal escort were involved in as a part of Dockery's command. Battle =Initial movements= On March 27, 1864 Colonel Clayton, who commanded the Fifth Kansas Cavalry at Pine Bluff, reported to Union Brigadier General Kimball his plans to launch an attack at Mount Elba, a community on the Saline in modern day Cleveland County, and \\"at which point, I will throw a temporary bridge across the Saline, and leave my infantry and part of my artillery to hold the same and act as a reserve. I will cross with my cavalry, make a feint in the direction of Camden, and move rapidly down the Saline by way of Warren to Long View, at which point the enemy have a pontoon bridge over which they cross in communicating with Camden from Monticello. I think they have some military stores also at this point. By destroying this bridge, I will cut off their communications and will be able to attack any small parties that may be between the Saline and the Washita (sic).\\" United States. War Department.

Clayton moved first toward Monticello, then toward Mount Elba. Arriving at Mount Elba in Cleveland County about 4 p. m. on March 28, the Union troops killed one and captured four of the Confederates defenders there. They then began assembling their wheeled pontoons and completed a bridge across the river by midnight. Confederate troops at Mount Elba were returning from Gaines Landing on the Mississippi River near Eudora where they had picked up supplies to be taken to the Confederate command in Camden. With the attack on Mount Elba, many of those soldiers withdrew to the Longview area. Lieutenants Greathouse and Young returned during the night and reported that they had driven in the enemy's pickets at Branchville the night before. At daylight on the morning of the 29th, Colonel Clayton left all the infantry, three pieces of artillery and one squadron of cavalry with the train at Mount Elba under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Marks with instructions to hold the bridge and observe the enemy in the direction of Monticello. He then moved eight miles with the balance of his command across the Saline in the direction of Camden to the vicinity of Marks' Mill. Colonel Clayton made this crossroads the base of his operations and gave instructions to Lieutenants Greathouse and Young with 50 picked and well mounted men each, for a total of 100, to move rapidly by the way of Warren to Longview to destroy the pontoon bridge. In order to cover the raid on Longview, Colonel Clayton sent a squad of cavalry along the Camden road, the two Princeton roads and up each side of the Saline River with instructions to convey the idea that the whole command was advancing on each of these roads. These squads of cavalry went out from 10 to 20 miles and returned the same day. Captain Pierce captured six prisoners on the road up the south banks of the Saline River. Captain Young skirmished with a squad of Confederate cavalry on the Princeton road, capturing 10 prisoners and reported Confederate General Joseph Shelby was at Princeton. =Skirmish at Longview= At daylight on the morning of March 29, the Union troops left their encampment at Mount Elba and moved rapidly toward Camden to the vicinity of Mark's Mills. From there, Clayton sent Lieutenants Frank M. Greathouse of the First Indiana Cavalry and Grover Young of the Fifth Kansas Cavalry with 50 picked men from each unit, for a total of 100 troopers, \\"to move with the utmost rapidity by the way of Warren to Long View, to destroy the pontoon bridge, the enemy's trains, etc.\\" The Union cavalrymen moved rapidly, arriving on the west side of the river at Longview just after sundown. A number of Confederate soldiers were encamped on the west side of the river.THE WAR IN ARKANSAS.; The Rebels Defeated at Longview Destruction of a Bridge and Train Over Three Hundred Prisoners Captured Another Pitched Battle and the Rebels again Routed Operations of Gov. Murphy. FURTHER PARTICULARS. The New Your Times, WASHINGTON, Wednesday, April 7, 1864., Accessed 27 May 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/07/news/war-arkansas-rebels-defeated-longview- destruction-bridge-train-over-threehundred.html Apparently Confederate pickets failed to respond to the presence of the Union raiding party because they assumed that the Union soldiers were a party of Wright's Cavalry that recently passed through the area were returning for some reason. It was often difficult to distinguish Union soldiers from Confederates during this period of the war. Some Confederates in Arkansas were wearing clothing manufactured at Confederate depots made out of English army cloth. Confederates had received a supply of British cloth through the Union blockade to Confederate depots in Texas, and a supply of uniforms made from this cloth had been forwarded to Arkansas. Jackets made from this material were hard to distinguish from Federal infantry and mounted service jackets.Fred Adolphus, \\"Confederate Quartermaster Clothing from the Houston Depot\\", in Military Collector and Historian, Winter 1996 To add to the confusion, some Confederate units, such as Confederate General Joe Shelby's Missouri Cavalry Brigade had become known for dressing in captured Union uniforms. Confederates on the west side of the river apparently thought that the Union cavalrymen were fellow Confederates and made no attempt to resist them. The written report that the two lieutenants explained, \\"When we came to the fork of Long View and Camden Road, which is some two miles from Long View, we took four prisoners, and learned from them that there had been a train of nine wagons and 25 men passed out a short time ahead of us. We sent a party out after them, burnt the wagons, and captured the men. We learned from them that there was a large train crossing, which had come out from Monticello that day. We moved on, and reached their camp just at dark. We charged into their camp, surrounded them, and demanded their surrender, and ordered them to fall into line. We coming on them so unexpectedly, and they being in such confusion, they obeyed immediately. There were 250 men, 7 or 8 officers. We destroyed their bridge, threw about 175 or 200 stand of arms in the river, burnt 30 wagons, which were loaded with baggage and camp equippage, also ammunition; took some 300 horses and mules. We then mounted our prisoners, and returned to our most worthy commander all O. K.\\" Numerous accounts of the skirmish at Longview seemed to suggest that most of the Confederates there were engaged in unloading a steamer of corn along with a supply and baggage train headed to Camden. The Steamer was not captured as once it became apparent what was happening the crew slipped it mooring and allowed the boat to drift downstream to be hidden in some rushes. The Union troops cut the pontoon bridge and destroyed a Confederate supply train they found on the west side of the river, and by 9:30 the next morning, had returned to the Union camp at Mount Elba. =Battle of Mount Elba= While the remainder of Dockery's brigade remained in camp at Monticello, Colonel John C. Wrights' regiment was on outpost duty between Pine Bluff and Monticello. Here, Colonel Wright received orders from General Dockery to move in the direction of Pine Bluff and ascertain whether the enemy had moved or was preparing to move. When within a few miles of Pine Bluff, Colonel Wright learned that the enemy had gone south on the day before in the direction of Mount Elba, Colonel Wright immediately took up the pursuit and overtook the enemy at sundown camped in the town of Mount Elba. At this time his presence was not known. Leaving a strong picket in the enemy's rear, he moved five miles east across Big Creek and went into camp. Earlier he had sent a courier to General Dockery at Monticello informing him of the condition and asking for re-enforcements. In a few hours a courier from General Dockery arrived with an order stating, \\"The General commanding is surprised to learn of your whereabouts; supposed from the orders given you, you would be in the vicinity of Pine Bluff. You will report at once to these headquarters.\\" Colonel Wright's answer to this was, \\"if I obey this order there will not be so much as a single picket between you and the enemy. I am sure the General commanding does not understand this situation, hence I decline to obey until further orders.\\" This answer was dispatched in haste and by daylight on the morning of the 30th, General Dockery with his brigade was at the camp of Colonel Wright. While en route to attack the Union force at Mount Elba, Colonel Wright informed General Dockery that he had men in his command that knew the country well, who had before sunrise had gotten behind the Federal pickets and captured them without firing a shot, so that when the whole command was within a few hundred yards of the Union camp, their presence being unsuspected. A charge then would have taken them by surprise and the results would be almost certain capture of all north of the river. But, General Dockery would not consent and delayed two hours getting his regiments into position. Meanwhile, their presence had been discovered by Captain Barnes with a squad of cavalry who had been sent on the road toward Monticello to watch the enemy. About 2:00 a.m. on the morning of the 30th, fearing that Lieutenant-Colonel Marks might not have sufficient cavalry to watch the enemy in the direction of Monticello, Colonel Clayton sent Captain Barnes with a squad of cavalry to report to him with orders to move at daylight in that direction. About 8:30 a.m. Colonel Clayton received a report that Captain Barnes had met the enemy on an opposite side of the river and had been driven in. Colonel Clayton immediately sent Lieutenant Colonel Jenkins with the Fifth Kansas cavalry to the assistance of Lieutenant-Colonel Marks, who was holding the bridge at Mount Elba.United States.

At 9:30 a.m. Lieutenants Greathouse and Young returned and reported the destruction of the bridge at Long View, the burning of a loaded train of 35 wagons, the capture of a large number of arms and ammunition, and bringing with them about 260 prisoners, nearly 300 horses and mules and a large number of contrabands. When Captain Barnes reported to Lieutenant-Colonel Marks early on the morning of the 30th, he sent his out on the road toward Monticello with instructions to scout the road for some distance and report by night. At 7:30 a.m. Captain Barnes returned and reported that he had encountered a body of the enemy cavalry of 100 men marching in the direction of Mount Elba.United States. War Department.

Colonel Marks immediately prepared for their defense. A barricade was formed of rails and logs from some negro huts and companies A, F, G, H and I of the Twenty-Eighth Wisconsin was thrown forward as skirmishers to engage the enemy and watch his movements. Here the skirmishing continued for approximately two hours. A t 9:30 a.m., The Federal skirmishers were forced to retreat into their camp, closely followed by the Confederates who made a spirited attack. About the time the Federal skirmishers were driven in, Lieutenant-Colonel Jenkins of the Fifth Kansas cavalry arrived at the Ferry and assumed command of the camp.United States. War Department.

Dismounting his men and leaving the horses under the bluff across the river from the camp, Colonel Jenkins sent his men to the front and threw out the line of skirmishers to hold the enemy in check as long as possible enabling them to improve on the hastily constructed barricades from the rails lying scattered around and in the fences nearby. This was done under a heavy fire from the enemy who now appeared in such force that Colonel Jenkins' skirmishers had to fall back on the main command.United States. War Department.

The Union battle line was formed with the right flank held by the Eightieth Illinois infantry, the left by the Twenty- Eighth Wisconsin and two companies of the Fifth Kansas cavalry and the center by three howitzers supported by the dismounted cavalry. The Confederates evidently expecting easy victory, kept moving steadily forward under the cover of the timber keeping up a continuous fire along their whole line. Up to this time only two or three rounds had been fired from the artillery though the firing of small arms had been severe for some time. The Confederates were now advancing with loud cheers and could plainly be seen through the woods in their front. Colonel Jenkins ordered the howitzers to be fired as rapidly as possible. After 30 minutes of hard fighting, it became evident that the severity of the Union fire was causing the Confederates to fall back in great haste and confusion. Seeing this, Colonel Jenkins again advanced his skirmishers and threw his left flank for ward some 300 or 400 yards. Here they found a number of Confederate dead and wounded as well as a number of arms which had been left in their hurried retreat. Colonel Jenkins now had the horses brought across the river and Majors Walker and Scudder of the Fifth Kansas cavalry with 100 men and one howitzer were sent after the retreating Confederates with orders to harass them as much as possible. Lieutenant Colonel Jenkins had just issued orders to have the dead collected, the wounded taken into the house, and to have the arms gathered when Colonel Clayton arrived relieving him of command. When the sound of the artillery firing was heard in the direction of Mount Elba and after a courier from Colonel Jenkins reported an engagement going on at that place, Colonel Clayton, who was still at his camp at Mark's Mill, immediately marched to the assistance of Colonel Jenkins. When he arrived at the crossing, he found that the enemy had been repulsed and had fallen back about one mile, followed by Majors Walker and Scudder with the Fifth Kansas cavalry. He immediately joined the pursuit with all his available cavalry and instructed Colonel Marks to follow with the infantry. After going about one mile, he found the enemy posted in thick timber with an enclosed field and peach orchard between his position. He had the fence thrown down and ordered the charge. When the artillery opened fire, the Union cavalry charged across the. open field into the timber. Here the Confederates broke into the wildest confusion and from this time on, their retreat was a perfect rout. The road and timber was strewn with blankets, saddlebags and guns. Prisoners were being brought in and sent to the rear. The pursuit was kept up until the Union cavalry reached a point about five miles from Mount Elba where the road crosses Big Creek. Here the Confederate rear guard under the command of Colonel Wright had succeeded in tearing up about 20 feet of the bridge and carrying off the boards. The creek could not be forded, therefore the pursuit was suddenly and effectively halted. By the time the Union forces were ready to move again, it was 5:00 p.m. and by the time they reached Centerville, a point about 12 miles from Mount Elba, it was night. At this time the greater part of the cavalry that had the expedition to Longview was very much fatigued and unable to move any further. The infantry with the prisoners and train were still somewhere behind. In view of this and the fact that the enemy had obtained four hours head start by obstructing the bridge and the encumbrance of the prisoners who would be difficult to guard during a night march, Colonel Clayton concluded that to pursue the enemy any further would be a useless tax upon the energy and endurance of his command. He therefore went to camp and the next day; marched the 28 miles back to Pine Bluff. Aftermath The Battle of Mount Elba lasted two and one half hours. For the Union forces, the expedition was a brilliant success. For three days they were deep in enemy territory, where they had fought and defeated forces more than twice their number. By skillful maneuvering, 100 picked men of this small force managed to get behind the Confederate army, capture and destroy his train of 35 wagons loaded with a great value of stores containing their paymasters safe with $860,000 (Confederate money), destroy their pontoon bridge over the Saline River, captured and brought to Mount Elba 260 prisoners, 300 horses and mules and a large number of contrabands. The Union loss throughout the expedition was only two killed and eight missing. The Confederate forces at Mount Elba consisted of Crawford's, Crockett's and Wright's regiments or about 1,200 men commanded by General Dockery in person. Their defeat was thorough and complete with a loss in killed, wounded and missing, independent of the 260 captured at Long View, of over 160 men. General Dockery, by not taking advantage of the information sent to him the night of the 29th by Colonel John Wright and by delaying two hours in getting his brigade into position, let slip through his hands the chance to capture the greater part of the Union forces at Mount Elba. Major General Sterling Price, the commander of the Confederate district of Arkansas, wrote to Brigadier-General W. R. Boggs, Chief of Staff of the Trans-Mississippi Department, that General Dockery, who was headquartered at Monticello commanding the 12th Arkansas Battalion Sharpshooters, the 18th Arkansas, the 19th Arkansas and the 20th Arkansas, had been ordered to harass the rear flanks of the Union troop movements and attack Union supply trains. \\"Unfortunately,\\" he reported, \\"before Brigadier-General Dockery could execute this order he was on March 29 attacked at Mount Elba by a party of the enemy from Pine Bluff and completely routed. They at the same time captured at Long View his entire train (twenty-six wagons) and about 200 prisoners.\\" United States. War Department.

Powell's success at Longview and Mount Elba were one of few bright spots for the Union forces in Arkansas that spring and the Union press lavished praise on Powell and his men\\" \\"Col. Clayton, commanding the expedition from Pine Bluff, destroyed the pontoon bridge at Longviewburned a train of thirty-five wagons loaded with camp and garrison equipage, ammunition, quartermaster's stores, etc., and captured over three hundred prisoners.....He engaged (General Thomas) Dockery's division, of about 1200 men, from Monticello, on the morning of the 30th ult., routed and pursued him ten miles, with a loss on his side of over one hundred killed and woundedcapturing a large quantity of small arms and two stands of colors. Our loss did not exceed fifteen in killed, wounded and missing.\\". Col. Clayton by this expedition has added fresh laurels to his brow. He is worthy of all honor, and deserving the highest reward at the hands of the government. He has been in every instance successful and will be promoted to the rank of Brigadier General for valiant service to the Union cause. He justly deserves the honor.\\". Clayton's report to his superiors highly praised the two lieutenants who had commanded the raid which resulted in the skirmish at Longview. He said, \\"The Long View raid reflects the highest credit to Lieutenants Greathouse and Young, and for brilliancy and success is almost without a parallel. One hundred men (50 from the First Indiana and 50 from the Fifth Kansas Cavalry) marched 40 miles into the enemy's country, captured and destroyed a train of 35 wagons loaded with stores of great value (their paymaster's safe containing over $60,000), destroyed their pontoon bridge over the Saline River, captured and brought to Mount Elba 260 prisoners, nearly 300 horses and mules, and a large number of contrabands, all, including the march of 80 miles to Long View and back, in the surprising short space of twenty- four hours. Our loss throughout the expedition was but two killed and eight missing. The conduct of the officers and men throughout was most gallant and energetic, and deserves the highest commendation.\\" Even though Powell's raid on Longview was a success, it was followed by a string of Union defeats and ultimately the failure of both Steele's Camden Expedition and the over all Red River Campaign. By the time that Steele arrived back in Little Rock, after 40 days in which the expedition had covered 275 miles, he had lost 635 of the 800 wagons and 2,500 horses and mules, not including at least 150 wagons and several hundred horses and mules lost at the Battle of Marks' Mill. While complete figures are not available, the Union troops lost 1,775 in killed, wounded or missing, not including the losses at Poison Spring, Jenkins, Ferry, or losses suffered by the various cavalry troops during the campaign.

The term originated in the early 2000s. In the following decade, media reported a rise in ghosting, which has been attributed to the increasing use of social media and online dating apps.  Origin of term  The term is used in the context of online exchanges, and became popular by 2015 through numerous articles on high-profile celebrity relationship dissolutions, and went on to be widely used. It has been the subject of numerous articles and discussions on dating and relationships in various media. It was included in the Collins English Dictionary in 2015.  In popular culture  Ghosting appears to be becoming more common. Various explanations have been suggested, but social media is often blamed, as are dating apps and the relative anonymity and isolation in modern-day dating and hookup culture, which make it easier to sever contact with few social repercussions. In addition, the more commonplace the behaviour becomes, the more individuals can become desensitised to it. Others have suggested that it is due to the decline of empathy in society, along with the promotion of a more selfish, narcissistic culture. Ghosting is not limited to only intimate relationship contexts. It can also happen between friends or even family members, and be practiced by employers with prospective candidates.  In personal relationships  Ghosting may be especially hurtful for those on the receiving end, causing feelings of ostracism and rejection. Some mental health professionals consider ghosting to be a passive-aggressive form of emotional abuse, a type of silent treatment or stonewalling behaviour, and emotional cruelty. In his article, \\"In Defense of Ghosting\\", Alexander Abad-Santos states: \\"the thing that undermines these diatribes against ghosting is that...[we] know what happened with their ghost. It just didn't work out and sometimes we just can't accept it.\\" He continues: \\"[a]t the heart of it, ghosting is as clear as any other form of rejection. The reason we complain about it is because we wanted a different outcome ... which is totally understandable.\\" However, this argument does not account for the inherent ambiguity in ghosting‚Äîthe person being ghosted does not know whether they are being rejected for something they or somebody else did, whether the person doing it is ashamed or does not know how to break up (or is scared of hurting the other's feelings). Also the ghost may simply not want to date the victim anymore, or may have started dating someone else while keeping the ghostee as a reserve option in case a relationship does not work out with that other date, as well as they can be facing serious problems in their lives. It may become impossible to tell which it is, making it stressful and painful. Related terms and behaviors While \\"ghosting\\" refers to \\"disappearing from a special someone's life mysteriously and without explanation\\", numerous similar behaviors have been identified, that include various degrees of continued connection with a target. For example, \\"Caspering\\" is a \\"friendly alternative to ghosting. Instead of ignoring someone, you're honest about how you feel, and let them down gently before disappearing from their lives.\\" A possible response to ghosting has been suggested with \\"ghostbusting\\": forcing the \\"ghoster\\" to reply. Then there is the sentimental and positive, but also ghost-related in origin, Marleying, which is \\"when an ex gets in touch with you at Christmas out of nowhere\\". \\"Cloaking\\" is another related behavior that occurs when an online match blocks you on all apps while standing you up for a date. The term was coined by Mashable journalist Rachel Thompson after she was stood up for a date by a Hinge match and blocked on all apps.  Research  In 2014, a YouGov survey was taken to see if Americans have ever ghosted their partner to end a relationship. In a 2014 survey, 1,000 US adults were interviewed about ghosting with results yielding that just over 10% of Americans have ghosted someone to break up with them.

History Efforts to bring trade unionists together across Manchester go back to the eighteenth century. In 1818 the cotton spinners persuaded other trades to join them in a successful but short lived Philanthropic Society. The first use of the name Trades Council was a meeting in 1837 of the United Trades Council of Manchester and Salford organising support for the Glasgow Cotton Spinners. A thousand people in the Corn Exchange listened to speakers including J.R. Richardson, author of ‚ÄòThe Rights of Women‚Äô and Joseph Rayner Stephens, both of whom went on to be active Chartists. Following a trade union conference in Sheffield in July 1866 called to discuss the use of the lockout weapon by employers, two delegates from the Manchester Typographical Association, William Henry Wood and Samuel Caldwell Nicholson, convened the inaugural meeting of the Manchester and Salford Trades Union Council in October 1866. A month later Wood was elected secretary and Nicholson president. Wood and Nicholson were Conservative working men. Other members of the council included the radicals Peter Shorrocks of the Tailors, William MacDonald of the Operative Housepainters and Malcolm MacLeod, an engineer. When the Council decided to avoid identifying with any political movement, the radicals set up the Trade Unionists Political Association with MacDonald as president and MacLeod as secretary. One of the Trades Council's first decisions was the proposal to form a court of arbitration. Set up jointly with the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in 1868, it was short-lived, failing to arbitrate a single case. More significantly in February that year, the council called a national conference of trade unionists which met in June and agreed to form what became the Trades Union Congress. Woods was elected president and Shorrocks secretary. This soon became the leading national association of trade unions. Peter Shorrocks played a leading role in establishing the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and was an active supporter of the International Workingmen's Association, the First International. He succeeded Wood to be secretary from 1877 to 1883. He was followed as secretary by George Davy Kelley, full-time secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers and a member of the General Council of the Manchester Liberal Association. Kelley helped to greatly increase affiliations to the council. Many of the new affiliations were general unions of unskilled workers, a development which Kelley opposed as he felt the organisations would not endure, but they soon came to dominate the council. Despite this, Kelley remained the council's most prominent figure, being elected to Manchester City Council in 1891 as a Liberal-Labour representative.Alan Haworth and Dianne Hayter, Men who made Labour, pp.122-123 In 1902, the council convened a meeting of local trade unionists and members of the Independent Labour Party and Social Democratic Federation, which renamed the council as the Manchester Trades and Labour Council, becoming the local affiliate of the Labour Representation Committee.Declan McHugh, Labour in the City, p.53 Two years later, Kelley broke his links with the Liberals, and in 1906 he was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament, standing down from his trades council posts. In the 1920s, the council affiliated to the Communist Party of Great Britain-led National Minority Movement.Alan Clinton, The Trade Union Rank and File: Trades Councils in Britain, 1900-40, p.148 Although the Labour Party set up its own Manchester Borough organisation, the council continued to campaign on a wide range of labour issues, remaining the leading labour movement organisation in the city into the 1930s, and attracted the support of John Maynard Keynes for its proposals on local industrial policy.Alan Clinton, The Trade Union Rank and File: Trades Councils in Britain, 1900-40, pp.179-180 In 1974, Salford District Trades Council was created, and the Manchester Trades Union Council adopted its present name.Salford Trades Union Council, \\"Officers\\" Secretaries :1866: William Henry Wood :1877: Peter Shorrocks :1883: George Davy Kelley :1906: Tom Fox :1909: William R.

Unlike the internationally known standard French 52-card deck, most Russian card games employ either the 36 card (games such as Durak) or the 32 card (particularly Preferans) decks.  History  Playing cards were first introduced into Russia at the beginning of the 17th century from Western and Central Europe (supposedly from Germany and Poland). But they were soon banned, Sobornoye Ulozheniye of 1649 mentioned card games as one of the \\"thief's crimes\\" punished by lashing, however, since Peter the Great the ban was usually ignored. In spite of many attempts by the Russian government to restrict card games, many Russians, especially the Russian nobility, played cards in a significant scale during the 18th century. Before the 19th century practically all playing cards were imported from Western and Central Europe, and since 1765 all imported cards had to be stamped and the high import duty had to be paid (that was supposed to limit card gaming). However, in 1819 the restrictions were lifted, but at the same time the import of playing cards was also forbidden and the state monopoly was created. The production of own Russian playing cards started in the Imperial Card Factory of the Imperial Paper Mill in Aleksandrovo (now a part of Saint-Petersburg).  Design  Russian playing card deck (face cards) designed by Adolf Charlemagne The design of the Russian card decks were derived and influenced by the German card decks as well as the French card decks. Russian cards in the market were divided into three or four categories, depending on the quality of paper and printing: from cheapest decks for laymen through medium quality decks for the Russian middle class to high class decks for the imperial court and the higher nobility. The middle category was covered by talcum powder, its cards were smooth and easy to shuffle, hence the term satin cards (). In 1862 the renown Russian painter Adolf Charlemagne () created a new unified design. Very soon his design became the most widespread and recognizable and it is still widely produced and used in Russia. Apart from that nearly fifty card designs were devised by various Russian artists during the 18th‚Äì20th centuries. = \\"Russian style\\" = \\"Russian style\\" card deck The end of the 19th and the beginning of 20th knew the rising interest to the old pre-Petrine Russian traditions (see also Russian Revival architecture), this fashion was even more intensified due to the 300th anniversary of the house of Romanovs in 1913. As a result, in 1911 the particular card design in the \\"Russian style\\" () was created. The costumes of the face cards imitated the historical 17th century Russian costumes of the famous 1903 Ball in the Winter Palace.  Deck  Due to the German influence the Russian standard deck contains only 36 cards from 6 to the ace. For some games, particularly Preferans, the 6s are not used, resulting in the 32 card deck. Nevertheless, the 52 card decks may also occur. Ace of Diamond with the Imperial coat of arms The design of the pip (numerical) cards as well as the suits (, , , ) resemble those of French playing cards. The design of the face cards is either that of Adolf Charlemagne or in the \\"Russian style\\". The design of the aces are variable, historically the ace of diamonds showed the coat of arms of the Russian Empire. The face cards and the aces are marked by the Russian letters that correspond to the Russian rank names: * (, tuz from \\"deuce\\" via ) for Ace * (, korol', \\"king\\") for King * (, dama from or ) for Queen * (, valet from ) for Jack The names for the pip cards are derived from Russian numerals: (shestyorka, semyorka, vos'myorka, devyatka, desyatka) for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 respectively.  In Russian culture  The popularity of card games in Russia was portrayed by some famous Russian writers, particularly Alexandre Pushkin who wrote The Queen of Spades. Because the 6 is the lowest card of the Russian deck, Russian slang uses the derogatory word shestyorka meaning \\"underling, lackey\\".  References   *  External links  * Playing cards from Russia.

He has made numerous television appearances on shows including The Mind of a Chef on PBS and as a contestant on the ninth season of Top Chef. He is a four-time James Beard Award nominee and currently owns four restaurants in Louisville, Kentucky, National Harbor, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. Early life and career Lee was born on July 2, 1972 and raised in Brooklyn to Korean parents. Lee began cooking at the age of 11 and credits his grandmother with first sparking his interest in food. After graduating magna cum laude with a degree in literature from NYU, Lee began cooking professionally at the age of 22. He traveled to France and toured the US to learn more about different ingredients, cuisines and cooking methods. It was on a trip to the Kentucky Derby in 2001 that he fell in love with Louisville and Southern cooking. He moved to the city in 2002 and began working at 610 Magnolia with former chef/owner Eddie Garber. Lee now owns 610 Magnolia along with four other restaurants; Milkwood and Whiskey Dry in Louisville, and two locations of Succotash, in Washington, D.C. and National Harbor. In 2007, Lee opened a venue for special events called The Wine Studio@610 Magnolia. In 2011, he was one of the 'cheftestants' on season 9 of Top Chef. He won two elimination challenges, and was the twelfth to exit the competition. He was also the host chef featured in the third season of The Mind of a Chef. In 2014, Lee partnered with YouthBuild and IDEAS 40203 to create a culinary training program based in the Smoketown neighborhood of Louisville. The program trains youth who may not be able to afford expensive culinary schools with skills in all aspects of the restaurant industry.

European tax avoidance  In October 2012, Starbucks faced criticism after a Reuters investigation found that the company reportedly paid only ¬£8.6 million in corporation tax in the UK over 14 years, despite generating over ¬£3 billion in sales‚Äîthis included no tax payments on ¬£1.3 billion of sales in the three years prior to 2012. It is alleged that Starbucks was able to do this by charging high licensing fees to the UK branch of the business, allowing them to declare a ¬£33 million loss in 2011. The UK subsidiary pays patent fees to the US subsidiary, purchases coffee beans from the Netherlands subsidiary (where corporation tax is lower than in the UK), and uses the Swiss subsidiary for other \\"miscellaneous services\\". A YouGov survey suggested that Starbucks' brand image was substantially weakened by the controversy surrounding how much tax it pays in the UK several weeks after the allegations surfaced. Starbucks' chief financial officer (CFO) appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in November 2012 and admitted that the Dutch government granted a special tax rate to their European headquarters, which the UK business pays royalties to. Dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes, unlike in the rest of the EU. The CFO denied that they chose the Netherlands as their European headquarters to avoid tax, explaining that the company's Dutch coffee roasting plant was the reason for the decision. Until 2009, the royalty rate was 6% of UK sales, but after being challenged by UK tax authorities it was reduced to 4.7%. The CFO told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products, but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided. The coffee they serve in the UK is purchased from the Swiss subsidiary, which charges a 20% markup on the wholesale price and pays 12% corporation tax on profits. Coffee is not transported to Switzerland but the 30 people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality. Regarding Starbucks' frequent reports of loss in the UK, the CFO told the committee that Starbucks are \\"not at all pleased\\" about their financial performance in the UK. MPs replied that it \\"just doesn't ring true\\" that the business made a loss, pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the US and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable. In Ireland, Starbucks' subsidiary Ritea only paid ‚Ç¨35,000 in tax between 2005 and 2011 and the subsidiary recorded losses in every year other than 2011. Ritea is owned by Netherlands-based Starbucks Coffee Emea. Their French and German subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the Dutch subsidiary, which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow. Reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees, the French and German subsidiaries would have paid ‚Ç¨3.4 million in tax. The Dutch subsidiary that royalties are paid to made a ‚Ç¨507,000 profit in 2011 from revenues of ‚Ç¨73 million, while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of ‚Ç¨2 million in 2011 and paid tax of ‚Ç¨870,000. Protesters, who were unimpressed by the company's offer to pay ¬£20 million in tax over the next two years, staged demonstrations in December 2012 in affiliation with UK Uncut. In June 2014, the European Commission antitrust regulator launched an investigation of the company's tax practices in the Netherlands, as part of a wider probe of multi-national companies' tax arrangements in various European countries. The investigation ended in October 2015, with the EC ordering Starbucks to pay up to ‚Ç¨30 million in overdue taxes, which the EC regards as illegal state support for corporations. A pair of economists from the KU Leuven noted that the Commission did not forbid Starbucks' tax construction as such, pretending that Starbucks is a Dutch company and effectively rewarding the Dutch state for its lenient tax policy.  Market strategy  Starbucks' footprint in the United States, showing saturation of metropolitan areas Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position, including buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. While relations with independent coffeehouse chains have been strained, some owners have credited Starbucks with educating customers on coffee.  Labor disputes  Starbucks workers in seven stores have joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as the Starbucks Workers Union since 2004. In line with a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to New York City, where the movement originated.Memo to Starbucks: Dig In, Smell the Coffee, Fight Back by Carl Horowitz On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a National Labor Relations Board settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement. The Reverend Billy leading an anti-Starbucks protest in Austin, Texas in 2007 Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the United States belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. A Starbucks strike occurred in Auckland, New Zealand, on November 23, 2005. Organized by Unite Union, workers sought secure hours, a minimum wage of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay baristas over US$100 million in back tips in a Californian class action lawsuit launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of tips violates state labor laws. The company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18-year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.Bostonist.com Chestnut Hill, MA Starbucks Employee Sues A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  Opening without planning permission  Starbucks has been accused by local authorities of opening several stores in the UK in retail premises, without the planning permission for a change of use to a restaurant. Starbucks has argued that \\"Under current planning law, there is no official classification of coffee shops. Starbucks, therefore, encounters the difficult scenario whereby local authorities interpret the guidance in different ways. In some instances, coffee shops operate under A1 permission, some as mixed use A1/A3 and some as A3\\". In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed on St. James's Street in Kemptown, Brighton, England, despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council, who said there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. Starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee, mugs, and sandwiches, gaining a six-month extension, but the council ordered Starbucks to remove all tables and chairs from the premises, to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop. 2500 residents signed a petition against the store, but after a public inquiry in June 2009, a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain. A Starbucks in Hertford won its appeal in April 2009 after being open for over a year without planning permission. Two stores in Edinburgh, one in Manchester, one in Cardiff, one in Pinner and Harrow, were also opened without planning permission. The Pinner cafe, opened in 2007, won an appeal to stay open in 2010. One in Blackheath Village, Lewisham was also under investigation in 2002 for breach of its licence, operating as a restaurant when it only had a licence for four seats and was limited to take away options. There was a considerable backlash from members of the local community who opposed any large chains opening in what is a conservation area. To this date, the Starbucks is still operating as a takeaway outlet.  Shark fin  alt= Environmental protestors in Hong Kong in June 2018 extended their campaign against Maxim's Caterers to also target Starbucks. This is due to Starbucks awarding regional licences to Maxims in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Vietnam. On June 15, 2018 protestors targeted Maxim's headquarters in a demonstration that also highlighted Maxim's being a regional licensee for Starbucks.  Overpricing  In October 2013, China Central Television accused Chinese Starbucks of over-pricing. The report compared the price of a tall (12 fl. oz., 354 mL) latte in Beijing, Chicago, London, and Mumbai. It was found that Beijing stores charged the most while Mumbai stores charged the least. It was also found that a tall latte cost 4 Chinese yuan (approx. USD $0.67) to make, but it sold at 27 yuan (approx. USD $4.50).  Underfilled lattes  In April 2016, a class-action lawsuit was pressed against Starbucks after multiple reported incidents of the company purposely underfilling their latte beverages to reduce milk costs. After two years of legal proceedings, the lawsuit was dismissed.  Fair Trade, Oxfam, and Ethiopian coffee farmers  In October 2006, the British NGO, Oxfam, accused Starbucks of financially wounding Ethiopian coffee farmers by violating Fairtrade agreements. Specifically, Oxfam stated that Starbucks was depriving Ethiopian farmers of $88 million a year by depriving the Ethiopian government of trademarking a number of its local coffee beans. Starbucks responded to the accusations by stating Oxfam's claims were misleading, and wished it would stop deceiving the public. An analysis by SFK Inc., a supply-chain risk management firm, revealed that both Starbucks and Oxfam had validity to their claims. The firm found that the demand for Starbucks coffee exceeded the supply of Fair Trade coffee available, and that Starbucks made efforts to purchase Fair Trade coffee, when available. Additionally, it was found that Starbucks paid premium prices for Ethiopian coffee at the time, prices higher than market value. The analysis further criticized not Oxfam or Starbucks, but the Fair Trade brand specifically, stating it as more of a \\"quick fix\\" to ease consumer guilt. While the firm acknowledged that the Fair Trade cause is noble, it was, however, lacking when pertaining aspects of regulation and supply-chain custody. The analysis further found that the Fair Trade brand comes with many miscellaneous fees, such as certification, inspections, and marketing, stating less of the money from the sale of Fair Trade makes its way to the farmers producing the product. SFK Inc. concluded that given the socio-political uncertainties of certain developing countries, external agreements within the government of such countries potentially opens the doors for corruption when farmer cooperatives are excluded from negotiation on their own behalf. The firm recommended that the coffee farmers produce directly for Starbucks, but non-exclusively, through a local subsidiary established by the brand. Such an agreement would allow Starbucks to fulfill its CSR goals, while ensuring Ethiopian specialty brands are recognized, and farmers are not subject to profit cuts from erroneous fees related to regulatory and bureaucratic procedures. The solution was criticized by opposition, stating such a solution would provide Starbucks a monopoly advantage on Ethiopian coffee, and did not fit the requirements for Fairtrade, specifically. While the analysis acknowledged the criticism, it also stated that farmers were still able to export any part of their crop through the traditional channels, and that while the solution did not meet the specific requirements of Fairtrade, it did align with its ultimate goal: protecting farmers. In May 2007, both Starbucks and the government of Ethiopia signed a licensing, distribution, and marketing agreement, recognizing the importance and integrity of Ethiopia's specialty coffee names. These initiatives allow farmer cooperatives to earn more from its coffee brands, and enable poor growers to capture a greater share of the retail price. Cups =\\"War on Christmas\\"= In November 2015, Starbucks introduced solid red seasonal cups, unlike previous seasonal iterations that were decorated with winter or Christmas-oriented imagery (such as reindeer and ornaments), but no overtly religious symbols. The cup design was discussed extensively on social media, with some citing it as another example of the \\"War on Christmas\\", calling it \\"cup-gate\\", and others expressed puzzlement over the outrage generated by a simple cup.Ember, Sydney (November 10, 2015) \\"Outcry Over Starbucks Holiday Cups\\" The Wall Street Journal, page B2 A man named Joshua Feuerstien then released a video suggesting that customers tell the baristas that their name was \\"Merry Christmas\\" so that baristas were forced to write it on the cups and shout \\"Merry Christmas\\" when calling off the drinks. This also started the trend #MerryChristmasStarbucks. Donald Trump, on the campaign for presidency, was one of the first to declare the \\"War on Christmas\\" in one of his tweets. This created a more politically charged meaning behind the controversy, due to Starbucks' reputation as a liberal corporation. The conservative tweets that attacked the release of the cup came during the campaign for the 2016 presidency and was seen as an attack on the liberal message of inclusion. As a response to Feuerstein's video, people began the hashtag #ItsJustACup as a counter to the view that Starbucks \\"hated Christmas.\\" =#Racetogether marketing campaign= On Monday, March 16, 2015, Starbucks launched a marketing campaign to promote conversations about race between customers and employees. This marketing campaign also called for baristas to write the hashtag #RaceTogether on customers' cups ‚Äì similar to how Starbucks is already known for writing customers' names on each cup. It was characterised as a \\"fiasco\\" by some media outlets, to the extent that Starbucks' vice president of public relations deleted his Twitter account.Corey Du medium.com On March 22, Starbucks CEO advised his employees there is no longer a need to write #racetogether on cups. Reuters reported that \\"Starbucks said the phase of the campaign that involved messages on drink cups was always scheduled to end Sunday.\\" =\\"The Way I See It\\"= Quotes by artists, writers, scientists, and others have appeared on Starbucks cups since 2005 in a campaign called \\"The Way I See It\\". Some of the quotes have caused controversy, including one by writer Armistead Maupin and another by Jonathan Wells that linked 'Darwinism' to eugenics, abortion and racism. Disclaimers were added to the cups noting that these views were not necessarily those of Starbucks. Israel A store on Piccadilly with its windows boarded up after being smashed by protesters There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it has been wrongly claimed that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the Israeli military, but such allegations are based on a hoax letter attributed to the President, Chairman, and CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz, who is JewishDamian Thompson \\"The Starbucks conspiracy theory: how a coffee chain was libelled by anti-Zionists \\", Daily Telegraph (blog), January 14, 2009 and supports Israel's right to exist.Brendan O'Neill \\"Israel, Starbucks and the new irrationalism\\", spiked.online, January 14, 2009 He is a recipient of several Israeli awards including \\"The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award\\" for \\"playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel\\". The hoax letter claiming that Schultz had donated money to the Israeli military was actually written by an Australian weblogger, Andrew Winkler, who has admitted fabricating the document.Ksenia Svetlova \\"Coffee libel in Egypt\\", The Jerusalem Post, July 30, 2010 Starbucks responded to these claims, widely circulated on the internet, stating that \\"Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund supports the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes\\". The protests against Starbucks derived from the Winkler letter were not the first; earlier protests occurred in June 2002 in Cairo, Dubai and Beirut universities in response to Schultz's criticism of Yasser Arafat. Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against Israel's role in the Gaza War over the claims. Organizations have urged a boycott of Starbucks, accusing Starbucks of serving as an ally of Israeli militarists. Starbucks was forced to close a store in Beirut, Lebanon due to demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. Demonstrators hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a Star of David over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying, Schultz \\"...is one of the pillars of the American Jewish lobby and the owner of the Starbucks,\\" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. On January 2009, two Starbucks stores in London were the target of vandalism by pro-Palestinian demonstrators who broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. by Mark Blunden, Evening Standard, January 19, 2009. Starbucks, which previously operated locations in Israel, under a partnership with Delek Group of Israel, stated that they did not close the Israeli locations due to political reasons, but due to market challenges. US military shared email A US Marines Sergeant emailed ten of his friends in August 2004 having wrongly been told that Starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the Iraq War. The email was shared online with tens of millions of people. Starbucks and the originator sent out a correction, but Starbucks' VP of global communications, Valerie O'Neil, said in September 2009 that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks.Ugly Rumours Communicate magazine, September 2009 Gun controversy As gun laws in many US states have become more relaxed, and more states have adopted open carry or concealed carry statutes, some gun owners have begun carrying guns while performing everyday shopping or other tasks. Many stores and companies have responded by banning the carrying of guns on their premises, as allowed by many states' local laws. Starbucks has not instituted an official policy banning guns in their stores. In 2010, the Brady Campaign proposed a boycott of Starbucks due to their gun policy. At that time, Starbucks released a statement saying \\"We comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve. That means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in 43 U.S. states. Where these laws don't exist, openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited. The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.\\" In 2012, the National Gun Victims Action Council published an open letter to Starbucks, asking them to revise their policy, and also proposed a \\"Brew not Bullets\\" boycott of the chain until the policy is changed, with Valentine's Day selected as a particular day to boycott the chain. In response, gun rights advocates started a counter \\"Starbucks Appreciation Day\\" buycott to support Starbucks' stance, and suggested paying for products using two-dollar bills as a sign of Second Amendment support. On July 29, 2013, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, initiated a petition demanding a ban on guns in Starbucks stores. On September 17, 2013, founder and CEO Howard Schultz asked customers to no longer bring guns into its stores. He made the comments in an open letter on the company's website. Schultz said he was not banning guns, but making a request. Public positions =Same-sex marriage= In January 2012, a Starbucks executive stated that the company supports the legalization of same-sex marriage. This resulted in a boycott by the National Organization for Marriage, a political organization that opposes same-sex marriage, who received 22,000 signatures in favor of their boycott.NOM Launches Starbucks Boycott Over Same-Sex Marriage Stance Retrieved July 19, 2012 When another shareholder (who had been quoted by NOM before) mentioned during a meeting that recent earnings had been \\"disappointing\\" since the boycott began, CEO Howard Schultz responded: \\"If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much.\\" In addition, 640,000 people also signed a petition thanking Starbucks for its support. (As of June 26, 2015, same-sex marriage in the United States is legal in all states following the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.) Muhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim group in Indonesia with 29 million members, and Perkasa, a group with 700,000 members, have called for a boycott of Starbucks over its support of gay rights. =Refugees= On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to indefinitely suspend the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States and suspended entry into the United States of nearly all citizens of seven countries until \\"extreme vetting\\" measures could be implemented. The same day, Starbucks' Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz wrote a letter to Starbucks' employees, stating in part, \\"There are more than 65 million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the United Nations, and we are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business. And we will start this effort here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.\\" As a result of Schultz's letter, supporters of President Trump's executive order supported a boycott of Starbucks, with some saying that Starbucks should give more help to American veterans. California cancer warning rule In March 2018, a California judge ruled that Starbucks and other companies must provide warning labels on all coffee products, warning consumers of chemicals that may cause cancer, a requirement by California law which Starbucks was found in violation of. The chemical in question is acrylamide, a carcinogen byproduct of roasted coffee beans found in high levels throughout brewed coffee. Declining to comment, Starbucks instead referred to a statement by the National Coffee Association claiming that cancer warnings on products would be \\"misleading\\". After the first phase of the trial, Starbucks may be subject to civil proceeding penalties of fines up to $2,500 per consumer exposed over the last eight years. Philadelphia arrests On April 12, 2018, two African-American men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, were arrested in a Starbucks store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A witness at the time of the arrests said that the men asked the staff if they could use the bathroom to which an employee said it was reserved for paying customers. The men waited at a table for another person without ordering and were instructed by the staff to either make a purchase or leave. When they did not comply, the store manager called the police, saying the men were trespassing, which led to the arrests. They were released without charges being pressed. The video of the arrest went viral and prompted the CEO of Starbucks Kevin Johnson to issue an apology. On ABC's Good Morning America, Johnson appeared for an interview and expressed his desire to meet with the men in person to apologize. He referred to the arrests as \\"reprehensible\\", and promised to take steps to prevent future incidents. Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney criticized the company and called for revisions of the company's policies. The incident led to protests at the shop where the arrests occurred and caused outrage. The company had announced that the store manager was no longer working at the store. The police commissioner, Richard Ross Jr., said the police officers did nothing wrong, having made multiple \\"polite\\" requests for the men to leave before arresting them. As tension grew, the cafe was closed for a few hours on April 16. After the event, Starbucks released a statement on plans to shut stores and corporate offices on May 29 for racial- bias education for approximately 175,000 U.S. employees. On May 2, it was reported that the two men settled for a symbolic $1 each and a promise from City officials that a program for young entrepreneurs would be established. This is separate from the Starbucks financial settlement that was announced in a joint statement between the two men, and Starbucks. In the settlement Starbucks has included the two men earn their bachelor's degrees with the tuition covered, and discuss their experience with former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder as part of the company's diversity efforts. Starbucks worked with two organizations to plan the curriculum for the anti-bias training, SYPartners and the Perception Institute. The trainings took place in Starbucks stores and were unfacilitated. Participants used iPads and guidebooks to direct them. The anti-bias training was planned to be in collaboration with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization. Tamika Mallory, a prominent activist and organizer of the 2017 Women's March, criticized the decision, accusing the ADL of \\"attacking black and brown people,\\" further remarking in a tweet that \\"The ADL sends US police to Israel to learn their military practices. This is deeply troubling. Let's not even talk abt [sic] their attacks against .@blacklivesmatter.\\" Starbucks was subsequently reported by Politico to have dropped the ADL from its anti- bias training, a decision that critics called \\"giving in to bigotry.\\" A Starbucks spokesperson disputed that the change was in response to political pressure, saying it was \\"architecting a multi-phase approach to addressing bias.\\"  See also  * History of Starbucks References Starbucks Category:Starbucks Starbucks Starbucks Starbucks Starbucks ","title":"Criticism of Starbucks"},{"id":"49314020","text":"Amanda Marsalis is an American film director and photographer.

He was mostly known for having refused to surrender his weapon as two Yugoslav police officers encountered him on the market in Prekaz. He then died later fighting several tanks and helicopters and Yugoslav special forces. He became an important figure in Kosovar-Albanian folklore as a symbol against Yugoslav rule. Life and death Meha was from a patriotic family from Prekaz in Drenica and was known amongst Albanians for owning the kulla of Mehajve in Nebihu. According to Albanian folklore, Meha was on his daily tour at the market when two Yugoslav police officers spotted his pistol in his waist and demanded him to surrender it to which Meha refused. When the police officers became threatful, Meha opened fire and fighting began. According to Yugoslav medias, Meha killed nine police officers and wounded two before he was wounded. Tahir then escaped the scene and headed back to this home. Yugoslav forces responded with tanks and helicopters and his father joined in to help. When a friend of Meha asked him to surrender his weapon, Meha said \\"I refuse to surrender to the serb\\" and stayed in his home. His father stayed in the house and the police forces began the siege at 10 pm during the day. They were surrounded by three battalions to ensure that Tahir Meha would be unable to escape. When the tanks opened fire, the wall of his house crumbled and Meha managed to throw a hand grenade in the cabin of the tank, damaging it severely. When Meha continued forward the light beams of the Yugoslav forces spotted him and opened fire. Meha was found the next morning with 8 bullets on the side and was carried away by locals.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkqvh6_tahir-meha-dokumentar_animals Cause of refusing to surrender his gun Meha's grandfather, Emin Lati, was a member of the Kacak movement of Azem Bejta during the Albanian fight for freedom against Serbia during the 1920s. After Azem Bejtas death in 1924, Emin Lati collected his revolver and hid it until 1941 where he gave it to Nebihu, his son. The gun of Azem Bejta, which now belonged to Nehibu, used it during World War 2 together with Shaban Palluzha and eventually gave it to Tahir Meha, who used to fight the Yugoslav forces. The reason Meha refused to hand over the gun was because it once belonged to Azem Bejta, and was considered to be venerated by the Albanians. Legend Meha became a rallying figure during the decade as a symbol of Albanian liberation against Yugoslav rule and was much celebrated by several important figures and political leaders. He is buried in Prekaz and what remains of his kulla has the Albanian flag attached to it as a symbol of freedom.

Biography  In 1841, 14-year- old Eug√®ne Godard enrolled at the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris. He did well in his studies and, being the son of a master mason, was intent on a career in architecture. After attending the launch of a gas balloon in 1845 however, he found his passion had a new direction and began building balloons. Although his first craft never managed to leave the ground, Godard persisted, and by the end of 1846 he had designed, built, and successfully launched several unmanned hydrogen balloons. He and his brother Louis established a workshop in Lille where the two constructed the balloon in which, on October 17, 1847, Eug√®ne made his first free ascent, initiating his career as professional aeronaut and aerostat manufacturer. In 1849, Godard went to Bordeaux and met the famous British balloonist Charles Green, who flew him aboard a balloon inflated with coal gas, which was cheaper and more easily obtained than hydrogen. Applying what he learned from Green, Godard constructed his next craft, which he named the Ville de Bordeaux. On October 6, 1850 Godard made his first long-distance flight from the hippodrome at Place de l'Etoile in Paris to Gits, Belgium aboard his balloon the Ville de Par√≠s, a craft that observers described as a ‚Äúnoble and gigantic‚Äù balloon. The Ville de Par√≠s was reportedly destroyed by fire about a month later following a mishap in Marseille where Godard and four passengers lost control of the balloon. Fortunately all five people survived.A balloon accident at Cassis An 1851 lithograph of Eug√®ne Godard An alleged photo of Mat√≠as P√©rez (center) and French pilot Eugene Goddard (right) aboard the balloon Ville de Paris. While this is undoubtably a photograph of a balloon accestion the person labeled as Goddard does not resembele him in either 1851 or 1868; indeed judging from the style of cloathing it was possibly taken in late 1880's 1890s to just after the turn of the century 1900 In 1852 Godard aided inventor Henri Giffard in construction the first steam airship. In 1853, launching from Vienna, Godard became only the second person to ever fly over the Austrian Alps. In 1854 Godard made a series of ascents at the marriage of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elizabeth of Austria. On that occasion Godard signed an agreement with the Austrian government which stated that, in case of war, he would build balloons, organize balloonists companies, and perform observation ascents for the military. Franz Joseph declared him the \\"Aeronaut of the Emperor of Austria.\\" In August 1855, he left France with his wife and his brother Auguste and went to the United States, where he remained until 1858. Godard‚Äôs many balloon ascents in North America included launches in New York City, New Orleans, St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati, San Francisco, and Cuba. After a perilous ascent aboard the balloon American during a storm in Cincinnati, Godard invented the tear panel which facilitates rapid deflation of a balloon. In 1856, Godard traveled to Cuba where he met canopy maker Matias Perez. The two shared a flight on May 21, after which Perez purchased the balloon from Godard for 1200 hard pesos. According to one report, this craft had also been named Ville de Par√≠s.Flew away like Matias Perez Perez flew the ship himself successfully on June 12 under excellent atmospheric conditions. Then on June 29, at around 7:00 PM, the Cuban attempted a second ascent, but this time in a strong wind. The balloon was quickly swept out to sea with Perez on board. The balloon and pilot were never found. On September 8, 1856, Eug√®ne Godard made the first successful Canadian passenger flight in a balloon, travelling from Montreal to Pointe-Olivier, Quebec. On board with him were A.E. Kierzowski and A.X. Rambau.Today in Aviation History ‚Äî September 8 The balloon, called Canada, was the first aircraft ever constructed in Canada.Wydera, Markus History of Ballooning Retrieved: February 5, 2016. Then on August 13, 1857, Godard made the first balloon flight in the history of Wales, launching from Caernarfon in a gas balloon called Aurora.Eug√®ne Godard & the Aurora In 1859, at the outbreak of the Franco-Austrian war, Godard returned to Europe and offered tethered observation balloon services to Emperor Napoleon III. In so doing, he instituted the art of aerial reconnaissance and broke the 1854 agreement he had made with Franz Joseph I, contributing to Austria‚Äôs defeat by the French. After the war, Godard began building hot air balloons equipped with a boiler of his invention, known as the \\"Montgodarfi√®res\\". In 1863 he was again awarded the title \\"Aeronaut of the Emperor\\", but this time by Napoleon III. He was commissioned to build a balloon to be used as a platform for aerial photography by renowned photographer Nadar. The aircraft, which was called Le G√©ant (The Giant), had an onboard darkroom, a two-story deck capable of carrying 50 men, and an envelope capacity of .Holmes 2013, p. 164 It was this balloon that inspired Jules Verne to write his adventure novel, _Five Weeks in a Balloon_. Later that year Godard built an even larger craft, L'Aigle (The Eagle), whose furnace weighed 445 kilograms (980 pounds) and had a volume that dwarfed that of Le G√©ant with . On July 20, 1864 Godard achieved the first hot-air balloon ascent from London, launching L'Aigle from Cremorne Gardens, and eventually landing in Greenwich. He launched a second time from the same spot 8 days later, this time landing in WalthamstowEug√®ne Godard's Large Fire Balloon In 1866, Godard invented a new optical telegraph system for the military. In 1867, he conducted series of scientific ascents with astronomer Camille Flammarion. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War Godard conducted captive observation flights around the city. The Provisional Government of National Defense also appointed him to construct balloons for an aerial postal service.Eug√®ne Godard (The Free Dictionary) Using work space in both the Austerlitz and East railway stations, with the help of his wife and his brother Jules, Godard built 33 balloons from October 1870 to January 1871. Then following the Siege of Paris, he moved his family to Nantes. While visiting Amiens on September 28, 1873, Godard and his son Eug√®ne II piloted Jules Verne on his first and only balloon ascent.Archives municipales de Nantes: l'a√©rostat nantais, de 1783 √† nos jours: les Godard At the 1878 Paris Expo, Godard worked with Henri Giffard offering rides to the public in his giant tethered passenger balloonScience Photo Archives - The Viewing balloon at 1878 Paris Exposition at the Tuileries Garden. The gondola accommodated up to 52 passengers, and over the course of the expo, rides were given to some 35,000 people. In 1884 Godard oversaw operation of the largest captive balloon in Nice, built at Grands Ateliers A√©rostatiques du Champ-de-Mars, the largest aircraft factory of the late 19th Century, by his nephew Louis II, Gabriel Yon, and 22-year-old apprentice Edouard Surcouf, who would go on to become a prominent aeronautical engineer.Grand Ballons Captifs & Libres de Nice On April 6, 1885 at Place Saint-Ambroise in Paris, Godard organized and directed the Ar√®nes du Sport A√©ronautique, France‚Äôs first ever aviation competition.P√≥ster Ar√®nes du sport a√©ronautique sous la direction de Eug√®ne Godard, 1885Ar√®nes du sport a√©ronautique sous la direction de Eug√®ne Godard ain√© inauguration le dimanche 15 Mars 1885 In 1888 he settled permanently in Brussels, where he died on Sept. 9, 1890.

Literally meaning Grand River, this channel is now part of Kali Krukut (Krukut river) in Tambora subdistrict. History The Kali Besar bend was once straightened out on the orders of Jacques Specx in 1631-1632. In the early days of Batavia in 17th century, ships usually sailed along a Kanaal to Kali Besar, where unloading and ship repairs were also done in dockyard in front of the long Kasteel but due to deposition of sand in the estuary and the size of the ships were getting bigger they could no longer pass the channel. The boats were then pulled by horses and slaves. For larger ships, passengers and cargoes were unloaded into small boats or barges. Aerial picture of Kali Besar in 20th century There used to be various buildings along the Kali Besar in the VOC era, such as warehouses, private settlements, churches and markets. Some of the existing markets in the Kali Besar include Vegetable Market, Banana Market, Chicken Market and Rice Market. Many of the buildings located along Kali Besar Barat street and Kali Besar Timur street are in European architecture and are built in the 19th century, including old buildings, offices and warehouses. The existence of these buildings form a historic neighborhood that becomes a tourism attraction, especially for recreational tourists who want to enjoy the atmosphere of \\"Old Town\\". Kali Besar picture taken in 1953 Kali Besar in Old Town Jakarta Kali Besar was the center of economy and trading of VOC where there were buildings for the manufacture and repair of ships as well as for the laborers or slaves to work. Kali Besar was seen as an elite residential area in the early 18th century and later transformed to become the central area of offices for international trading. One example is The Red Store building. Many houses of Chinese immigrants were once built around the area, but many later burned down during the 1740 Batavia pogrom. Kali Besar has several times changed its function, after the Ciliwung straightening in 1632, where small ships could bring goods from the sea and from the hinterland to the port. Since 1870, a growing number of commercial companies appeared in Kali Besar, and became the central area of offices of international commerce until the 1960s. The growth of Kali Besar being the center of commerce resulting in the presence of the church and the market disappeared. Its position as a trading center nearly displaced by the completion of the Tanjung Priok port in 1885 which is just from Kali Besar. Malaria outbreaks made this region was no longer conducive for new businesses. Since 1900, many employers moved out to along the Noordwijk straat and Rijswijk straat further to the south of Old Town.

In 1977, she \\"rediscovered\\" the astronomical marker site known as the Sun Dagger on Fajada Butte in Chaco Culture National Historical Park. Research has indicated this site records the solar and lunar cycles. In 1978, she founded the non-profit Solstice Project, through which she has produced a book of peer-reviewed research papers and two documentary, PBS broadcast films on Chaco Canyon. She continues to produce research and films from Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the Solstice Project is based. Life and education Sofaer was born on November 20, 1940 in Philadelphia, PA, where she grew up. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1962, where she met scholar of mythology Joseph Campbell. He became a research adviser when she founded the Solstice Project. Working previously in social planning, community organization, housing opportunity initiatives, and as an artist, she developed an interest in Maya astronomy, leading to her documentation of Southwestern pictographs and petroglyphs.Sofaer, Anna (2008), Chaco Astronomy: An Ancient American Cosmology, Ocean Tree Books, She married Michael Pertschuk in 1977. Solstice Project =Rediscovery of the Sun Dagger= Fajada Butte Sun Dagger Diagram In 1977 Sofaer visited Chaco Canyon as a volunteer recording ancient Southwestern American rock art. She chanced to record petroglyphs on Fajada Butte at what is now called the Sun Dagger or Three Slab site, now perhaps the most famous site in Chaco Canyon, located at a southeastern facing cliff near the top of Fajada Butte. The three large stone slabs leaning against the cliff channeled light and cast shadow so as to create light \\"dagger\\" markings on two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall. \\"We happened to get there near noon, a week from solstice, and a dagger of light was bisecting the spiral.\\" Her research has since indicated this site to likely have been a calendrical shrine, marking the sun's varying heights at solstices and equinoxes, and the moon's rise over its 18.6 year standstill cycle. =Research and films= Major Ruins of Chaco Canyon In 1978, Sofaer founded the 501(c) organization Solstice Project. The purposes of the organization are research, preservation, and education regarding the ancient Chaco culture of the Four Corners region. The Solstice Project's research initially focused on the Sun Dagger site, with research collaborators including physicist Rolf Sinclair (NSF), astronomer LeRoy Doggett (USNO), architect Volker Zinser, archaeologist R. Gwinn Vivian, and anthropologist and MacArthur Fellow, Alfonso Ortiz of the Tewa Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico Pueblo. The Solstice Project expanded its studies to include surveys, in collaboration with Phillip Tuwaletstiwa and other geodesists of the NGS of NOAA, of the orientations of the Chacoan Great Houses and the Great North Road. In 2008, Sofaer's peer-reviewed research papers to date were compiled and published as Chaco Astronomy: An Ancient American Cosmology, by Ocean Tree Books. Some archaeologists were initially skeptical of the role of the moon in ancient monumentsAveni, Anthony (1993), Ancient Astronomers, St. Remy Press, p 128. but Sofaer's work in general has been met with praise from such groups as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Geographic, archaeologists such as Timothy Pauketat and Stephen Lekson and the American Southwest's Native American communities.

Originally named the Shreveport Junior Astronomical Society, it was founded in 1959 by a group of high school students led by a fellow student, Sara Worley. Fifteen people attended an organizational meeting to establish a club on October 10, 1959. Officers were elected at this meeting and Sara Worley became the first president of the Shreveport Junior Astronomical Society. A second organizational meeting took place on October 17, 1959, where a constitution and additional society-related details were established. The constitution was approved, signed, and ratified at a third meeting on October 24, 1959, although there was no State of Louisiana charter. The first public meeting of the club was held on November 14, 1959 at Centenary College of Louisiana. Two goals were announced: build an observatory and procure a planetarium for the Shreveport area. Within five years, these two goals were accomplished through local participation and fundraising.Schwartzenburg, Dewey. The Founding of the Shreveport Astronomical Society. November, 1962. To raise money, the club hosted stargazing events for the general public and received donations from area businesses. The club at one time had well over 100 members on its roster and grew as a result of the popularity of the NASA Space Program in the 1960s. Stargazing events were well attended. One stargazing event held at Youree Drive Junior High School on November 13, 1960 was estimated to have over 2,000 people in attendance.Goodwin, Jennie. History of the Shreveport-Bossier Astronomical Society. 2012. In 1963, the club became known as the Shreveport Astronomical Society to better represent its adult membership and transitioning away from a junior society. In 1964, the club leased and transformed an abandoned grain silo into an observatory.Goodwin, Jennie. History of the Shreveport-Bossier Astronomical Society. 2012. Later that year, the City of Shreveport dedicated the area‚Äôs first planetarium at the city‚Äôs fairgrounds.The Shreveport Times. Jan. 15, 1964. p. 2A. In April 1971, a reorganization of the club took place by shifting focus from a club for high school students to a club for adults. Youths could become society members, but only those 16 years or older could hold office positions. On March 27, 1975 the club became the formal society it is known as today. Incorporation papers were signed on that day and a board of directors was created. The club eventually expanded its name to the Shreveport-Bossier Astronomical Society (SBAS) on April 3, 1996 alongside a dedication ceremony at a SBAS dark sky site in Bossier Parish provided by Bossier Parish Community College.Bossier Parish Community College Astronomical Observatory Dedication. April 3, 1996. The observatory was originally named the Shreveport Observatory, and it was later renamed after a founding member, Ralph A. Worley, an avid amateur astronomer, oil executive, and Sara Worley‚Äôs father. The society continues to operate out of the Ralph A. Worley Observatory located about 8 miles south of the LSU-Shreveport campus off LA Highway 1 on LA Highway 175. In 2015, the society celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Worley Observatory. Over that 50-year period, the SBAS has hosted thousands of members of the general public to view the night sky through telescopes and with the naked eye.  Membership  Membership in the SBAS is open to anyone 10 years of age or older, but only those of at least 16 years of age may vote and hold office. Members of all ages may participate in society activities. The society currently has a membership of more than 80 people. Society members contribute to the hobby of amateur astronomy via articles in astronomy publications, variable star observing, asteroid occultations, Astronomical League observing programs, and outreach events. Members also receive a subscription to the Astronomical League's publication, The Reflector.  Meetings  Meetings are held at Louisiana State University in Shreveport on the third Saturday of every month in the Science Lecture Auditorium. Each meeting begins with a discussion of society business affairs followed by refreshments and good fellowship. The official astronomy program follows the business meeting. The December meeting is usually devoted to a club-only Christmas party.  Events  Stargazing events open to the public are held six times a year: three in the spring and three in the fall, as well as daytime solar observing events throughout the year. The SBAS also coordinates with the Sci-Port Planetarium, American Rose Center, Broadmoor Branch Library, and LSU-Shreveport.  Publications  The society distributes a monthly newsletter named The Observer which features articles, member astrophotography, and announcements.  Officers & Committees  President, Vice President, Secretary/Treasurer, SBAS Board, Worley Committee, Public Relations Committee, Star Party Committee, SBAS/Public School Liaison, Observation Chairman.

She was given the nickname \\"Lottie the Body\\" when she was a teenager working in modeling. She also became known as the \\"Black Gypsy Rose Lee\\" and the \\"Gypsy Rose Lee of Detroit.\\" Born and raised in New York, her career in burlesque began in San Francisco, and later she moved to Detroit. Lottie was renowned for her support of other exotic dancers, musicians, and entertainers. During her lengthy career, she worked throughout the U.S. and in numerous other countries, performing with many of the great singers, comedians, musicians, and dancers of her era. Overview Lottie Tatum Graves Claiborne (n√©e Bristow) was born in Syracuse, New York, on October 31, 1930. She grew up enjoying participating in sports like baseball and basketball, and loved studying ballet as a girl. By age seventeen, she quit school to become a professional dancer. Her first professional job was performing with Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, Herbert White's popular dance troupe in the 1940s that traveled to venues around the country. Famous for the \\"Lindy Hop,\\" the routines were a combination of jazz, tap, swing, and more. She was also working as a model. At that time in her life, she did not foresee a career as an exotic dancer. But, once the Lindy Hop craze died, she quickly learned that other types of professional jobs in the field of dance were few and far between for an African American woman. It was then that she honed her skills as a burlesque performer. Thus began a long career that took Lottie around the world and introduced her to a life that she'd never imagined as a youngster. In the late 1940s, Lottie married an Air Force lieutenant and moved with him when he was stationed in the San Francisco Bay Area. She created her burlesque act there during the height of the popularity of jazz clubs. She and her husband divorced; and, she met Harlem Globetrotter Goose Tatum at the Champagne Supper Club. They married. After her marriage to Tatum ended, Lottie moved to Detroit, by 1960. There she lived for many years with Robert Graves. When he died, she met and married Willie Claiborne, and they enjoyed a long marriage until her death. Career When Lottie lived and performed in San Francisco in the late 1940s and early 1950s, she also traveled the country to work. She became a popular performer in Arthur Bragg's Idlewild Review at the Paradise Club in Idlewild, a resort town dubbed the \\"Black Eden of Michigan.\\" There she was known as the \\"Black Gypsy Rose Lee.\\" She eventually made Detroit, Michigan, her home base. Throughout her career, her strip show used Afro-Cuban music and choreography, and she wore elaborate costumes. Her routine included removing clothing, but no nudity. At times she removed no clothing at all, but enchanted her audiences with her performances in either case. Her technique made her enormously popular, and she was in high demand in venues around the country and in other countries. A racketeer in Indianapolis even built a nightclub for her, called the Pink Poodle. Lottie worked alongside many performers - comedians, singers, musicians, and dancers - who were popular in that era, including Redd Foxx; T-Bone Walker; Della Reese; Billie Holiday; Sammy Davis, Jr.; Aretha Franklin; Miles Davis; Sam Cooke; Bessie Smith; B.B. King; Louie Armstrong; Martha Reeves; the Four Tops; the Rhythm Kings; Sarah Vaughn; Cab Calloway; Dinah Washington; Fats Waller; Totie Fields; a number of Motown groups; and others. Supporting and mentoring other performers, especially dancers, was important to Lottie. Christine Jorgensen, a nightclub entertainer who was the first well-known transsexual in the US, became one of her best friends. Lottie felt strongly about supporting others regardless of sexual orientation. She also met many famous people who were not in the entertainment business, like politicians and government leaders. While traveling with the Harlem Globetrotters to Cuba before Communism in that country, they met Fidel Castro. She found him to be \\"a sweet little man,\\" having no idea he would become a Communist revolutionary. Early in her career, when she was married to Tatum, she often served as an unpaid MC for the Globetrotters. By the time she was in her fifties, she danced less and worked as an MC more, at Detroit night clubs. Her effervescent personality made her popular with club audiences. She retired at age 61. When she needed a walker late in her life, she laughed and said it was because she'd done the splits one too many times.Personal conversation with Linda Hughes 2019 Civil Rights Movement Lottie believed that she lived her \\"own sort of Civil Rights Movement\\", making friends and connections in her own way everywhere she went. However, at times she was treated like a second-class citizen because she was black. Those times were surprisingly rare, she said, especially considering that African Americans were not always welcome while the U.S.A. was mired in an era of inequality and bias. The Civil Rights Movement, with African Americans campaigning for equality, lasted throughout the 1950s and 1960s. During that time of protest and struggle, Lottie felt that she was treated respectfully most of the time, by black and white people, men and women. She recalled with fondness being the first black woman to dance on television in Alaska, where she was treated like \\"a queen.\\" The wives of political leaders in other countries would take her shopping, and she was invited to be a guest in the Dodge family (the car people) summer home in Michigan. Although she experienced some of the bigotry many African American's experienced, like occasionally not being allowed in the front door of a club and having deplorable sleeping quarters, for the most part she felt that her career afforded her some privileges that not all black people experienced. Fame had its advantages. She had worked long and hard to build that career, and conducted herself in a way that demonstrated that she knew she deserved to be respected for her efforts. She expected nothing less, but did not let it stop her when she did not get it. Personal life Lottie was married and divorced twice, to the lieutenant and to Goose Tatum; then had a long-term relationship with businessman Robert Graves until his death; and then married a third time to Willie Claiborne, which lasted until her death. She divorced Tatum when he fathered a child by another woman, during the time that they were together. She said she lost not only a husband but a \\"good friend.\\" Then she lived with Detroit businessman Graves for many years, although they never officially married. They separated briefly, something she said saddened her but she understood seeing that she traveled so much for work. But they came back together when she retired at age sixty-one. She forgave him for leaving because, she said, she loved him. Unfortunately, he died in her arms on the day of his return. He had suffered a heart attack. She then met and married Claiborne, and they were together until her death in 2020. Lottie and Willie considered each other to be \\"soulmates\\" and shared a loving twenty-five-year relationship. Although never having children of her own, Lottie held close relationships with many of the younger people she supported and mentored. A lifelong sports fan, she cheered for any and all Detroit teams. She also championed preserving the history of her beloved Detroit and supported the Detroit Sound Conservancy. Lottie was a devout Roman Catholic. She belonged to Our Lady Queen of Heaven - Good Shepard Catholic Community in Detroit, regularly attending mass throughout her life.

The book Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Jazz Era, updated in 2020, by Elizabeth Pepin Silva and Lewis Watts, includes an interview with Lottie. Words of wisdom In her chapter for What We Talk about When We're Over 60, Lottie chronicled highlights of her personal and professional experiences, including overcoming racial barriers in order to pursue her passion for dancing. Her goal was always \\"sharing whatever gifts I have to make people happy.\\" She wrote, \\"If I were to give advice to a young woman today, it would be to live your dreams, just like I did. If I could make it in a time when there was everything going against me - a teenaged African-American female in a highly competitive profession during racist times - you can do whatever it is you desire to do, too. Just remember me, Lottie the Body. If I could do it, you can, too.\\" Death Burlesque star Lottie Graves-Claiborne, better known as \\"Lottie the Body,\\" died in Detroit on February 28, 2020, at the age of 89. Not long before her death, she reminisced about having lived a full life with no regrets. \\"To all you women... I pray that you may have the same kind of love and happiness that I enjoy. I send my love and God's blessings to you all.\\" References External links *The National: A Facade of Silence Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:American Burlesque performers Category:American dancers Category:American erotic dancers Category:American female dancers Category:American female erotic dancers Category:American vedettes Category:Artists from South Carolina Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Lottie 'The Body' Graves Claiborne"},{"id":"49314877","text":"Shaun Wane, England's current head coach There have been thirteen head coaches of the English national rugby league team since 1974. In the early years Great Britain played in major tournaments until the 1990s as the England team played sporadically in other competitions. The role is a part-time job so coaches can coach a domestic club team as well as the national team. History =Early years= Great Britain traditionally represented England and the home nations in major international tournaments. Occasionally England would participate in competitions such as the European Championships and made their World Cup debut in 1975. England coaches were sporadic and usually only coach a few games as they were on no long term contract. =More regular competition= In 1995, Phil Larder was brought in to replace Ellery Hanley before the 1995 World Cup in England, the first time England would play in their own World Cup. They reached the final for the second time in their history in their second World Cup but were defeated by Australia. They went on to win the European Championships the next year. Larders contract expired at the end of 1996 and the Rugby Football League (RFL) were looking for a new coach to take control in time for the 2000 World Cup which was again on home soil. They appointed Sheffield Eagles coach John Kear in 1999 after his Eagles side cause a huge Challenge Cup upset in 1998 after they defeated Wigan Warriors. He was given the task of leading England to a third consecutive World Cup final after the success of their 1995 campaign. However the 2000 World Cup was a huge failure with England being knocked out by Australia in the semi finals by a wide margin and the entire competition being very one sided. Plans for a 2004 World Cup were then scrapped however Kear stayed on the guide England to another European Championship in 2003 before leaving in 2004. Kear was replaced by Karl Harrison who won the 2004 European Championships which was the only international competition to be played until 2006 when he was replaced by Paul Cullen who won the first, and last Federation Shield comfortably in 2006. =First foreign coach = The RLIF announced plans for a World Cup to take place in Australia in 2008 and the RFL appointed their first foreign coach in 2007 by appointing then Leeds Rhinos coach Tony Smith. Smith took England to Australia and guided them to the semi final where they were defeated by Australia again. The campaign was seen as a huge failure with reports from claiming there being a rift in the camp between Leeds Rhinos and St. Helens players who mostly made up the team. The next year in 2009 a new competition was launched, the Four Nations which was held in England and France. England reached the final and but were unable to beat the Australians once again. Smiths contract was not renewed in 2010 as the RFL wanted the new national team coach to be full-time. Many coaches did not want to leave their clubs to coach England full-time who only played once a year in a post season tournament. In 2010 Bradford Bulls coach Steve McNamara was appointed. His first tournament was the 2010 Four Nations in Australia and New Zealand where they failed to reach the final. The Four Nations returned to England in 2011 where they reached the final again with the chance to beat the Australians. They lost once again only managing to score one try. McNamara coach England in the mid season international against the Exiles, the best overseas Super League players in 2011 and 2012. In 2013 it was the first time a World Cup had been held in England since 2000. They reached the semi finals where they lost to New Zealand in the dying seconds of the game having led for most of the match. The national team returned to Australia for the 2014 Four Nations where they failed to reach the final down under for the second time. In 2015 England replaced Great Britain to play New Zealand in the Baskerville Shield. They won the series 2-1, the first series win since Great Britain beat Australia in 2007 and McNamara's first piece of silverware of his managerial career. His contract was allowed to expire in 2016, he left as England's longest serving coach. Brisbane Broncos head coach Wayne Bennett was appointed in 2016 to success McNamara.

Friedrich Julius was the son of the lawyer Heinrich Wilhelm Hassel and his wife, Marianne Friederike (born Marianne Friederike von Rappard). Heinrich Wilhelm Hassel was a senior legal official (Geheimer Justizrat) at the Hamm District Court. Military career Hassel attended the Secondary school in Hamm (\\"Gymnasium Hammonense\\"), passing his school final exams in 1853. In October of that same year he joined the Second Battalion of the \\"Prince Frederick of the Netherlands\\" (2nd Westphalian) Infantry regiment of the Prussian army as a musketeer. The battalion was based at this time at Wesel, a garrison town near the western edge of Prussia's Rhine Province. In 1855 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. A few years later, reflecting a favourable performance evaluation, he was given command of the Prussian Military Academy between 1858 and 1861. Further commands took him successively to Halberstadt and Erfurt following which he was promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant and transferred to the Fusilier Battalion of the 15th Infantry Regiment in Bielefeld in the middle of January 1863. The regiment took part in the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864, during which Hassel distinguished himself on 17 April 1864: together with a Captain von Hoffm√ºller he managed to get his unit across the Alssund, render Danish canon on the Island of Als inoperable, and return with equipment and munitions undamaged. The next day he was decorated for this exploit with the Order of the Red Eagle (with military swords). The heroic deed was later recalled by the inclusion of the image of a boat when the family received a coat of arms in 1887. In the Austro-Prussian War Hassel took part, as a member of the Elbe Army in the Battles of H√ºhnerwasser and the M√ºnchengr√§tz. On 28 July 1866 he became a Captain and was decorated with the Order of the Crown. In March 1870, now a Company commander, Hasel was transferred again, this time to the 35th Brandenburg Fusilier regiment. With the mobilisation that year against France, he joined the General Staff of the 16th Division. In this position he participated in the Battles of Spicheren, Mars-la-Tour, Gravelotte, Amiens, Hallue and St. Quentin. He also took part in the successful Siege of Metz. Hassel was promoted again on 22 December 1870, now becoming a Major, and awarded the Iron Cross. After the war was formally concluded by the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871), he was transferred to the General Staff of the 8th Army Corps. In February 1877, now an Oberstleutnant, he was sent to K√∂nigsberg as a representative of the Chief of the General Staff of the 1st Army Corps. However, serious illness forced his removal from the General Staff in October 1878. On his recovery he was given an √† la suite General Staff appointment and given a teaching post at the Military Academy. In 1881 Hassel was made Chief of Department 1 of the Army General Staff and promoted to the rank of colonel. His department focused on strategic intelligence regarding the Russian army. He returned to field service on 23 September 1883 as commander of the Magdeburg 36th \\"Count Blumenthal\\" Regiment, and was then on 25 April 1885 ordered to represent the Chief of the General Staff of the 4th Army Corps. On 24 June 1885, now with the rank and remuneration of a Brigade Commander, Friedrich Hassel was appointed Chief of this General Staff, and on 4 December 1885 he became a Major general. On 22 March 1887 Friedrich Hassel was ennobled by the emperor, in recognition of his long service. One result was that his family name changed from \\"Hassel\\" to \\"von Hassel\\". Between 16 May 1888 and 21 March 1889 he commanded the 15th Infantry Brigade, based in Erfurt. After that, promoted again, now to the rank of Lieutenant General, he was given command of the 6th Division, based in Brandenburg an der Havel. However, he was pensioned out of the army, with the usual ceremony, on 12 August 1890 due to illness. Two months later he died at a sanatorium in the Harz mountain region. Personal Friedrich Hassel married Elise Helene Christiane Thormann (1846‚Äì1896) on 11 November 1866 at Rendsburg. The marriage produced three recorded children as follows: * Theodor Emil Ferdinand von Hassel (27 July 1867 - 10 March 1915), a career soldier who was killed in action in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle * (29 September 1868 - 29 November 1935), a career soldier and the father of Kai-Uwe von Hassel (1913-1997) * Magdalene von Hassel (5 June 1872 - 30 October 1942) who married References Category:Lieutenant generals of Prussia Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Eagle, 2nd class Category:People from Hamm Category:1833 births Category:1890 deaths ","title":"Friedrich von Hassel"},{"id":"49314920","text":"Franco Purini, born as Francesco Purini (Isola del Liri, 9 November 1941), is an Italian architect, essayist, and university professor.

A small portion of exhaust from the combustion chamber is tapped off to power the turbine(s). The combustion tap-off cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine. The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted. Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine. The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner. The J-2S rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969. By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle. According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process. However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. In contrast, the upper- stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.BE-3 test update, Blue Origin, 10 August 2018, accessed 15 August 2018].

DCS is headquartered in the James H \\"Sloppy\\" Floyd Veterans Memorial Building with additional field offices throughout the state. DCS is tasked with: the supervision and reentry services of felony probationers and parolees; the oversight of adult misdemeanor probation providers; and, provides administrative support to the Georgia Commission on Family Violence (GCFV).  History  In 2013, Governor Nathan Deal and the Georgia General Assembly passed legislation creating The Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. The council's charge was to conduct periodic comprehensive reviews of criminal laws, criminal procedure, sentencing laws, adult correctional issues, juvenile justice issues, enhancement of probation and parole supervision, better management of the prison population and of the population in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, and other issues relates to criminal proceedings and accountability courts. After a comprehensive study of the current issues facing Georgia's community corrections system, the Council and Governor Deal determined that enhancements to public safety and governmental efficiency could be achieved by creating one state agency that is responsible for all offender supervision within Georgia's communities. As the next step in Governor Deal's ongoing criminal justice reform efforts, HB 310 was introduced during the 2015 legislative session. Addressing the recommendations made by the GCCJR, HB 310 transferred the responsibilities of the community supervision of parolees from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, probationers from the Department of Corrections, and certain Class A and B juveniles from the Department of Juvenile Justice to the Department of Community Supervision. The bill also transferred the oversight responsibilities of private and governmental misdemeanor probation entities from the County and Municipal Probation Advisory Council (CMPAC) to the newly created Board of Community Supervision. The Georgia General Assembly passed HB 310 and on May 7, 2015, Governor Deal signed HB 310 into law, thereby creating the Department of Community Supervision.  Offender Supervision  The creation of DCS has enabled the consolidation of the once separate and independent supervision components of parole and probation. This consolidation allows case assignments to be made based upon the geographic location of an offender's residence as opposed to the offender's status within the criminal justice system. DCS field offices are aligned with the established ten judicial districts which comprise the current forty-nine judicial circuits.  Adult Misdemeanor Probation  Prior to the creation of DCS, the County and Municipal Probation Advisory Council (CMPAC) was tasked by the General Assembly with regulating misdemeanor probation being managed by private companies. In 2006, the council's role expanded to regulate all misdemeanor providers, including governmental misdemeanor probation providers. This oversight stems from related changes in law, O.C.G.A. ¬ß¬ß 42-8-100 through 108, assigning municipal and county governments the responsibility for managing misdemeanor probation operations in lieu of the Georgia Department of Corrections. Effective July 1, 2015, the roles and responsibilities previously performed by CMPAC were transferred to the Board of Community Supervision.  Day Reporting Centers  DCS offers Day Reporting Centers (DRCs) in many judicial circuits throughout Georgia. DRCs are community-based programs that are highly structured, non-residential alternatives targeting high risk/ high need offenders. Intensive programming targets substance abuse, mental health, and/ or cognitive/ behavioral issues through counseling/educational programming and close supervision. DRC's operate in three phases: Detox/Behavior Stabilization, Sobriety/Employment and Aftercare.  Board  The Board of Community Supervision as outlined in HB 310 consists of the: Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, Commissioner of the Department of Juvenile Justice, Chairman of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles, Vice Chairman of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles, Commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, Director of the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS), one County Commissioner, one representative from Private Probation Entity, one representative from a Governmental Entity, one City Manager, and one Sheriff appointed by the Governor. The Board of Community Supervision is the sole entity responsible for promulgating rules and regulations regarding: * Contracts or agreements for probation services * Conduct of business by private service providers and governments establishing probation systems * Registration of private and governmental service providers * Uniform professional and contract standards in rendering misdemeanor probation supervision * Counseling and collection services to the courts * Inspection and investigation of private and governmental service providers * Enforcement of registration requirements DCS Board members are: * Tyrone Oliver, Commissioner of the Department of Juvenile Justice * Terry Barnard, Chairman of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles * Brian Owens, Vice Chairman of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles * Judy Fitzgerald, Commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities *Timothy C.

Considered a destructive threat to alfalfa production in North America, several accidental introductions have been successfully countered though the use of a variety of biological control species. Description The alfalfa weevil grows to a length of about . The rostrum or beak is short and broad. The frons is half as wide as the rostrum while the pronotum is broadest in the centre. The general colour of the insect is brown, with a dark mid-dorsal stripe. The larva has a distinctive black head and no legs; it is yellowish-green, with a white dorsal stripe and faint white lateral stripes. It is about long just before pupation. It pupates in a white, pea-sized cocoon made of loosely-woven silk. It resembles the clover leaf weevil (Hypera punctata), but that species is nearly twice as large, the larvae have tan heads and they seldom cause much damage to alfalfa crops. Life cycle Larva In Illinois, some eggs are laid in the late fall or the winter, when weather conditions permit. Adults also overwinter and become increasingly active in March and April. Eggs are laid in batches of up to 25 inside alfalfa stems. The larvae feed for three or four weeks, moulting three times, before pupating in the cocoons they make. They emerge as adults in about one or two weeks. After feeding for a week or two, they may experience aestivation during the remainder of the summer, in which they demonstrate a dampening of their metabolic, respiratory and nervous system activities. In fall, the adults hide in the crowns of alfalfa plants or move onto coarse vegetation in ditches or by fences or in nearby woodland. Damage Both the larvae and the adults are diurnal and feed on the foliage of alfalfa, the larvae doing the most damage. The adults eat the edges of the leaves, giving them a feathery appearance. At first, the larvae feed on terminal leaves leaving puncture marks, but they later move down the plant to feed on lower leaves. The leaves attacked are skeletonised as the larvae feed between the veins, and plant yields can be reduced by up to 15%. Sometimes the larvae are killed by the pathogenic fungus Zoophthora phytonomi, especially in warm and humid weather. They may also be parasitized by ichneumon wasps, Bathylplectes anurus and B. curculionis. The female of these wasps is only about long, and lays an egg inside an early stage of the larva of the weevil. The developing wasp larva is a parasitoid, living inside the weevil larva and devouring it, eventually pupating soon after its host. The wasp's brownish cocoon has a broad white band in the case of B. curculionis, and a narrower, raised one in the case of B. anurus. When it is disturbed, the cocoon of the latter species can \\"jump\\" several centimetres to avoid predation. Both these species of wasp have been investigated for their potential for biological control of the weevil, and B. anurus is generally considered superior to B. curculionis because of its higher reproductive rate.

Day, the second son of Col. Noble and Elizabeth (Jones) Day, and nephew of Yale President Jeremiah Day, was born in the village of New Preston, in Washington, Connecticut, August 4, 1808. He graduated from Yale College in 1828. After having taught for nearly two years in Burlington, N. J., and having begun the study of law in Philadelphia, he was appointed tutor in Yale in 1831. He continued in that office for three years, taking at the same time the full course in the Yale Divinity School. After fifteen months' travel in Europe he was ordained pastor of the First Congregational church in Waterbury, Conn., on November 9, 1836. He resigned this charge, October 1, 1840, to accept the chair of Sacred Rhetoric in Western Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio. He remained in connection with that institution until 1858, the title of his professorship for the last fourteen years being Practical Theology. During his residence in Hudson he took a leading part in the endeavor to obtain a railroad connection with Pittsburgh and Cleveland. In 1858 his interest in the higher education of women induced him to accept the presidency of the Ohio Female College, at College Hill, in the suburbs of Cincinnati. After a successful administration of six years, he resigned and removed to New Haven as the most attractive place for the literary work to which he proposed to devote himself. He had already published several volumes, beginning with The Art of Elocution, in 1844. His Art of Rhetoric, a much approved text-book, first appeared in 1850. During the quarter of a century after his return to New Haven his pen was continually busy, and his separate publications in book form (ending with a volume on The Science of Education in 1889) number about twenty. The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by Iowa State University in 1877. He died in New Haven, from an attack of influenza, resulting in pleurisy, on January 12, 1890, in the 82nd year of his age. He married, April 27, 1836, Jane Louisa, daughter of Simeon Marble, of New Haven, who survived him with one son and two daughters.

He was a member of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly for the United Front, and a Communist activist. In 2005, he was posthumously awarded the Ekushey Padak, one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, for his contributions to literature, which include 24 published books in Bengali and English. Early life and background Ashab Uddin was born in April 1914, in Sadhanpur, a village in what is now Banshkhali Upazila of the Chittagong District of Bangladesh, which was then part of the British Indian province of Bengal. He belonged to a middle-class Muslim family. His father was a tea plantation manager named Munshi Safar Ali Chowdhury. Safar Ali had five children from his first marriage and six from his second marriage with Ashab Uddin's mother, Nasima Khatun. Among Safar Ali's sons, Ashab Uddin was the second-youngest. According to Ashab Uddin, his ancestors were from the Gaur region, and one of his ancestors had moved to Sadhanpur while serving the Mughal Empire, possibly under Shah Shuja. Education Ashab Uddin's education began in a maktab, after which he attended a \\"minor school\\", followed by the Sadhanpur English Middle School and the Banigram High School, from which he graduated in 1932. While studying at the Banigram High School, Ashab Uddin organised a library in Sadhanpur, which he named the Sadhanpur Rural Welfare Library. This was the first library in Sadhanpur, and one of the few in the area. One of his aims was to open a library in a Muslim-majority rural area, as all the rural libraries he knew of were located in Hindu neighbourhoods. Together with his friends, he raised money for the library by working as a waiter at weddings. Using this money, he purchased books for the library and subscribed the library to several periodicals. Ashab Uddin and his friends also staged an anti-moneylender play that they had read in one of these periodicals. In 1934, Ashab Uddin Ahmad obtained an IA degree from Chittagong College, securing a scholarship of Rs. 20 per month. In 1936, he graduated from Chittagong College with a BA. He obtained an MA in English from the University of Dhaka in 1939. Teaching and activism Ashab Uddin Ahmad began teaching English in September 1939 at his alma mater, Chittagong College, buying his first suit and tie prior to starting work there, as wearing these was compulsory for professors at state colleges under the British Raj. He was forced to leave this position in April 1941 as a result of a conflict with the principal, Padmini Bhusan Rudra. In July 1941, he was hired by the Chittagong Islamia Intermediate College (now known as Government Hazi Mohammad Mohshin College), where he remained until 1945. One of his students there was Abdul Karim, who would later become the vice-chancellor of the University of Chittagong. Abdul Karim reminisced later that Ashab Uddin Ahmad's lectures on prose and poetry were so engaging that listening to them was sufficient preparation for an examination. He also noted that Ashab Uddin had helped him as well as other students with advice, money and books as needed. In 1945, Ashab Uddin Ahmad joined Laksam Faizunnesa College, moving to Feni College in 1948, and Comilla Victoria College in 1950. =Language Movement= Although Ashab Uddin had supported the Pakistan Movement ever since the Lahore Resolution of 1940, he became disillusioned with Pakistan within a few months of the creation of the state. In his view, the Pakistani elite misused Islam as a way to promote its class interests at the expense of the country's \\"Sindhi, Baluch, Pathan and Bengali\\" peoples. On 27 December 1948, the Pakistani minister of education, Fazlur Rahman, declared that the Arabic script should be used to write all the languages of Pakistan. In practice, this suggestion, if implemented, would only have affected Bengali, as all the languages of West Pakistan already used the Arabic script. Ashab Uddin wrote to the Pakistan Observer in 1950 to protest against Fazlur Rahman's suggestion. Around the same time, Ashab Uddin, together with a fellow professor at Comilla Victoria College named Abul Khair, founded a cultural organisation named the Pragati Majlis (Progress Assembly). The organisation was headquartered in Comilla, in rented premises across the street from the town hall. The Pragati Majlis organised discussions on the future of Bengali culture and the Bengali nation in general, and drew an audience largely consisting of professors and students from the Comilla Victoria College. The activities of the organisation were viewed with suspicion both by the Muslim League and by the state. Nevertheless, it was shielded from persecution by the influential non-Bengali principal of Comilla Victoria College, Akhtar Hameed Khan, who was on friendly terms with Ashab Uddin. In 1952, following the killing of several people at a protest march in Dhaka demanding that Bengali be made an official language of Pakistan, a demonstration was held in Comilla to echo the demands made in Dhaka and express solidarity with the victims. Ashab Uddin and Abul Khair led a number of Comilla Victoria College to join the procession, which stretched out for a mile. The main slogan voiced by the protesters was, \\"We want Bengali to be a state language. We want Nurul Amin's neck.\\" Prior to the Comilla protest, Ashab Uddin had talked to local Muhajir leaders in order to persuade them not to oppose the Bengali Language Movement. As a result, after the demonstration, one Muhajir leader gave a speech in Urdu at the Comilla town hall in support of granting Bengali the status of a state language. =Meeting with Ayub Khan= In October 1952, Ashab Uddin Ahmad joined a \\"Teachers' Goodwill Mission\\" to West Pakistan, organised by the East Bengal Non-Governmental College Teachers' Association. Among the places they visited was Saidu Sharif, the capital of the princely state of Swat. The members of the Teachers' Goodwill Mission were received on the day after their arrival in Swat by the ruler of the state, Abdul-Haqq Jahan Zeb. The dinner thrown in the teachers' honour by Jahan Zeb was also attended by Ayub Khan, then the Chief of Army Staff (whose daughter was married to Jahan Zeb's son), as well as several other federal government officials. During the meal, Ayub Khan happened to sit across the table from Ashab Uddin Ahmad. After dinner, Ayub engaged Ashab Uddin in conversation and told him that East Bengal was nothing but \\"water\\", \\"population\\" and \\"student trouble\\". He also suggested that if the Bengalis did not like Pakistan, they could \\"go to the Baboos\\", i.e. Indians. For his part, Ashab Uddin reminded Ayub that, in the provincial elections of 1946, the Muslim League had attained its best results in Bengal. Given that the creation of Pakistan was the main electoral issue, it was in fact Bengali Muslims who had made Pakistan possible, in Ashab Uddin's view. Although Ayub Khan seemed to accept the above argument made by Ashab Uddin Ahmad, the latter was left sorely disappointed, and afterwards cited this as an example of the \\"ill will\\" the Teachers' Goodwill Mission had met with in West Pakistan. Ashab Uddin found it particularly surprising that Ayub Khan viewed the Bengali Language Movement as a separatist struggle at a time when the participants of this movement did not harbour separatist views. In Ashab Uddin's view, this prejudice against Bengalis on the part of Ayub and the rest of the Pakistani elite ultimately resulted in Ayub's words being prophetic, and Bangladesh becoming independent in 1971 with the help of the \\"Baboos\\" mentioned by Ayub. =Literature Conference= In 1953, Ashab Uddin Ahmad and Abul Khair organised the first All-East-Bengal Literature Conference at the Comilla town hall, under the auspices of the Pragati Majlis. A number of noteworthy East Bengali writers and journalists attended this conference, including Abdul Karim Sahitya Bisharad. In December 1953, Ashab Uddin Ahmad quit his job at Comilla Victoria College to go into politics. Political life By 1953, Ashab Uddin Ahmad was a member of the Awami League, led by Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, and put forward his candidacy for the Banshkhali seat in the East Bengal Legislative Assembly elections of 1954 on a United Front ticket, the United Front being an alliance of parties of which the Awami League was the most important part. =Dhar controversy= The election campaign began soon after the publication of Ashab Uddin's book Dhar (Loan). Some of his readers misinterpreted certain passages in that book as attacks against Islam. What caused particular consternation was his contention that it was useless to listen to a Friday prayer sermon if one could not understand its meaning. A rival candidate, Amirul Haq Khan Bahadur, bought up all the copies of Dhar that he could buy in the bookshops of Chittagong and had his canvassers carry copies with them on the campaign trail, damaging Ashab Uddin's chances of getting elected. Shortly before the election, a famous Islamic scholar, not named by Ashab Uddin in his recollections, visited Banshkhali. When some locals approached the scholar with objections to certain passages in Ashab Uddin's book, the scholar replied that he was not sufficiently well-versed in Bengali or English to judge the author's argument. Nevertheless, he promised to conduct an istikharah prayer to determine the author's level of faith. Ashab Uddin passed a sleepless night at home, feeling that he was being subjected to the whims of the Delphic oracle. To his immense relief, however, the scholar declared after the dawn prayer the following day that Ashab Uddin was a faithful and trustworthy man. Eventually, he was elected to the East Bengal Legislative Assembly with a majority of the votes in his constituency. =Petition incident= As a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Ashab Uddin Ahmad was a member of the Awami League Central Committee. At the same time, he secretly cooperated with the Communist Party of East Pakistan, and would meet with its leaders, such as Moni Singh, in Dhaka. As a result of his left-wing sympathies, Ashab Uddin was arrested in 1954, and imprisoned in Chittagong. His cellmate was Prof. Ekhlasur Rahman, who was working as a chemist at the Karnaphuli Paper Mills in Chandraghona. Rahman, along with several other people, had been charged with organising a riot between Bengali Muslim and non-Bengali Muslim workers at the factory. In Ashab Uddin's view, Rahman was innocent, and the riot had been organised by the Pakistani federal government, with the help of the director of the paper mill. When Ashab Uddin was released from prison, Rahman asked him to intervene with the government on behalf of the accused. Ashab Uddin then had a petition drawn up by a lawyer, and got it signed by 47 MLAs. The petition was addressed to the federal law minister, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. Once the petition was ready, Suhrawardy informed the Awami League executive Abdus Samad Azad that Ashab Uddin could bring the petition to him. Thus, Ashab Uddin Ahmad and Azad duly visited Suhrawardy to deliver the petition. When they arrived, however, Suhrawardy pretended not to recognise them, astonishing Ashab Uddin. He took the petition from Ashab Uddin's hands and returned it to him, telling him in English that the \\"Law cannot be altered\\". In Ashab Uddin's view, Suhrawardy misunderstood the intent of the petition, as what the petition was asking for was not a change in the law, but rather that the law be applied correctly. Eventually, Ekhlasur Rahman was tried by the High Court of East Pakistan and acquitted. Ashab Uddin's view of Suhrawardy, however, never recovered from this incident. =Autonomy resolution and opposition to Suhrawardy= On 27 March 1955, Governor-General Sir Ghulam Muhammad changed the name of East Bengal to East Pakistan. Consequently, the erstwhile East Bengal Legislative Assembly came to be known as the East Pakistan Assembly. Meanwhile, the United Front collapsed due to its inability to implement the platform under which it was elected, known as the 21-point plan. On 4 September 1956, the Awami League formed a provincial government headed by Ataur Rahman Khan, in coalition with five smaller parties. Eight days later, on 12 September, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy of the Awami League became the prime minister of Pakistan, at the head of a coalition government. Thus, for the first time ever, the Awami League held the positions of prime minister of Pakistan and chief minister of East Pakistan simultaneously. Nevertheless, the 21-point programme remained largely unimplemented. Abdul Hamid Bhashani, the president of the Awami League, convened the a five-day Kagmari Conference which was funded by Yar Mohammad Khan the treasurer of the Awami League also the founder and publisher of The Daily Ittefaq and Mirza Mehdy Ispahani in February 1957 to promote autonomy for East Pakistan and a neutral foreign policy for Pakistan. Bhashani was unhappy with the military alliance between Pakistan and the US and wanted Pakistan to withdraw from all military treaty relationships it had with the US. At the conference, during a meeting of the Awami League Central Committee, Suhrawardy said to Ashab Uddin in English, \\"you do not want that I should remain Prime Minister of Pakistan\\". He added that Bhashani did not want him to keep the position either. In response, Ashab Uddin said to him in Bengali, \\"people voted for me not in order for me to pawn Pakistan to American imperialism.\\" The following day, the Awami League Council met and voted by a wide margin to cancel the Pakistani military alliance with the US. Bhashani, meanwhile, gave a speech in which he said if East Pakistan did not get autonomy, it would be forced to bid goodbye to West Pakistan. Finally, as a result of this pressure from left-leaning members of the Awami League, the provincial government allowed a private members' bill in support of provincial autonomy for East Pakistan to be brought before the East Pakistan Assembly. Thus, on 3 April 1957, several members of the East Pakistan Assembly moved four different versions of a resolution in support of granting East Pakistan autonomy. All members of the cabinet, other than Dhirendranath Datta and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, withdrew from the assembly chamber, so as not to appear to back the resolution. During the ensuing debate, Ashab Uddin Ahman spoke in favour of the motion, alongside Muzaffar Ahmed, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Chitta Ranjan Sutar, Razia Banu and Ashutosh Singha. In his speech in Bengali in favour of the resolution, Ashab Uddin Ahmad said that \\"it was on the demand for autonomy that Pakistan was founded\\", as could be seen in the Lahore Resolution, and that consequently opposing autonomy for East Pakistan meant opposing Pakistan. He also argued that the 21-point plan, which, as he reminded the assembly, Suhrawardy was formally committed to, could not be implemented without the implementation of the 19th point, which called for regional autonomy. Giving a detailed breakdown of Pakistani government expenditure in East Pakistan and West Pakistan between 1947 and 1956, Ashab Uddin showed that the federal government had spent Rs. 3,280,000,000 in East Pakistan and Rs. 20,760,000,000 in West Pakistan. Ashab Uddin argued that, given that Pakistan, like an eagle, had two wings, both wings had to be strong. Lastly, he stated that \\"full regional autonomy\\" was necessary \\"for our freedom\\". At the end of the debate, a majority of the members of the East Pakistan Assembly voted in favour of one of the four versions of the resolution, calling for \\"full Provincial Autonomy for East Pakistan\\", with only currency, foreign affairs and defence to remain under the purview of the federal government. Ashab Uddin Ahmad later stated that he saw his contribution to this resolution to be his most significant act as an MLA. On 13 June 1957, the Awami League Council was convened again, this time by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka. Ashab Uddin believed that Mujibur Rahman had inflated the membership of the council by issuing several hundred dubious membership cards. Moreover, there was intimidation used at the council meeting against the most left-wing members, such as Ashab Uddin and Mohammad Toaha. This council meeting voted to support the Pakistani-US military alliance. As a result, Bhashani decided to leave the Awami League and form a new party called the All-Pakistan National Awami Party (NAP). This party's main demands would remain the same as Bhashani's earlier demands within the Awami League: that East Pakistan be granted autonomy, and that Pakistan observe neutrality in foreign relations. Following Bhashani's lead, Ashab Uddin switched his allegiance from the Awami League to the NAP. Delegates attending the inaugural NAP convention were attacked with sticks by thugs allegedly hired by the Awami League, but ultimately the formation of the party could not be prevented. =End of the East Pakistan Assembly= On 7 October 1958, President Iskander Mirza instituted martial law, which dissolved the federal parliament and provincial assemblies. Arrest warrants were issued against certain members of the East Pakistan Assembly, including Ashab Uddin Ahmad. He was able to leave his house 20 minutes before the police arrived to arrest him. Subsequently, he went into hiding, and took part in the underground anti-Ayub-Khan movement after Ayub replaced Iskander Mirza. =Communist activism and the 1971 war= In 1966, as a consequence of the Sino-Soviet split occasioned by Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech of 1956, the Communist Party of East Pakistan split in two, with the East Pakistan Communist Party (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) separating as a pro-Chinese party. It was the latter party that Ashab Uddin Ahmad joined. When the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out in 1971, Ashab Uddin Ahmad and Sudhanshu Bimal Datta decided not to leave the country, as many other political leaders were doing, but rather to organise an armed unit to take part in the war. They recruited several former members of the army, navy and air force, and appointed Saleh Ahmad (previously of the air force) commander of the unit. The unit operated in Satkania and pursued a twofold short-term aim: to fight against bandits operating in the area, and to rescue non-Muslims in danger of being killed by Pakistani forces. Once they were successful on both fronts, Ashab Uddin and Datta decided to expand the activities of the force by attempting a march from Satkania south to Cox's Bazar via Banshkhali. Ashab Uddin hoped that thousands of peasants would join the unit, which would then be able to seize and hold territory, subjecting members of exploitative classes to popular trials and fomenting a wider revolution. This, however, was not to be. On 22 September 1971, upon reaching Banshkhali, all but two of the members of the unit were killed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's supporters (who did not wish independent leftist forces to operate outside their control), while the other two escaped and were soon killed by Pakistani and Al-Badr forces. When Ashab Uddin and Datta arrived in Banshkhali the following day to rendezvous with their unit, they immediately had to flee. Ashab Uddin spent some time hiding on a boat in the middle of a river but, afraid of being caught either by either Pakistani or pro-Mujib forces, he proceeded to Chittagong, where he spent the rest of the war in hiding, growing a beard as a disguise. =Politics in the Bangladesh era= After the war, the Communist Party led by Toaha, which Ashab Uddin was a member of, was in opposition to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's government. In 1979, Ashab Uddin stood for election to the Bangladeshi parliament from Banshkhali. Although he did not wish to take part in the election so long as Ziaur Rahman was in power, he was persuaded to do so by the party leadership. However, he did not win the seat this time. In 1980, Ashab Uddin, Toaha and another Bangladeshi Communist leader named Dr. Khayr were invited by the Communist Party of China (CCP) to visit the country. Before leaving China, the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted for a luncheon by Yang Shangkun, the mayor of Guangzhou. Yang stated during the gathering that \\"We have established socialism in the country. Now there is no longer a need for class struggle. It is enough to increase production.\\" Ashab Uddin objected that Lenin and Mao had said that class struggle had to continue until full- fledged communism was established. He warned Yang that, with the import of capital from capitalist countries, China may also end up importing CIA plots. After this lunch, Ashab Uddin sent a letter of similar import to the Central Committee of the CCP. Ashab Uddin quit active politics in 1981, disillusioned by the factionalism of Bangladeshi Communists (there were six or seven pro- China Communist parties in Bangladesh, not to mention the pro-Soviet ones), as well as the corruption of some Communist leaders. When discussing the 1991 election, Ashab Uddin Ahmad expressed the view that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Bangladesh, given that most of the population at the time was illiterate, which exposed them to exploitation and communalism. In his view, \\"Ministers and MPs do not represent the general public in any way. They are only the representatives of money and strength.\\" In his view, Indian democracy had not been able to solve the problems of \\"poverty, landlessness, homelessness, unemployment, the lack of education, untouchability and communalism.\\" He believed that, looking at India, Bangladeshis should draw the conclusion that, instead of democracy, what was needed was a popular revolution led by a revolutionary party.

It is referred to as Manson Cave in the NZ Topo Map, after owners in the early 20th century,Information panel \\"Water Catcher\\", Department of Conservation NZ however the cave is known as Rawhiti Cave locally, and on DoC information panels and in brochures. The cave's entrance is one of the largest cave entrances in New Zealand with an opening of about wide and up to tall. The ceiling is densely covered in stalactites which become increasingly finer deeper down into the cave. A short walking track leads halfway down into the cavernous opening to a viewing platform. Flora The diverse twilight-zone flora near the entrance of Rawhiti Cave makes this cave nationally significant. Over long periods of time, plant growth on the cave formations causes them to grow towards the sunlight as more calcium carbonate is deposited regularly on top of the plant growth. This phenomenon, called phytokarst, is most evident on the larger stalactites near the cave entrance, which are strongly curved outwards due to the heavy moss and fern growth on their sunlit sides.Information panel \\"Rawhiti Cave ‚Äì a nationally significant phytokarst\\", Department of Conservation NZ Apart from the short walking track to the viewing platform, the cave is undeveloped and in its natural state. Delicate ferns and mosses grow on the cave's sloping floor, and phytokarst stalagmites also grow towards the light, similarly following the growth pattern of the plant life that helps form and shape them. During winter months, sunlight reaches the back wall of the cavern, creating viable conditions for some species of algae to survive at the lower limit of light availability for photosynthesis. These algae cover the rear walls in a range of red hues.Information panel \\"Plant Mosaic\\", Department of Conservation NZ History and tourism Rawhiti Cave was originally formed some one million years ago, before Dry River cut the valley deeper to its present position. The original cave roof has collapsed long ago, forming a massive self-supporting dome leading down to a steep-sided pit formed of loose debris.Information panel \\"How old is Rawhiti Cave?\\", Department of Conservation NZ In the early 1900s, Darcy Manson, son of the land owner, cut a track to the cave and took people there on tours until the late 1920s. He named the cave Rawhiti, MƒÅori for \\"sunrise\\", due to the winter sun shining right to the back of the cave. From 1955 to 2000, the cave was owned by the Baird family, who provided daily tours on demand. In 2000, the cave's ownership changed to Heritage New Zealand, and the Baird Reserve area is now managed by the Department of Conservation NZ, its split into the adjacent Dry River Scenic Reserve and Rawhiti Caves Scenic Reserve. The track to Rawhiti Cave starts at an informal car park on private farm land and leads into the Dry River valley for 30 minutes, followed by a 30-minute uphill zigzag track to the cave entrance. The viewing platform inside the cave entrance includes information panels and is still well enough lit that no torches are needed. This is one of very few such caves that is open free of charge to the general public, hence visitors are urged to stick to the path to avoid damaging the fragile environment inside the cave.

Biography Osborne started out playing the drums. He began his bandleading career in 1924. He began recording in 1929 with a light, crooning vocal style similar to Rudy Vall√©e's. While Vall√©e was in Hollywood for the filming of The Vagabond Lover, Osborne took over for him at his Heigh-Ho Club. Osborne's orchestra focused on the trombone; he called this \\"slide music.\\" In his book, The Big Bands, George T. Simon noted that the tenor of the times contributed to Osborne's early success: \\"Then in 1929 came the stock-market crash and the Depression. The high living and the tempos slowed down. The mood and the music of the country changed. The search for security, for sweetness and light, was reflected in the country's musical tastes ‚Äî in its acceptance of crooners like Rudy Vallee and Will Osborne, and then Bing Crosby and Russ Columbo, in its preference for dance music that encouraged romance and sentiment and escape.\\" Simon described the band that Osborne formed in 1935 as \\"a stylized outfit that featured rich, deep-toned brass, emphasizing, of all things, slide trumpets plus glissing trombones blown through megaphones. He and his orchestra appeared in the 1946 Monogram musical comedy film Swing Parade of 1946. A 1948 newspaper article reported that, at that time, \\"The band holds the all-time attendance record at Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles.\\" The Band's theme song was The Gentleman Waits.

The device uses decentralized authentication to encrypt any communications and comes with its master public key and unique private key pre-installed with the phone. When a device is communicating with another Turing Phone, the two devices can directly verify their identity, side- stepping the need to route it via a Key Distribution Center. At first the device was to run Android 5.0 which was later abandoned in favour of Sailfish OS, an operating system more resistant to attacks and threats, modified and adjusted according to the specifications and the user interface of Turing Phone. The OS licence and cooperation with Jolla enabled the use of Sailfish Secure, a security-hardened version of the platform, developed in collaboration with the Finnish SSH Communications Security, the inventor of the SSH protocol. In 2017 TRI announced their intention to release an Android version besides the Sailfish OS, though, the specifications and the schedule have not been availed. The device body is made of a material called \\"Liquidmorphium\\" which is described by the manufacturer as an ‚Äúunbendable‚Äù metal that's stronger than titanium or steel and more resistant to shock and screen breakages. The phone is released in three memory capacity versions, the cheapest one of which costs US$610. A Cnet.com article called the pricing high, but noted that the \\"phone remains aimed at the well-heeled and security conscious, and not the average consumer\\". Turing Robotic Industries has announced to have shipped the first batch of Turing Phones on July 12, 2016, as well as the second and third batches to be followed on July 22 and July 29 respectively.

C.) Beall (1892‚Äì1970) was an American commercial illustrator and portrait painter. He did watercolor art and drawings for magazines and comic books. Beall designed posters for the United States government for war loan drives during World War II.  Early life  Beall was born on October 15, 1892, in Saratoga, Wyoming, with the given name Cecil Calvert. His parents were Charles W. Beall and Eugenia N. Beall. He had a brother who was a year older, Roger.  Education  Beall received tutoring from the Canadian- American painter George Brant Bridgman at the Art Students League in New York City. While there he displayed his artwork and drawings at exhibits of the Society of Illustrators. Beall also attended Pratt Institute to learn the art of watercolor painting and poster drawing.  Career  General MacArthur, surrender WWII on USS Missouri ‚Äì painting by C.C. Beall Beall did work for many of the leading periodicals of the twentieth century. His watercolor style was in a type of bold contrasting reflections, which was popular at the time. Some Meredith magazines that he produced paintings and colored drawings for included Collier's, Vanity Fair, Cosmopolitan, Woman's Home Companion, Saturday Evening Post, American Family Circle, and This Week. He also painted covers for Elks Magazine and Reader's Digest books. Beall's 1936 painting of President Roosevelt for Collier's cover page led to the position as art director for the Democratic National Committee. Beall was temporarily an employee of the U. S. War Department. At the same time, he was also a correspondent-artist for several magazines, including Collier's, and painted portraits of decorated war heroes. Beall was an eyewitness to the 1945 official Japanese surrender on the U.S.S. Missouri. He painted General MacArthur at the event; his work later became the official portrait. U.S. Victory Bonds  Posters  Beall's 1945 Treasury poster painting of Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the raising of the replacement American flag on Iwo Jima was used for the war campaign in the Seventh Loan drive. He claimed he didn't change any of the lines in the original photograph, but merely colorized it. It was put on track to be the most displayed picture in history. The loan promotion brought in more than $26 billion in 6 weeks' time to help end World War II. The original American flag put up on Mount Suribachi was taken down as a memento. The total fund raised for all eight War Bond drives was $156 billion. Beall's original drawing of U.S. President Roosevelt that was used for the World War II $200 E Bond was given to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. The poster from this art work was labeled \\"In The Strength Of Great Hope We Must Shoulder Our Common Load.\\" The formal presentation in October 1945 from Beall was in Washington, D.C. with the director of the Office of War Finance, Ted R. Gamiie.  Family  Beall married Mildred Muriel Hall in 1920. They had three children: Charles (born 1922), Barbara (born 1924), and John (born 1928).

Description Eremophila incisa is a small, spreading shrub which grows to a height of between with branches that are flattened near their tips and sticky due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately and scattered along the stems, thick, egg-shaped to elliptic, sticky, shiny, curved downwards and mostly long and wide. The most distinctive feature of the leaves is that their margins are cut into, producing stiff, spiny teeth. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on a sticky stalk, usually long. There are 5 green to purplish-brown, lance-shaped to egg-shaped overlapping sepals which are very hairy on their inner surface. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is deep purple to mauve on the outside and white with yellow-brown spots inside. The outside of the tube and petal lobes are densely hairy but the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from March to October and is followed by woody, almost spherical fruits which have a hairy, papery covering and are in diameter.Newman Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae.

Poole Scholarship in 1980 and from 1980-84 she received grants from the Saskatchewan Arts Board. Career In The Academy from the fall of 1990 she delved into her personal recollections. The Academy contained figurative paintings which were tied together by narrative. These pieces deal with Marie Lannoo's stay at a convent school. They do not focus on the story of a girl going to convent school but rather are Lannoo's recollections of her time at the school. Her recollections are tied to each other, as Cindy Richmond wrote, \\"in a narrative form by the painter's specific reactions to those recollections.\\" The Academy was the first time she used herself as her subject. \\"Her close attention to the evocative power of colour and texture, allow the viewer more than one perspective from which to approach the work,\\" Cindy Richmond, the curator for The Academy, acknowledged. In Imprints Lannoo dealt with imprinting in its metaphorical implications and also, as Tim Nowlin wrote, \\"within the material realization of her paintings.\\" These works deal with layering information on the canvas. The paintings are dense and complex; using stenciling, pouring, scraping and brushing paint. They are, as Tim Nowlin has put it, \\"like palimpsests, surfaces where information is layered upon prior information, both rubbing out and exposing traces of meaning.\\" Her main subject matter is reflected colour which shows in her Mendel Art Gallery exhibition, Through and Through and Through. In this exhibition she used Transparent and luminescent material. Roald Nasgaard has written that, \\"Increasingly her work has disembodied colour, casting it out into space as pure spectral display.\\" This show was an experience and not simply something to be viewed. As Vincent Varga wrote, \\"It allows the viewer to get inside the dynamic colours.\\" Her interest in form and optical effects of colour and surface is particularly evident in her exhibition with Margaret Elizabeth Vanderhaeghe, The Source of Things. Dan Ring, the curator, for The Source of Things, explains Lannoo's recent work uses abstract language to show both, \\"the embodied and the disembodied, forming meaning out of pattern and repetition, alluding to both the world we live in and to a history of abstraction.\\" In the early 2000s Marie Lannoo was an artist mentor at the Saskatoon Mendel Art Gallery. Her work is currently in many public collections including Canada Council Art Bank, Government of Alberta, Saskatchewan Arts Board, SaskTel and the University of Saskatchewan. She exhibits locally, nationally and internationally and is represented by Galerie de Bellefeuille in Montreal, Newzones Gallery of Contemporary Art in Calgary, Alberta and Galerie Lausberg in Toronto.

He is the editor-in-chief of the Metropolis newspaper the Daily Star. An early Superman supporting character, he was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster as the unnamed editor who gave Clark Kent his first job as a reporter in Action Comics #1 (June 1938). His name was later revealed in Superman #2 (1939). Perry White replaced him as the Editor-in- Chief of the Daily Planet in Superman #7 (Oct 1940). In the New 52 the character is once again running the Daily Star. Golden Age Virtually nothing is known about the background of this version of the character, but his personality as a newspaper editor was well defined. He was irascible, yelling at his reporters when angry or excited, but he was also a model of courage, loyalty, and integrity. When the superintendent of a labor camp claimed that reports about him in the Daily Star were libelous, Taylor would not apologize, saying that the information they had obtained was authoritative, and he dared the superintendent to sue. He also defended the reporter's pledge not to reveal the source of information.Action Comics (volume 1) #10 (March 1939) Taylor at first refused to hire the inexperienced Clark Kent as a reporter but later changed his mind when Kent brought in the story of an attempted lynching.Superman (volume 1) #1 (July 1939) He shortly made it Kent's steady assignment to cover the reports about the existence of someone called Superman. However, when Lois Lane, the Stars \\"lonelyhearts\\" column writer, claimed the next day to have met Superman, Taylor didn't believe her, asking if she had actually seen pink elephants.Action Comics (volume 1) #1 (June 1938) This was indicative of the difference in Taylor's attitude toward Kent and Lane: he was very supportive of Clark, giving him a variety of assignments including South American war correspondent, but if Lois asked for an important story she was told by her editor that it was \\"no job for a girl!\\" To be fair, Kent received his share of abuse, as when Taylor called him a \\"brainless idiot\\" and fired him for flubbing an assignment. But the editor gave Clark his job back when he brought in the story,Action Comics (volume 1) #5 (October 1938) and he actually softened toward Lois over time. Taylor also admitted it when he was wrong, as he did when he accused Kent of betraying his confidential source for cowardly reasons.Action Comics (volume 1) #10 (March 1939) In the spring of 1940, the newspaper Taylor edited inexplicably changed its name to the Daily Planet.Superman (volume 1) #4 (Spring 1940)Action Comics (volume 1) #23 (April 1940) He retained his position until November of that year,Action Comics (volume 1) #30 (November 1940) after which time a new editor, Perry White, was suddenly introduced.Superman (volume 1) #7 (November‚ÄìDecember 1940) Earth-Two When DC Comics created the multiverse, the Superman of Earth-Two was assigned all the characteristics and baggage of the early Golden Age version of the character, and this included the Daily Star and George Taylor, who was still editor when Clark Kent and Lois Lane got married.Action Comics (volume 1) #484 (June 1978) Upon announcing his retirement in the early 1950s, Taylor chose his successor by way of a competition between Kent and senior reporter Perry White. By solving a famous missing-person case, White proved the superior reporter but ironically lost the editor's job to Kent because Taylor felt that the better reporter shouldn't be locked to a desk.Superman Family #196 (November‚ÄìDecember 1979) Sometime after retiring, Taylor discovered a filmstrip depicting Kent changing to Superman, but he promised Clark that he would never reveal the Man of Steel's secret identity. However, corrupt reporter Rod Pilgrim overheard the conversation and subsequently murdered Taylor to acquire the filmstrip. Superman confronted Pilgrim, convinced him that the images were part of a gag film, and turned the killer over to police.Superman Family #209 (August 1981) Earth-One In Superman #366 (Dec. 1981) George Taylor was shown to be the editor of the Daily Planet on Earth- One before Perry White. Taylor, who had succeeded a man named Morton, chose White to replace him when he retired at age sixty-five, an event that coincided with Clark Kent's junior year at Metropolis University.Superman: The Secret Years #4 (May 1985) George Taylor, Junior, became editor of the Daily Star in Star City and continuously tried to prove that Oliver Queen was the masked hero Green Arrow. George Taylor III was a record-breaking pole vaulter.World's Finest Comics #244 (April‚ÄìMay 1977) Post-Crisis After the Crisis on Infinite Earths wiped out the multiverse and replaced it with one Earth, the Metropolis Daily Star with George Taylor as editor was a rival paper to the Daily Planet, which was edited by Perry White.The Adventures of Superman #451 (February 1989) Taylor was still in his position as late as 2002.Superman (volume 2) #183 (August 2002) When Superman was cast into a Golden-Age reality during the \\"Dominus Effect\\" storyline of 1998, the original George Taylor briefly reappeared. The New 52 In the 2011 New 52 relaunch, George Taylor was reintroduced in Action Comics Vol.2 #8 as the publisher of the Daily Star. In other media *George Taylor appeared in season one of Adventures of Superman episode The Evil Three.

It is the sequel to 2014's Xenonauts. Gameplay Xenonauts 2 is a turn-based tactics video game. Synopsis Xenonauts 2 takes place in an alternate history timeline during the Cold War, rather than being a chronological sequel to Xenonauts. Though like its predecessor, Xenonauts 2 is inspired by X-COM: UFO Defense. Development In 2015, Goldhawk Interactive began prototyping and designing a potential sequel to their 2014 game Xenonauts. At the time, the possibility of Xenonauts 2 becoming their next project was still under evaluation. The game is being developed using the Unity game engine. It will make use of 3D graphics rather than the 2D sprites of its predecessor. The development team's main concern with the transition to 3D graphics was whether they could create an art style that looked good and replicated the sprites from the original game. The use of 3D graphics would enable features such as objects with physics behavior and rotating the camera angle. Setting the game in an alternate timeline meant that humanity would not possess the advanced alien technology from Xenonauts. The developers believed that this decision gave them the freedom to alter the story, setting and enemies to craft a more interesting game. They also set out to redesign the aliens for the sequel. Project lead, Chris England remarked that he wanted them to be both visually and mechanically more interesting than in Xenonauts. Release In February 2016, Goldhawk officially announced Xenonauts 2, with the game scheduled to be released in 2017. In November 2016, Goldhawk began distributing free development builds of Xenonauts 2 with fortnightly updates. The demo was later released on distribution service GOG.com in February 2017. They wanted to get feedback from the player community before charging for an in-development version of the game through the Steam Early Access program.. Goldhawk launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in July 2018, the funding goal was reached within 8.5 hours. A closed beta was released on November 28, 2018 for Kickstarter backers who pledged ¬£25 or more. In the announcement of the closed beta, the developers stated that the game would enter Early Access in March 2019. In October 2019, Goldhawk said that they were expecting a mid-January 2020 release on Steam Early Access, however as of August 2020, the release was still pending on the Steam platform.

It was inaugurated on 11 November 1938 by Governor Charles Bonham-Carter to the memory of those killed in World War I, but in 1949 it was rededicated to those killed in both world wars. The monument was designed by Maltese artist Louis Naudi, who was influenced by Antonio Sciortino. According to Mark G. Muscat, the War Memorial \\"is possibly the sole example of a work of art in Malta which up to a certain extent illustrates the idea of Futurism put forward by Marinetti and Sant'Elia in Italy... Naudi deserves credit for his successful attempt at breaking away from the British colonial architecture that was commonplace at the time... It would be more plausible to classify the War Memorial as an Art Deco stylistic expression... as an avant-garde aesthetic applied to hardstone construction, which gives Naudi's towering design an imposing look.\\" The monument is an obelisk in the form of a Latin cross, and it is built out of local globigerina limestone. It has four plaques showing the colonial badge of Malta and reproductions of a document issued by King George V in 1918 acknowledging Malta's role in World War I, the letter by which King George VI awarded the George Cross to Malta in 1942, and a 1943 scroll by President Franklin D. Roosevelt saluting Malta for its role in World War II. The War Memorial is located on the site which during the Order of St. John was used for public executions. It is close to the Malta Memorial which is dedicated to Commonwealth aircrew who died in World War II, and memorials to the Royal Malta Artillery and The King's Own Malta Regiment. It was originally positioned halfway between City Gate and ƒ†lormu Cassar Avenue, but was relocated during the realigning of St. Anne Street in 1954. The memorial was restored and the area around it landscaped in the early 2010s. An eternal flame was installed at this point. The President and Prime Minister as well as other dignitaries lay wreathes at the monument at an annual remembrance ceremony. The memorial is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument.

Early life Born in Providence, Rhode Island on December 20, 1893 to Paul and Antonia (n√©e Hecker) Newman, Louis Israel Newman attended Brown University (B.A. 1913), and then went on to receive an M.A. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1917, and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1924. From 1913 to 1916 Newman served as rabbi of Congregation Beth Israel (Berkeley, California). In 1917, Newman became an assistant to Rabbi Stephen Wise at the Free Synagogue in New York City and then was ordained by Stephen Wise and Martin Meyer in 1918. Career After his ordination, Newman became rabbi of the Bronx Free Synagogue (1918‚Äì21). In 1921, he became rabbi of Temple Israel in New York City and was appointed to the faculty of the Jewish Institute of Religion (JIR) when it was founded the following year. In 1924, Newman moved to San Francisco, replacing Martin Meyer as rabbi of Temple Emanu-El. In 1930, Newman returned to New York City to become rabbi of Temple Rodeph Sholom. He stayed in this pulpit until his retirement in 1972. During his tenure at Temple Rodeph Sholom, Newman became active in the Zionist Revisionist movement, was the chairman of the Palestine Mandate Defense Fund, and was honorary chairman of both the Revisionist Tel Hai Fund and the American Friends of a Jewish Palestine. He once again served on the faculty of the JIR. He also served on the American advisory committee for the Hebrew University and as a vice president of the American Jewish Congress.  Brandeis University  Newman was the visionary for Brandeis University. \\"To be sure, Rabbi Newman was not the first during the twentieth century to advocate for a Jewish institution of higher learning. [...] Yet, it was Newman's proposal, published in the Jewish Tribune, which inexplicably garnered the attention and raised the eyebrows of American Jewry. Rabbi Newman had firsthand knowledge of the Jewish quota, having attended Brown University at a time when the school's administration imposed 'limitations in the enrollment of Jews and Negroes.' Taking stock of the United States' 15,000 Jewish collegians‚Äînearly ten percent of the total collegiate population‚ÄîNewman lamented that 'the Jewish student is becoming more and more unwelcome in privately endowed American universities.' More significant than exclusion from academe, Newman worried about the very practical problem that, as a result of limited educational opportunities, American Jews were in jeopardy of being further rejected from 'higher spheres of the professions and commerce.'\\" There were many other proposals, but Newman continued steadfast in his work for his vision of a Jewish university. He published a slim volume, appropriately titled A Jewish University in America?, featuring an expanded version of his original essay and a collection of the articles and letters that had appeared on the subject. In 1945 Newman was recruited by Rabbi Israel Goldstein, to join a group of men to consider the possibility of opening a Jewish university in Waltham, Massachusetts, some ten miles northwest of Boston. For his obvious interest and expertise in the matter, Goldstein was delighted to \\"have the friendly support of Rabbi Louis I. Newman.\\" Though Newman's did not remain on this board that would help in the founding of Brandeis, the school's first president, Abram L. Sachar, wrote to Newman, just three weeks before the start of the first semester. Sachar told Newman that he considered him to be \\"one of the most valued pioneers in the long battle to establish a university in America under Jewish auspices.\\" And, \\"in a very deep sense we are indebted to you for preparing the soil and fructifying it,\\" wrote Sachar. Yet, it was probably another line in Sachar's letter that properly represented Newman's bittersweet feelings on the matter. \\"It is too bad,\\" Sachar sympathized, \\"that a generation had to pass before your vision was acted upon.\\"Abram L. Sachar to Louis I. Newman, September 15, 1948, Louis I. Newman Papers, Box 11, Folder 6, American Jewish Archives. Writings Newman was a prolific writer and playwright. Some of his volumes include: Jewish Influence on Christian Reform Movements (1924) and Jewish People, Faith and Life (1957). He also compiled and translated the classic work The Hasidic Anthology, Tales and Teachings of the Hasidim: The parables, folk-tales, fables, aphorisms, epigrams, sayings, anecdotes, proverbs, and exegetical interpretations of the Hasidic masters and disciples; their lore and wisdom (1934, 1968, 1972), which has become a standard textbook for courses in Jewish studies. Personal life In 1923, Newman married Lucille Helene Uhry, daughter of Edmond and Lillian (n√©e Hessberg) Uhry. Together they had three sons, Jeremy Uhry Newman, Jonathan Uhry Newman, and Daniel Uhry Newman. Rabbi Louis Israel Newman died at the age of 78 on March 9, 1972 in New York City.

He founded Bluestar, a small solvents factory, in 1984, and created ChemChina by taking control of more than 100 troubled factories from the government, which retains ownership. Early life and education Ren Jianxin was born January 1958 in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, of Hebei ancestry. During the Cultural Revolution, he worked as a sent-down youth in Dunhuang from 1974 to 1975. From 1975 to 1984 worked at Lanzhou Chemical Machinery Research Institute. He obtained a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from China Central Radio and TV University (now Open University of China). In 1994, he earned a master's degree in business administration from the department of economics at Lanzhou University. Career In 1984, Ren used a loan of RMB ¬•10,000 to start Bluestar Company (), an industrial solvents factory, together with seven young employees. It later became China National Bluestar (Group) Company, a joint venture with the Blackstone Group. Starting in 1996, Ren created the ChemChina empire by taking control of more than 100 troubled chemical factories all over China, which remained government-owned. His management style was to keep lay- offs at a minimum by shifting workers to the company's Malan Noodle restaurant chain, and to modernize by bringing in outside consultants. In May 2004, after the State Council of China approved a merger of companies formerly under the Ministry of Chemical Industry as the China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina), Ren Jianxin became its General Manager, as well as Deputy Secretary of the Committee of the [Communist] Party in the company (became the Secretary since 2010). Since December 2014 he has been promoted to the chairman of the board of directors, on top of his position as the highest ranking Communist Party member of the firm. Ren is chairman of what The Economist has described as the \\"most dynamic globaliser among China's state enterprises\\". ChemChina bought the Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli in 2015 for $7.7 billion, and the German machinery maker Krauss-Maffei for $1 billion, the biggest acquisition by a mainland Chinese company in Italy and Germany, respectively. As of 2015, ChemChina is ranked 265th among the Fortune Global 500 companies. Awards Ren is listed in China's \\"Top 10 M & A Figures\\", \\"The Most Famous Entrepreneurs\\" and ‚ÄúCCTV Annual Economic Figures‚Äù.

It'll be something pretty unexpected; we're actually on tour with them when we get back from Japan, and it's going to be kind of cool because we're going to record the collaboration, without writing anything, right at the end of the tour. I'm really excited to see what we're going to come up with.\\" In February 2016, The Body and Full of Hell made the closing track \\"The Little Death\\" available for online streaming to promote the album. The title is a reference to the French saying \\"la petite mort,\\" which translates to \\"the little death\\" and used to be a reference to a fainting fit but in modern times is used to describe the sensation after an orgasm. The track concludes with an audio sample from the 2010 HBO film You Don't Know Jack starring Al Pacino as the physician-assisted suicide activist, Jack Kevorkian. Weeks later, the group streamed the track \\"The Butcher\\"‚Äîa song originally written and recorded by Canadian folk musician Leonard Cohen and originally released on his 1969 second studio album, Songs from a Room. On the week of One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache's release, the collaborative group released a music video for the track \\"Fleshworks\\". Both bands will tour together in support of One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache starting with an April 2016 European tour.  Reception  Upon its release the album was met with widespread acclaim with many reviewers praising the cohesive collaboration between the two bands. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 78, based on 6 critics, which indicates \\"generally favourable reviews\\".Reviews for One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache.Metacritic.

Lowery (December 9, 1830 or 1832 c. 1900) was an African American preacher and lawyer, who was the first black lawyer to argue a case before the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Lowery was sponsored to the Supreme Court Bar by Belva Ann Lockwood, the first woman admitted to the bar, in 1880. Lowery was the fifth black attorney to be admitted to the bar.

In 1857, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and continued preaching there. In 1858 he married and moved to Chatham, Ontario (the West Canada)Lovette 1999 p146 where he remained for three years before returning to the US and moving to a farm given to him by his father near West Lancaster in Fayette County, Ohio. In 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, he went to Nashville to preach to the black soldiers and freedmen in the area. At the time, Colonel R. K. Crawford of the 40th United States Colored Troops was in command and Lowery was denied commission as chaplain of the regiment. Instead, he was transferred to the 9th United States Heavy Artillery U.S. Colored Troops where he received a commission as chaplain. He also was a teacher for the 2nd U. S. Colored Light Artillery U.S. Colored Troops, Battery A.  Teaching and law  Illustration from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper showing Samuel Lowery's Supreme Court bar admission After the war, he moved his family to Rutherford County, Tennessee where he continued to teach and preach. Lowery and his father founded a black university, the Tennessee Manual Labor University in 1867 in Ebenezer, Tennessee near Murfreesboro based on the model of Franklin College.Lovette 1999 p145 He also began studying law. The school began to struggle in 1872, with reasons given including financial improprieties and the Ku Klux Klan. The accusations of financial improprieties were based on an 1872 fundraising tour of the north by Lowery and another teacher, Daneil Wadkins. The pair, who were black and Republican, were not supported by white, largely Democratic, Disciples who frequently criticized the school and reportedly felt that success in the black school would undermine white superiority. Lowery and Wadkins were accused of mismanaging the funds and expelled from the church. Without support, further fundraising efforts failed and the school closed in 1874.Lovette 1999, p146-147 Lowery moved back to Nashville, where he was admitted to the bar and began practicing law.

Silk cultivation and industry  About 1874, his ten-year-old daughter, Annie L. Lowery, attended an exhibition of silkworms by Lewis Theobald and persuaded her father to buy some silkworm eggs. Annie began to raise silkworms on white mulberry trees at their home in Huntsville. Annie died in 1877, and Samuel continued her work. He met with other major silk manufacturers in the United States, including Frank Cheney, brother of Ward Cheney and John Kyle of Paterson, New Jersey. In 1875, Lowery established the Lowery Industrial Academy, and later founded the S. R. and R. M. Lowery Industrial Silk Culture and Manufacturing Company. Lowery believed that black workers in the south would be ideal workers in the industry, comparing the work to work in cotton fields.Raising Silk in the South, The New York Times, (New York, New York), February 10, 1881, accessed August 29, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6418526/raising_silk_in_the_south_the_new_york/ In 1879, Lowery was the editor of a newspaper, the National Freeman, in Huntsville.Personal, The Tennessean (Nashville, TN), October 22, 1879, page 4, accessed August 29, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6418425/personal_the_tennessean_nashville/ In 1880 he established a cooperative community in Jefferson County, Alabama called Loweryvale. He spent much of his later career advocating the silk industry. He won awards for his silk at international exhibitions in Louisville in the 1880s, New Orleans in 1884, and Omaha in 1898.

Its updated version Darkfores2 combines the techniques of its predecessor with Monte Carlo tree search. The MCTS effectively takes tree search methods commonly seen in computer chess programs and randomizes them. With the update, the system is known as Darkfmcts3. Darkforest is of similar strength to programs like CrazyStone and Zen. It has been tested against a professional human player at the 2016 UEC cup. Google's AlphaGo program won against a professional player in October 2015 using a similar combination of techniques. Darkforest is named after Liu Cixin's science fiction novel The Dark Forest.  Background  Competing with top human players in the ancient game of Go has been a long- term goal of artificial intelligence. Go‚Äôs high branching factor makes traditional search techniques ineffective, even on cutting-edge hardware, and Go‚Äôs evaluation function could change drastically with one stone change. However, by using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network designed for long-term predictions, Darkforest has been able to substantially improve the win rate for bots over more traditional Monte Carlo Tree Search based approaches. = Matches = Against human players, Darkfores2 achieves a stable 3d ranking on KGS Go Server, which roughly corresponds to an advanced amateur human player. However, after adding Monte Carlo Tree Search to Darkfores2 to create a much stronger player named darkfmcts3, it can achieve a 5d ranking on the KGS Go Server.  Against other AI  darkfmcts3 is on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs such as Zen, DolBaram and Crazy Stone but lags behind AlphaGo. It won 3rd place in January 2016 KGS Bot Tournament against other Go AIs. = News Coverage = After Google's AlphaGo won against Fan Hui in 2015, Facebook made its AI's hardware designs public, alongside releasing the code behind DarkForest as open-source, along with heavy recruiting to strengthen its team of AI engineers.  Style of play  Darkforest uses a neural network to sort through the 10100 board positions, and find the most powerful next move. However, neural networks alone cannot match the level of good amateur players or the best search-based Go engines, and so Darkfores2 combines the neural network approach with a search-based machine. A database of 250,000 real Go games were used in the development of Darkforest, with 220,000 used as a training set and the rest used to test the neural network's ability to predict the next moves played in the real games. This allows Darkforest to accurately evaluate the global state of the board, but local tactics were still poor. Search-based engines have poor global evaluation, but are good at local tactics. Combining these two approaches is difficult because search-based engines work much faster than neural networks, a problem which was solved in Darkfores2 by running the processes in parallel with frequent communication between the two. = Conventional strategies = Go is generally played by analyzing the position of the stones on the board. Some advanced players have described it as playing in some part subconsciously. Unlike chess and checkers, where AI players can simply look farther forward at moves than human players, but with each round of Go having on average 250 possible moves, that approach is ineffective. Instead, neural networks copy human play by training the AI systems on images of successful moves, the AI can effectively learn how to interpret how the board looks, as many grandmasters do. In November 2015, Facebook demonstrated the combination of MCTS with neural networks, which played with a style that \\"felt human\\". = Flaws = It has been noted that Darkforest still has flaws in its play style. Sometimes the bot plays tenuki (\\"move elsewhere\\") pointlessly when local powerful moves are required. When the bot is losing, it shows the typical behavior of MCTS, it plays bad moves and loses more. The Facebook AI team has acknowledged these as areas of future improvement.  Program architecture  The family of Darkforest computer go programs is based on convolution neural networks. The most recent advances in Darkfmcts3 combined convolutional neural networks with more traditional Monte Carlo tree search. Darkfmcts3 is the most advanced version of Darkforest, which combines Facebook's most advanced convolutional neural network architecture from Darkfores2 with a Monte Carlo tree search. Darkfmcts3 relies on a convolution neural networks that predicts the next k moves based on the current state of play. It treats the board as a 19x19 image with multiple channels. Each channel represents a different aspect of board information based upon the specific style of play. For standard and extended play, there are 21 and 25 different channels, respectively. In standard play, each players liberties are represented as six binary channels or planes. The respective plane is true if the player one, two, or three or more liberties available. Ko (i.e. illegal moves) is represented as one binary plane. Stone placement for each opponent and empty board positions are represented as three binary planes, and the duration since a stone has been placed is represented as real numbers on two planes, one for each player. Lastly, the opponents rank is represented by nine binary planes, where if all are true, the player is a 9d level, if 8 are true, a 8d level, and so forth. Extended play additionally considers the boarder (binary plane that is true at the border), position mask (represented as distance from the board center, i.e. x^{(-0.5 * distance^2)}, where x is a real number at a position), and each player's territory (binary, based on which player a location is closer to). Darkfmct3 uses a 12-layer full convolutional network with a width of 384 nodes without weight sharing or pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by a rectified linear unit, a popular activation function for deep neural networks. A key innovation of Darkfmct3 compared to previous approaches is that it uses only one softmax function to predict the next move, which enables the approach to reduce the overall number of parameters. Darkfmct3 was trained against 300 random selected games from an empirical dataset representing different game stages. The learning rate was determined by vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Darkfmct3 synchronously couples a convolutional neural network with a Monte Carlo tree search. Because the convolutional neural network is computationally taxing, the Monte Carlo tree search focuses computation on the more likely game play trajectories. By running the neural network synchronously with the Monte Carlo tree search, it is possible to guarantee that each node is expanded by the moves predicted by the neural network.  Comparison with other systems  Darkfores2 beats Darkforest, its neural network-only predecessor, around 90% of the time, and Pachi, one of the best search-based engines, around 95% of the time. On the Kyu rating system, Darkforest holds a 1-2d level. Darkfores2 achieves a stable 3d level on KGS Go Server as a ranked bot. With the added Monte Carlo tree search, Darkfmcts3 with 5,000 rollouts beats Pachi with 10k rollouts in all 250 games; with 75k rollouts it achieves a stable 5d level in KGS server, on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs (e.g., Zen, DolBaram, CrazyStone); with 110k rollouts, it won the 3rd place in January KGS Go Tournament.

Performed to music by Henry Cowell, the piece was the second work created by Graham in response to the Spanish Civil War. The first, Immediate Tragedy, was introduced in 1937.  Theme, score, set and costume  According to program notes, Deep Song was \\"not meant to be an exact picture of a Spanish woman but presents the torture of mind and body experienced in common by all people who react to such suffering as the Spanish people have faced.\\" When Cowell was composing the music for Immediate Tragedy, Graham requested another movement, which he called Canto Hondo, Spanish for \\"deep song\\". In Flamenco music, deep songs (cante jondo) are the most serious of the vocal form. Sometimes, Graham used both compositions for Immediate Tragedy; other times, she used only the original sarabande. Deep Song was choreographed to Canto Hondo on its own. The music for both ballets was lost for decades. Canto Hondo was discovered in 2003 behind a desk at the Martha Graham Dance Company's offices. The score for Immediate Tragedy has never been found. Graham designed both the set and costume for Deep Song. The set consisted of a single long low wooden bench, similar to the one constructed for Lamentation. It suggested both a coffin and mourners' pew, and served as an axis for the soloist's motions. The costume alluded to Pablo Picasso's powerful mural Guernica, painted in the same year Deep Song was made. As Graham danced, the lines of her body in the long striped black and white dress formed graphic strokes of white against the black velvet backdrop.  Choreography  The choreography embodied the suffering of the Spanish people. \\"It was full of strange, strong creation, full of angular spasms, of Picasso style abstractions in plane and three- dimensional mobility, expressing as no newspaper story with a Madrid date line has done of the struggle...\\" Program notes for the troupe's 2015 season described \\"the forms of the dance ‚Äì its swirls, crawls on the floor, contractions and falls\\" as \\"kinetic experiences of the human experience in war... It is the anatomy of anguish from tragic events.\\"  Critical reception  From the outset, the solo was received favorably, although some reviewers thought the piece overwrought. The Boston Transcript's critic wrote, \\"the dancer seemed to be overplaying her hand, so that what began as a moving portrait ended, by overstatement, in losing some of its point.\\" Another reviewer, noted the dance was \\"exaggerated in delineation and repetitious in content but a highly effective though stylized portrayal of a tortured mind and body.\\" Following a Graham retrospective in 1944, The New York Times' dance critic John Martin wrote the work was not among those that \\"seemed to do most completely what they set out to do,\\" but could be categorized with dances having \\"aspects, elements, passages of beauty and power.\\" He referred to Deep Song in particular as an \\"extraordinary evocation.\\"  Performance history  Deep Song was presented fairly frequently from its premiere to the mid-1940s. In January 1938, Graham performed the solo at the New York Hippodrome in the second \\"Dance for Spain\\" benefit concert. The event may have been where she first met future husband and dance partner Erick Hawkins, who was appearing with Ballet Caravan. During the 1980s, Graham, who disliked revivals, was persuaded to reprise some of her earlier dances. Deep Song was restaged in 1988. Graham alone had danced the solo role, but did not remember all the choreography. Former company members helped her recreate the work from their recollections and Barbara Morgan's photographs of the piece. Since the original score was lost at the time, Cowell's Sinister Resonance was used in its place. Since its reconstruction, Xin Ying, Blakeley White McGuire, Carrie Ellmore-Tallitsch, Terese Capucilli, Christine Dakin, and Joyce Herring have appeared in the solo role. Deep Song is in the current Martha Graham Dance Company repertory.

The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July 26 over the Ganges delta and moved in a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75 km/h (45 mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July 30\\\\. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August 2\\\\. Across its path, Komen dropped torrential rainfall, primarily in northwestern Myanmar where the precipitation totaled at in Paletwa. The rains compounded upon ongoing flooding and contributed to the worst flooding in the country in a century. About 1.7 million people were forced to evacuate as flood waters inundated houses to their rooftops. About 510,000 houses in the country were damaged or destroyed, and many residents lost their source of income as 667,221 acres (270,000 ha) of crop fields were damaged. The floods killed 132 people, of which at least 39 were directly related to Komen. The government requested assistance from the international community to cope with the disaster, considered the worst in the country since Cyclone Nargis in 2008. Elsewhere, the storm's flooding damaged 88,900 houses in Bangladesh and covered crop fields for a week; Komen killed 45 people in the country, some of whom due to illnesses spread by the storm. Later, floodwaters affected southeastern India, killing 103 people and damaging or destroying 476,046 houses. Meteorological history The monsoon spawned a low pressure area on July 25 over the extreme northern Bay of Bengal and along the southern coast of Bangladesh. With low wind shear and abundant convection south of a developing circulation, the system quickly organized. At 03:00 UTC on July 26, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a depression, while the circulation was nearly stationary near the southern coast of Bangladesh. Land interaction and an unfavorable phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation prevented further strengthening, despite warm water temperatures of . Early on July 27, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the depression after the convection organized further, amplified by good outflow. Still embedded within the monsoon, the depression remained nearly stationary for two days over southern Bangladesh. The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on July 28, due to the increasingly defined circulation. On July 28, the system began moving more to the south and southeast, although its movement was very slow, possibly affected by another monsoon depression over western India. The IMD described the track as \\"unique\\", taking a \\"semi-circular path over the northeast Bay of Bengal.\\" At 00:00 UTC on the next day, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and three hours later the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02B, located 135 km (85 mi) southwest of Chittagong, Bangladesh. A tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast imparted dry air, but otherwise, conditions were generally favorable. A ridge over Myanmar turned the system to the north on July 29. During that day, the circulation was somewhat elongated and exposed from the convection, while the thunderstorms in the southern periphery organized into spiral rainbands. At 18:00 UTC on July 29, the IMD upgraded the system to Cyclonic Storm Komen, one of only four storms of such intensity in July since 1965; typically, low pressure areas that form in the month are in the extreme northern periphery of the Bay of Bengal, allowing little time to develop over waters, and usually impeded by wind shear. Late on July 29, the JTWC estimated that Komen attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), based on estimates from satellite imagery. As the storm approached Bangladesh, the circulation remained very broad with most of the convection in the southern periphery, although radar imagery from the coast indicated there was a formative eye feature in the storm's center. At 06:00 UTC on July 30, the IMD estimated peak 3 minute winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Between 14:00-15:00 UTC that day, Komen made landfall on Bangladesh just west of Chittagong, and the JTWC discontinued advisories once the storm was ashore. Komen quickly weakened as it turned to the northwest through Bangladesh, steered by a ridge over Tibet to the north. On July 31, the system crossed into the Indian state of West Bengal as a weakened depression. The track shifted to the west-southwest until Komen weakened into a remnant low on August 2 over Jharkhand. Preparations Komen over land on August 2 During the duration of Komen's existence, the IMD issued warnings on the storm that were relayed to the governments of the countries affected. In southeastern India, government officials issued various warnings for fishermen and for the potential of disruptive rainfall. The widespread flooding forced 1.2 million people to evacuate their homes, with 1,537 shelters opened to house 214,306 of the evacuees. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee canceled an overseas trip to London to coordinate relief activities related to the storm. The Bangladeshi government evacuated 331,120 people to 766 storm shelters, mostly in low-lying areas of Cox's Bazar District. Impact For several days, Komen dropped heavy rainfall across the northern Bay of Bengal and onto the adjacent coastlines of northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and eastern India. The southeast quadrant produced the heavy rainfall, resulting in a peak rainfall of in Paletwa, Myanmar; the country experienced record rainfall totals during July and August 2015 in some locations. =Bangladesh= Moving ashore Bangladesh, Komen was accompanied by a storm surge of that affected Chittagong, while flooding rains caused landslides.gladesh, a station at Teknaf Upazila briefly recorded winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) on July 30. Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh recorded over of rainfall over three days, and over in Cox's Bazar over ten days. Rough seas killed two people off Cox's Bazar when a boat capsized. Rain-induced landslides killed five people in Cox's Bazar, and two others died in the town due to flooding. The storm damaged 88,900 houses across Bangladesh, including hundreds of fishermen huts. Trees knocked onto houses killed at least three people in separate instances. Flooding submerged at least of crops for at least a week after Komen struck the country. Komen killed 45 people in Bangladesh - 21 in Cox's Bazar and 7 in Bandarban District - some of whom due to illnesses spread by the storm. About 220,000 residencies required some form of assistance after the storm, primarily to cover lack of food. Damage in Chittagong were estimated to be ‡ß≥1.398 billion (US$18 million). =India= India, rainfall peaked at in Harinkhola, West Bengal, after the storm moved inland and tracked westward. Komen's rainfall in India compounded upon previous floods; heavy rainfall from the storm occurred while rivers and dams were overflowing. Rainfall produced a landslide in Manipur state in extreme eastern India, killing 20 people. As the storm moved into West Bengal, it killed 10,088 livestock while affecting millions of residents. Komen damaged 368,238 houses and destroyed another 107,808. Across the state, the storm killed 83 people, some related to lightning and snakebites. Flooding covered a portion of National Highway 60 in neighboring Odisha state. The Indian government utilized 121 rescue boats to assist stranded residents. Overall damage in West Bengal were up to ‚Çπ30 billion (US$467 million). =Myanmar= Across northwestern Myanmar, Komen brought additional rainfall after weeks of monsoonal flooding. ref> In extreme northwestern Myanmar, Maungdaw recorded winds of 124 km/h (77 mph), possibly during a passing squall. Nearby Sittwe recorded winds of 107 km/h (67 mph). Torrential rainfall, reaching per hour, caused flooding and landslides. In Chin State northeast of Tonzang, Komen resulted in three landslides, including one along a mountain slope that moved 395 million tons of ground at a speed of up to 180 km/h (112 mph); the landslide was 5.9 km (3.6 mi) in length, one of the largest worldwide in a decade that was unrelated to an earthquake, and a much faster moving landslide than normal. The flooding after Komen's passage were considered the worst disaster in Myanmar since Cyclone Nargis in 2008, and according to the government, possibly the worst flooding in a century. About 1.7 million people had to temporarily evacuate. Water levels reached the top of buildings, which displaced residents and restricted travel to just by boat and helicopter. Floods from Komen caused further damage to houses and roads. The floods covered crop fields with mud and silt, particularly in valleys. By the end of July 2015, over of farmlands were inundated, of which 667,221 acres (270,000 ha) of planted crops were damaged, mainly to the rice paddy. About 236,000 chickens were killed, and there were lower losses to other livestock. In Sittwe, flooding and winds damaged six shelters and camps, where about 100,000 people were residing during the storm. The shelters sustained damage to latrines and learning centers, necessitating the use of tarps to ride out the floods. The town of Kalay was isolated by floods and only reachable by air travel. Flooding from Komen was worst in Rakhine State, where water distribution was contaminated, and entire towns were largely destroyed. Waters started to recede by August 4, allowing residents to return home; by September 2015, most of the displaced residents nationwide had returned home. High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000 houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132 deaths, at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State. Komen was directly responsible for at least 39 deaths in the country. Total estimated loss of the flooding were at K231.3 billion (US$192.8 million). Aftermath On July 31, President of Myanmar Thein Sein declared disaster areas for Chin and Rakhine states and for Sagaing and Magway regions. On August 4, the government issued an appeal to the international community for assistance. In response, the government of Australia provided A$3 million, and the United States Agency for International Development sent US$600,000. Neighboring Bangladesh donated $800,000 worth of medicine, water kits, and other supplies. Assistance from other countries included $775,000 from the United Kingdom, $142,202 from nearby Thailand, $100,000 from the Singapore Red Cross, and $300,000 from China. After Myanmar's government failed to respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2 million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06 billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6 million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000 people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.

He developed the idea of a single-handed sailing event for recreational sailors to take place at autumn equinox, and he coined the name first in Danish and later in English.

Fourteen is the average age of children who enter into congregate care. In the United States out of the 400,000 children in the foster care system around 55,000 live in congregate care settings. In the United States in 2013 there was 55,916 children in congregate care. In the last ten years, there has been a 37% decrease in the number of children in congregate care, which is greater than the overall 21% drop in number of children in the foster care system. Among the options of placements for youth in the foster care system, congregate care settings are supposed to be used as a temporary placement, until youth are considered stabilized and ready for a family-like setting. Reports show that on average, youth spend anywhere around 8 months in congregate care ). According to Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, children are required to have a case plan that aims to place them in the most appropriate and least restrictive settings that supports their wellbeing and needs. A 2015 report by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that states are not consistently lessening the use of congregate care and that more information is required. Some children are placed in congregate care because they are thought to be in need of behavioral or mental health support services, or because they have a clinical disability. In 2013 out of all children in congregate in the United States, 36% had a mental health disorder, 45% had behavioral issues, 10% had a disability, and 28% did not have any clinical labels. Many children are placed in these settings because there is a lack of space available in family settings. According to officials, depending on the state there are anywhere between 5 and 32 percent of children who are placed in such settings that are not in need of such high surveillance.

Grinding involves the removal process of material and modifying the surface of a workpiece to some desired finish which might otherwise be unachievable through conventional machining processes. The grinding process itself has been compared to machining operations which employ multipoint cutting tools. The abrasive grains which make up the entire geometry of wheel act as independent small cutting tools. The quality, characteristics, and rate of grinding wheel wear can be affected by contributions of the characteristics of the material of the workpiece, the temperature increase of the workpiece, and the rate of wear of the grinding wheel itself. Moderate wear rate allows for more consistent material size. Maintaining stable grinding forces is preferred rather than high wheel wear rate which can decrease the effectiveness of material removal from the workpiece.  Mechanisms of wheel wear 300x300px A common attributing factor to wheel wear is grain fracture, which can be an advantage. A portion of each of the individual grains on the wheel surface breaks apart and leaves the remaining grain bonded to the wheel. The fractured grain is left with newly exposed sharp edges which attribute the self-sharpening characteristic of grinding wheels and cutting tools in general. Attritious wear or progressive wear which is typically undesirable leads to the grains dulling by developing flat spots and rounded edges on the wheel which can deteriorate the wheel‚Äôs ability to remove material. Flat spots also can lead to excessive heat generation with the added surface contact which in turn enables bond fracture, or the brittle fracture of the adhesive bonds between the grains. The removal of these worn grains from the adhesive bonds restores the wheel‚Äôs cutting ability once more. Grinding wheels can also be characterized by the grains‚Äô increased capacity to fracture according to a level of higher value of friability. Different bonding materials are used depending on the intended use of the grinding wheel. The bonding material is classified by its individual strength called its wheel grade.  Grinding forces  Grinding Wheel Wear Curve: Diameter of wear (mm) as a function of time (td), Three stages of grinding, and dressing/tool life determined in stage II (Td). The longevity and cutting ability of a grinding wheel can be affected by the grinding forces generated while in use. Experimental investigation has revealed a direct relationship between cutting speed, wheel geometry, chip geometry, and the grinding forces namely the resultant normal force component (Fn ), the tangential force component (Ft ), and their ratio when in contact with a workpiece. Stage I: As a workpiece enters the grinding zone the initial contact forces are unstable and rise abruptly short period of time and a small wear spot is formed. The overall performance of a wheel during this moment of unstable rising forces can be minimized with proper dressing conditions prior to use and can help effect the high peak and steady state forces which should normally be contained within a short period of time. Stage II: During the steady state wear stage reaction forces are constant and the flow of heat generation in both the work piece and wheel remain in equilibrium. The measurable data in this stage presents itself as a linear rate of wear as a function of the working duration of the dresser application or tool life (Td). The tool life corresponds to the grinding wheels ability to maintain the initial shape give to it during the dressing prior to use. As the workpiece stays full contact with the grinding zone in the steady state of constant forces the flow of heat generation in the work piece and the wheel maintains equilibrium. This phase usually does not produce temperatures that would coincide with bond fracture however the material properties of the bond strength can determine the maximum applied force the wheel grit can sustain prior to fracture. Stage III: Wear rates on the workpiece become detrimental while the rate of change in reaction forces decreases. The end of tool-life represent the initial dressing condition are no longer effective. The rate of change of forces generated in this stage are minimal and wear on the workpiece as an exponential tendency.  Effects of cutting temperature  thumbThe lifespan of the grinding wheel and final surface properties of the workpiece are directly affected by the operating cutting temperature. Heat generated during grinding penetrates the grinding wheel and the workpiece which can cause dimensional errors due to thermal expansion Several adverse effects of a high cutting temperature are as follows: * Tempering * Burning * Thermal cracks * Residual stresses The heat flux distribution at the grinding wheel- workpiece interface The addition of grinding fluids can effectively control cutting temperatures to reduce heat induced surface effects on the wheel and workpiece. High heat flux density may result in the grinding wheel melting and consequently, increased wear. The heat flux (Œ¶) penetrating the grinding wheel and workpiece depends mainly on the cutting speed (vs) and cutting force (Fc). The temperature of the grinding wheel is related to the density of heat flux (œÜ = dŒ¶/dA) generated (which also is directly proportional to the feed rate). An approximate value of the heat flux can be calculated as follows: Œ¶ = Fc ‚Ä¢ vs  Grinding wheel types  Grinding wheels can be made with a variety of materials depending on the desired abrasive quality required during use. Abrasive material, natural of synthetic, used in grinding include some common types of grinding wheel geometry. # Straight # Cylinder # Straight Cup # A variety of material types  Abrasive grains  The process of grinding requires an abrasive component with material properties harder than the workpiece. Most common grinders employ a rotating surface being brought in contact with a work surface. The wheel component of grinder itself is generally composed of abrasive grains held together by a bond structure which contain some amount of porosity.  Wheel speed  Typical ranges and speeds for abrasive processesThe grinding wheel typically operates at high rotational speeds. The wheel speed depends several factors, some of which included the grindability of the wheel, the shape of the part, and the material of the workpiece. These properties will affect important parameters such as the surface finish, surface integrity, and wheel wear. Likewise, the grinding wheel speed will depend on which abrasive process is needed and which finishing process is desired.  Dressing  A worn grinding wheel can be dressed to restore its grinding properties. Dressing a grinding wheel causes new grains to be produced on a glazed or loaded grinding wheel. A glazed grinding wheel is the result of high attritious wear causing the grains to become dull. A loaded grinding wheel is a result of chips clogging the grains on the grinding wheel due to the grinding of soft materials, improper grinding wheel selection processing parameters. In addition to sharpening a grinding wheel dressing can also be used to true a grinding wheel that is out of round or to shape the profile of a grinding wheel to produce specific features on the workpiece.

Just as crucially, she and Goodman don't act as if innovations in R&B; ceased before they were born; most of these songs are as modern sounding as anything aired on radio stations classified as mainstream urban.\\" He was disappointed by some of the collaborations on the record, feeling that \\"Begin resonates most when Hervey and Goodman are left to themselves\\". Evan Rytlewski of Pitchfork criticized what he felt was a lack of experimentation, noting that Hervey and Goodman's songs \\"shuffle between disco, house, and neo-soul. And while they update these styles with the airy, wide-open production aesthetic of modern alternative R&B;, their songs are rooted squarely in pop. There are no experimental digressions that might alienate the dance floor... Lion Babe aren't after cred. They're after hits.\\" Dami Solebo of PopMatters said that Lion Babe \\"appear to play spin the bottle with sub-genres in an effort to make something stick\\" and that ultimately \\"many of Lion Babe's ditties fall short of achieving anything in particular, making it a pleasant enough album, but one that is quickly forgettable\\".

Background While this was the first time the organization has held an event at the venue, it was the fifth time that UFC has hosted an event in Los Angeles County. Previous UFC events in the area took place at the Staples Center. The event was expected to be headlined by a UFC Middleweight Championship rematch between champion Luke Rockhold and former champion Chris Weidman. They previously met at UFC 194, when Rockhold won Weidman's title via fourth-round TKO. However, Weidman pulled out on May 17 due to a large extrusion herniation on his neck. The first replacement choice was former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion Ronaldo Souza, who lost his title to Rockhold in 2011, but he injured his meniscus in a win at UFC 198 against former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Vitor Belfort. Therefore, he was replaced by The Ultimate Fighter 3 winner Michael Bisping. The fight was also a rematch as the two met previously in November 2014 at UFC Fight Night: Rockhold vs. Bisping, with Rockhold winning via submission in the second round. The co-main event featured a UFC Bantamweight Championship trilogy bout between current two-time champion Dominick Cruz and former WEC Featherweight Champion Urijah Faber. The pairing first met at featherweight on WEC 26 in 2007, where Faber defeated Cruz via guillotine choke to defend his title. The rematch took place on UFC 132 in 2011, when Cruz defended his title for the first time via unanimous decision. A lightweight bout between Evan Dunham and The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 2 winner Leonardo Santos, originally scheduled for UFC 198, was moved to this event after a minor injury to Dunham delayed the matchup a few weeks. Subsequently, Santos pulled out on April 29 due to an undisclosed injury and was replaced by James Vick. In turn, Dunham pulled out of that pairing on May 5 for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Beneil Dariush. In January 2016, former UFC Lightweight and Welterweight Champion B.J. Penn announced his intention to return to active competition in the featherweight division after an 18-month \\"retirement\\" and was expected to compete at UFC 197. However, Penn's return was delayed after an investigation into criminal allegations made against him was launched. After the UFC concluded that no criminal or civil charges would be filed, the organization announced that he would face Dennis Siver at this event. In turn, Siver pulled out on May 10 due to an undisclosed injury. He was replaced by Cole Miller. Subsequently, Penn himself was removed from the card on May 23 after he was flagged for a potential anti-doping violation: the use of an IV in excess of 50 ml in a six-hour period during a March 25 out-of-competition sample collection. He was replaced by Alex Caceres. A lightweight bout between John Makdessi and Mehdi Baghdad was originally scheduled for this event, but on April 28 it was announced that the bout was moved to UFC Fight Night: dos Anjos vs. Alvarez. The event marked the first time fighters were allowed to weigh in for their bouts in the morning (starting 10 a.m.), rather than the traditional time of 4 p.m. used for public proceedings. They weighed in with a California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) official looking on so they would have less time to be dehydrated after their weight cuts and more time to rehydrate after making weight. They were back on hand to stand on the scale ‚Äì ceremoniously, for the fans and media ‚Äì and face off with their opponents. This is part of new measures for fighters' safety, with the CSAC creating new rules that will eventually be adapted to all the other athletic commissions. During the main card broadcast, the UFC announced that UFC 8 and Ultimate Ultimate 96 tournaments winner Don Frye will be inducted to the UFC's Hall of Fame at the \\"International Fight Week\\" in July, one day after UFC 200.

He is one of five New Zealanders who featured in the Sunday Times Rich List 2009. He was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the community in the 2005 New Year Honours.  Early life  Born in Christchurch, New Zealand, he was expelled from Christ's College, Christchurch, in 1955, and spend the next 10 years working in various blue collar industries (including oil drilling, construction, and rigging) around the world, as well as numerous hotels and jazz clubs in the United States.  Oil industry  In the 1960s Watt worked as an explosives expert for oil exploration crews in North Africa, the Middle East, and Central America. In the late 1960s/early 1970s he worked for the National Supply Company oilfield division of Armco Steel, out of Houston, TX, and Louisiana, on the early development of sub-sea wellheads and blow-out preventers. During this period he became a partner of Drexel Oil Services in Aberdeen, Scotland. After a project with the Israeli Government off the Sinai Peninsula, Watt sold out of all his oil interests in 1976.  Sports  While working with Capital Sports New York, he formed CSI in London and quickly saw an opportunity where sports bodies worldwide were not exploiting their international television rights intelligently, and in a pioneering move soon represented all soccer bodies in UK/Europe, as well as all international rugby and cricket federations. CSI's largest publicised contract was a deal with NewsCorp in the lead up to the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, which lead to the professionalism of international Rugby Union, particularly in the southern hemisphere. Worth approx. $950m, this was largest sports broadcasting contract in history at the time. CSI represented all cricket and rugby federations, and most soccer federations, for 15 years. Their work is largely credited with shaping the current professionalism of most major sporting industries. CSI was sold to the Interpublic Group in 2001.  Music  Watt produced numerous albums since the 1990s, most notably Vince Mendoza's Grammy- nominated Epiphany in 1999, which is considered a classic by the jazz music industry. In 2009 Watt joined music mogul Korda Marshall in relaunching the Infectious Music record label (formerly known as Infectious Records). The label's most notable signing was alt-J, who won the 2012 British Barclaycard Mercury Prize for their debut album An Awesome Wave, which reached Platinum certification in the UK. Their other signings include General Fiasco, Local Natives, Cloud Control, Drenge, Superfood, RY X, The Acid, These New Puritans, and Vance Joy. Infectious Music was acquired by BMG Rights Management in September 2014. Watt is also the owner of the legendary Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, London, with business partner Sally Greene OBE.  Theatre  Watt has had an extensive history in the theatre industry, and is the only New Zealander to receive a Tony Award for his production of Annie Get Your Gun. His current theatre production credits include: * Jersey Boys * The Bodyguard * Matilda the Musical * Groundhog Day His previous notable theatre production credits include: * We Will Rock You * The Boy from Oz * Gypsy One of the Durham Miners' Association's banners, which features Anthony Wedgwood Benn, as well as Michael Watt.  Philanthropy  Watt has dedicated much of his later life to philanthropic endeavours around the globe. His earlier efforts include sponsoring the Durham Miners' Gala when it was on the brink of collapse in the late 1990s. His UK domestic work also includes supporting the Easington Colliery Band, as well as many other music-based non-profits including The Sixteen, the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, and across the Atlantic the Jazz Foundation of America. By forming the Ronnie Scott's Charitable Foundation in 2015 he is continuing to support major musical charities across the UK and provide free instruments to disadvantaged youths. His efforts expanded to internationally to include numerous projects in Mozambique, such as agricultural and sustainability developments in the northern village of Chupanga, a school for the blind in Beira, as well as the purchase and conversion of a disused prison on the outskirts of Beira into a women's safe space. He also funded with Concern Worldwide the development of another safe space for women and children in Bangladesh, as well as a state of the art paediatric dental clinic in a refugee camp in Amman, Jordan. In Cuba he has developed schools and community projects, as well as providing Cuban hospitals with much needed supplies. His love of sports has seen him develop cricket facilities in townships of South Africa, while back in his native New Zealand he funded the development of the Hadlee Watt Academy and the Bert Sutcliffe Oval at Lincoln University in Christchurch, New Zealand. In recent years his focus has shifted towards the refugee crises in the Middle East and Africa, in particular he has supported projects by Concern Worldwide to: deliver emergency aid kits to thousands of internally displaced person in Northern Syria, provide aid to Syrian refugees in Northern Lebanon, and help Sierra Leone recover after the Ebola crisis. He is also the primary donor for Salam LADC, a grassroots NGO that provides aid to the approx. 500,000 Syrian and Palestinian refugees in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon.

Battat was from the town of ad-Dhahiriya in the Hebron Subdistrict of the British Mandate of Palestine.Cohen, p. 187. He was a well-known commander in his home region and was suspected by the British authorities of involvement in the killing of British archaeologist J. L. Starkey in January 1938. The authorities put a bounty on Battat for Starkey's death and other alleged crimes, and his whereabouts were made known to them by a Palestinian informant.Cohen 2008, p. 135. Battat and his men were ambushed by British forces in the hills around Hebron on 7 May 1938, leading to a heavy, two-hour-long firefight. Battat was consequently killed in the shootout and his men dispersed, with no British fatalities. Rebels retaliated by executing a Palestinian from Beit Ummar charged with tracking Battat on behalf of the authorities. Abd al-Rahman al-'Azzi, a village leader from Beit Jibrin, was suspected by the al-Husayni faction of informing the authorities about Battat's location and was consequently compelled to organize armed rebel activity in his region to compensate for his alleged collaboration.Cohen 2008, p. 132, 173.

The Equity Partners are Government of Uganda represented by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation holding 96% of the initial stock and Makerere University holding 4%. KMC developed Africa's first electric vehicle in 2011, Africa's first hybrid vehicle in 2014 and Africa's first solar electric bus in 2016. KMC's market entry product is the Kayoola EVS, a Fully Electric, Low Floor City Bus with a range of 300 kilometers on a full charge. History The KMC journey dates back to 2007; evolving from an extra-curricular activity under the auspices of then Makerere University Faculty of Technology, to a university curricular activity and later a mainstream national initiative for automotive manufacturing. In 2007, a global consortium of over 31 universities and colleges across the world took part in a Vehicle Design Summit (VDS) to design and bring to market a 5-Seater plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the Vision 200, targeting the Indian market. Under the United States-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology led three-year project, Uganda's Makerere University was the only participant from Africa. The team from the Faculty of Technology now College of Engineering, Design, Art and Technology was responsible for design and integration of the Low Power Electronics and Data Networking Systems. Given the experience in building the Vision 200, other global experiences through collaborations, and best practices benchmarking, the Makerere team resolved to embark on a project aimed at designing and building a vehicle in Uganda. The Kiira EV in Kampala The Center for Research in Transport Technologies (CRTT) was then conceived under Makerere University in December 2008 and approved as part of the University Structures effective 1 January 2011. The strategic goal of CRTT was to advance research and innovation in transportation technologies on land, air and sea with specific emphasis on green mobility solutions for Africa. The Kiira EV Project was the first project implemented under CRTT. The Kiira EV, Africa's first electric vehicle, was completed by the team and launched by H.E Yoweri Museveni, the President of the Republic of Uganda, on 24 November 2011. The successful execution of the Kiira EV Project led to the establishment of the Kiira Motors Project as a government initiative for Automotive Industry Development aimed at Establishing a Vehicle Plant in Uganda. The Kiira Motors Project started the Kiira Vehicle Technology Innovation Program through which the Kiira EV SMACK, the first Electric Hybrid Vehicle designed and built in Africa, was developed and unveiled at a very high-profile event at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi, Kenya in November 2014. The team then designed and built the Kayoola Solar Bus, the first Electric Solar Bus designed and built in Africa. The Kayoola Solar Bus was launched by H.E Yoweri Museveni on 16 February 2016 at the Kampala Serena Hotel. Kiira Motors conducted a Pre-Investment Analysis (The KMC Business Case) to affirm the viability of vision Vehicles Made in Uganda. This informed the development of the Kiira Motors Corporation Business Strategy and subsequently Business Plan. The KMC Pre-Investment Analysis (Business Case) was launched by the Uganda Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda on 7 December 2015 at the President's Office Conference Hall. Commercial Production Cabinet of Uganda sitting on Monday 9 April 2018 at Statehouse Entebbe approved the roadmap for the Commercialization of the Kiira Electric Vehicle Project. This is to be undertaken in a phased manner with the market-entry point being assembly of vehicles (including electric vehicles) in partnership with reputable vehicle manufacturers. Cabinet approved a Seed Fund of US$40 Million (USh 143.7 Billion) over a period of four years starting in the Financial Year 2018/19 with an allocation of USh 24 Billion under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. The decision was facilitated by a comprehensive appraisal and approval of a Feasibility Study for Setting Up and Operating the Kiira Vehicle Plant by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. Cabinet also authorised the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation to put in place the necessary Institutional Framework for the Commercialization of the Kiira Electric Vehicle Project and mandated the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation to establish and oversee the project governance and management structures. The assembly plant is expected to have an installed capacity of 5,000 vehicles annually. Kiira Vehicle Plant The government of Uganda, acting through the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA), allocated 100 acres for the establishment of the Kiira Vehicle Plant, located at the Jinja Industrial and Business Park, Plot No. 701, Block 2 Kagogwa Village, Mawoito Parish, Kakira Town Council, Jinja District. 309x309px Kiira Motors Corporation and National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding for Construction of the Kiira Vehicle Plant Start-Up Facilities (Phase I) at the Jinja Industrial and Business Park based on the Force Account Mechanism provided for under Section 95(A) of the PPDA Act, 2003 (as amended). This was subsequent to clearance of the MOU by the Solicitor General. The Kiira Vehicle Plant Site was handed over to NEC on 18 January 2019, who deployed security and commenced work on 11 February 2019. Construction is expected to take two and a half (2.5) Years with completion slated for June 2021. The Scope of Work for NEC includes: Site Clearance; Construction of a perimeter fence and Two Gates; Excavation of a 1.4 km Open Channel along the Western Boundary; Construction of the Assembly Shop, Offices, R&D; Space, Materials Storage Areas, Overhead Water Reservoir, Container Yards, Finished Vehicle Park Yard, and Plant Monument; Construction and Installation of Servicing Facilities including the Plant Campus Circulation Roads, Power Distribution, Water Distribution, I.T Network Backbone, Drainage and Waste (Water and Solid) Management Systems; and defects liability period shall be for 12 months commencing on the date of Practical Completion of the Project. The construction and installation of a 3.7 km long 33kV medium voltage electricity line connecting the Kiira Vehicle Plant Site to the national electricity grid was completed, tested and commissioned by Umeme. The construction and installation of a 5.4 km long 6-inch water pipeline connecting the plant site to the municipal water supply system was completed, tested and commissioned by National Water and Sewerage Corporation. Establishment of the Kiira Vehicle Plant is expected to catalyse investment by small and medium enterprises in the manufacture of vehicle parts, components and autonomy systems (Brake pads, seats, bolts and nuts, bumpers, vehicle electronics, navigation system, among others). Kiira Motors Corporation has developed a roadmap for the Domestic Manufacture of Auto-Parts in Uganda and secured accreditation from PPDA for an alternative system for procurement of Auto-Parts Suppliers providing for sample parts development and accreditation of the production part manufacturing system. Establishment of the Kiira Vehicle Plant is projected to increase demand for the utilization of Uganda's natural resources such as steel from iron ore deposits; plastics from oil and gas, lithium ion batteries from graphite, lithium and cobalt deposits, vehicle upholstery and interior padding from cotton and leather, glass from silica and sand among others. The Kiira Vehicle Plant's contribution to employment in Uganda is estimated at 940 jobs from the Start-Up Investment. The full-scale plant operation is estimated to create over 2,000 direct jobs and 12,000 indirect jobs. In January 2020, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported that the Kayoola electric buses were as of then, available for sale to the public. KMC plans to manufacture 5,000 electric vehicles annually, beginning in July 2021. The manufacturer plans to procure up to 90 percent of the components in Uganda.

She is the first African American woman animator and one of a handful of black experimental filmmakers working since the late 1970s. She has earned international acclaim for her experimental, documentary, animation, and cross-genre productions. Her work, as well as her efforts as one of the first African American woman film educator, have led some in the press to describe her as a media activist for social justice and challenging representations of African American stereotypes in the mainstream media.Gateward, Frances K. \\"Chenzira, Ayoka.\\" St. James Women Filmmakers Encyclopedia (1999): 74-76. Film & Television Literature Index with Full Text. Web. 7 Feb. 2016.) Chenzira is most well known for her 35mm feature films Hair Piece: A Film for Nappyheaded People (1984) and Alma‚Äôs Rainbow (1993). Many of her recent works as a transmedia storyteller play with the increasingly digital world through art that combines material objects with digital environments, including Chenzira and her daughter HaJ's collaboration HERadventure (2013). Early life Born in Philadelphia to Paul and Bernice Wilson, Ayoka Chenzira was raised by her mother in North Philadelphia, living in the same building where her mother owned a beauty salon. She grew up playing the cello, field hockey and studying ballet. Chenzira was exposed to art from a young age, including dance lessons and theater visits as a child. Her mother made clothing for Ayoka, and strongly encouraged her to pursue her artistic ambitions. She has been working with moving images since she was 17. Chenzira married choreographer Thomas Osha Pinnock, whom she collaborates with often in her production and distribution company Red Carnelian. They have a daughter together, Haj. Education Chenzira attended private boarding school during high school. After graduating, she studied film and photography at The College of New Rochelle in Westchester, New York. She accomplished her M.A. degree in education at Columbia University. She received her B.F.A. degree in film production from New York University, where her thesis piece was Syvilla: They Dance To Her Drum (1979), \\"a short film that documented the African American concert dancer, Syvilla Fort, who was her dance teacher\\". She is the first African American to have earned her PhD in Digital Media Arts at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Chenzira is a professor of Women Studies, Film and Video at Spelman College. She is one of the first African Americans to teach film production in higher education. Career Chenzira was one of a group of young black filmmakers who worked outside of mainstream financing and production systems for films. From 1981‚Äì1984, Chenzira was the programs director of the Black Filmmakers Foundation, where she helped promote and distribute black films. She was one of the first African-American women to produce a feature-length film, Alma's Rainbow (1993). In 1984, she was one of seven writer/directors selected for the Sundance Institute. In the mid 1980s, Chenzira formed Red Carnelian, a New-York based production and distribution company focusing on media productions depicting life and culture of African Americans. The company has a successful distribution division, Black Indie Classics, and the company also provides film and video making instruction and opportunities to communities where individuals typically do not have access to the field of media production. Chenzira was the Chair of the Department of Media and Communication Arts at the City College of New York, where she managed programs in advertising, public relations, journalism, film and video; she also co-created their first M.F.A in media arts production graduate program. Chenzira is an arts administrator and lobbyist for independent cinema, distributing and exhibiting hundreds of films by African-American artists internationally. She is a founding board member of Production Partners in New York, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the visibility of African- American and Latino films. She was key in providing support for Charles Lane‚Äôs award-winning feature Sidewalk Stories (1989). She has also served as a media panelist for the Jerome Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Her contributions along with 14 other panelists for the Minority Task Force on Public Television resulted in the first Multicultural Public Television Fund. In 1996, Chenzira was consultant to the M-Net Television of South Africa. In 2001, Chenzira was invited to serve as the first William and Camille Cosby Endowed Professor in the Arts at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. There, she created and directed the award-winning Digital Moving Image Salon (DMIS), a year-long research and documentary production course. She also created and served as co-director of Oral Narratives and Digital Technology, a joint venture between Spelman College and the Durham Institute of Technology (DIT) where she designed and taught workshops primarily for Zulu students at DIT. in 2015 Dr Chinezira's animated film Hair piece:a film for Nappyheaded people was exhibited by the whitney museum of American art. She was also invited to show her early films at Lincoln center as part of a celebration of black film makers titled \\" Tell it like it is : Black independents in New York, 1968‚Äì1986. Films Hair Piece: A Film for Nappyheaded People is a 1984 satirical short film incorporating mixed media and animation to describe the emotional connection of black women and their hair. Chenzira said the film was inspired by the question, \\"Why is kinky hair seen as broken?\\" Chenzira, noted for her feminist topics, points out \\"self image for African-American women living in a society where beautiful hair is viewed as hair that blows in the wind\\".Robinson, S. L. (2011). Satire as cultural strategy for coping with racism in america(Order No. 1499375). Available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. (889251572). The pioneering short animated film tackles matters of space and personal rights for Black women and their bodies.Weaver, S. Q. (2015). Resurrecting black beauty culture: A critical analysis of the black beauty salon through contemporary film (Order No. 1597097). Available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. (1712861117). The award-winning ten-minute, 16-mm color animation contrasts the hair experiences and culture of Black women against white beauty standards. Chenzira depicts the salon locale as an engaging space, calling for an initiation in scholarly and film discourse about Black hair culture and Black female agency. Using humor, music, and mixed media of magazine photographs, Chenzira examines African American beauty trends as well as issues for Black women from the early 1900s to the early 1980s. In 2018, Hair Piece: A Film for Nappyheaded People was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and recommended for preservation. Also in 1982, Secret Sounds Screaming: The Sexual Abuse of Children was a documentary sharing the experience of childhood sexual abuse from a distinctly black perspective. It was her first self-produced film. Chenzira produced and directed Alma's Rainbow in 1993, a \\"coming-of-age\\" comedy-drama about middle- class black women in Brooklyn. This was one of the first 35mm feature films produced, written and directed by an African-American woman. It is one of Billboard Magazine‚Äôs top 40 home video rentals. Through the course of the film, Alma Gold, her daughter Rainbow, and Rainbow‚Äôs semi-estranged Aunt Ruby work to reinstate themselves and their various types of ‚Äúwork‚Äù with a sense of value in society, to find happiness in life, love and finances.Wright, G. W. (2008). The gravity of alma's rainbow: Problems of work and feminism in ayoka chenzira's film. Quarterly Review of Film and Video, XXV(4), 296-305. The film explores the ~~tensions~~ and pitfalls that arise in a journey of this nature‚Äîmost paths are fraught with risk, while others should not be pursued under any circumstances. Though assumptions were made about the film on the ‚Äúpalette of the movie‚Äôs mise en scene‚Äù, ‚Äúbubble gum dialogue‚Äù and ‚Äúsplashy costumes‚Äù, the subject matter had intellectual weight in its deconstruction of roles based on race, class, and gender. Chenzira dismantles the sexist, capitalist modes of patriarchy that negatively affect women's self-images within the working world; a struggle Black women face in ‚Äúhow to deprogram the ideological brainwashing they have received from the capitalist system without sacrificing the spiritual and economic success that such a system allows them access to through its lines of power.‚Äù Two of her films, 1979's Sylvilla: They Dance to her Dream and 1989's Zajota and the Boogie Spirit, are explorations of the role of dancing in black history. Sylvilla is a documentary exploring the life of Sylvilla Fort, who was trained by dancer Katherine Dunham and went on, herself, to train dancer Alvin Ailey. Zajota is an animated film about the path of Africans taken to America and the Caribbean. Chenzira said the film grew out of a sense that black Americans felt discomfort at the idea of dancing well. Chenzira left film for digital and transmedia storytelling in her work in the 2000s. She released the first part of HERadventure, an \\"interactive sci-if fantasy film\\" on her website and YouTube. Created by Chenzira and her daughter HaJ and funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, the part film and part interactive game has been accessible worldwide online since 2014. Her transition from film to a \\"transmedia storyteller\\" has been partly inspired by the new multitasking environments people inhabit: \\"parts of the story can be on a specific website while other parts can be accessed through a smartphone or on FaceBook, Instagram, etc. If you look around most people are doing more than one thing. They‚Äôre on phone while in conversation with someone else and also looking at some other screen.

Kline sold the railroad of farmland on which the town of Weldon was founded. with The railroad began construction of the Weldon Depot in 1880, the same year the town was laid out. The depot was completed the following year. The MI&N; was reorganized in 1886 as the Keokuk & Western Railroad. They operated the rail line through Weldon until 1901 when it became part of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. Passenger service continued in Weldon until December 1945. The last freight train went through the station in January 1946. The tracks were torn out when the railroad ceased service on the line. The depot was given to the town of Weldon, which maintains it. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The depot is a single-story, frame structure the measures . The building's original foundation was made up of railroad tie pilings set in the ground. It was replaced in 1989. The exterior walls are composed of vertical barn board and batten siding. It is capped with a gable roof, with wooden brackets under the eaves.

The plan consists of ten proposals, all of which are aimed at reducing police violence. The campaign's planning team includes Brittany Packnett, Samuel Sinyangwe, DeRay Mckesson, and Johnetta Elzie. The activists who produced the proposals did so in response to critics who asked them to make specific policy proposals. Subsequent critics of Campaign Zero and of their 8 Can't Wait project point out that some of the policies it recommends are already in place as best practice policies at many police departments. Some of these include the Milwaukee policing survey and the PRIDE act. However, a 2016 study by Campaign Zero found that only three of the eight policy recommendations were adopted by the average police department and that no law enforcement agency had adopted all eight. Platform Since its inception, Campaign Zero has collected and proposed policy solutions for police reform in ten areas. #End Broken Windows Policing: decriminalize crimes that do not threaten public safety, end profiling and stop and frisk policies, and establish alternative approaches to mental health crises. #Community Oversight: establish effective civilian oversight structures and remove barriers to report police misconduct. #Limit Use of Force: establish standards and reporting of police use of deadly force, revise local police force policies, end traffic-related police killings and high-speed chases, and monitor how police use force and increase accountability for use of excessive force. #Independent Investigations and Prosecutions: lower the standard of proof in civil rights cases against police, use federal funds for independent investigations and prosecutions, establish a State Special Prosecutor's Office for police violence cases, and require independent investigations for all police killing or serious injury cases. #Community Representation: recruit police officers who represent the demographic characteristics of their communities and use community feedback to inform policies. #Film the Police: require police body cameras and legislate/uphold the right to record police. #Training: invest in rigorous and sustained training and consider unconscious/implicit bias testing. #End Policing for Profit: end police department quotas, limit fines and fees for low-income citizens, forbid property seizure, and require police budgets to pay for misconduct fines. #Demilitarization: end the federal government's 1033 Program to supply military weaponry to local police departments and institute local restrictions to prevent the purchase of military weapons by police. #Fair Police Contracts: remove barriers to misconduct investigations and civilian oversight, keep officer disciplinary history accessible to police departments and to the public, and ensure financial accountability for officers and police departments that kill or seriously injure civilians. Campaign Arriving on the heels of protests in Ferguson, New York, Baltimore, and elsewhere over cases of civilians being killed by police officers, Campaign Zero in August 2015 was launched as a \\"data-driven platform\\" with the goal of ending police brutality. The same team had created the project MappingPoliceViolence.org four months prior, which tracked and mapped incidents of police violence. In November 2015, the campaign released its first research report, which examined the use of body cameras in police forces in 30 cities and the fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability associated with body camera policies. Data about the policies of 17 cities is maintained on a live spreadsheet. In December 2015, the campaign released a second report, a review of police union contracts in 81 cities, along with an associated campaign called \\"Check the Police\\" that seeks to mobilize activists to pursue changes in such contracts. The report examined ways in which union contracts delay interrogations, allow officer personnel files to be erased, disqualify complaints, and limit civilian oversight.\\"Police Union Contract Review.\\" Campaign Zero. Retrieved 2016-06-30. An actively updated database of contracts and analysis is maintained by the campaign online. In June 2016, the campaign continued its work on police union contracts with the release of its third report, \\"Police Union Contracts and Police Bill of Rights Analysis.\\"\\"Police Union Contracts and Police Bill of Rights Analysis.\\" Campaign Zero. Retrieved 2016-06-30. This report focused on use of force policies and evaluated protections in those policies for civilians.\\"Use of Force Policy Review.\\" Campaign Zero. Retrieved 2016-06-30. Reception Because many of the policies Campaign Zero recommends are already in place in some police departments, Slate contributor Ben Mathis-Lilley has said that with the launch of its site, Campaign Zero \\"is saying to mainstream politicians: Here are some products that have been sold before‚Äînow do your job.\\" Harold Pollack has stated that the document in which the campaign announced its proposals is \\"a very useful and professional document\\", and that certain proposals it made, such as increasing police diversity and reducing the use of monetary punishments to raise revenue, seemed \\"particularly smart.\\" On January 19, 2016, it was ranked as one of 20 tech insiders defining the 2016 United States presidential election by the staff of Wired. 8 Can't Wait project In June 2020, in response to the killing of George Floyd, Campaign Zero launched 8 Can't Wait, a database that tracks how eight policies to curtail police violence are employed in major cities. The eight policies are: #Ban chokeholds and strangleholds. #Require de-escalation. #Require a warning before shooting. #Require that all alternatives be exhausted before shooting. #Require officers to intervene when excessive force is being used. #Ban shooting at moving vehicles. #Establish a Force Continuum. #Require comprehensive reporting. A 2016 study by Campaign Zero found that only three of the eight policy recommendations were adopted by the average police department and that no law enforcement agency had adopted all eight. A number of celebrities have magnified the #8cantwait hashtag, including Oprah Winfrey and Ariana Grande. Since the project was announced, some cities have responded by enacting all eight policies or indicating that they will review their policies to embrace all eight. Only San Francisco, California and Tucson, Arizona were initially identified by Campaign Zero as implementing all eight policies. = Criticism = While 8 Can't Wait received initial, widespread praise on social media, the news, and within state government, the agenda began receiving skepticism from progressive groups, who criticized the policies as insufficient to tackle the deep, systemic problems of police brutality. Critics of 8 Can't Wait state that policing in America cannot be \\"reformed\\" and instead must be defunded. Critics also cite the instances of murder and violence by police officers in cities that have already passed some of the 8 Can't Wait measures. 8 to Abolition, a campaign for the abolition of prisons and police, was created as a direct criticism and response to 8 Can't Wait.

Widenmann (January 24, 1852 ‚Äì April 13, 1930) was a Deputy United States Marshal and associate of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War.  Early life  Widenmann was born January 24, 1852, to German-born parents in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Widenmann's father was the Bavarian Consul in Ann Arbor. As a teen-ager, Widenmann was sent back to the family‚Äôs native Germany for his schooling. He lived there for several years with a grandfather. Returning to America in 1871, Widenmann settled in New York City, where he remained for two years before drifting west, finally arriving in Lincoln in mid-February 1877. In New Mexico, he would be appointed Deputy Marshal by U.S. Marshal for New Mexico Territory John Sherman Jr.  Lincoln County War  On February 18, 1878, John Tunstall was killed by Murphy-Dolan gunmen William Morton, Frank Baker, Jesse Evans and Tom Hill. Tunstall had been accompanied by Robert Widenmann, Dick Brewer, Billy the Kid, John Middleton, Henry Newton Brown, and Fred Waite while herding horses from his ranch on the Rio Feliz to Lincoln. On February 20, 1878, Sheriff William J. Brady, and his deputies arrested Billy the Kid and two other men riding with him. Three days later, Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Widenmann, and a detachment of soldiers captured Sheriff Brady's jail guards, put them behind bars, and released the Kid and Brewer. On March 9, 1878, New Mexico territorial Governor, Samuel Beach Axtell, issued a proclamation revoking Rob's appointment as Deputy Marshall. On March 30, 1878, The Santa Fe New Mexican announced that U.S. Marshal John E. Sherman had reappointed Widenmann to the deputyship. On April 1, 1878, Regulators Jim French, Frank McNab, John Middleton, Fred Waite, Henry Newton Brown and Billy the Kid ambushed Sheriff William J. Brady and four of his deputies on the main street of Lincoln. They fired on the five men from behind an adobe wall on John Tunstall's property. Brady died of at least a dozen gunshot wounds. Deputy George W. Hindman was hit twice, fatally. Widenmann was present, but whether he participated was never ascertained: he claimed he was feeding Tunstall's dog at the time of the shooting. (When later asked at an inquiry why he was in possession of two pistols and a rifle, he replied that the dog was vicious). Both Billy the Kid and Deputy Marshal Widenmann were wanted by county law officials for their deaths. Deputy Marshal Widenmann turned himself into the military at Fort Stanton. On April 4, 1878, Lieut. Col. Nathan Dudley assumed control of Fort Stanton and immediately released Rob and three others in default of legal documents. On April 7, 1878, Rob and Marshal John E. Sherman Jr., arrested Jesse Evans, but within hours Dudley had procured warrants for Rob and seven others, who were now rearrested and held at the fort pending investigation in connection with the murder of Brady. Here they remained until 18 April, when a grand jury ordered the release of four, including Rob, and indicted the others. On May 2, 1878, Rob, Alexander McSween, and seven others were incarcerated, this time by Sheriff John Copeland on Dudley's orders, only to be released two days later on lack of evidence. On June 12, 1878, Rob left Lincoln for the last time, traveling under military escort to Mesilla, New Mexico to testify against Jesse Evans. This he did on 2 July. Toward the end of September or the first week of October 1878, Widenmann, fearing for his life, fled the territory making his way east to ship out for London.  Later life  Robert A. Widenmann's post- New Mexico career took him to Great Britain, where he visited Tunstall's family, and onto New York where in 1896 he was a National Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative from New York 17th District. He died in Haverstraw, N.Y. on April 13, 1930 at the age of 78. According to his daughter Elsie, Widenmann lived in fear of his life for many years because of his role in the Lincoln county war and in bucking such powerful New Mexico politicians as Stephen B. Elkins.

It focuses on Engine Company 50 of the Detroit Fire Department, and the city of Detroit as it faces an economic collapse and rising arson and fire rates. The film was executive produced by Denis Leary and Jim Serpico through their production company, Apostle, as well as Steve Tihanyi and Morgan Neville.  Synopsis  The film follows the firefighters of Engine Company 50 of the Detroit Fire Department over the course of a year as they struggle with the highest arson rate in the country, and a lack of funding from the City of Detroit as it approaches bankruptcy. It highlights 3 specific individuals involved with the Detroit Fire Department. Dave Parnell is a 33-year veteran firefighter, living in the same neighborhood as Engine 50. The film shows Parnell's last year on the job, approaching retirement as he turns 60 years old, and coming to terms with the death of his ailing, longtime wife, Gloria. He acts as the elder philosopher of the firehouse, spouting wisdom on life, firefighting, love, and the current state of Detroit. Brendan \\"Doogie\\" Milewski, is a straight-shooting, adventurous, 11-year firefighter who becomes paralyzed after a wall crashes down on him while fighting a fire. Newly married, Doogie must adjust to life outside of the fire department, and life as a paraplegic. After spending 30 years with the Los Angeles Fire Department, Detroit-native Don Austin is hired as Detroit Fire Department's new commissioner facing the task of rehabilitating and revitalizing the organization. He must lead the Department despite Detroit's financial crisis and the growing rate of arson in the city's abandoned buildings.  Development  Putnam and Sanchez began work on the film after learning about the November 2008 death of Walter Harris, a Detroit firefighter who was killed while fighting a blaze in a vacated home. Wondering why firefighters would risk their lives to save an abandoned building in a city that has 80,000 abandoned structures, Putnam and Sanchez began investigating the state of the Detroit Fire Department. They began shooting with Engine 50 in August 2009. Putnam and Sanchez started asking for corporate donors and taking tax- deductible online donations. General Motors made a donation in December 2010 to start filming while fundraising continued. Over the next 13 months, until January 2012, the film crew was embedded with the firefighters. With the exception of two of its Directors of Photography, BURN employed exclusively local crew. Denis Leary and Jim Serpico (\\"Rescue Me\\") joined as BURN's executive producers in 2011.  Release  The film premiered at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival where it won the Audience Award.  Distribution  Despite an overwhelmingly positive response at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival, the film was unable to secure a buyer for distribution. Putnam and Sanchez decided to self-distribute and release BURN by renting out movie theaters in 35 cities across the United States and embarking on a multi-city tour. These screenings were promoted as industry screenings, targeted at local firefighting companies. Distributor Area 23a began booking the film into AMC Theatres, though Putnam and Sanchez decided to continue self-distribution after seeing a large difference in profits between the AMC screenings and their own screenings. In Spring 2013, BURN played in 170 cities across the United States in four-walled screenings.  Reception  = Critical response = On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has a score of 100% based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 8 out of 10. The Washington Post called it \\"An emotional character study of a group of heroic, yet very human, individuals.\\"  Home media  BURN was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 18, 2013.

History The territory was created by decree of President Manuel Gonz√°lez Flores on 12 December 1884. Its first political leader was Leopoldo Romano. During the government of Flores, and that of his successor, Pablo Rocha y Port√∫ (1897-1904), there were great industrial and agrarian advances. Coffee was cultivated in the villages of Huicicila, El Malinal, El Llano, Mecat√°n, Jalcocot√°n and Cora; cotton, in Santiago Ixcuintla and Tuxpan, from where it was supplied to the factories of Jauja and Bellavista. Within the industrial sector, the sugar mills in Puga and La Escondida saw a great economic boost. The Tepic Cigar Factory was created, whose cigars and cigarettes were considered of first quality worldwide. Other cigar factories were El Tr√°fico and El Amigo del Pueblo. At the end of the government of Leopoldo Romano, workers' struggles began. In 1894, Francisca Quintero organized a work stoppage in the Bellavista textile factory. Two years later, there was a strike in Jauja, and in 1905, the Elias brothers led another in Bellavista. At the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, the population of Ixtl√°n del R√≠o was the first to rise up in arms, to the cry of ¬°Viva Madero! In 1911, General Martin Espinosa defeated the forces of the dictator Porfirio Diaz, entered Tepic on May 26 of that year, and was immediately appointed political chief, replacing Mariano Ruiz (1904-1911). After the coup d'√©tat led by Victoriano Huerta, Espinosa was overthrown, and huertista Jesus Lopez de Haro was appointed to replace him. Lopez resigned two months later in favor of fellow huertista, Agustin F. Migoni, who remained in power for five months and was succeeded by Domingo Servin, the last huertista political leader. That year, 1913, the troops of and Isaac Espinosa entered the territory. Servin was overthrown and the young Buelna was appointed. However, months later he was replaced by . In 1915, the conflict began between Villa and the constitutionalists. The discord reached this territory, Dozal was overthrown and replaced with general Juan Carrasco, who left power two months later, succeeded by Ernesto Damy, who in turn left power in the hands of General Juan Torres Sur (1915-1917). During the latter's administration there was no fighting and the country began to recover. In 1916, the first labor union was created. The tepicenses elected Juan Espinosa B√°vara, Crist√≥bal Lim√≥n, and Marcelino Cedano to the Constituent Congress of Quer√©taro, where the transformation of the Territory of Tepic into the Free and Sovereign State of Nayarit was decreed.

The society was founded in 1969 by three Muslim physicians and is known for then-President Barack Obama's visit on February 3, 2016. The society serves around 3,000 people. History Several Baltimore mosques may have helped in the founding of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, including Masjid Al-Haqq and Masjid As-Saffat, founded in 1947 and 1971, respectively, in which early members of the society attended. The Islamic Society of Baltimore was founded in 1969 by three Muslim physicians, one of whom was Mohamed Z. Awad, an Egyptian-born physician at Towson, Maryland. Awad co-founded the society due to Muslims' concerns to \\"maintain their religion for themselves and to pass on their Islamic heritage to their children in the face of strong pressures toward assimilation,\\" as reported by The Baltimore Sun in 1978. The society began with several families who met every Sunday at Shaffer Hall in the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University to pray, discuss scriptures, and study Arabic. The organization was registered in the state of Maryland on September 2, 1969. Efforts to raise funds for the construction of a mosque were made by the society as early as 1970, in the form of a fundraising bazaar. Bazaars to raise funds were also held in the years 1971 and 1972 on the campus of Johns Hopkins University. According to co-founder Mohamed Awad in 1978, the society consisted mostly of foreign-born Muslims from India, Pakistan, and Middle Eastern countries. By the end of the 1970s, the society served around one hundred families. The society purchased a lot on Johnnycake Road by the late 1970s, where Masjid Al- Rahmah was constructed from 1982‚Äì83. The mosque was built with a capacity of around 180 people, but held around 300 people during Friday prayers. In 1985, the society's mostly foreign-born membersip had around 475 families. In 1987, a gymnasium was built, and a full-time K‚Äì12 school, Al-Rahmah School, was established with 27 students in its first year. The campus also includes a housing complex. The Al-Rahmah Quran Academy was opened in 1999‚Äì2000 by Qari Muhammad Zahid, initially having one student. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 by the Islamist militant group Al-Qaeda, the Islamic Society of Baltimore condemned the attacks. On September 13, the leaders of nine Baltimore area mosques gathered at the mosque to discuss the events and how to help victims of the attacks. Police stationed officers to keep watch over the mosque at all hours. An open house was held at the society for the public on September 23, which was attended by Baltimore mayor and future Maryland governor Martin O'Malley. In the weeks following the attacks, no incidents of discrimination or harassment were reported at the mosque, according to imam Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh, although general secretary Abid Husain claimed that a woman had screamed profanities at the mosque shortly after the attacks occurred. In 2003, El-Sheikh, who had been an imam at the mosque from 1983‚Äì1989 and 1994‚Äì2003, left the mosque. In April and May 2015, the society received two threats from anonymous callers. The first call occurred on April 28 to the school facility, in which the caller asked the time at which the school closes, before reportedly saying, \\"It's the perfect time to bomb the bus.\\" The second call occurred on May 5, in which the caller threatened to \\"spill Muslim blood.\\" The Baltimore County Police Department does not believe either of the two threats are credible, although they improved security on the society's campus in response to it. =Barack Obama's visit= On December 12, 2015, the White House held three meetings with Muslim leaders to discuss concerns about rising hostility toward religious minorities. They pressed officials to consider then-president Barack Obama to visit a mosque, preferably with former president George W. Bush, which has been requested for years. On January 28, 2016, mosque officials were informed of a possible visit by Barack Obama, and plans for the visit to the mosque were made official and announced by the White House on January 30. White House officials stated that its purpose is \\"to celebrate the contributions Muslim Americans make to our nation and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom to our way of life,\\" which is likely related to the combat of Islamophobia. Barack Obama visited the mosque on February 3, 2016, marking his first presidential visit to a mosque in the United States. He held a round table discussion with Muslim community leaders and made a speech, in which he rejected political rhetoric and violence directed at Muslims, and talked about the role Islam has played in American history. Many have derided the visit, such as American Muslim and doctor Zuhdi Jasser, who said, \\"As a Muslim American I'm just insulted, this is disgraceful that this is one of the mosques ‚Äî or the mosque ‚Äî that [Obama has] chosen to visit\\", during an interview on Fox & Friends. Jasser described the mosque as radical, extreme, and not representative of modern Muslim Americans. =2018‚Äì2020 expansion= Construction in March 2020 County officials issued a mandate to remove the temporary classroom trailers, as there are too many on the campus. Around ten Al-Rahmah School classes are held in the trailers due to lack of space in the main building. The society developed plans for expansion from older proposed expansion layouts. The society was given permission by the county to start the expansion, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held in October 2018. The expansion plans to add a library, more classrooms, larger prayer areas for major events, and move the Al-Rahmah Quran Academy closer to the main building. The cost is estimated to be around $2 million and was projected to be completed by August 2019, coinciding with the society's 50th anniversary. The 50 Strong campaign celebrated both the society's 50th anniversary in 2019 and the expansion project. The society collected artifacts such as old photos and documents from its past, which was to be presented in a multimedia project on the society's anniversary. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Islamic Society of Baltimore cancelled all prayers and events, broadcasting programs and religious activities from its YouTube channel to reach people. Mosque officials formed an all-physician task force to recommend safety protocols. During Ramadan, the society distributed \\"Blessing Boxes\\", boxes containing flour, oil, rice, and other househould staples, to help Muslim families affected by COVID-19 break their fast. A drive-through was also set up for families to receive meals while socially distancing. Alongside 49 other local organizations, the Islamic Society of Baltimore received a grant of at least $3,000 from the Baltimore County COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund to promote public health. Controversies Following the announcement of Barack Obama's visit to the mosque in 2016, many conservative media outlets accused the organization of having \\"historic\\" and \\"deep\\" ties to extremism or radical Islam, including Fox News, The Washington Times, The Daily Caller, and Breitbart News. Many conservative outlets focused on Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh, a former longtime imam at the mosque. =Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh= While Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh was an imam at the mosque in 2004, he told The Washington Post, \\"If certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle.\\" The comment gained controversy with several media outlets, such as The Daily Caller, Fox News, and The Washington Times. ThinkProgress, however, commented that these \\"right-wing outlets omitted that fact that the quote was a specific reference to the uptick in violence between Israelis and Palestinians ‚Äî not Americans ‚Äî and that Sheikh immediately added that 'condemnation of indiscriminate killing of civilians' was widespread in his community.\\" El-Sheikh is also a former imam of the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Virginia. Anwar al-Awlaki, who was allegedly centrally involved in planning terrorist operations for Al-Qaeda, preached and made sermons at the mosque in 2001. Despite the statements made by news outlets, El-Sheikh \\"never delivered those sermons himself,\\" as noted by ThinkProgress. The mosque was also served by imam Mohammed al-Hanooti in the 1990s, who was \\"named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\\" El-Sheikh was a member and \\"leading figure\\" of the Muslim Brotherhood in Sudan before moving to the United States in 1978. However, as he told The Washington Post, he cut relations with the group in 1992. El-Sheikh was also a co-founder of the Muslim American Society, a group controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood. El-Sheikh was also a regional director for the Islamic American Relief Agency, whose parent organization has been cited by the U.S. Treasury Department for connections to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. =Other controversies= The Islamic Society of Baltimore is reportedly connected to the Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim organization \\"named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 2008 criminal prosecution in which several individuals were convicted of funneling money to the terrorist group Hamas,\\" according to The Washington Times. In 2011, Suleiman Anwar Bengharsa, a Muslim cleric, prison chaplain, and imam, gave a two-week course at the Islamic Society of Baltimore on the Islamic teachings of marriage. In the years leading up to 2016, however, he openly endorsed ISIS on Facebook, condemned American mosques as un-Islamic, declared that homosexual acts should be punishable by death, and criticized Muslims who assisted authorities in terrorism investigation. According to an FBI affidavit filed in federal court, in June 2015, he supplied $1,300 to Sebastian Gregerson in Detroit, who used it to expand his arsenal of firearms and grenades, although Bengharsa claimed it was intended for charity. Gregerson was arrested in July and indicted on explosive charges. The FBI suspected the two men of plotting terrorism. In a 2013 YouTube video, Yaseen Shaikh, an imam at the mosque and formerly in Plano, Texas, \\"characterized homosexuality as a psychological disorder that has no place in Islam or society,\\" and \\"lamented that gay rights groups have 'hijacked' political discourse,\\" which received negative feedback from news media such as The Daily Caller and The Washington Times.

It begins at B√ºlowsvej in Frederiksberg as the direct continuation of Rosen√∏rns All√©/Rolighedsvej and passes through Vanl√∏se before reaching Bellah√∏j in Br√∏nsh√∏j. A metro station on the Copenhagen Metro City Circle Line is located at Aksel M√∏llers Have. History Godth√•bsvej at present-day Gr√∏ndals All√©, 1890 It is unclear when Godth√•bsvej was built, but it is one of the oldest roads in the area. Associated with Ladeg√•rden, a farm established by Christian IV, although possibly much older, it was the first of several \\"royal roads\\" in the area. From 1664, it was referred to as \\"Den gamle Kongevej\\" (\\"The Old Royal Road\\") to distinguish it from New Royal Road (now Gammel Kongevej). It was for centuries also known as the Islevvejen (Islev Road) and later as Granddalsvej (Gr√∏ndal Road). From circa 1855, the outer part of the road became known as Godth√•bsvej after the country house Store Godthab, which had stood on the side of the road since 1770. The inner part of the street was renamed Rolighedsvej after Rolighed, another country house. The Classen Terraces in 1868 More houses began to appear along the inner (eastern) part of the road from the middle of the 19th century. The Classen Terraces were built for indigent workers by the Classenske Fideicommis in 1866-1880. Godth√•bsvej in 1899 Towards the end of the century many of the low, scattered buildings were replaced by taller blocks. Further out, west of Nordre Fasanvej, the only buildings along the street were a couple of factories and some allotments, which continued well into the 20th century. Notable buildings and residents Aksel M√∏llers Have (Godth√•bsvej 35-41) is a Modernist housing estate built in 1946 to design by Sigurd Tanggaard..

The 3-story apartment buildings Godth√•bshus, Gr√∏ndalshus and Fordreshus(Godth√•bsvej 182-208, R√∏nneb√¶rvej 2-12) were build in 1926‚Äì27 based on the design by Thorkild Henningsen og Karl Larsen. Thorkild Henningsen also designed the slightly younger terraced housing development Fuglebakken 1928‚Äì29. It consists of a total of 165 houses located on the streets Godth√•bsvej, Duevej, Fuglebakkevej, Drosselvej, Solsortevej, Vagtelvej and Egernvej. Gr√∏ndalshuset, on the corner with Sallingevej (No. 2‚Äì4) in Vanl√∏se, is a housing estate designed by Frits Schlegel in 1936.

The whole Summan area includes a population of more than 50,000 people, 80% of them Saudis, according to the 2011 census. They maintain an agricultural area with more than two thousand wheat farms, which ranks it first in Saudi Arabian wheat production. History The name Qaryat al-Ulya means upper village in Arabic. It was established on the location of a well which was traditionally used by nomadic Bedouin as a water source. During the rise to power of Ibn Saud, he created new villages by settling down nomads and indoctrinating them in the Wahabbi interpretation of Islam, calling them the Ikhwan. In 1920, as part of this program nomads from the Mutayr tribe founded the city of Qaryat al-Ulya, led by . The city occupied a strategic position along the pilgrimage route from Basra and Bahrain to Mecca. Because of its proximity to the Kuwaiti and Iraqi borders, Ibn Saud built a fortress there, under the supervision of Prince , who was governor of Al-Ahsa in 1935‚Äì36. After the 1920 Battle of Jahra, the poet Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen wrote in reference to the city: Ÿàÿ•ÿ∞ŸÉÿ± ŸÖÿ¢ÿ´ÿ± ŸÇŸàŸÖ ÿ¨ŸÑ ŸÇÿµÿØŸáŸÖ ÿ¨ŸáÿßÿØ ÿ£ŸáŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿØŸâ ŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿ®Ÿè ŸáŸÖ ÿ£ŸáŸÑ ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿ•ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜ ŸÑŸáŸÖ ŸÇÿØŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿµÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨Ÿâ ÿ®Ÿáÿß ŸÇÿ±ÿ®Ÿè Geography The city is located 350 km northeast of Riyadh, 280 km northwest of Dammam, and 150 km south of Kuwait‚ÄìSaudi Arabia border.

In 1988, Byrd died at age 92 in St. Louis, Missouri. Byrd requested that money be donated to a scholarship fund in lieu of a memorial service. Early life and education Byrd was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, in the United States on July 3, 1895. Her father Robert Byrd was a bricklayer who moved his family to Portland, Oregon when she was a youth. At the time African Americans were not allowed to own homes or even vote in Oregon. Byrd was the only student of her heritage in her Portland high school. In 1917, she was the first African American to enroll at the University of Oregon, where she decided to major in economics. When Byrd moved to Eugene for school she was not the first African American to live in the town, as there were a few African Americans living in poverty around Alton Baker Park. Although she was able to attend the University of Oregon, state and school policies still prevented her from being able to live in the campus dormitories due to her race. She was also not allowed to join a sorority. During her time at the university, she worked as a domestic servant in the home of history professor Joseph Schafer, while also living in the home. Two years after enrolling at the University of Oregon, she transferred to the University of Washington in 1919, and in 1921 she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Liberal Arts.  Early career  After graduating from the University of Washington in 1921, Byrd later moved back to Oregon where she became an English teacher for Portland's segregated Young Women's Christian Association. In her spare time, she served as the vice president of the local NAACP chapter. In 1923 the KKK in Eugene was extremely active, but that did not prevent sociologist and civil rights activist W.E.B Dubois from accepting an invitation from Byrd to speak on the campus of the University of Oregon, which led to Byrd and Dubois forming a close friendship. In the early days of the Harlem Renaissance, in the mid-1920s, Byrd moved to New York to train with the city's YWCA. Here she would also organize events for W.E.B. Du Bois and write for his NAACP journal, The Crisis. In 1926, Byrd and fellow UO alumni met with UO president Arnold Bennett Hall to create an alumni chapter for New York City. The Alumni agreed to continue to meet and would eventually become the UO Alumni Association's New York Ducks chapter. In 1927, Byrd received a Quaker scholarship to study settlement housing in England. This would be Byrd's first time traveling out of the country. To celebrate and honor Byrd, a farewell tea was held on Easter Sunday before she left. Among the 200 guests in attendance were Countee Cullen, Aaron Douglas, and Langston Hughes. Hughes even read poetry to Byrd, and the crowd. While abroad, she found a position at the International Labor Organization (ILO), connected to the League of Nations, in which she researched the status of African workers in Mandate regions. She did this inspired by another Oregonian woman, Esther Lovejoy, who had earlier directed the Portland Young Women's Christian Association African American branch. Byrd's work led her to speak at the ‚ÄòSixth Congress of the Women‚Äôs International League for Peace and Freedom‚Äô in ‚Äò29.  Civil rights activism She was an early activist in the civil rights movement, collaborating with national leaders like W. E. B. Du Bois. In 1929 Byrd began working as a research assistant in Fisk University ‚Äòs sociology department. In this position, Byrd researched the quality and quantity of educational opportunities for African Americans in the South. She later worked for economist Paul Douglas at the University of Chicago. Byrd was hired under Franklin Roosevelt's National Recovery Act to \\"observe possible exploitation of colored workers\\" during the implementation of minimum wage laws. On February 21st, 1934, Byrd was barred from the Senate restaurant. Byrd and her associates were attending hearings on the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynching bill. Upon entering the restaurant, the waitress informed them, \\"If that woman is colored, she can‚Äôt eat in here.\\" They were later escorted off the premises by the police. Senator Royal S. Copeland stated that she was not barred because of her race, but because there were no tables available. Byrd denied this version of events saying there were plenty of tables available. Accounts from the police recall Byrd acting in a tantrum shouting and cursing when being escorted out, while Byrd's associates say she acted completely reasonably, not cursing, simply stating no crime was committed. After the fact, Copeland declared that there would be a table set aside for African Americans. Over the next few weeks, it became clear that the restaurant was making excuses to not serve African Americans. Copeland admitted that the waitress had in fact barred Byrd and not fulfilled the promise of a separate table for African Americans. He continued to deny that the restaurant publicly barred African Americans. Byrd was the first African American woman to work for the National Recovery Administration. She was in charge of the application of new rules regarding both pay equality and fair working conditions. While in this job she faced public critique from a few news sources. Both the Washington Herald and the New York Daily News commented on her, but with very differing opinions. The Washington Herald said she was a \\"shrewd economist\\" while the New York Daily News said she was labeled an \\"efficient, able negro woman\\". After only a few months Byrd was asked to leave her position at the NRA because they did not feel it would be safe for an African American woman to do any work or establish any projects in the south. Despite all of the obstacles and hostile environments she had faced, it was decided she would not be able to keep herself safe and do her work. It was this that inspired her to join the Joint Committee for National Recovery. This committee was centered around investing possible hate crimes, such as lynchings, as well as unsafe working conditions. With what they found through these investigations the JCNR went before Congress and testified that despite the Roosevelt Administration's promises all people were not being treated with equality. In the mid-1920s, Byrd had become somewhat of an icon in the African American community. Byrd was still associated with New York's YWCA but became the president of the Alpha Beta Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority at Fisk University, where she also helped to organize a group of African American college students. Byrd was selected in 1927 to then travel to England where she studied settlement housing. As she was in Europe, she worked to establish herself further as an activist against racial issues. Working with the League of Nations, she got people together to form a rally to fight against racism in Prague during a speech, furthering her work as an activist. Not only was she an activist for the African American community, Byrd also fought for women's rights as she was a strong believer that women deserved to be treated equally to men. In 1929, Byrd returned to America and started working for Fisk University in the sociology department where she almost lost her job later on for accusing the president of the university of discrimination against black and white professors.

The district includes 68 buildings, 59 of which are considered contributing to its historic status; these buildings include warehouses and other industrial structures and were built from the 1880s through the 1920s. The buildings generally have utilitarian designs inspired by the Chicago school and are built with reinforced concrete frames and brick exteriors. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 2014. History Peoria became a significant industrial and shipping center in the late 19th century, and development boomed in the district due to its access to the Illinois River and the city's numerous rail lines. The industries present in the district reflected the city's economy as a whole and included brewing and distillery, the manufacture of farm implements, and iron and steel production. Revitalization In the 21st century, the warehouse district has undergone a revitalization, with some of the buildings being repurposed for residential, retail, and small business use. This work has been encouraged by the city government and by the private Downtown Development Corporation of Peoria. It has been financed in part by the creation of a tax increment financing district. Rhodell Brewery is a craft brewery and taproom that opened in 1998, a harbinger of both the warehouse district revitalization and the craft beer boom. In 2015 the brewery moved several blocks from its original location on Water Street to a new, larger location in the Murray Building on Walnut Street.

This vessel should not be confused with the later sternwheeler Albany (ex N.S. Bentley), which ran, also on the Willamette River, from 1896 to 1906, when it was rebuilt and renamed Georgie Burton. Construction Albany was built in 1868 at Canemah, Oregon for the People's Transportation Company. Shipbuilder G.M. Stickler (b.1836) assisted in the construction of the Albany, as he had with other steamers, Dayton, Success, McMinnville, and Senator. Albany was built at the same time as the Success. Albany was reported to be a \\"very light draft steamer.\\" Design Albany was long exclusive of the extension over the main deck, called the \\"fantail\\", on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The steamer had a beam (width) of , exclusive of the long protective timbers installed on the sides of the boat at the top of the hull, called the guards. The depth of hold was . The official merchant vessel registry number was 1738. Engineering Albany was driven by a stern-wheel, turned by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of . The overall size of the vessel was 328 gross tons, which was a measure of volume, and not weight. Operations Advertisement dated Sept. 1, 1868, for steamers of the People's Transportation Company, including the then new Albany. =Officers= After completion, Albany was piloted by Capt. Aaron Vickers (d.1875) and, for a short time, by Capt. James D. Miller. George A. Pease is also reported to have been one of the steamer's first captains. Most of the time Albany was operated by captains Aaron Vickers and George Jerome. =Initial routes= Albany was in operation by August 1868, running from Oregon City to Salem, Oregon. During one trip in August, the low water period on the Willamette, a reporter on board wrote later that the steamer \\"actually navigated some parts like wet gravel. We have specimen stones thrown out of the bed of the river by her wheel, in our office.\\" On September 1, 1868 the People's Transportation Company placed Albany on a schedule of running from Oregon City to Salem Oregon three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. A connection was made at Oregon City with either of the sternwheelers Senator or Alert running daily (Sunday excepted) from Portland. =Low water impedes navigation= Just after Albany was placed in service, in early September 1868, very low water in the Willamette River made it difficult for it and two other two boats then operating on the upper river, Success and Echo to make a connection between Canemah and Salem, Oregon. The Morning Oregonian said at the time: \\"The boats are all that could be desired, and the boatmen skillful and very energetic, but they can't run on dry land.\\" On Monday, June 27, 1870, Albany called at Eugene, Oregon with a load of freight. This was considered very late in the season for a steamer to reach Eugene. =Heavy load of wool= On the Monday before June 23, 1871, Albany came downriver to the city of Albany, Oregon \\"loaded to the guards with wool.\\" According to the Eugene Guard, on Albany's last call at Eugene prior to June 30, 1871, the steamer loaded 361 bales of wool, weighing a total of 59,311 pounds, or approximately 30 tons. =Sale to Ben Holladay= On September 6, 1871, by vote of its shareholders, the People's Transportation Company was dissolved and all of its assets, including the steamer Albany, were sold to a company organized by the prominent businessman Ben Holladay. =Later operations= Alice (right), at boat basin in Oregon City, Oregon, circa 1874. At the end of July 1871, steamboat business had fallen off. The sternwheeler Fannie Patton, which had been running from Oregon City to Salem, was taken out of service, with the Albany taking its place. Shoo Fly would take Albany's place on the run from Salem to Corvallis, Oregon. The small amount of downriver freight was said to have been caused by the high prices for wheat and wool in the spring of the year, which brought those commodities into the market, leaving not much left in the countryside to ship. Upriver freight however was reported to have been good for season. In mid-February 1874, Albany hit a snag near Harrisburg, Oregon, and sustained three small holes in the hull. Most of the cargo was taken off by Success, and Albany proceeded downriver. The damage was thought to have been light. In March 1874, Albany departed once a week from Oregon City for Harrisburg, Eugene, and all intermediate points. Albany was then owned by the Oregon Steamship Company, which also ran other steamers on the upper Willamette from Oregon City: Alice to Corvallis twice a week, Dayton, to the cities of Dayton, Lafayette, and McMinnville, all on the Yamhill River, and Fannie Patton, to Albany, twice a week. All these steamers made a connection at the boat basin in Oregon City with the steamer E.N. Cooke, which made daily runs on the upper Willamette, below Willamette Falls, departing Oregon City for Portland daily (except Sundays) at 7:30 a.m., and leaving Portland at 2:00 p.m. on the return trip to Oregon City. John D. Biles was the agent for all of them. Sunk near Long Tom River Albany was wrecked on January 6, 1875 at the mouth of the Long Tom River, and abandoned as a total loss. The steamer had been proceeding up the Willamette River, with no cargo on board, and had just passed the confluence of the Long Tom, when it hit a snag. The initial report was that the captain managed to beach the steamer before it filled with water, the damage was small, and readily reparable. When news of the incident reached, Oregon City, the sternwheeler Success was dispatched to go to the assistance of the Albany. However the initial reports were incorrect, and it was not feasible to repair Albany. In mid-January 1875, the boilers and machinery of Albany were salvaged and brought downriver to Portland by Success. The Oregon Steamship Company intended to install the machinery into one of two new shallow-draft freight steamers it was planning on building, in the middle of March, 1875, for the upper Willamette trade. The machinery from Alert would go into the other planned new sternwheeler. Captain Aaron Vickers, who was in charge of Albany at the time of the wreck, died at Oregon City on February 13, 1875, reportedly from the effects of exposure at the time of the sinking.

It is a shrub or small tree found in Western Australia and South Australia and has narrow leaves with a hooked end, and white or cream-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila interstans is sometimes a broom-like shrub growing to a height of with many branches arising from near ground level, and sometimes a rounded shrub to small tree sometimes growing to a height of . It branches point upwards and are rough and wrinkled. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are linear in shape, long and wide, rough and sometimes covered with resin. The flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 4 on flattened, sticky stalks long. There are 5 cream-coloured, mostly glabrous, sticky, narrow elliptic to lance-shaped sepals which are long which sometimes have a reddish tinge. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white or cream-coloured, rarely lilac-coloured. Both the inside and outside of the tube and petal lobes are hairy although the hairs are of different kinds. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to December, varying with subspecies and is followed by oval-shaped fruits which have crusty covering and are long.Widgiemooltha Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1899 by Spencer Le Marchant Moore who gave it the name Pholidia interstans. The description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. In 1904, Ludwig Diels and Ernst Georg Pritzel changed the name to Eremophila interstans. When Moore described the species, he noted that it seemed to be intermediate between the two genera Eremophila and Pholidia recognised at the time. He therefore gave the specific epithet interstans, derived from the Latin words inter meaning \\"between\\" and stans \\"standing\\". Two subspecies are recognized in the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila interstans (S.Moore) Diels subsp. interstans which is a shrub or small tree with leaves spreading at an angle to the branches, and cream-coloured flowers appearing between August and early October; *Eremophila interstans subsp. virgata (W.Fitzg.) Chinnock which is a broom-shaped shrub with leaves often held against the branches by resin, and white flowers appearing between October and December. (Subspecies virgata was originally described by William Vincent Fitzgerald as Eremophila virgata.) Distribution and habitat Eremophila interstans subsp. interstans is common and widespread in red sand, sandy loam or clay between Balladonia and Southern Cross in the Coolgardie and Murchison biogeographic regions. There is also a disjunct population on the Uno Range of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. Subspecies virgata grows in clay or sandy loam between Norseman and Menzies in the Coolgardie and Murchison biogeographic regions. Conservation status Both subspecies of E. interstans are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has a soft habit and a massed display of cream-coloured or lilac flowers in spring making it an attractive feature plant. It is a large shrub, sometimes a small tree, fast growing and useful as a windbreak, although it should be planted where it has room to grow. It can be propagated from cuttings from a young specimen or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. It will grow in most soils, including heavy clay, in either full sun or a partially shaded site and is both drought and frost tolerant.

The Uniform Law creates a common legal services market across NSW and Victoria, encompassing almost three-quarters of Australia‚Äôs lawyers. The scheme aims to harmonize regulatory obligations while retaining local performance of regulatory functions. The Uniform Law regulates the legal profession across the two jurisdictions, governing matters such as practicing certificate types and conditions, maintaining and auditing of trust accounts, continuing professional development requirements, complaints-handling processes, billing arrangements, and professional discipline issues. The Uniform Law creates two bodies: The Legal Services Council, and the Commissioner for Uniform Legal Services Regulation, who also acts as CEO of the Legal Services Council. Together, these bodies set policy framework for the new scheme, and refine the way it operates by issuing guidelines and directives for the sake of consistency; making regulations; and advising Attorneys General on any potential amendments.

Background The event was initially announced as a Fight Night event with a middleweight bout between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Vitor Belfort and former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion Ronaldo Souza scheduled to serve as headliner. However, it was reported by Brazilian media that this event would become UFC 198 following a series of events in January 2016 that led to the originally planned UFC 196 becoming a UFC Fight Night following a series of cancellations. On March 4, it was confirmed that the event was indeed changed to PPV and it would be headlined by a UFC Heavyweight Championship bout between champion Fabr√≠cio Werdum and top contender Stipe Miocic. They were briefly scheduled to meet at the original UFC 196, as Miocic replaced former two-time champion Cain Velasquez. In turn, Werdum announced on the following day that he was pulling out of the event due to injury as well as he wasn't comfortable with the opponent change while dealing with injuries of his own. The event was the first that the promotion hosted in Curitiba. It was the fourth stadium venue to host a UFC event after UFC 129 at the Rogers Centre in Canada, UFC on Fox: Gustafsson vs. Johnson at the Tele2 Arena in Sweden and UFC 193 at the Etihad Stadium in Australia. A lightweight bout between Evan Dunham and The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 2 winner Leonardo Santos, originally scheduled for this event, was moved to UFC 199 after a minor injury to Dunham delayed the matchup a few weeks. The event featured the long anticipated debut of Curitiba native Cris Cyborg, former Strikeforce Women's Featherweight Champion and current Invicta FC Featherweight Champion, in a catchweight bout of 140 lb against Leslie Smith. Kamaru Usman was expected to face S√©rgio Moraes at the event. However, he pulled out two weeks before the event due to injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Luan Chagas. Former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva was expected to face Uriah Hall at the event. However, Silva pulled out just four days before the event with a clinical condition that indicated acute cholecystitis and required surgical intervention. The UFC wanted to find a replacement for him, but Hall opted against that. During the main card broadcast, the UFC announced that former interim UFC Heavyweight Champion and Pride Heavyweight Champion Ant√¥nio Rodrigo Nogueira will be inducted to the UFC's Hall of Fame at the \\"International Fight Week\\" in July, one day after UFC 200.

Hoax It has been reported as a hoax, with modern metallurgical and other analysis showing that a 28 gram specimen collected by Evans was actually part of the Imilac Chilean meteorite of 1822 and probably acquired by him in Panama on his return to the United States East Coast. The mountain of Evans' claimed find has been tentatively identified as Johnson Mountain from Evans' reports and field notes; surveys of the area with sensitive proton magnetometers in the 1980s failed to show evidence of a nickel-rich meteorite there.

This vessel should not be confused with the similar sternwheeler Onward built in 1858 at Canemah, Oregon and dismantled in 1865. Construction In June 1867, the People's Transportation Company was preparing to build a new steamer at Colfax, on the Tualatin River at about river mile 6, to run to Forest Grove. The planned steamer would have a keel length of 95 feet, 18 feet beam, and 4 foot, 4 inch depth of hold. The new steamer was reported to be based on the design of the existing steamer Senator. This appears to have been the steamer Onward reported in another source to have been built in 1867 at a place called Tualatin Landing by C.F. Kent and John Colman for Joseph Kellogg. Dimensions Onward was long, exclusive of the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the ‚Äúfantail‚Äù on which the sternwheel was mounted. The beam (width) of the vessel was . The depth of hold was . The gross tonnage (a measure of volume and not weight) of the steamer was 155 gross tons and 81 registered tons. The official United States merchant vessel registry number was 19274. Engineering Onward was driven by a stern-wheel, turned by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of . Operations Abigail Scott Duniway travelled on the Onward in August 1874, and described the operation of the vessel in her newspaper The New Northwest: =Tualatin River route= The Tualatin River flows into the Willamette River a few miles south of Oregon City. In its natural state, from the mouth of the Tualatin upstream for distance, there was a stretch of rapids with a fall of about 50 feet. From the head of the rapids however shallow draft boats could run up the river to a point about 12 miles upriver from Hillsboro, Oregon. The river was slow moving with many bends. Near the Tualatin at its lower end was Sucker Lake, as Oswego Lake was then known. Sucker Lake at its nearest was about one mile distant from the Tualatin River. A tramway had been built between Sucker Lake and the Tualatin River, which carried heavier freight between the two bodies of water. In February 1869, there were the following landings on the Tualatin River: Farmington Landing, Harris‚Äôs Landing, Hillsboro, Centerville, and Forest Grove. =Sucker Lake and Tualatin River service= As of May 2, 1868, Onward was running regular trips on the Tualatin between Hillboro and Colfax. Onward operated with a crew entirely from the Kellogg family: Charles Kellogg, master; Elijah Kellogg, engineer; Orrin Kellogg, purser. According to other reports, Captain Ed. Kellogg was in charge of Onward, while Elisha Kellogg was the engineer and Orrin Kellogg (b.1845) was general superintendent and purser. At Colfax, a connection was made with the tramway belonging to the milling company, which ran to the eastern side of Sucker Lake, where another connection was made with a steamer owned by the same company running on the lake. This steamer then ran across the lake to Oswego, located on a portage between the lake and the Willamette River. The cargo was then unloaded from the steamer, then hauled by team down the portage to the Willamette River, where the cargo would be picked up by a steamer of the People‚Äôs Transportation Company. Although the trip required cargo to be handled 10 times, it was still considered superior, in 1868, to hauling over the hilly divide between Portland and the Tualatin plains. Forest Grove run In the week before December 19, 1868, the steamer Onward was able to proceed from Colfax up the Tualatin River to Forest Grove and back. Although the water was very low, and navigation was difficult, it was expected to become easier soon, and another run was planned for Saturday, December 26, 1868. Reportedly a large amount of grain had been accumulated at points along the river, waiting for higher water so it could be shipped. In January 1869, the people of Centreville, Oregon were raising money by subscription for the purpose of clearing out Dairy Creek, near Hillsboro, Oregon, to make it navigable for the Onward. In December 1872, Onward was reported to be ‚Äúslowly working her way up the Tualatin river.‚Äù A large amount of wheat had been harvested, and was being stored at Hillsboro, waiting for the rains to come to raise the river‚Äôs water level to allow steamer navigation. In 1873, after a canal was completed between the Tualatin river and the eastern end of Sucker Lake, Onward operated on both bodies of water until 1874, when the steamer was brought overland to the Willamette through the portage at Oswego. =Sale of Onward= On March 18, 1874, James D. Miller and C.P. Church purchased Onward, which was then lying in the Tualatin river about 4 miles upriver from the diversion dam built for Moore‚Äôs Mill. Miller intended to use Onward on the run on the Columbia to the Cascades, but the steamer turned out not to have enough power. The steamer had also been sold at about the same time for $2,000, which was reported to be ‚Äúnot the value of her machinery.‚Äù =Transfer to Willamette= On April 10, 1874, it was reported that the week before, three young men who had been hired by Capt. Sebastian ‚ÄúBas‚Äù Miller to help bring the Onward out of the Tualatin, had nearly drowned when their skiff encountered a line stretched across the Tualatin, which caught their boat and capsized it. The men managed to reach a log, which they held onto until 9:00 a.m. the next day, when they were rescued by Captain Milled. On April 18, 1874, the Onward was reported to have been transferred from the Tualatin River to the Willamette River. The steamer was also said to have been ‚Äútransported‚Äù from the Tualatin to the Willamette. According to later testimony of James D. Miller, the new owner, he had brought Onward down to the Willamette through the unnavigable rapids at the mouth of the Tualatin through the use of a coffer dam. =Lewis River operations= In August 1874, Onward was running a route between Portland and the Lewis River. The steamer is also reported to have been running from Portland, to Cathlamet, W.T. Onward is reported to have passed into the control of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company in 1875, with the O.S.N. having subsequently worn the steamer out. While there is a report that Onward was transferred to the Umpqua River in 1875, this appears to be an error. On the Sunday before December 14, 1877, while Onward, laden with groceries, hay and other cargo, was returning from the Cowlitz River, the steamer struck a snag at the month of Blind Slough, and sank in 12 feet of water. Disposition On January 26, 1879 it was reported that the engines from the steamer Onward had been sold to be installed into a new steamer to be built for traffic between The Dalles and the head of the Cascades Rapids, on the Columbia River.

He created linocuts, woodcuts and etchings. Chestar Njadu was also his son. Biography Wok of Mufangejo Muafangejo came from the people of Kwanyama (Kuanjama), who inhabit the northern parts of Ovamboland. As a child, he tended cattle barefoot. 1955 his father died, leaving his mother, who was one of eight wives, with no assets. His mother converted to Christianity and moved in 1956 to the Anglican mission station in Epinga which lay south of the border in Namibia. In 1957 John followed her there and attended the local missionary school. At twenty Muafangejo moved to the Holy Cross School of Mission in Onamunhama, then to the St Mary's School in Odibo. He stayed there until 1967. An American missionary named C. S. Mallory supported his artistic talent and helped him with the application to the Arts and Craft Centre of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rorke's Drift, Natal in South Africa. The Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre was founded in 1962 by the Swedish couple Ulla and Peder Gowenius and played a significant role in the development of South African art in the second half of the 20th century. Here Muafangejo came into contact with different artistic techniques, such as the weaving, woodcarving, painting and pottery. One of his teachers was Azaria Mbatha (b. 1941). He distinguished himself particularly in etching and linocut. In 1968 he suffered a nervous breakdown and was in treatment in the Madadeni Hospital in Newcastle due to a severe depression. After his release he acquired a degree from Rorke's Drift in 1969. From 1970 to the end of 1974 he worked as an art teacher at the mission school in Odibo. In 1974 he was awarded the Artist-in-residence scholarship in Rorke's Drift. In 1975 he returned to Odibo, and in 1977 moved to Windhoek. During 1986‚Äì1987 he built a house in the suburb of Katutura.South African History Online He died suddenly of a heart attack on 27 November 1987. Works John Muafangejo was considered the most important visual artist of his country. His linocuts are powerful depictions of people and events, expressed in black and white imagery, condensing the colourful landscapes and animal images of Namibia's artists of European origin. He often combines text with images, and his images contain references to the history and culture of the ovaKwanyama. He did not live to see the independence of Namibia, but the violent struggle for it formed the background for his art.Anene Ejikeme: Culture and customs of Namibia.
