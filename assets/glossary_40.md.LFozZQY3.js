It was published quarterly in October, January and April. One issue each year was dedicated to an emerging metropolis for contemporary art. Parachute was concerned primarily with the visual arts and museology. The magazine occasionally devoted articles to other art forms when they transcended their conventional boundaries and provoked theoretical debates. The last issue, No.125, appeared in 2009 when decreasing funding levels made it impossible to continue operation. Parachute was founded by Ren√© Blouin and Chantal Pontbriand, who met at V√©hicule, one of the first artist- run centres in Canada, (together with A Space and the Western Front) and the Research Group in Arts Administration. Pontbriand was writing for Artscanada and Vie des Arts :fr:Vie des arts, the only two art magazines in Canada at that time. Funding for the first issue was provided by V√©hicule. Blouin was replaced by France Morin. Initially, funding was provided by the Canada Council and the Ministry of Culture of Quebec, before the Quebec Arts Council was formed, lastly the City of Montreal, which has its own arts council, provided funding.  First fifteen years Early issues were printed in black and white, letter-sized. The first issue contained an article by Irwin and Myrna Gopnik about John Heward. The fourth issue was published in collaboration with Joseph Beuys. The board consisted of Melvin Charney, Robert Graham, and Raymond Gervais. Anne Ramsden served as an associate editor for Parachute magazine from 1980 to 1982. 2000s  A new, smaller book format was introduced in 2000. Until then, Parachute had been published in black and white and in a large, staple bound magazine format 22.5 x 30.5 cm. A number of thematic issues weer published, three in \\"community\\", and others on \\"resistance,\\" \\"democracy,\\" \\"violence,\\" and \\"economies\\". Parachute also concerned itself with emerging art centres. The first ‚ÄúCity‚Äù issue was Mexico City with Cuauht√©moc Medina as guest editor, then Beirut (2002), Shanghai, S√£o Paulo, and Havana. Parachute participated in Documenta 12 magazines, a project of the 12th edition (2007) of the documenta exhibition. The magazine was supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu√©bec Increased postal rates in 2000 contributed to the financial difficulties, as did quotas for local content (increased scrutiny by funding organizations into how much local content was in the magazine versus foreign content). The board of directors consisted of Jean-Pierre Gr√©my (chairman), Chantal Pontbriand (president), Colette Tougas (treasurer), Mary Ann Ferguson, Paul Fraser, Robert Hackett, Johanne Lamoureux and R√©jean Legault. =Publications= References Category:Contemporary art magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in Canada Category:Magazines established in 1975 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2009 Category:Magazines published in Montreal Category:Quarterly magazines published in Canada Category:Visual arts magazines published in Canada Category:Bilingual magazines Category:French-language magazines published in Canada ","title":"Parachute (magazine)"},{"id":"49377091","text":"Owen Briscoe (19 November 1920 - 3 March 1992) was a British trade unionist.

He worked as cabinet head at the Labor and Social Protection Ministry (1934-1942); translator, editor and press secretary at the Press Directorate (1944-1949); editor at Agerpres (1949-1950); and proofreader at the State Publishing House for Literature and Art (1951-1956). Vesper's published debut took the form of poems that appeared in his high school magazine in 1924. His early poetry situated him within the Iconar group of Bukovina poets, who advocated metaphysical verses in an avant-garde style. His work appeared in Mircea Streinul's 1938 anthology Poe»õi tineri bucovineni. He published volumes of poetry (Echinox √Æn odƒÉjdii, 1933; Constela»õii, 1935; Poeme de Nord, 1937; Izvoare, 1942; Poezii, 1968; Ascult√¢nd nop»õile, 1972; Al treilea orizont, 1979), historical fiction (Via»õa lui Mihai Viteazul, 1939; Chipuri domne»ôti, 1944) and novels (PrimƒÉvara √Æn »õara fagilor, 1938; Glasul, 1957). His translations included Russian tales, Vasily Belov, the Kalevala and Louis H√©mon. Aside from his hermetic poems and those which display a somewhat affected messianism, Vesper's poetry, innately romantic, is undoubtedly valuable. It reflects an authentic experience of awe in the face of death and its projection into a fabulous realm.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol. II, p. 804.

Wechter started the first baize manufactory of Turku and was co-founder of the local shipbuilding industry together with his business partner Henric Rungeen. Wechter became one of the richest merchants of the city. Wechter took part in the Diet of Sweden for three times in 1734‚Äì1743 representing the estate of bourgeoisie. He was also involved local politics starting from the 1730s; between 1741 and 1769 he was a councillor. For the end of his political career Wechter was passive and embittered. By time he also lost most of his property.  Early years  Wechter was born in Turku, Southwest Finland. His parents were merchant, mayor Henric Wechter and Anna n√©e Simolenia. The Wechters were an old Turku bourgeois family. The city fell under Russian occupation during the great wrath in 1713 and the family could not escape. Henric Wechter hide a part of his large property and could not manage to tell the location of the treasure before his death. The cache was found at academy construction site as late as in 1802, when Esaias Wechter had already passed away.  Industrial career  Soon after the end of the Great Northern War in 1723 Esaias Wechter got bourgeois rights. He became shipowner and did foreign trade. Although Turku was a poor city back then, Wechter's business ran well. In 1726 he married Catharina Schele, which further advanced his financial situation. in 1730 he was the second richest bourgeois of Turku after Henric Rungeen. In the 1730s Wechter was involved in developing many industrial companies. In 1732 Wechter and Rungeen founded a small shipyard to east side of River Aura, next to Korppolaism√§ki. At first the yard repaired ships of the local merchants. Shipbuilding began in 1737, and the owners recruited English-born master shipbuilder Robert Fithie to lead the operations. The yard built at least three large ships during 1738‚Äì1741. This was the beginning of industrial shipbuilding in Turku and led later to development of Turku Old Shipyard. In 1738 Wechter and few other bourgeois rented the Teijo iron mill. Wechter and Rungeen founded a baize manufactory in Turku in 1738. They applied for privileges, and in 1739 they were awarded a ten-year-long exclusive right to baize production, and a certain part of the production was sold to military stationed in Finland. The co-operation with Rungeen ended in the same year due to political dissensions and Wechter owned the manufactory alone thereafter. The production started first in temporary facilities and was moved in 1742 to two complexes on west side of Aura river. The machinery consisted of four looms. A fulling facility was built at a mill in Littoinen and the cloth was dyed in another facility owned by Wechter. Soon the number of personnel reached 60. The bottleneck in production was availability of yarn. A new facility for yarn spinning was started in a new penitentiary founded in 1738. Wechter was the facility manager in 1738‚Äì1750. The employees were some dozen women who were vagrants or convicted for crimes. The conditions of the workers were inhumane; one week's amount of food was enough for just two days and the women suffered of coldness and maltreatment by guards. Reportedly, three women killed their infants to get a death penalty. Due to the extremely poor conditions productivity remained low, which frustrated Wechter. When Sweden went to war against Russia and the Russian troops advanced towards Turku in 1743, Wechter dismounted the looms, brought them to Stockholm and continued the operations in temporary facilities. The shipyard was closed shortly before arrival of the Russian army; the last ship produced transported refugees to Stockholm. Wechter transported the machinery back to Turku after the war and Russian withdrawal. The business ran well and the company got its first competitor as late as in 1756. But Wechter had funded the business by beneficial public loans, which he eventually could not pay back. The situation was further worsened during recession in the 1760s. Due to financial problems caused by the manufactory and other businesses, Wechter had to sell the operations to Joseph Bremer in 1770.  Political career  = Diet of Sweden = Wechter was selected to represent the bourgeoisie in the Swedish Diet for the first time in 1734. He got directly into the political core, as he was set to the Secret Committee. In the committee Wechter supported the Caps' party and Arvid Horn. He was selected for the second time to the Diet and Secret Committee in 1738‚Äì1739. In the committee he resisted the plan of the Hats to start a war against Russia. He also participated in discussions about requirement of Finnish language knowledge for officials serving in Finland. Supporters of Wechter wanted to send him to the Diet of 1740, but the governor denied the plan. Wechter participated in the 1742 Diet during his exile in Stockholm. He reached for participating in the 1746 Diet but lost the elections. The craftsmen of Turku selected Wechter to represent them in the Diet but his attorney letter was denied in Stockholm. = Local politics = Wechter was a difficult person to get along with; he was eager to criticise others and his property decreased by time. One reason for this was his large family. He lost his supporters among bourgeois during the 1740s but gathered popularity among craftsmen. Since the 1730s Wechter was the chairman of the city elders and in 1741 he became councillor. In 1745 he sought to mayor position, but lost against Anders Roos. Wechter could not swallow his defeat. Following the election, he neglected his role as councillor. He still held the post until 1769.

Description The name Lilaea appears for the first time in Homer's Iliad (in the Catalogue of Ships) as one of the nine Phocian towns which had participated at the Trojan War. Lilaea was named after the Naiad Lilaea, the daughter of the river-god Cephissus, since the city itself was situated close to the sources of the river. A sanctuary dedicated to Artemis and another one, dedicated to the deified river stood there in antiquity. The inhabitants of Lilaea believed that the water of Castalian spring in Delphi was a gift of Cephissus, so some days in the year they threw sweets in the river, thinking that they would surface in Castalia. History The broader region of Lilaea had been inhabited since the 3rd millennium BCE. Herodotus does not mention it among the Phocian cities which had been destroyed by the Persians, possibly because in those days it was attached to Doris, which made its submission to Xerxes I, or because it was so well fortified that the Persians never subdued it. Based upon numismatic and epigraphic evidence, the latter appears the more likely. The city is also mentioned by Strabo, Pausanias, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder, and Stephanus of Byzantium. Lilaea was destroyed during the Third Sacred War by Philip II of Macedon in 346 BCE, but it was rebuilt during the following years in the course of the project for the reconstruction of the Phocian citadels. It was besieged by Philip V of Macedon and the city had to accept that a Macedonian garrison but soon after an uprising, led by Patron, managed to defeat the Macedonians and they withdrew after the formalization of a pact. Description When Pausanias visited Lilaea, in the second century, he reported seeing a theatre, an agora, and baths, with temples of Apollo and Artemis, containing statues of Athenian workmanship and of Pentelic marble., 10.33.4-5, 10.3.1, 10.8.10. Archaeology Lilaea is located near the modern namesake village of Lilaia. Its walls and gates are to the east of the modern settlement. Among the visible antiquities of the region count the architectural members by the springs of Agia Eleoussa, where a fountain and the temple of Cephissus lay, as well as the early Byzantine remains of a basilica dedicated to St. Christopher. Another Byzantine church, dated to the 10th-11th century was dedicated to St. Eleoussa. The fortification of the city is evident on the hill \\"Pyrgos\\" or \\"Palaeokastro\\".

Construction was aborted in the mid-1990s when the developer ran out of money, leaving the hulking hotel building sitting abandoned for two decades until it was demolished in 2016. History The Sea Spa Nova Scotia, as it was called when first marketed in 1990, was privately financed by German siblings Brigitta Hennig and Wolfgang Spiegelhauer of the construction company Suwobau. The two stated that they were \\"deeply impressed by the beauty of the land\\" and conceived the 131-room, five-storey, 175,500-square-foot luxury resort to be developed at an estimated cost of C$37.5 million on a site of more than 120 hectares. They predicted that Europeans would flock to the hotel to enjoy a range of stress-relieving activities including seashore walks, body-building, underwater massage, electrical therapy, and electro-galvanic and carbon-dioxide baths. The hotel was to feature an indoor saltwater pool, special air-filtration systems, and the use of non-toxic construction materials. The project received $10,000 from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to assist in marketing. The spa was a welcome development in an area hit by the decline of the fishing industry, and was expected to employ up to 200 people. Construction began in 1992. In 1994, after the hotel structure was substantially complete and weather-tight, the developers ran out of money and couldn't secure additional financing after sinking more than $20 million into the project. One of their partners had dropped out of the project, and the value of their assets in Germany had reportedly depreciated following the reunification of that country. The collapse of the project left many contractors unpaid, putting some smaller companies out of business. In late 1996 creditors forced a foreclosure sale to two Halifax developers, Jim Spatz and George Armoyan, for a mere $505,759. Spatz and Armoyan tried for years, to no avail, to resell the development to a hotel company. In a 2015 interview, Spatz stated that as the building aged they felt it became less and less likely that it would ever be completed, so they decided to demolish it. Demolition began in late 2015. The site will be subdivided into private residential lots.

It has the dimensions of volts. The usual symbol for magnetic current is k which is analogous to i for electric current. Magnetic currents produce an electric field analogously to the production of a magnetic field by electric currents. Magnetic current density, which has the units of V/m¬≤ (volts per square meter), is usually represented by the symbols \\\\mathfrak{M}^t and \\\\mathfrak{M}^i. The superscripts indicate total and impressed magnetic current density. The impressed currents are the energy sources. In many useful cases, a distribution of electric charge can be mathematically replaced by an equivalent distribution of magnetic current. This artifice can be used to simplify some electromagnetic field problems. It is possible to use both electric current densities and magnetic current densities in the same analysis. Magnetic current (flowing magnetic monopoles), M, creates an electric field, E, in accordance with the left-hand rule. The direction of the electric field produced by magnetic currents is determined by the left-hand rule (opposite direction as determined by the right-hand rule) as evidenced by the negative sign in the equation : abla \\\\times \\\\mathcal{E} = -\\\\mathfrak{M}^t . Magnetic displacement current Magnetic displacement current or more properly the magnetic displacement current density is the familiar term It is one component of \\\\mathfrak{M}^\\\\mathfrak{t}. : \\\\mathfrak{M}^t = \\\\frac {\\\\partial B} {\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathfrak{M}^i . where : \\\\mathfrak{M}^\\\\mathfrak{t} = total magnetic current. : \\\\mathfrak{M}^\\\\mathfrak{i} = impressed magnetic current (energy source). Electric vector potential The electric vector potential, F, is computed from the magnetic current density, \\\\mathfrak{M}^\\\\mathfrak{i}, in the same way that the magnetic vector potential, A, is computed from the electric current density. F is used in the same way the magnetic vector potential for sources attributed to magnetic current. Examples of use include finite diameter wire antennas and transformers. magnetic vector potential: \\\\mathbf A (\\\\mathbf r , t) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf J (\\\\mathbf r' , t')}{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf r'}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^3\\\\mathbf r'\\\\,. electric vector potential: \\\\mathbf F (\\\\mathbf r , t) = \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{M}^i (\\\\mathbf r' , t')}{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf r'}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^3\\\\mathbf r'\\\\,. where F at point \\\\mathbf r and time t is calculated from magnetic currents at distant position \\\\mathbf r' at an earlier time t'. The location \\\\mathbf r' is a source point within volume Œ© that contains the magnetic current distribution. The integration variable, \\\\mathrm{d}^3\\\\mathbf r', is a volume element around position \\\\mathbf r'. The earlier time t' is called the retarded time, and calculated as :t' = t - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf r'}{c}. Retarded time accounts for the accounts for the time required for electromagnetic effects to propagate from point \\\\mathbf r' to point \\\\mathbf r. = Phasor form = When all the functions of time are sinusoids of the same frequency, the time domain equation can be replaced with a frequency domain equation.

Magnetic frill generator  A dipole antenna driven by a hypothetical annular ring of magnetic current. b is chosen so that 377 x ln(b/a) is equal to the impedance of the driving transmission line (not shown). A distribution of magnetic current, commonly called a magnetic frill generator, may be used to replace the driving source and feed line in the analysis of a finite diameter dipole antenna. The voltage source and feed line impedance are subsumed into the magnetic current density. In this case, the magnetic current density is concentrated in a two dimensional surface so the units of \\\\mathfrak{M}^i are volts per meter. The inner radius of the frill is the same as the radius of the dipole. The outer radius is chosen so that : Z_L = Z_0 \\\\ln( \\\\frac b a). where : Z_L = impedance of the feed transmission line (not shown). : Z_0 = impedance of free space.

It is considered to be the final, but not ending part of \\"Moon Saga\\", a concept by which is conceptually linked to its predecessor albums Moon (2002), Crescent (2003), and Diabolos (2005), as well as the movie Moon Child (2003), theatre play Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&II; (2012-2014), and two novels (2003, 2014). Overview The concept album and its promotional tour, Last Visualive, are Gackt's first in almost seven years. It is called \\"last\\" because it is considered as a turning point in his career, whether it will be his last original release and tour, featuring his signature stage shows, for a while or not. It is called \\"Visualive\\" because links together video, performance and music. On October 7, 2015 the single \\"Arrow\\" was released. The tour and album release were supported by Nestl√©. Through this collaboration, on Nestle's special website every month until the official release, new songs to be included for the album were available for streaming and download. The concept was conceived in 2004 during the Sixth Day & Seventh Night tour (song \\"Utakata no Yume\\"). It was followed by the Diabolos tour in 2005, and in between the Requiem et Reminiscence II tour in 2009, Gackt thought to do the Last Moon tour. However, due to the vast developing time of Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&II; plays he would not be able do the RR II concept, and instead managed to establish the Visualive form with the RR II concept. Moon Saga Conceptually, the story of the \\"Moon Saga\\" is separated in four chapters. The first chapter takes places roughly from the year 700 to 1300, second from 1300 to 1600, third from 1600 to current time (2000), and fourth from the current time (2000) to the future (2045). The work from 2002 (Moon) and 2003 (Crecent, movie Moon Child, novel Moon Child Requiem) covered the fourth chapter, from 2005 (Diabolos) took place between the second and third chapter, while from 2012-2014 (theatre play Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&II;, novel Moon Saga Mysteries of Yoshitsune) and 2016 (Last Moon) depict the first chapter. The whole story is set in both Europe and Asia (mostly Japan), depending on the story and meaning wanted to be expressed. The idea was to create a story where the Oni (Japanese demons) were the origin of vampires, and eventually of the central character in the first chapter, Yoshitsune Minamoto. In the Heian period existed those called as Mononoke (spirits), and Mononofu, who were born between humans and Mononoke, and with special powers dominated both Mononoke and humans. The story from Mysteries of Yoshitsune spreads out when the member with inherited blood crossed over to Europe, and became the progenitor of the later vampires. The story from the first chapter follows the \\"darkside inhabitants\\" - darts, who were scattered all over Europe, fighting for different countries even against fellow inhabitants in the shadow of history. The second chapter how they tried to make something that will surpass them and for purpose of fighting, so were created 13 \\"shitos\\" (, apostle, disciple), but their body was incomplete and couldn't appear under the sun. From the third chapter, now known as \\"vampires\\", is followed their life. They didn't pursue their purpose of life, and as become aware of the darkness inside them, raises the question what is now their purpose of existence. After the awakening, two of the thirteen shito died (the man and woman shown in the music video of \\"Todokanai Ai to Shitteita no ni Osaekirezu ni Aishitsuzuketa...\\") leaving behind eleven. Five out of the eleven decided to stand up and fight against the darts, their creators. They wanted to prove that there was meaning in their existence, however they were outnumbered, and there was only one shito survivor. However, it is not a vampire's story as they were presented as a way of expressing a certain evil side and existence of humans. People long for immortality, believing it to be a wonderful thing, while vampires know how painful such an immortal existence can be and seek a peaceful death, because without death the life has no meaning. The theme of the concept, like his other in Requiem et Reminiscence albums, is about the existential questions of humanity. The \\"Moon Saga\\" is a symbolic story about the repetition of human sins, war and the question of what is the ultimate meaning of human life. The history of mankind's struggle ‚Äì the suffering and sorrow in the quest for the virtues and ideas. =Last Moon= The tour is titled as Saigo no Tsuki (\\"Last Moon\\" in English language), but the saigo is not written in kanji (last, end) yet which has a nuance of \\"the final moments\\" or \\"dying days\\", as it is not the end of the \\"Moon\\" concept. The theme of the album and tour is people thoughts during the last moments of death while looking at the Moon. The symbolism of the Moon in the story is for the reason it's witnessing the tragedies that humanity repeats, and thus through the Moon people can symbolically look back on the life path they walked on. The story of the Last Moon in the basis has the story of Mysteries of Yoshitsune, but it is actually the perspective about the former by the non-human entities from the Moon who come to collect the souls, whose figures dressed in black can be seen in the music video and cover of singles \\"Returner (Yami no Sh≈´en)\\" and \\"Arrow\\", as well album. The non-human narrator during the show questions why the humans with such strong feelings of friendship and love, repeat the same mistakes, can't stop hurting each other, and spend short lives fighting. Composition According to Gackt, it's a heavy album with deep world view, and it's definitely not suitable to be simply played in the background. Almost every song was created from the story sketched above and features a special image or place in the live performance. Having studied traditional Japanese poetry, Gackt incorporated a mix of traditional and modern speech in the lyrics, and experimented with the songs' beat, noting that traditional Japanese poetry is more suitable for an irregular beat. He also listened to the esoteric Buddhist sutras. The songs are distinctive for their blend of modern Western musical instruments and traditional Japanese instruments, like Shakuhachi, Shamisen, Shinobue, Erhu, Sh≈ç, Koto and Taiko, a kind of music called by Gackt as \\"Zipangu rock\\" from which can be sensed the country of origination. The song \\"Arrow\\" was meant for the very end of the story, but was performed at the start of the live. It is an intense ballad rock song, lyrics of which deal with the sacrifice for an ideal future. Some songs like \\"Hana mo Chiyu\\" are written as waka, which have a 5-7-5 pattern, and are suitable for irregular quintuple or septuple beats. The song \\"Kugutsu ga Gotoku\\" also has archaic Japanese words. The song \\"Kimi Dake no Boku de Iru Kara\\" is about the heartbreaking determination and the desire to protect a lover dying from illness. Its animated music video features Gackt. The song is conceptually related to \\"P.S. I Love U\\" as the man's feelings for a woman are expressed in the first, while the woman's feelings about the man are expressed in the second song. Although not in the track list, the songs \\"Hakuro\\" and \\"Sakura Chiru...\\" are part of the four song series from the first chapter of \\"Moon Saga\\", along with \\"Setsugekka (The End of Silence)\\" and \\"Akatsukizukuyo (Day Breakers)\\". Release The album was released on April 27, 2016 in two physical editions, regular (CD; GLCD-00016) and limited (CD+DVD; GLCD-00015), as well as on Spotify. Until November 6, 2015 a special limited edition (GLCD-00014) was available on Gackt's official website's global store. In November 2016 was announced that the album is being re-recorded for an English language version and future release. During the tour was sold limited edition album titled \\"Last Visualive Saigo no Tsuki ‚ÄìLast Moon‚Äì\\" (GLCD-00017) with two CDs (CD 1 48:28 - CD 2 59:07 minutes), with the whole live setlist in original order. =Charts= In its first week the studio album reached number six on the Oricon's weekly album chart, with 16,447 copies sold, and topped the Oricon independent album chart. On its first week the album charted at thirteen on the Billboard Japan's Hot Albums chart, while rising to number ten at the Top Albums Sales chart. Single \\"Arrow\\", released on 7 October 2015, reached number fifteen, and charted for four weeks on the Oricon's weekly single chart. As the single was released by an independent label it was also featured on the Oricon indies singles chart, peaking at number two. On the Billboard Japan Hot 100 it peaked at number sixty, and peaked at number fourteen on the Top Single Sales chart. Single \\"Kimi Dake no Boku de Iru Kara\\", released on 23 November 2016, reached number thirty on the Oricon's weekly single chart, selling 4,107 copies. On the Billboard Japan peaked at number forty-four on the Top Single Sales chart. Last Visualive tour On August 8 Gackt's first national (and world) tour in seven years, called Last Visualive Saigo no Tsuki ‚ÄìLast Moon‚Äì, was announced. Although the original intention was to be held in 2015, it was postponed to 2016. It started with a fanclub only concert on March 19 at Misato City Cultural Hall in Saitama, with the first public show being held on March 21 at the Colany Hall in Yamanashi. In January 2016, because most of the 25 concerts sold out, an additional 16 were announced, making the total 41 concerts. The tour ended on July 3 with two consecutive shows at the Saitama Super Arena, consisting of a total of 42 concerts in thirty cities and over 120,000 visitors. The final show was broadcast on WOWOW in October 2016, and its live recording will be released in regular and premium DVD and Blu-ray edition on March 14, 2017. In the ending credits of the final show were announced world tour and return tour in Japan in 2017. =Show= The concert shows generally lasted about four hours (with circa one hour long MC), and are focused around the album's track list. The concert's stage set looked like a post-apocalyptic movie set, they include videos which are related to the Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&II;, as well as various projection mapping scenery on the back screen. The lives are conceptually divided into four parts. The first part begins with the video showing Yoshitsune at the battlefield, narration questions like \\"why do people repeat the same mistakes?\\", and with many fateful arrows approaching Yoshitsune, which shooting has commanded brother Yoritomo, the video ends and starts the performance of the first song \\"Arrow\\". The music video of \\"Returner (Yami no Sh≈´en)\\" shows Yoshitsune being pierced by the arrows. During the performance of \\"Akatsukizukuyo (Day Breakers)\\" was montage of battle sciences, and Yoshitsune's improbable wish to remain close to the friends until the next meeting. The second part begins with the video showing part of the story which occurred 9 years earlier in 1180 between brothers Yoshitsune and Yoritomo, and the Heian Era scene is shown by the instrumental performance of \\"Utakata no Yume\\" where Gackt played the Japanese traditional instrument shamisen. The song \\"Kugutsu ga Gotoku\\" is performed with particularly intense animation and boogaloo dance choreography, followed by pantomime dance during \\"Youranka (Lulling)\\". The third part begins with the film from \\"Camui Gakuen\\", cover concerts festival conceptualized around fictional school. The sudden difference in the world view of the songs and stage is to release the audience from the built up tension and make them engage in playful entertainment. It includes an hour long MC, and both \\"Kimi Dake no Boku de Iru Kara\\" and \\"P.S. I Love U\\" started in a cappella. The final fourth part begins with the video of Yoshitsune waking up from the dream about his friends with whom he fought together, realizing he is pierced with arrows, which is followed by the ending performance of \\"Setsugekka (The End of Silence)\\", and video showing the ascending soul of Yoshitsune. =Set list= Track listing = Notes = * The title of \\"Kugutsu ga Gotoku\\" was originally revealed as , but later changed to the current title. * The song \\"Kimi Dake no Boku de Iru Kara\\" is the opening theme song for the anime Trickster in which Gackt was a voice actor.

Serum anti- myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies are present in up to half of patients with an acquired demyelinating syndrome and have been described in association with a range of phenotypic presentations, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis. Presentation The clinical presentation is variable and largely dependent upon the overall clinical manifestation. The presence of anti-MOG autoantibodies has been described in association with the following conditions: * Seronegative neuromyelitis optica. * Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, especially in recurrent and fulminant cases. * Multiple sclerosis.Jarius S, Metz I, K√∂nig FB, Ruprecht K, Reindl M, Paul F, Br√ºck W, Wildemann B. \\"Screening for MOG-IgG and 27 other anti-glial and anti-neuronal autoantibodies in 'pattern II multiple sclerosis' and brain biopsy findings in a MOG-IgG-positive case Mult Scler. 2016 Feb; * Optic neuritis or transverse myelitis, especially recurring cases. * CRION (chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy). *Aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis (typically post-infectious). The most common presenting phenotypes are acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children and optic neuritis (ON) in adults. Some of these phenotypes have been studied in detail: = Seronegative neuromyelitis optica = Anti-MOG antibodies have been described in some patients with NMOSDCYNTHIA MCKELVEY, Press Report, What‚Äôs the Role of Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein in NMO? who were negative for the aquaporin 4 (AQP-4) antibody. However, NMOSD is an astrocytopathy, whereas MOG antibody- associated disease is an oligodendrocytopathy, suggesting that these are two separate pathologic entities. Rare cases have been described of patients with antibodies against both AQP4 and MOG. These patients typically have MS-like brain lesions, multifocal spine lesions and optic nerve atrophy. However, the coexistence of both antibodies is still a matter of ongoing debate. = ADEM = The presence of anti-MOG antibodies is more common in children with ADEM.Silvia Tenembaum et al.

A post-infectious autoimmune process has been proposed as a possible pathophysiologic mechanism. Other reports point to molecular mimicry between MOG and some viruses as a possible etiology.De Luca et al.

They are similar to pattern-II multiple sclerosisDeena A. Tajfirouz, M. Tariq Bhatti, John J. Chen, Clinical Characteristics and Treatment of MOG-IgG‚ÄìAssociated Optic Neuritis Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports, December 2019 with T-cells and macrophages surrounding blood vessels, preservation of oligodendrocytes and signs of complement system activation. Diagnosis MOG-IgG is detected by means of so-called cell-based assays (CBA). CBA using live cells transfected with full- length human MOG and employing Fc-specific detection antibodies are the gold standard for anti-MOG antibody testing. Serum is the specimen of choice; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is less sensitive compared to serum testing. Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands, the diagnostic mainstay in multiple sclerosis (MS), are rare in MOG-EM, both in adults and in children. If present at all, intrathecal IgG synthesis is low in most patients, often transient, and mainly restricted to acute attacks. CSF findings are significantly more pronounced in acute myelitis than in acute ON, which is frequently associated with normal CSF findings, and depends significantly on disease activity (more pronounced during acute attacks), attack severity, and spinal cord lesion extension. CSF white cell numbers in MOG-EM may be higher than in MS, especially in acute myelitis, but normal cell numbers do not rule out the disease. CSF often contains neutrophil granulocytes and CSF L-lactate levels may be elevated, thus mimicking bacterial meningitis in some cases. The intrathecal, polyclonal antiviral immune response (so-called MRZ reaction), which is present in around 63% of MS patients, is absent in MOG-EM. Proposed diagnostic criteria require serum positivity for MOG antibody as detected by CBA, a clinicoradiological presentation consistent with an acquired demyelinating syndrome (VEP can replace radiological evidence only in patients with acute ON), and exclusion of alternative diagnoses; in addition, so-called 'red flags' have been defined, which, if present, should prompt physicians to challenge the diagnosis and to prompt re-testing for MOG-IgG, ideally using a second, methodologically different assay. In the young, MRI typically shows ADEM‚Äìlike lesions and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), whereas optic neuritis and short transverse myelitis are more commonly seen in older patients.Maciej Jurynczyk Ruth Geraldes Fay Probert Mark R.

Research Animal models in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE, have shown that ‚ÄúMOG-specific EAE models (of different animal strains) display/mirror human multiple sclerosis\\" but EAE pathology is closer to NMO and ADEM than to the confluent demyelination observed in MS. History Reports describing the possible involvement of anti-MOG antibodies in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating conditions first appeared in the literature in the late 1980s, but evidence to support their role in demyelinating disease was always weak and inconsistent. The possibility of an anti-MOG MS-subtype was considered around 2000. The turning point was in 2011, when Mader et al. developed a cell-based assay using HEK 293 cells which increased the detection rate of these antibodies in the serum.

This radio telescope is historically famous for taking part in the first successful very long baseline interferometry experiment in the 1960s, where it was experimentally arrayed with the 26-metre Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, British Columbia. History In 1961, the site was selected by the National Research Council of Canada as suitable for the construction of a fully steerable antenna.National Research Council of Canada: Proposed 120ft Telescope, Freeman Fox and Partners, Drawing 384, March 1961 By 1962, plans showed that the main instrument had grown to a antenna. Construction of the telescope started in the spring of 1964. The concrete base weighed 300 tons, the steel dish and its rotating mount another 900 tons. An equatorial mount in the base, only five feet high, positioned the instrument. The telescope was designed to operate at higher frequencies than existing instruments, requiring much of it to be constructed of flat plates instead of an open mesh in order to accurately focus these signals. The surface was built to be accurate to 1/5 of a centimeter, allowing it to accurately focus wavelengths to around 1.5 cm. Construction was completed in early 1966, and the telescope started operations in May 1966. Work was also completed a polar mounted paraboloid microwave horn and an 11 m equatorial mount dish north of the main antenna complex. One of the earliest extended projects carried out on the instrument was the first successful very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment. Long Baseline Interferometry compares the signals from two or more telescopes, using the differences in phase between the signals to resolve the objects. Earlier experiments had used direct electrical links or microwave relays to extend the distance between the two telescopes, while still allowing real-time comparison of the phase of the two signals in a common instrument. However this limited the distance between the two instruments, to the distance the signal could travel while still remaining in-phase. The NRC invented a new technique that eliminated the need to directly compare the signals in real-time. Their technique used 2 inch Quadruplex videotape to record the signals along with a clock signal from an atomic clock. The clock signal allowed the two signals to be later compared with the same accuracy that had formerly required direct realtime connections. NRC funded the installation of identical instruments at the ARO and a smaller telescope at DRAO. Combining the signals would simulated a single 3,074 km diameter radio telescope. Having learned that the Americans were also attempting a similar VLBI experiment, they tried to be the first to successfully use the technique. Their target for the experiment was quasar 3C 273. Recordings were made into the early morning of April 17, 1967. DRAOs tapes and atomic clock were shipped to the ARO for comparison, and after a month of trying to get the data to \\"line up\\", on May 21 they succeeded. After a few more days they had made the first highly accurate measurement of the size of the quasar, showing it was less than 100 light years across, about 1/1000 the span of the Milky Way. Further experiments revealed the fact that 3C 273 had a distinct \\"jet\\".The Algonquin Radio Observatory, Home to the largest parabolic antenna in Canada In 1968 the telescope was used in a geodesy experiment that measured the distance between the ARO and space- tracking telescopes in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan to 2143 km ¬± 20 m. Other early experiments included a study of flare stars by Queen's University. It was also used by Alan Bridle and Paul Feldman in 1974 for the first SETI search to be carried out at the 1.35 cm wavelength, emitted by water molecules in space.Algonquin Radio Observatory =Later uses= The 46m Thoth telescope (left) and 11m telescope (right) viewed from the entrance road at the Algonquin Radio Observatory. The surface of the telescope consisted of a mix of aluminum mesh around the outside and plates covering most of the surface. The mesh was almost transparent to wavelengths less than around a centimeter, and the plated area was not smooth enough to focus wavelengths shorter than about 1.5 cm. As attention in radio telescopy turned to shorter wavelengths, representing higher energy events, the ARO became less useful to NRC. After planning to resurface it so that it could operate at wavelengths as small as 3 mm, the NRC decided to cease operations at ARO in 1987 which were subsequently transferred to the Ontario Institute for Solar and Terrestrial Science (ISTS) in 1991. ISTS operated the antenna for several years before operation was returned to the Federal Government through Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). NRCan set about modernizing the facility, upgrading the antenna control and receiver systems to enable the antenna to participate in the International very-long-baseline interferometry Service (IVS). The antenna was operated for 48 hours per week until 2006 when one of the antenna's main azimuth load bearings failed. In 2007, Thoth Technology Inc. acquired operations of the facility from NRCan and undertook a four-year refurbishment of the antenna returning it to fully operational status by 2012. The telescope's current uses include performing VLBI experiments for the University of Toronto's Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, the monitoring of Global Navigation System (GNS) spacecraft for guidance signal quality control and the downlink of data from interplanetary spacecraft. Since 2016, the antenna has been equipped with a digital radar system that provides Space Situational Awareness data on the location of geostationary spacecraft and debris larger than one square meter at ranges up to 50,000 km.

Revelations showed that Karimova was paid bribes through a series of shell companies by a series of firms seeking to negotiate with her directly. In addition, it was discovered that more industries had paid bribes for access to Uzbekistan than simply telecom firms. Background Gulnara Karimova A Swiss criminal investigation begun in 2012 was directed at first against four Uzbek citizens who had connections to Karimova. Two of them were arrested that year and freed on bail. Also in 2012, a Swedish TV documentary stated that a Swedish telecom group, TeliaSonera, in exchange for licenses and frequencies in Uzbekistan, had paid $320 million to a Gibraltar- based shell company, Takilant, that was reportedly linked to Karimova. TeliaSonera denied the charges. Revelations In January 2013, Swedish investigators released new documents apparently showing that TeliaSonera had tried to negotiate directly with Karimova. In the same year, US and Dutch authorities began investigating her. In February 2014, the chief executive of TeliaSonera was forced resign after serious failures of due diligence were uncovered. In May, the Swedish media made documents public that suggested Karimova had aggressively dictated the terms of the TeliaSonera contract and threatened it with obstruction by several Uzbek government ministries if it did not agree to make illegal payments. Related money-laundering investigations in Switzerland and Sweden continued throughout the year, and hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts connected to the case being frozen by authorities. By the end of the year, Swedish criminal proceedings were underway. It was reported in March 2014 that Swiss authorities had begun a money-laundering investigation into Karimova and corruption in Uzbekistan, and prosecutors in Bern said that the evidence had led their investigation into Sweden and France and that they had ‚Äúseized assets in excess of 800 million Swiss francs ($912 million).‚Äù It was also revealed in 2014 that the US Justice Department and SEC were investigating Vimpelcom Ltd., based in Amsterdam; the Russian firm Mobile TeleSystems PJSC; and Sweden‚Äôs TeliaSonera AB. These three firms had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to firms controlled by Karimova. An August 2015 report stated that US prosecutors were asking authorities in Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Switzerland to seize assets of about $1 billion in connection with their investigation into corruption by the three above-mentioned global telecoms and other firms liked to Karimova. US authorities believed Karimova was the principal of a ‚Äú$1 billion fortune scattered across the continent.‚Äù In November 2015, it was reported that Karimova was possibly on the run. Reports stated that she had been seen at a restaurant in Tashkent. It was reported in January 2015 that although executives at the Norwegian telecom firm Telenor, which owns one- third of Vimpelcom, claimed that they had uncovered no signs of corruption, a newly released document indicated that Telenor had knowledge about millions in bribes. Results On March 20, 2015, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) \\"asked Sweden to freeze $30 million in funds held by a Stockholm-based bank\\", as part of its activities ending the corruption scheme. of Karimova and Talikant. At the time, Karimova was reportedly under house arrest in connection with a corruption investigation. Meanwhile, investigations were underway in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, France and the Netherlands focusing on shell companies allegedly used by the three multinational telecoms ‚Äúto pay bribes and gain access to the lucrative Uzbek mobile phone market.‚Äù The DOJ probe uncovered the fact that all three firms had ‚Äúpaid bribes to Uzbek officials to obtain mobile telecommunications business in Uzbekistan and that funds involved in the scheme were laundered through shell companies and financial accounts around the world, including accounts held in Sweden, to conceal the true nature of these illegal payments.‚Äù European investigators revealed that Takilant was run by Gayane Avakyan, a former Karimova aide. According to Swiss newspaper Le Temps, ‚Äú500 million francs of the seized funds involved TeliaSonera, a major telephone company and mobile network operator in Sweden and Finland, and the rest involved Karimova‚Äôs personal assets.‚Äù A July 1, 2015, report stated that US authorities were seeking to seize $300 million in bank accounts in Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium, alleging that the funds were the proceeds of corrupt payments in Uzbekistan by MTS and Vimpelcom, presumably to Karimova, between 2004 and 2011. An August 2015 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) report stated that Uzbek authorities had arrested nine suspects in connection with their probe of Karimova's corruption activities. Among those taken into custody were two top executives at a Coca- Cola bottling plant in Uzbekistan, which Karimova formerly owned. On September 17, 2015, it was reported that TeliaSonera was ‚Äúdeeply shaken‚Äù by the corruption scandal in Uzbekistan, and that it would be pulling out of all of central Asia as a result of ‚Äúheavy investor and public pressure.‚Äù It was revealed that the US Department of Justice, along with Swedish prosecutors, had initiated investigations into corruption allegations at TeliaSonera. In October 2015, Norway's government demanded the resignation of Telenor chairman Svein Aaser on account of the Uzbekistan corruption scandal. Reactions Reportedly, Karimova ‚Äúran afoul of her father,‚Äù who refused to comment on the accusations against her. Previously, in 2013, Karimova accused Uzbek security services on Twitter of harassing her and deceiving her father about her. Her sister, Lola, rejected her, however. In return, Karimova accused Lola, Uzbekistan's UNESCO ambassador, who lives in a $40 million mansion in Geneva, of hiding secret stashes of dollars somewhere in the president's palace. In early 2014, Gulnara claimed her sister had sent goons to physically harm her because she wished to go to Israel for medical care. Gulnara smuggled out a letter informing the media of her arrest, claiming the \\"reason for the Pinochet-style persecution is that I dared to speak up about things that millions are quiet about.\\" Karimova was put under house arrest in February 2014. She stated that she and her 16-year-old daughter were prohibited from visiting the president. She claimed to have been the target of police violence and asserted that she had been refused medical and psychological treatment.

The firm was in the business of wholesale and retail for chemists and surgical instrument makers. Origins The original company can be traced back to 1816 (see Grace's Guide which is the leading source of historical information on industry and manufacturing in Britain). Edward Matterson was a druggist who ran the firm after being employed by Allen and Hanburys. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School. In 1822 the company moved to 13 Briggate, Leeds. In 1833 William West F.R.S. took over the company after Matterson went bankrupt (see The bankrupt directory: being a complete register of all the bankruptcies, with their residences, trades, and dates when they appeared in the London gazette, from December 1820 to April 1843). In 1839 Thomas Harvey joined the business, when William West left the company to pursue analytical chemistry. The firm was then renamed Thomas Harvey. Harvey was born at Barnsley into a Quaker family. His father was a linen manufacturer. The second of five children, he was educated at Barnsley Grammar in Yorkshire in 1812. From 1822 to 1825 Harvey studied at Ackworth and afterwards became a chemist apprentice for David Doncaster of Sheffield. Upon Doncaster's death he trained at Thomas Southalls in Birmingham for eight years. In 1837 Harvey settled in Leeds as a chemist. He became an anti-slavery campaigner and philanthropist. Richard Reynolds In 1844 Richard Reynolds joined the company as an apprentice. He was born in 1829 and was the eldest son of an apothecary who died when the boy was only four years old. From 1850 to 1851 he attended the School of Pharmacy in London where he took first prizes in chemistry, materia medica and botany in a contest held by the pharmaceutical society. He then went to Mr. Henry Deane at Chapman for two years and returned to the Leeds business. In 1854 Richard Reynolds joined Thomas Harvey as a partner and the company then became Harvey & Reynolds. In 1861 the firm was joined by a Mr. Fowler and became Harvey, Reynolds & Fowler. By 1864 Thomas Harvey had retired (Noted in 1884). At the age of 72, he undertook an arduous journey to Canada on a Quaker mission but it exhausted him. He died on December 25 at his home at Ashwood, Headingley Lane. Mr. Haw then joined the business and the company became Haw & Reynolds. In 1867 the business was listed as Haw, Reynolds, & Co. In 1883 Fredrick W Branson joined the business. An 1884 advertisement listed the partnership between Reynolds & Branson (late Harvey, Reynolds & co). 1898-1914 The firm of Reynolds & Branson was registered in July 1898 as a limited corporation with a capital of ¬£34,000 in shares of ¬£10 each by Messrs. R. Reynolds, F. W. Branson. No remuneration was given to Mr. R. Reynolds, but a ¬£700 each per annum to the others. In 1890 Richard Reynold's son, Richard Freshfield (Fred) Reynolds was made a partner. The firm was in the business of wholesale and retail chemists and surgical instrument makers.[5] Fredrick W Branson now focused on the development of scientific apparatus and chemical glassware for the business. The company was flourishing under his management. Frederick Hartridge attended the University of Leeds in 1905, and then attending the School of Pharmaceutical Society in London in 1909. In 1901, during the outbreak of lead poisoning at Morley, the company was called in. Frederick W. Branson made recommendations which freed Morley from this scourge. In collaboration with A. F. Dimmock, M.D., he contributed to the British Medical Association meeting in 1903 a paper \\" A new method for the determination of uric acid in urine\\" (Br. Med. J., 1903, 2, 585). For this process he devised a correction scale which was contributed to the British Pharmaceutical Conference in 1904. At the 1905 meeting of the British Medical Association a further paper by these two authors was read, \\" A rapid and simple process for the estimation of uric acid \\" (ibid., 1905, 2, 1104), in which uric acid was precipitated and the precipitate measured in a specially graduated tube. In 1914, in collaboration with Dr. Gordon Sharp, he contributed a paper to the British Pharmaceutical Conference on the activity of digitalis leaves and the stability and standardisation of tinctures of digitalis. The war years During the First World War, he actively pursued efforts to standardize the size and shape of chemical glassware. In 1916, he was elected as an inaugural member of the Society of Glass Technology. He organized research and published works on these topics. Branson sought to secure in Great Britain the manufacturing process for the glass required for the equipment of munition factories.[8][9] Branson contributed a paper on the composition of some types of chemical glassware to the Society of Chemical Industry (J. SOC. Chem. Ind., 1915, 34, 471) in collaboration with his son Frederick Hartridge, a paper to the Transactions of the Society of Glass Technology (1919, 3, 249)\\" A proposed standard formula for a glass for lamp workers. Branson was chairman until retirement in 1932. His son, Frederick Hartridge, Associate of the Royal Institute of Chemistry AIC, became chairman and managing director of Reynolds & Branson.[5][7] he run the company for 20 years, until his untimely death on 10 February 1952, Frederick Hartridge had appointed his 3 Sons and Daughter as directors of Reynolds & Branson, Frederick Norman the eldest son who attended Ilkley Grammar an all-boys school, Eileen his only daughter, Peter Orchard who as Director of Phospherade, which was the mineral water company, He attended Roundhay all-boys grammar school. In the Second World War he was in the RAF with 54 Spitfire squadron, in 1942 married Rita Blackburn, he went to Australia with 54 Spitfire squadron at the end of 1942, he met Patricia A Grant his second wife. He married Patricia in Leeds 1948, Peter emigrated to Australia 1953, when his father died leaving the bulk of the business to his eldest brother Frederick Norman, He set up his own pharmacy in Blackburn South in 1955, He later become a Podiatrist retiring at the age of 90, Richard Orchard who attended Roundhay all-boys grammar school, Second World War Richard was also in RAF as a pilot he died on active service 1945. His eldest son Frederick Norman Branson became Chairman & Managing Director of Reynolds & Branson in 1953, he would run Reynolds & Branson for almost 20 years, at this point the company had a workforce of 150 people, In 1972 Frederick Norman Branson sold the business to Barclay, later selling to the asset strippers Slater & Walker.

The Army immediately swore Oath to \\"King Milan\\". The Great Powers opposed, and Prince Milan informed Chernyayev that he could not accept the declaration; Chernyayev replied that he was to leave with all Russian military if it was not accepted. Chernyayev assured that the recognition by the Great Powers was unnecessary, that the proclamation of kingdom raises the morale of the army and Serbian people, because \\"a kingdom means independence\\". It was compensation for the victims and the main profit of the war, which in his view, should continue after the truce for two months. He claimed that during that time, Russia would provide greater assistance to Serbia than even necessary. Prince Milan, pressured by the Great Powers, stated that he would not accept the proclamation.

Early life Born in Izvoru, Olt County, he attended primary school in his native village, followed by high school in Slatina. He led a disorganized and nomadic life, living from one day to another while wandering from city to city (Bistri»õa, Dej, BacƒÉu, Gala»õi, Constan»õa) and founding or working on various obscure publications. Career He finally settled in Bucharest, where he worked as an editor on several publications and founded and led one of his own, the magazine Vitrina literarƒÉ (1929-1934). He solidified a reputation as an apt polemicist. He also delved into literature, as an author of humorous stories. He was well-received in the SburƒÉtorul literary circle, although in Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne contemporane, its leader Eugen Lovinescu gave a much more modest opinion of Damian's merits. His first book was the 1929 Eu sau frate- meu?!..., a collection of humorous sketches. Two others appeared in the same genre (DouƒÉ »ôi-un cƒÉ»õel, 1933; Bol»ôevicul, 1936); the latter was retrospective in nature. Other books fit into the genre of literary reportage: Celula nr. 13 (1932), Bucure»ôti (1935) and Rogojina (1945). His novels generally were of the journal or confessional variety: De-a curmezi»ôul (1935) and Gheorghe I. Marin (1937). Only the 1936 novel Om had literary pretensions; this love story rings rather false, particularly in its poetic and lyrical passages. Toward the end of his life, he returned to journalism, heading the newspapers Bucure»ôti (1941) and Fapta (1945-1947). In May 1941, Nichifor Crainic, Minister of National Propaganda in the Ion Antonescu regime, suspended Bucure»ôti, citing its pro- democracy outlook. Damian sent a protest telegram that Crainic, due to its references to his personal life, found violent and offensive. Referred to military prosecutors, the journalist was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for offending the public authorities, and carried out his sentence in full. He later wrote Rogojina, which deals with his incarceration at VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison. In 1933, he was awarded the Romanian Writers' Society prize.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol. II, p. 443-44. Pite»ôti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004.

Biography Raab, born in Frankfurt, Hesse, was one of four children of a German First World War veteran. His father, through his own experience during the war, raised Raab a pacifist and Christian and the latter held a strong conviction against any form of killing.

He was not immediately prosecuted because of his status as a youth international, but was monitored by the police, and arrested 18 months later. Raab was detained and tortured for the next 11 months and eventually sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. Imprisoned in the fortress of Kassel, Raab contemplated suicide but was talked out of it by one of the guards. Raab fabricated a key, escaped and found shelter with a woman whose husband had been shot and killed by the Nazis. With the help of his brother, Raab escaped Germany for France on 1 May 1937, dressed in a SS uniform. Unable to speak French and without any money Raab received help from local people and eventually made his way to Paris where he was recognised as former German youth international and, despite opposition from Germany, signed for CA Paris. Raab moved to Nantes for work reasons in 1938 but had to give up his post as a draftsman after the outbreak of the Second World War because of the company being involved in national defence contracts. He was eventually arrested because of his German nationality and sent to work in an ammunition factory until shortly before the armistice in 1940 when he escaped from the advancing German Army. During the German occupation of France Raab avoided arrest by the Germans and wrote pacifist leaflets which he distributed to German soldiers, hiding for a time in the village of Treilli√®res. After the liberation of Nantes in 1944 Raab joined FC Nantes and played for the club until 1949. He also had two stints as manager of FC Nantes as well as becoming the club's director of sports for a time. He became a critic of the money involved in professional football when, at the same time, there was so much suffering and poverty in the world. Raab died on 12 December 2006 in Nantes.

It was decommissioned for cost reasons in 2017 after 25 years of useful life.  History  Elkraft, one of the predecessors of DONG Energy (now √òrsted), began considering offshore turbines in 1987, and surveyed the waters around Lolland in 1989.\\"Elkraft igang med verdens f√∏rste offshore m√∏llepark\\" Ingeni√∏ren, 18 August 1989.

The electricity industry at the time generally considered offshore turbines to be ludicrous, as they must operate in salty conditions and have much smaller output than central power plants.Korsgaard Nielsen, Michael. \\"Farvel til verdens f√∏rste hav-m√∏ller\\" Berlingske, 8 February 2016Korsgaard Nielsen, Michael. \\"Fra energiens originaler til b√∏lgernes gulddrenge\\" Berlingske, 8 February 2016 The skeptical attitude had changed 6 years later, as offshore winds drove more energy production than those on land. A single wind turbine had been erected in Swedish waters earlier, but Vindeby was the first collection of turbines, making it the first offshore wind farm. Four years later, the similar sized Tun√∏ Knob wind farm was made.ing.dk/artikel/vindmolle-fest-pa-tuno-knob-13739 Tests were done to learn what to do and what not to do.

Accessed: 9 February 2016. The original government concession was for 25 years, from 1991 to 2016. In 2016, DONG Energy first considered shutting down the wind farm, as it was well past its design life and had become uneconomical. Vindeby was the first in a long line of successful wind farms which led a downwards cost trend.DONG to dismantle Vindeby 4c Vindeby was the first wind farm to be decommissioned by Dong Energy, which was completed in September 2017. In 25 years, Vindeby had produced a total of 243 GWh. The blades were recycled into noise barriers. =Technology= The developers contracted Bonus Energy to supply 11 wind turbines (450 kW each) for the project, placed in shallow waters. The annual power is equivalent to 2-3,000 Danish households. The turbines were modified for offshore use by sealing the towers and controlling the humidity inside with air conditioning, extending the life of the machinery.Stenstrop, Georg. Vindeby Kulturarv.

Palacio del Marqu√©s de Portugalete in the late - 19th century. A hall in the Palacio del Marqu√©s de Portugalete. The Palacio del Marqu√©s de Portugalete was a grand ornate palace built in the 1860s, located at number 56 of the Calle de Alcal√°, on the corner of Calle Alfonso XI, in Madrid. Also known as the Palace of Bail√©n, it belonged to the family of Francisco Javier Casta√±os y Aragorri (a descendant of General Casta√±os, the victor of the battle of Bail√©n). It was built by the architect Adolfo Ombretch, who also built the nearby palace of Linares. For many years it was a venue for the wealthy elite to meet and discuss national politics. It was demolished after the Spanish Civil War, and in 1946, in its place, was constructed the building of the National Institute of Forecast, now occupied by the National Institute of Health. \\"El Palacio de Portugalete\\", ABC (newspaper). March 3, 2015.  History  The palace was built during the reign of Isabel II. Its owner was the Marquis of Portugalete and the Duke of Bail√©n, originally called the \\"Duchy of Bail√©n Casta√±os\\", a title created in 1833 by King Ferdinand VII in favor of General Francisco Javier Casta√±os y Aragorri Urioste y Olavide. It was later transformed into perpetual and hereditary in 1847 by Queen Isabel II. As the General Casta√±os died childless, the property passed into the peerages of Luis √Ångel de Carondelet y Casta√±os, his sister's son, and her husband the Baron of Carondelet, the 2nd Marquisate of Portugalete. The plans and the direction of the construction of the building were executed by the French architect Adolfo Ombrecht. Its interior had a ballroom decorated with flowers, a chapel for religious events, a billiard room, a hall of portraits, bathrooms decorated in Pompeian style by the painter Oreste Mancini, a gallery museum, a music hall and a large number of dependencies. Carrara marble is heavily used, and there are tapestries and paintings by Francisco Goya, Vicente L√≥pez, Palmaroli, Eduardo Rosales, Murillo, Pradilla, Madrazo, Gisbert, Casado del Alisal, etc., sculptors being the most renowned Benlliure, ebony and ivory furnitures, colorful chandeliers and windows.\\"EDIFICIOS DESAPARECIDOS DE MADRID (PALACIO DEL MARQUES DE PORTUGALETE)\\", Madrid sin prisas. may 9, 2013 The palace was built in the center of the plot, having an inner courtyard with garden, the outside was enclosed by a fence. For the construction was used the stone and the brick alternately, stone for the main part as corners, gables, cornices, doorways and windows. To highlight the design of the central body of the facade of the calle de Alcal√° forming a curved space. At the death without descendants of the 3rd Duke of Bail√©n, Eduardo de Carondelete y Donado in 1882 the titles passed to his carnal niece, Encarnaci√≥n Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, but the palace and its contents were inherited by his widow, Mar√≠a Dolores del Collado y Echag√ºe, the latter, was the one who really gave luster and fame to that palace. And she did especially through her celebrated parties and meetings. For many years the palace was a meeting place for the wealthy and political classes of the time as C√°novas del Castillo. In its halls national politics was so commonplace that once, leaving C√°novas this palace with a large representation of the Government, a reporter asked: \\"Mr. President, have been Council?\\" It was demolished after the Spanish Civil War to make way for new forms of urbanism and in 1946, the building of the National Insurance Institute, later called the National Institute of Health was built in its place. At present, the current building is owned by the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality of the Government of Spain.

Each package of downloadable content added new player versus environment (PvE) missions and player versus player (PvP) modes, new locales to visit, and new items for the player to make use of. The first expansion was The Dark Below in December 2014, which was followed by House of Wolves in May 2015. The third, The Taken King, was released in September 2015 and had the largest effect on the game, as it changed much of the core gameplay. Upon the release of the third expansion, retailers issued Destiny: The Taken King Legendary Edition, which included Destiny and all DLC up to and including The Taken King. In December 2015, Destiny shifted to an event-based model, featuring more periodical limited-time events. The fourth and last expansion called Rise of Iron released in September 2016. Upon release of the fourth expansion, retailers issued Destiny: The Collection, which includes Destiny and all DLC up to and including Rise of Iron. Although the first three downloadable content packs were available for all consoles that Destiny was originally released for (PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One), the fourth expansion, Rise of Iron, is only available on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As per an exclusivity agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, Destiny and all of its expansions featured timed exclusive content for the PlayStation versions. The timed exclusive content that was available at the launch of Destiny, as well as the exclusive content of the first two expansions, became available for Xbox when The Taken King launched. The Taken Kings and Rise of Irons PlayStation exclusive content became available for Xbox in October 2017 after the launch of Destinys sequel, Destiny 2. Overview Prior to the official release of Destiny in September 2014, Bungie declared that a major component of the game would be a continuous release of new content. Bungie Director of Production Jonty Barnes said: \\"We're going to continuously update the game from now until the end of time. That's always going to be part of the philosophy of Destiny. We always wanted to build a new universe but keep building upon it, rather than to do a complete and utter restart periodically.\\" By the time of Destinys launch, two planned packs of downloadable content (DLC) had been officially announced: The Dark Below and House of Wolves. From the launch of Destiny, players could purchase the Destiny Expansion Pass, which included the first two expansions at a discounted price versus buying them separately. Players also received an exclusive sparrow (EV-30 Tumbler) if they purchased the Expansion Pass or The Dark Below by January 15, 2015. At E3 2015, Bungie officially announced a new, larger expansion called The Taken King. On February 11, 2016, Bungie confirmed a new, large expansion for September 2016 and a full sequel to Destiny‚ÄîDestiny 2‚Äîfor 2017. The fourth expansion was officially confirmed as Rise of Iron on June 9, 2016. In the weeks proceeding from the release of Destiny, players were reporting areas that could be accessed by various glitches or secret accesses. These areas were described as appearing \\"half-baked\\", and were noted to often be devoid of items or NPCs. In an interview with Eurogamer, on the claims that these were on-disc DLC, Bungie president Harold Ryan replied that the content were incomplete resources intended to reduce download requirements for future DLC. For Year Two, senior designer Derek Carroll explained that the studio wanted to shift towards an \\"event-based model\\" with \\"surprises\\" for players, available to all owners of The Taken King at no additional charge, as opposed to a timed roadmap, as had previously been speculated. Marketing director Eric Osborne further clarified its plans for \\"Year Two\\", stating that it would not consist solely of time-limited events as had been implied by others, but new \\"events, activities, content, and features\\", as well as an event planned for early 2016 that would be \\"far larger than anything you‚Äôve seen since the release of The Taken King\\". The Dark Below Destinys first DLC pack, The Dark Below, was released on December 9, 2014. The expansion added new content centering on the Hive race and their deity Crota, Son of Oryx, who had been referenced in the original game. Four story missions, a strike, and a raid were added. New bounties, equipment, and three Crucible maps were also added, as well as two Crucible modes: \\"Inferno\\", a modifier on multiple modes where points are solely scored on kills and the player's radar is disabled, and \\"Doubles\\", a two-versus-two version of Skirmish. Maximum weapon attack damage was increased to 331 for new legendary and exotic weapons, and the Light level cap was increased to 32. Although previous legendary items could not be upgraded to the new stats, exotic items earned prior to the expansion's release could be upgraded through X√ªr with the Exotic Shard material, however, players lost all previously earned perks, requiring them to relevel their exotics. An additional exotic weapon (\\"The 4th Horseman\\" shotgun) and another strike (\\"The Undying Mind\\") were timed exclusives for PlayStation platforms until September 2015. A hard mode for the raid was added on January 21, 2015. =Plot= Shortly after destroying the heart of the Black Garden, Eris Morn, a former guardian and the only surviving member of a team who tried to previously take on Crota, comes out of hiding and returns to the Tower to warn of the Hive prince's return. Her first quest tasks the Guardian with killing a Hive Knight on Earth called the Fist of Crota. The Guardian then sets out to stop the Hive from overtaking Rasputin, who are led by a powerful Hive Wizard called Omnigul, the Will of Crota. After the Guardian destroys a massive ogre called the Might of Crota, Omnigul flees. Eris then has the Guardian travel to the Moon to stop the Hive from resurrecting their god. This the Guardian does and they destroy a crystal that contained part of Crota's soul. After returning to the Tower, Eris assigns the Guardian with two more quests. The first of these has the Guardian to fill an urn called the Urn of Sacrifice with the ashes of defeated Hive on Earth, including a powerful Hive Knight called Urzok, the Hated. The Guardian then takes it to the Moon to collect Hive eyes for Eris. The second quest has the Guardian destroy the remaining servants of Crota on Earth called the Heart of Crota, the Hand of Crota, and the Eyes of Crota. This leads to the strike, \\"The Will of Crota\\", where the Guardian hunts down and eliminates Omnigul. Despite the Guardian's best efforts, including destroying part of Crota's soul, they were not able to prevent Crota's resurrection. The expansion culminates with the raid, \\"Crota's End\\", where a team of guardians travel deep within the caverns of the Moon where they take on Ir Y√ªt, the Deathsinger (another powerful Hive Wizard) before completely destroying the Hive prince himself. In the base game, there is a story mission called \\"The Sword of Crota\\" where the Guardian is tasked with destroying the weapon. When The Taken King released, it added a new questing system to the game and this mission became the first mission of The Dark Below quest line. =Reception= The Dark Below received a mixed reception from reviewers, who were critical of its content. It has an aggregate score of 63/100 for the PlayStation 4 version (based on 41 reviews) and 59/100 for the Xbox One version (based on 4 reviews) from Metacritic‚Äîno score is available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Vince Ingenito of IGN, who gave the expansion a 6/10, stated that the only reason to purchase the expansion was for the raid. He said there was very little to do in the expansion, stating \\"I saw barely anything substantial that I hadn't seen in Destiny before\\", noting how the expansion's story missions were just recycled areas of the base game. He also criticized the story, saying it did not add much to the lore of Destiny. Justin Clark of GameSpot, who also gave it a 6/10, had similar remarks and criticized the amount of grinding needed to play the expansion's content. Clark, however, did enjoy the quest that involved killing Urzok, the Hated. Urzok, who is very powerful, appears in the middle of a periodic event, a chaotic war between the Fallen and the Hive, and any player can participate. He said these are the type of events that Destiny should have more often. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer, who also gave it a 6/10, was more positive of the story missions, but was critical of how all pre-expansion gear is effectively obsolete. All new gear featured higher attack and defense, but the old gear, with the exception of exotics, could not be upgraded. Although exotics could be upgraded, all the work players had put into maxing them out became wasted because they had to redo all the work to max them out to the new stats. House of Wolves House of Wolves was released on May 19, 2015; the expansion added new content centering on the Fallen race, as players attempt to thwart a campaign by Skolas, Kell of Kells, to unite the Fallen race under his rule. The expansion added a new social space (the Vestian Outpost), which is the hub for the expansion's content, six story missions, bounties, weapons and gear, a new special weapon class (sidearm), a strike, and three Crucible maps. An additional Crucible map (\\"The Timekeeper\\") was a timed exclusive for PlayStation platforms until September 2015. A revamped upgrading system was introduced: players could reforge new legendary weapons (except House of Judgment and Trials of Osiris weapons) to try and achieve better perks. Upon obtaining the Etheric Light and Exotic Shard materials, players could \\"ascend\\" all legendary and exotic items, respectively, to the highest levels possible as of the expansion: Light level cap 34 and 365 damage for weapons. Because of the backlash of the first expansion, players did not lose any perks on their items when upgrading to the new stats. A limited-use weapon was added and is only available in certain missions: the \\"Scorch Cannon\\" (similar to a rocket launcher but the rockets can be attached to enemies and their explosion delayed to cause more damage). Two new multiplayer modes were also added: Prison of Elders (PvE arena) and Trials of Osiris (PvP game type). *Prison of Elders is a cooperative mode, in which a team of three players fights against waves of enemies with varying gameplay modifiers, culminating with a final boss. The level 28 version includes matchmaking, while the higher levels require players to have a pre-made fireteam, unless they want to attempt them solo. The level 28, 32, and 34 difficulty boss changes weekly, but level 35's does not. The Taken Kings April Update added a new Prison of Elders quest, bounties, a level 41 difficulty with matchmaking, and a level 42 score-based mode called \\"Challenge of the Elders\\"; players can purchase an \\"Elder's Sigil\\" scorecard from Variks, which has different weekly challenges and obtaining the weekly high scores rewards high-level gear. *Trials of Osiris is a weekly, time-limited PvP event held between Fridays and Tuesdays, in which a fireteam of three members attempts to win as many matches as possible. Matches use the Crucible mode \\"Elimination\\": a three-versus-three, best-of-nine rounds mode that was also added with this expansion. A fireteam can continue participating until they amass 9 victories or 3 losses. Participating in Trials of Osiris requires the purchase of a \\"Trials Passage\\" scorecard from Brother Vance at the Vestian Outpost; items that can add a win to the card or indemnify a loss can also be bought with \\"Passage Coins\\" that are earned by playing Trials. Reaching varying numbers of wins on the score card allows the player to earn rewards‚Äîfor example, reaching five earns a featured armor piece, and reaching seven earns a featured weapon. Going undefeated with nine wins unlocks The Lighthouse, an exclusive social space on Mercury with greater rewards. If a team amasses three losses, they can try again by buying a new Trials Passage. With the release of The Taken King expansion, Trials now has its own set of bounties with additional rewards. =Plot= A few months following the events of The Dark Below, Skolas, the former Kell (leader) of the House of Wolves, has been freed from the Reef's Prison of Elders by a member of an ancient organization called the Nine. A prophecy foretold that a Kell would rise up and unite all Fallen Houses. Believing himself to be this Kell, Skolas declares himself the Kell of Kells and frees his imprisoned lieutenants and rallies the House of Wolves, thus beginning a campaign to unite all Fallen Houses under his rule. To try and recruit guardians to combat the rising threat, Queen Mara Sov orders that the Reef's Vestian Outpost be opened to them. Located in the asteroid belt, the Outpost is the residence of Petra Venj and Variks the Loyal, who serve as guides for the Guardian. The Guardian is sent to Venus to stop Skolas from gaining support from the House of Winter, but is unsuccessful. On Earth, Skolas tries to gain support from the House of Devils and House of Kings, but the Guardian interferes and is this time successful at keeping them from joining Skolas. In the process, they also eliminate members of a Fallen assassination team called the Silent Fang and three Fallen Barons, Yavek of the Wolves and Paskin and Vekis of the Kings. The Wolves return to Venus and break into the Vault of Glass to steal the Vex's technology to further Skolas's goals, however, Skolas and the Wolves are eventually overpowered by the Guardian. Chasing the Kell of Kells to the top of Venus's Citadel, Skolas is captured and returned to the Prison of Elders. The level 35 mode of the Prison of Elders PvE arena is called \\"Skolas's Revenge\\" where in the final round, a team of guardians face Skolas again to execute him. Petra also has bounties for the Guardian to eliminate other high- ranking members of the Wolves, including a mission to kill the Archon-Slayer Skoriks. Variks has the Guardian to complete the strike \\"The Shadow Thief\\" to eliminate Taniks, the Scarred, a mercenary for hire among the Fallen who is employed by the Wolves but does not belong to any House. In the base game, there is a story mission called \\"Scourge of Winter\\" where the Guardian is tasked with killing Draksis, Winter's Kell. When The Taken King released, it added a new questing system to the game and this mission became the first mission of the House of Wolves quest line. =Reception= House of Wolves received better reception than its predecessor, The Dark Below. It has an aggregate score of 72/100 for the PlayStation 4 version (based on 31 reviews) and 71/100 for the Xbox One version (based on 4 reviews) from Metacritic‚Äîno score is available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Jose Otero of IGN, who gave it a 7.5/10, said that the expansion \\"learns from its predecessor's mistakes.\\" Although it did not fix Destinys issues with the story or its loot system, \\"it does introduce new, sensible gear upgrade paths, a fun new campaign with a few surprises, and rewarding endgame activities\\". There was less grinding as gear dropped at higher levels than previously, however, this only applied to House of Wolves gear. The new Etheric Light material was praised, as it let all previous legendary gear be upgraded to the new stats without having to relevel the gear, although the material was a rare drop. The Prison of Elders PvE arena was praised, but Otero said that there was not a lot of variety in its objectives. He said that although it was not as impressive as a raid, \\"it's unique enough to stand on its own merits.\\" Trials of Osiris was also praised. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer had similar remarks and said the expansion \\"deliver[s] an overhaul of systems and a stream of modes and features that are the best thing to happen to Destiny since its launch.\\" He said it felt like Bungie remembered what made their previous games so special. Robinson highly praised the new sidearm weapon, calling it one of Bungie's best guns on par with pistols in their previous Halo games. The new level cap was praised for being easier to obtain than previously. He said that although the expansion was not a radical overhaul, it was a serious step in the right direction. Major expansions =The Taken King= The third expansion, The Taken King, was released on September 15, 2015, marking the end of \\"Year One\\" of Destiny. The expansion focuses on Oryx, The Taken King and father of Crota, as he leads a new race of enemy, the Taken, to avenge his son's death. Players have access to a new PvE area, the Dreadnaught, Oryx's massive ship situated in the rings of Saturn (with its own Patrol mode), as well as playable missions on Mars' moon Phobos (previously only available in PvP), and the raid, \\"King's Fall\\"; the hard version raised the highest obtainable Light level to 320 and the April 2016 update increased it to 335. A new public activity called Court of Oryx is accessed during the Dreadnaught's Patrol mode with random bosses and three levels of difficulty. A new heavy weapon was introduced, a sword, which has new mechanics from the swords that can be used during certain Hive missions. Three new strikes were added and three Year One strikes were revised to include the Taken race in addition to the other enemies. Seven new Crucible maps were added, in addition to three new PvP modes, \\"Rift\\", \\"Mayhem\\", and a new version of Control called \\"Zone Control\\". New sub-classes were added for all three classes; the Void-based \\"Nightstalker\\" for Hunter, the Arc-based \\"Stormcaller\\" for Warlock, and the Solar-based \\"Sunbreaker\\" for Titan. A new quest storyline was added in the \\"April Update\\" where players must defeat Malok, a Taken prince attempting a rise to power in the aftermath of Oryx's defeat. Like the previous expansions, The Taken King had timed exclusives for PlayStation platforms, which lasted until October 2017 (although originally planned to last until September 2016). Two new retail versions of Destiny, the \\"Legendary Edition\\" and \\"Collector's Edition\\", were released alongside The Taken King: both included a copy of the game, all \\"Year One\\" DLC, and The Taken King. A Digital Collector's Edition was also available. Year One players received commemorative items when purchasing The Taken King. A new PS4 bundle was also available, which included a limited edition white 500GB PS4 with Destiny artwork on the face of the console, the Legendary Edition of Destiny: The Taken King, and all bonus content from the Legendary and Digital Collector's Editions. Players who purchased The Taken King received an item called Spark of Light, which boosted one new character to level 25, the minimum level needed to play The Taken Kings content. =Rise of Iron= The fourth and last expansion, Rise of Iron, was released on September 20, 2016, and marked the end of \\"Year Two\\" of Destiny. The expansion focuses on the Fallen race, as they have breached the Wall that surrounds the City and are armed with the SIVA virus, a Golden Age breakthrough in self-assembling nano technology. Lord Saladin of the Iron Banner PvP event is a major character and leads players as they set out to become the new generation of the Iron Lords and wipe out SIVA. A new social space called the Iron Temple was added and is located on Earth at Felwinter Peak, and players have access to a new zone on Earth called the Plaguelands, marking the first time that there are two playable Patrol zones on one planet. In the Plaguelands, players encounter a new faction of Fallen called the Devil Splicers. A new public event called \\"Archon's Forge\\" is also accessible in the Plaguelands; it is similar to The Taken Kings Court of Oryx event. A new strike was also added, as well as a new raid, \\"Wrath of the Machine\\"; the normal version unlocked on September 23 and the hard version unlocked on October 18. The highest obtainable Light level was increased to 400 with the release of the hard raid. A new limited-use flaming battle axe is featured in certain missions, and PvP received a new mode called \\"Supremacy\\", three new maps, as well as the option to make custom private matches in PvP‚Äîprivate matchmaking is available to all players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, regardless if they purchase Rise of Iron. The final update to Destiny released on March 28, 2017. Titled \\"Age of Triumph\\", it added a new 13-page record book, tracking players' progress since the original release of Destiny, and all raids prior to Rise of Iron were increased to Light level 390 with updated rewards that drop at 400 Light; the maximum Light level was not increased. Unlike the base game and the previous three expansions, which were all available on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One, Rise of Iron is only available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Character progression, which was previously shared across consoles of the same family, became separate. Players who pre-ordered Rise of Iron received the \\"Iron Gjallarhorn\\" exotic rocket launcher and the \\"Iron Gjallarwing\\" Sparrow. Like the previous expansions, Rise of Iron had timed exclusives for the PlayStation 4 that lasted until October 2017, and just like with the release of The Taken King, veteran players received commemorative items. A new retail version of Destiny called \\"Destiny: The Collection\\" was released. It features the game and all downloadable content up to and including Rise of Iron. Like The Taken King, players who purchase Rise of Iron receive an item called Spark of Light, although this one boosts one new character to level 40, which is the minimum level needed to play Rise of Irons content. Limited-time events Destiny featured a number of limited-time events, lasting from one to three weeks. Although Year One only featured one limited-time event, Bungie announced in December 2015 that for Year Two, they would focus on doing more of these types of events instead of doing a big DLC pack every few months, like The Dark Below and House of Wolves. =Queen's Wrath= Shortly after the launch of Destiny, a two-week long event began on September 23, 2014 called \\"Queen's Wrath\\" with Petra Venj as its main NPC. This event featured bounties and multiple challenges on existing missions for players to complete to obtain exclusive items. =Festival of the Lost= A two-week long Halloween-themed event began on October 26, 2015 called \\"Festival of the Lost\\" where players could complete quest lines to earn decorative masks for their Guardians. Eva Levante was the main NPC for this event. The masks were of different NPCs and main bosses in the game. During the event, players had to wear certain masks to complete parts of the quests (e.g., complete a heroic strike while wearing The Speaker mask). Masks were rewarded randomly and every player received a mask at the start of the event. Rare masks went away after the event but Legendary ones were kept. New emotes were added to the Eververse Trading Company, including the Zombie Dance, inspired by the \\"Thriller\\" Dance. A new Crucible map, Cathedral of Dusk, was also released during this event. It was available to all players during the event, but became accessible to only those who owned The Taken King after the event. Festival of the Lost returned on October 25, 2016 for two weeks. It featured new quests, including one from new NPC Tyra Karn (added in Rise of Iron) in the Iron Temple, as well as new masks and rewards, in addition to returning ones from the previous year from Eva Levante. Additionally, all Crucible maps were set to nighttime for the duration of the event, and the Vestian Outpost and the Iron Temple were decorated, in addition to the Tower. =Sparrow Racing League and The Dawning= On December 8, 2015, a new three-week long event became available called the \\"Sparrow Racing League\\" (SRL) with Amanda Holliday as its main NPC. In this event, players raced against each other on their sparrows, which Bungie described as a \\"six-player, free-for-all death race through enemy territory.\\" Two race tracks were made specifically for this event: one on Mars and the other on Venus. Maps also featured obstacles, such as enemies who would shoot at players. Through this event, players could earn new sparrows and gear. Helmets and class items could drop with a Light level and could be infused, while other gear only had perks to help while racing. New quest lines and bounties were added for the event. The Eververse Trading Company added new emotes, including the Energetic Dance, inspired by the \\"Jump On It!\\" Dance. Eververse also featured toolkits for new sparrows, horns for the sparrows, and a record book which gave players special SRL objectives; completing those tasks resulted in exclusive gear like an emblem and an armor shader. There was also a PlayStation exclusive quest for the event. The event, however, was only available to players who owned The Taken King. According to Bungie, sparrow racing was originally an experiment to see if players would like it. Sparrow Racing League returned as part of a new three-week holiday event called \\"The Dawning\\" on December 13, 2016. The event introduced a new scoring system for Strikes, with new \\"elite\\" Vanguard bounties. There were also new quests, weapons, and gear, as well as new gifts and treasures. The Tower was also redecorated for the event. SRL itself featured new tracks and new rewards. Some rewards were obtainable through a 2-part record book; the first part were objectives for SRL and the second part were objectives for Strikes. Unlike the previous year, SRL stayed after the conclusion of the event, but can only be accessed in private matches. =Crimson Days= A Valentine's Day-themed event called \\"Crimson Days\\" commenced on February 9, 2016 and lasted for one week. Lord Shaxx was the main NPC of the event with a new quest line and bounties for players. Senior designer Leif Johansen said the reason for its short length was because they \\"[did not] want [the event] to overstay its welcome and drift away from its 'small and fun' goal\\". The event featured a new Crucible mode called Crimson Doubles, which was a two-versus-two Elimination- style mode featuring \\"a special twist\\". The twist was a buff called \\"Broken Heart\\": when a teammate died, the player would get maxed-out stats, giving them a better chance to revive their ally. A teammate's kills counted towards the player's own bounties as well. Players also had the chance to earn exclusive gear. New emotes were also added to the Eververse Trading Company, including the Strange Dance, inspired by the \\"Hotline Bling\\" Dance. This event did not return in 2017.

Panjange spiders exhibit some of the most extraordinary morphology among Pholcidae. Males of most species have eye stalks, sometimes with long pointed processes; males of some species have unusually elongated pedipalps, which in spiders function as copulatory organs; and females of some species have external portions of their genitalia strongly folded and extensible. The biological significance of these sexual modifications remain unclear. Naming and etymology The genus Panjange was established in 1983 by biologists Christa L. Deeleman-Reinhold and P. R. Deeleman, to accommodate four new species. The genus derives from the Malay word panjang, meaning long and slender. Description Male P. camiguin, frontal view, showing elongated eyestalks with pointed processes Panjange spiders are light yellow in color, with brownish patterning on the body. There are six eyes in two small groups: in males the eyes are situated on two stalks or turret-like structures. Species and distribution The 18 species of Panjange are divided into three species groups: the nigrifrons group on Borneo (containing P. bako P. iban, P. nigrifons, and P. sedgwiki); the cavicola group ranging from Sulawesi to northern Australia (comprising P. alba, P. cavicola, P. mirabilis, P. madang, and P. dubia); and the lanthana group in the Philippines, comprising P. bukidnon, P. camiguin, P. casaroro, P. dinagat, P. hamiguitan, P. isarog, P. lanthana, P. malagos, and P. marilog). Natural history Female P. camiguin with egg sac parasitized by a wasp In the Philippines (lanthana group), most species seem to have low abundances and very patchy distributions, with few specimens found within a very small area and none in surrounding areas of apparently similar vegetation. This may have been related to the low abundance and patchiness of suitable large leaves. Specimens are usually collected between about 50 cm above ground to about 2 m, and they are likely to occur also in higher strata of the forest, possibly in higher abundances. The web is a domed sheet, most of which is closely attached to the underside of a leaf. The extremely fine silk is poorly visible except when the sheet is viewed directly from the side. Egg sacs are only slightly elongated and covered by a barely visible layer of silk. In one case (P. camiguin) eight of ten eggs in an egg sac were parasitized by a parasitic wasp.

On average, the long creek contributes about a third of the lower Siuslaw's water volume. Beginning near Prairie Mountain near the Lane‚ÄìBenton county border in the Central Oregon Coast Range, Lake Creek flows generally southeast through the Siuslaw National Forest to the vicinity of Horton, then southwest through the communities of Blachly, Triangle Lake, Greenleaf, and Deadwood. It enters the Siuslaw River at Swisshome, by water from the larger stream's mouth on the Pacific Ocean at Florence. The map includes mile markers along Lake Creek and the Siuslaw River. Transportation Oregon Route 36 runs along the creek from Blachly to Swisshome. Near Greenleaf, a covered bridge known as Lake Creek Bridge or Nelson Mountain Bridge carries Nelson Mountain Road over the creek. Nelson Road meets Route 36 just north of the bridge. The bridge is on the National Register of Historic Places. Recreation =Picnicking= The Bureau of Land Management oversees the Lake Creek Falls recreation site downstream of Triangle Lake. Open all year, the site is used for picnicking, swimming, and viewing runs of steelhead and coho and Chinook salmon as they travel upstream to spawn. The BLM added a fish ladder at this site in 1989; it opened additional stream-miles to migrating fish. The BLM also manages a site at Hult Reservoir, also known as Hult Pond, along Lake Creek upstream of Horton. Possible activities include picnicking, boating, and warm-water fishing. Amenities include a boat launch and toilets. Nearby is the Hult Equestrian Staging Area for horse riding on trails. =Whitewater boating= Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run an stretch between Deadwood on Lake Creek and Tide on the Siuslaw River. Various parts of the run are rated from class I (novice) to class IV (advanced) on the International Scale of River Difficulty, depending on location and flow rates. Hazards include rapids called \\"The Horn\\" and \\"Bus Stop\\" with large waves and rocks. Along the river below the confluence with the creek, a sometimes-submerged human-made structure poses danger to boaters. =Fishing= Lake Creek supports populations of steelhead, Chinook salmon, and cutthroat trout that can be legally caught under certain conditions. Fishing for wild steelhead is catch and release, but some finclipped hatchery steelhead can be kept. Fishing for Chinook is allowed below Deadwood Creek. Cutthroat fishing is legal along the main stem but not the tributaries. Fishing for coho salmon, which also frequent the creek, is prohibited. Other regulations may apply depending on species, season, and location. Tributaries Named tributaries of Lake Creek from source to mouth are Billy Tower Canyon followed by Congdon, Swartz, Village, Conrad, Pope, Post, and Swamp creeks. Then come Pontiss, Little Lake, Spring Canyon, Fish, Lamb, and Greenleaf creeks. Further downstream are Steinhauer, Wheeler, Nelson, Wilcut, Hollo, Johnston, Deadwood, and Indian creeks.

The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. An authorization bill is a type of legislation used in the United States to authorize the activities of the various agencies and programs that are part of the federal government of the United States. Authorizing such programs is one of the powers of the United States Congress. Authorizations give those things the legal power to operate and exist. Provisions of the act A summary of provisions of the Act is available on the Congress.gov website and include the following: *Authorizes annual appropriations of $17.5 billion primarily for Coast Guard activities for both fiscal years 2016 and 2017. *Requires the Coast Guard to submit to congress a manpower requirements plan every four years. *Makes funds available for the design and construction of an icebreaker that is capable of buoy tending to enhance icebreaking capacity on the Great Lakes, and for preacquisition activities for a new polar icebreaker. *Sets end-of-year strength at 43,000 active duty members for FY 2016 and 2017, unchanged from FY 2015. *Upgrades the office of the Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard from the rank of Vice Admiral to Admiral. *Allows for the appointment of five Vice Admirals, up from four. *Requires the implementation of a standard for tracking operational days at sea for Coast Guard cutters. *Requires the establishment an education program, for members and employees of the Coast Guard, that offers a master's degree in maritime operations. *Requires the use of a multi-rater assessment (to include peers and subordinates) for Flag officers and SES, and an assessment of feasibility for all other members. *Requires a process to account for the number of safety zones established for permitted marine events and an account of Coast Guard resources to enforce these safety zones. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office for the related bill , as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on April 30, 2015. This is a public domain source. This act authorizes appropriations totaling $17.5 billion, primarily for ongoing operations of the Coast Guard and FMC over the 2016-2017 period. The act amends laws that govern the activities of Coast Guard, FMC, and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation. Assuming appropriation of the specified amounts, CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $16.6 billion over the 2016-2020 period. This act imposes private-sector mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), on sponsors of marine events and manufacturers of small boats. Based on information from USCG and industry experts, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandates would fall below the annual threshold in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($154 million in 2015, adjusted for inflation). Procedural history The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on December 8, 2015 by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R, CA-50). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. It passed the House by voice vote on December 10, 2015 and the passed the Senate with an amendment by voice vote on December 18, 2015. The House agreed to the Senate amendment by voice vote on February 1, 2016. The act was signed into law by President Obama on February 8, 2016. Prior to this, another related bill, had passed the House by voice vote on May 18, 2015. Debate and discussion Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA) said the following in support of the bill: \\"The bill makes several reforms to Coast Guard authorities, as well as laws governing shipping and navigation. Specifically, the bill supports Coast Guard servicemembers, improves Coast Guard mission effectiveness, enhances oversight of the Coast Guard programs, encourages job growth in the maritime sector by cutting regulatory burdens on job creators, strengthens maritime drug enforcement laws, and increases coordination with partner nations, further strengthening port security. It does all this in a way that allows this to be brought under suspension in a bipartisan way.\\" Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA) was also in support of the bill, and stated the following: \\"It is clear that we are at the advent of Arctic operations for the Coast Guard, and it is vital that the service has the icebreaking capabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively in this very unforgiving maritime environment. The bill will advance the completion of the materiel assessment of the Polar Sea to determine, finally, if this heavy icebreaker can be returned to service. Additionally, this legislation authorized funding to allow the Coast Guard to maintain progress in developing requirements and preliminary design for a new heavy icebreaker.\\" \\"I am also pleased that this legislation includes language that will continue to preserve the remaining LORAN‚ÄìC infrastructure until such time as the administration makes a final decision on whether or not to build out an enhanced LORAN or eLORAN infrastructure to provide a reliable, land-based, low-frequency backup navigation timing signal to back up GPS, the Global Positioning System.\\" See also *List of acts of the 114th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4188 *Congress.gov H.R. 4188 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4188 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4188 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4188 Category:Acts of the 114th United States Congress Category:United States Coast Guard ","title":"Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015"},{"id":"49379054","text":"Triin is an Estonian feminine given name.

Flag icons denote the first announcements of confirmed cases by the respective nation-states, their first deaths (and other events such as their first reported cases of microcephaly and major public health announcements), and relevant sessions and announcements of the World Health Organization (WHO), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as relevant virological, epidemiological, and entomological studies. Timeline The date of the first confirmations of the disease or any event in a country may be before or after the date of the events in local time because of the International Dateline. = 1947‚Äì1983 = Uganda The Zika virus is first isolated in 1947 in a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest near Entebbe, Uganda, and first recovered from an Aedes africanus mosquito in 1948. Serological evidence indicates additional human exposure and/or presence in some mosquito species between 1951 and 1981 in parts of Africa (Uganda and Tanzania having the first detection of antibody in humans, in 1952, followed by isolation of the virus from a young girl in Nigeria in 1954 during an outbreak of jaundice, and experimental infection in a human volunteer in 1956. The virus was then found variously in Egypt, Central African Republic, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Gabon; Between 1969 and 1983, Zika was found in equatorial Asia including India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan. Zika is generally found in mosquitoes and monkeys in a band of countries stretching across equatorial Africa) and Asia (Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia). The first confirmed case of Zika fever in a human occurs in Uganda during 1964 in a field researcher, who experiences a mild, non-itchy rash. = 2007 = Federated States of Micronesia The first major outbreak is identified outside of Africa and Asia, on Yap Island. Previously only 14 cases of Zika fever had been documented since the virus had first been identified in 1947. Approximately 5,005 people, more than 70% of the population of 7,391, were infected with Zika, and generally exhibited mild symptoms; no cases of microcephaly were reported. = 2008 = United States The first case of sexual transmission is reported, that of a scientist who had fallen ill in Senegal who thereafter infected his wife. = 2012 = Researchers identify two distinct lineages of the Zika virus, African and Asian. = 2013‚Äì2014 = French Polynesia In October 2013, an independent outbreak of the Zika virus occurred in the Society, Marquesas and Tuamotu Islands of French Polynesia. The outbreak abated in October 2014, with 8,723 suspected cases of Zika reported. The true number of Zika cases was estimated at more than 30,000. An unusual rise in neurological syndromes is reported, including 42 cases of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (GBS); typically five cases are reported in a three-month timeframe. French Polynesia On 20 March, researchers discover that two mothers and their newborns test positive for Zika, perinatal transmission confirmed by polymerase chain reaction performed on serum collected within four days of birth during the outbreak. French Polynesia On 31 March, researchers on Tahiti report that 2.8% of blood donors between November 2013 and February 2014 tested positive for the Zika virus, of which 3% were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation. This indicated a potential risk of transmission of the Zika virus through blood transfusions, but there were no confirmed cases of this occurring. French Polynesia On 13 December, a patient recovering from Zika infection on Tahiti seeks treatment for bloody sperm. Zika virus is isolated from his semen, adding to the evidence that Zika can be sexually transmitted. Japan In December 2013, a Japanese tourist returning to Japan was diagnosed with Zika virus infection by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases after visiting the French Polynesian island of Bora Bora, becoming the first imported case of Zika fever in Japan. New Caledonia In January 2014, indigenous cases of Zika virus infection were reported in New Caledonia. The outbreak peaked in April, with the number of confirmed cases reaching 1,400 by 17 September. Cook Islands In February 2014, an outbreak of Zika started in the Cook Islands. The outbreak ended on 29 May, with 50 confirmed and 932 suspected cases of Zika virus infection.

The company develops, manufactures and sells optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks, These products include transceivers, tunable lasers, high bandwidth receivers, optical semiconductors, photonic integrated circuits, and 100 gigabit per second and above modules.\\" These are each \\"cost-effective components that handle massive amounts of data at very high speeds\\". NeoPhotonics products primarily implement coherent technology and include those designed for 100G and beyond data rates, such as at 200G, 400G and 600G, for telecom and datacenter or content provider networks and applications. The company's high speed 100G and beyond coherent products are based on Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology. Applications in coherent transmission use not only amplitude but also phase and polarization to increase data rates tenfold or more over conventional ‚Äúon-off‚Äù transmission protocols. Coherent transmission is also necessary for next-generation flexible and efficient switching of signals individual wavelength without conflict or contention between wavelengths in an optical network, such as Software Defined Networks. Coherent transmission has become the technology of choice for the most advanced high speed telecommunications networks today. Revenues from the company's high speed products have grown rapidly due to the rapid expansion of telecom backbone and content provider networks accommodating increased mobile traffic. Initial adoption of the company's 100G coherent products were in the Long Haul market sector, over the next several years it is expect that growth in 100G and beyond will be mainly driven by adoption of 100G coherent products in the much larger Metro market sector and the datacenter market for large web-scale data network market. NeoPhotonics Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NPTN. History The company was co-founded by Chinese-born Sean Bi and Japanese-born Nobuyuki Kambe in 1996. The two men were introduced by one of Bi's professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Meanwhile, the company received an initial investment of US$1 million from Pete Thomas at Institutional Venture Partners. The company was initially called NanoGram Corporation, and pursued development of technologies and applications using inorganic nanomaterials. The company changed its name to NeoPhotonics Corporation in 2002. At that time, and according to Forbes, in 2002, in the midst of the tech bubble, the company was reorganized into three companies: NanoGram Devices, which kept the battery- making technology for medical devices; NeoPhotonics, which went after the optical devices market; and a third firm, NanoGram Corp., which initially managed the intellectual property and then further developed optical and polymer films using nanomaterials. It also received US$35 million from investors in 2002. In early 2003 the company acquired Lightwave Microsystems, a manufacturer of silica-on-silica passive integrated optical products. Late that year, again in 2003, the company filed for reorganization under bankruptcy. Shortly thereafter, after completing their reorganization and exiting bankruptcy, the company sold NanoGram Devices for approximately US$45 million to Greatbatch Technologies. In 2005, the company acquired ownership in Photo Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese manufacturer of optoelectric devices and modules, based in Shenzhen, China. By 2006 they acquired most all of Photon's outstanding shares. In the following years, NeoPhotonics further acquired optical component companies Optun, Inc., Lightconnect, Inc., BeamExpress, Inc., Santur, Inc., Oki Semiconductor, Inc. and Paxera Corp. The company completed is initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange on February 2, 2011. As of October 2016, the market capitalization of NeoPhotonics Corporation was approximately $700 million. As of June 2016, the company owned approximately 550 US patents and 100 patents overseas. The company operates manufacturing in Silicon Valley, California; Tokyo, Japan; and Shenzhen, China.

Also prominent is the author D. H. Lawrence and his German wife Frieda who have fled from London to an isolated farmhouse nearby and befriend Clare. But all is not well as John is suffering from shell-shock, and Frieda is suspected by the authorities of signaling to pass U-boats... Inspiration Asked about the appearance of D.H Lawrence in the novel, Dunmore explained \\"Their story needed to be told. We know the bare bones of what happened ‚Äì but what was it like for him and Frieda in this landscape? The details intrigued me: Lawrence creating a garden, growing things like salsify, getting in tons of manure. He knew how to do practical things ‚Äì the ironing, the washing ‚Äì and his combination of day-to-day good sense and the life of the mind fascinated me. I felt there were some interesting things about that particular period and about what turned him against England.\\" Reception *Elaine Feinstein writing in The Independent concludes \\"Zennor In Darkness is the first novel, and far from flawless; Helen Dunmore moves too readily from one person's consciousness to another, and at first the present tense seems awkward, even pretentious.

The film, directed by Jane Marsh and produced by James Beveridge, was an account of the Canadian military during the Second World War. The film's French version title is Canada en guerre.  Synopsis  Canada in the 1930s was a peaceful nation with limitless potential and great resources of timberlands, prairie wheat fields and bountiful fisheries. After the outbreak of the Second World War, Canada was transformed into a nation at war. Thousands of recruits entered the military to begin their training. The first concern was to buttress the borders of a country with 24,000 miles of coastline to defend. On the home front, industrial production soared with factories converting to munitions and other weapons of war. By 1942, Canada is the \\"aerodrome of democracy\\" with its involvement in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Canada trained thousands of airmen from the Royal Air Force (RAF), Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA), Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the United States Army Air Corps and Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) (as well as airmen from many other countries) from bases stretching across the country. In a spirit of democratic cooperation with other Allied/United Nations, Canadians responded to the needs of war, both in Canada and globally. In cooperation with the United States, one of the great strategic projects was the Alaska Highway where Canada's created the Northwest Staging Route to fly aircraft from North America to Asia. By the fourth year of the war, Canada's fighting men and women are also engaged in battles on land, sea and air, pitted against the might of Nazi Germany and its allies. Production Typical of the NFB's Second World War documentary short films in the Canada Carries On series, Inside Fighting Canada was made in cooperation with the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.\\"Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women.\\"The Winnipeg Tribune, April 18, 1941. Retrieved: February 9, 2016. The film was created as a morale boosting propaganda film. \\"The film [Inside Fighting Canada] was making an important point. Audiences had seen in earlier films how the Nazis were building their empire upon a modern form of medieval slavery. Democracy built its defences with the voluntary effort of people exercising their own free will. Here then was the implied comparison between the two systems and democracy stood supreme. Characteristically, no mention was made of conscription, which had split the nation badly in the spring of 1942.\\"Evans 1984, p. 134.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia.

After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two.

World War II, Communism, unemployment, the role of labour unions, and working conditions were all subjects featured by the NFB during the period from 1939 to 1946\\".Khouri 2007, back cover. Khouri further stated: \\"\\"As it stresses the importance of women's contribution during the war, 'Inside Fighting Canada' emphasizes that this effort should not be conceived as a 'temporary war measure,' and that instead, it should be considered the start for a new era where women can equally contribute to building a better future for the entire society.\\"Khouri 2007, pp. 139‚Äì140.

There have been more than 300 limited-edition seasonal and regional flavors of Kit Kat chocolate bars produced in Japan since 2000. Nestl√©, which operates the Kit Kat brand in Japan, reports that the brand overtook Meiji Chocolate as the top-selling confection in Japan from 2012 to 2014. The company's marketing campaign, which partnered with Japan Post to sell the bar in 20,000 post offices, won an award in 2010. The campaign encouraged associations of the product's name with the coincidental cognate , translated as \\"You will surely win\\", and could be mailed as a good luck charm for students ahead of university exams.  History  A Japanese edition Kit Kat Kit Kats were introduced to Japan in 1973 when Rowntree's made an agreement with Fujiya. In 2014, they were the top-selling confection in the country. The Kit Kat brand took the number one sales position from Meiji chocolate in 2012, though Meiji remains the leading confection company in Japan overall. In 2004, the green tea flavor was introduced. Since then, the product has been sold in more than 300 seasonal and regional flavors. The top- selling flavor of the candy bar in 2010 was soy sauce. Nestl√© attributes the success of the flavor varieties to the tradition of omiyage, in which regional specialties are brought back for family and co-workers from trips away. The company believes the limited-edition seasonal models create a \\"scarcity and rarity of value\\" for customers. The business model was created to solve a problem the company found in Japanese convenience stores, which frequently rotated items and flavors off of shelves. By producing smaller runs of flavors, the company was better able to control its production costs. It was also economically viable in Japan because there is no initial product fee for listing new products in Japanese convenience stores. Kit Kats in Japan are produced at Nestl√©-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura. The milk chocolate used for Kit Kats is made from whole-milk powder and Nestl√© buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa.  Marketing  A train car with Kit Kat logos in Japan Marketing for Kit Kats in Japan is believed to have benefited from the coincidental false cognate with \\"Kitto Katsu\\", a phrase meaning \\"You will surely win\\" in Japanese. Some market research has shown that the brand is strongly correlated to good luck charms, particularly among students ahead of exams. Kit Kat's \\"Lucky Charm\\" advertising campaign in Japan won the Asian Brand Marketing Effectiveness Award in 2005. Nestl√© and the Japan Post launched a campaign in 2009, allowing people to write messages and mail the chocolate bars from 20,000 post offices. The special packages included a space to write a message of encouragement and affix a stamp. The promotional packages were sold out within a month. That campaign won the Media Grand Prix in 2010's Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.  Varieties  Japanese Strawberry Kit Kat bar The Kit Kat Chocolatory, with recipes designed by chef Yasumasa Takagi, opened in 2014, and had expanded to seven branches by 2015. The company claims it has served more than 1 million customers and earned more than 2 billion yen. These shops sell high-end Kit Kat products such as raspberry-infused dark chocolate, orange-chocolate rum, and sakura green tea. A variety of Takagi's flavors have been introduced as seasonal products, including flavors such as \\"plum, passion fruit and chilli, ginger and kinako soybean powder\\". In 2016, Nestl√© introduced a sake Kit Kat, which combines sake powder with white chocolate. Some varieties are restricted to a specific region associated with that particular bar. Others are limited- run varieties, with excess supply saved for year-end \\"happy bag\\" specials. In 2015, 500 single-finger bitter chocolate bars were sold with gold leaf wrapping for about $16 in high-end retail shops. Notable varieties include adzuki (red bean), beni imo (purple sweet potato), brown sugar syrup, matcha (green tea), and soy sauce. The cafe shop Pronto has introduced croissants incorporating Kit Kats. Pizza chains Napoli no Kama and Strawberry Cones introduced dessert pizzas with bakeable Kit Kat toppings in March 2014. In October 2018, Nestle opened a Kit Kat store at Namba Station in Osaka. = Additional varieties = References External links  Category:Japanese brand foods Category:Food and drink in Japan Category:Japanese desserts and sweets Category:Japanese confectionery Category:Chocolate bars Category:Nestl√© brands ","title":"Kit Kats in Japan"},{"id":"49379449","text":"A Foreign Affair (AFA) is an international dating and marriage agency that promotes romance tours for American men to meet women in Latin America, Southeast Asia, China, Russia, and other CIS countries. AFA founders testified at court hearings in Washington when Senator Cantwell first pushed for the implementation of the 2005 International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA), which, along with the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, is designed to protect women from potential abuse. Officially, the company is an international marriage agency/broker under IMBRA.  Critical reception  A feature on ABC's Nightline covered an AFA meetup in Odessa, Ukraine and found that while many of the women who attended the meetup were genuinely interested in finding an ideal match with an American man, others seemed to be taking advantage of the men by attempting to convince them to buy expensive gifts. In the segment, owner John Adams does not dispute the fact that some men may fall victim to scamming, though he says that such instances are rare. A BBC reporter also attended a meetup in Ukraine and interviewed several attendees, finding that many of the men attended because they were frustrated about the prospects of finding an ideal match in the US, while many women attended in search of a partner who was responsible and could provide them with a better life. A 2011 The Today Show segment featured AFA and one of its founders in light of the mail-order bride industry's success after the 2008 recession. The segment explored some common negative perceptions about the mail-order bride industry, along with concerns that relationships precipitated by websites like AFA might not be completely equal; for instance, the host was concerned that women might be pushed into such relationships due to socioeconomic factors out of their control. AFA was also featured in a National Geographic documentary called Bachelors Abroad, a feature documentary called Love Me, Our America with Lisa Ling, and an episode of MTV's Sex 2K.

Geography  Since the 19th century, observers have deemed Ensenada Honda among the safest Caribbean harbors. Its irregular coastline features rocky cliffs, sandy beaches, and mangrove forests. Three smaller inlets gate the cavernous cove: \\"Malena\\" and \\"Dakity\\" to the west, and \\"Mosquito\\" to the east. A number of distinct coral specimens inhabit the area around Culebra, and some communities have flourished at the very bay's entrance. They form bars barely above sea level and block portions of its opening.  Environmental history  For most of the 20th century (1902-1975) the bay served as grounds for military training, as wreckage left from the time reveals. Explosions and the resulting contamination left pulverized underwater craters and diminished the health of sea life. But low-tech, community-based programs and coral grafting have expanded the reefs' fields and increased their bio-diversity. The bay is today an eco-tourist destination, celebrated for its turtles, and the center of the local fishing industry.

Its one likely claim to recognition was that it would give the Motor City a radio building business. In those days it was known, somewhat pretentiously, as Detrola Corporation of Detroit.\\" They may well have been the world's most prolific manufacturer of private brand radios for department stores and small retailers, likely building sets under more than 100 different brand names. The company also manufactured large quantities of radios under the Truetone name for Western Auto and Silvertone brand for Sears. Popular models were the \\"Super Pee Wee\\" and \\"Catalin 281\\" known for being cheap economy sets. At the company's height in 1936, Detrola claimed to be \\"The sixth largest radio manufacturer in the United States\\" and had about 1,000 employees, and sales representatives in many cities and foreign countries. Detrola Model 579 (1946) radio, made of plywood In 1941, Detrola became a supplier of war supplies, most notably land mine detectors, aircraft radios, and electrical panels for ships. Ross sold out his interests in the company to the International Machine Tool Company, which was a conglomerate led by C. Russell Feldmann. After World War II, Detrola resumed civilian production but decided not to branch off into the television set market. However, production costs became high and there were serious union issues. The company struggled to keep up with larger manufacturers. The company sold off its thriving auto radio manufacturing business to Motorola in the summer of 1948, then stopped all manufacturing later in 1948. As of 2016, Crosley Radio has revived the Detrola namesake for a reproduction radio.

It is about 120 km from Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan. The Project commenced commercial operations on 23 March 2013 and has the distinction of being Pakistan and AJ&K;‚Äôs first hydropower IPP. By developing a bankable framework this trendsetting project has paved the way for rapid and full scale development of Pakistan and AJ&K;‚Äôs hydropower potential. The Project is jointly owned by Hubpower (HUBCO) and Laraib Group with an equity split of 75% and 25% respectively. The Project has been developed under Build-Own-Operate- Transfer (BOOT) basis, whereby it would be transferred to the Government of AJ&K; free of cost at the end of a 25-year term.  Financing and cost  The Project achieved Financial Closing on December 20, 2009. Total Project cost is estimated at about US$235 million and financing is arranged at debt equity ratio of 75/25. USD financing has been provided by Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, International Finance Corporation, and the French origin Soci√©t√© de Promotion et de Participation pour la Coop√©ration Economique (‚ÄúPROPARCO‚Äù) whereas PKR financing has been provided by Habib Bank Limited (‚ÄúHBL‚Äù) and National Bank of Pakistan (‚ÄúNBP‚Äù).  Construction  The construction of the Project started on December 29, 2009 under a fixed price, time certain EPC Contract executed with Sambu Construction Company Limited of South Korea (‚ÄúSambu‚Äù) in June 2009. The water to wire E&M; equipment package has been supplied by a leading E&M; supplier; Andritz Hydro under a subcontract with Sambu. Hyundai Engineering is the design subcontractor of the EPC Contractor. Construction of the Project was monitored by Owner‚Äôs Engineer consisting of joint venture of Montgomery Watson Harza (‚ÄúMWH‚Äù) and National Engineering Services of Pakistan (‚ÄúNESPAK‚Äù) while Mott MacDonald of UK are the Technical Advisors to the Financiers and were responsible for construction and environmental monitoring on their behalf.  Operation  The Project achieved commercial operation date on March 23, 2013 which was two months ahead of the required commercial operations date under the PPA. The Operation and Maintenance of the Project is being carried out by TNB REMACO Pakistan (Private) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of TNB Repair and Maintenance SDN BHD which is ultimately owned by Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Malaysia. The Project insurances have been placed offshore with leading insurance companies through Marsh, who are the Insurance Advisor and Broker of Record for the Project.  Distribution  Other Concession Documents package includes the GOP Implementation Agreement with Government of Pakistan, AJ&K; Implementation Agreement with AJ&K; Entities (i.e. Government of AJ&K; and AJ&K; Council), Water Use Agreement with Government of AJ&K; and Land Lease Agreements with Government of AJ&K.; Under its guarantee (.i.e. the GOP Guarantee), Government of Pakistan has guaranteed the payment obligations of NTDC, Government of Pakistan and Government of AJ&K; under the Concession Documents.  Hydrology and technical details  A concrete lined Head-race channel is used to convey the water from Bong Pond to Powerhouse. The Project does not involve the construction of a dam or reservoir nor does it affect the existing water management regimes. It withdraws water released from the existing Mangla Dam and returns that water to the main stem of the Jhelum River through a 7.5 km long tailrace constructed in a sub-channel of the River Jhelum. The Project does not affect upstream or downstream hydrology of the Jhelum River due to its run of the river nature and is having positive environmental and social impacts. Energy generated through the four 21 MW low head high efficiency Kaplan bulb turbines, housed in a semi submerged powerhouse complex, is evacuated through an in-out connecting arrangement with the double circuit 132 kVA Mangla/Kharian transmission line, which passes over the Project site. No right-of-way acquisition was needed since connection facility has been built within the Project site. The Project uses the water being discharged from the upstream existing hydropower plant (1,000 MW Mangla Hydroelectric Power Station) located at Mangla Dam. The raising of Mangla Dam has been completed recently by the Pakistan‚Äôs Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and will result in increase in the storage capacity of the Mangla Dam (‚ÄúMangla Dam Raise Project‚Äù). The Mangla Dam Raise Project will provide better regulated water to the Project. Noteworthy achievements  Pakistan's first Independent hydropower Plant (IPP), it was awarded Middle East Renewable Deal of the Year 2009 by Euromoney. New Bong Escape was also the first Hydropower Project in Pakistan/AJ&K; to be registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project by CDM Executive Board under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on January 31, 2009.

The song features guest vocals from American rapper Fetty Wap. It was released on March 18, 2016, as the ninth track on This Is What the Truth Feels Like by Interscope Records. The track was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Tor Hermansen, Mikkel Eriksen, and Fetty Wap. The track's production was handled by Stargate, while additional production was made by Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. Musically, \\"Asking 4 It\\" is a hip hop and trap influenced track, made clear especially in Fetty Wap's rap verse. Lyrically, the song discusses someone's doubts while in a relationship, presumably Stefani referring to her recent divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale. Upon release, \\"Asking 4 It\\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Some critics labeled the song as \\"trippy\\" and a \\"club stomper\\", while others called it \\"dated\\" and questioned its \\"awkward\\" placement on the album. The track was included on the set list for her 2016 concert series This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour.  Background and release  Shortly after the lukewarm response to singles \\"Baby Don't Lie\\" and \\"Spark the Fire\\", Stefani scrapped any material worked on for her then upcoming third studio album. Stefani's record label, Interscope Records, approached her to consider the idea of working with new songwriters and producers, such as Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, to which she agreed. During her recording sessions with Michaels and Tranter, Stefani became interested in working with new collaborators. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Stefani felt that Fetty Wap had \\"a voice with so much character\\", so she subsequently told her team that she wanted to collaborate with him. In the same interview, Stefani stated she was surprised the collaboration even happened due to scheduling conflicts concerning Fetty Wap: \\"Asking 4 It\\" was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Tor Hermansen, Mikkel Eriksen, and Fetty Wap. It was produced by Stargate, while additional production was handled by Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. The track was mixed by Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent, while Mike Anderson and Miles Walker handled recording and tracking. Fetty Wap is the only featured artist on the album. On February 12, 2016, This Is What the Truth Feels Like became available for pre- order on iTunes Store. Nearly a month later, \\"Asking 4 It\\" became available for purchase on March 18, along with the rest of the album.  Composition and lyrics  \\"Asking 4 It\\" has been described as a hip hop and trap song, backed by a rapped verse by Fetty Wap, with a length of three minutes and thirty seconds. A writer for Hitsync described \\"Asking 4 It\\" as a \\"bopping, hip hop tinged beat flecked with dancey synths.\\" Chris Mench of Complex described the inclusion of Fetty Wap as Stefani \\"call[ing] upon one modern-day hit maker\\", while Clara Hudson of The Daily Free Press called this move \\"gimmicky\\". Lyrically, \\"Asking 4 It\\" discusses several topics, including a lover's doubts while in a relationship; Stefani sings \\"You're giving me truth and it's such an unfamiliar subject\\", which ET Online described as \\"a sultry take on the uncertainty of a new romance.\\" The song was inspired by her divorce from Bush lead singer, Gavin Rossdale; Stefani wrote several songs during these recording sessions to start \\"a new chapter in her life\\". In an interview with Today's Matt Lauer, Stefani stated that the majority of her recent studio work would discuss her breakup with Rossdale. Billboard stated that the lyrics \\"Are you sure you wanna love me? / I know that it's a lot to handle me / But it is what it is / It's all part of my broken history\\" were \\"ultra personal\\". In his description of the track, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that \\"'Asking 4 It' strikes at the heart of pop radio\\" while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media described \\"Asking 4 It\\" as \\"the album's sole feature atop an unconvincing beat.\\" Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter felt that the album's \\"sound cools down a little\\", but that the track \\"is still easy to dance to\\".  Critical reception  Upon release, \\"Asking 4 It\\" received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. In a highly positive review, Leonie Cooper of NME praised Stefani for her \\"nonchalant divorc√©e swagger\\" on the track, later calling \\"Asking 4 It\\" a standout track on the album. Similarly, Mesfin Fekadu of The Washington Post called the track a \\"high point\\". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times favored the track, labeling it as \\"trippy\\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt dubbed \\"Asking 4 It\\" as a \\"come-on disguised as [a] caution\\"; Greenblatt further praised the song for being a \\"stomper\\". In a negative review of \\"Asking 4 It\\", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the track \\"dated\\" and \\"no more worthy of Stefani's emotional exorcism than 2014's stale 'Spark the Fire'\\". Emily Blake of Mashable thought that \\"Asking 4 It\\" was \\"an out-of-place hip-hop track\\", while Jordan Miller of BreatheHeavy felt that the song was \\"vulnerable\\" and unfavorably predicted that it will \\"probably become a single\\" in the future. Daniel Bromfield of Pretty Much Amazing panned \\"Asking 4 It\\" but enjoyed Fetty Wap's contribution to the track; Bromfield thought \\"it's tragic how completely [Fetty Wap] upstages Stefani\\" and how Fetty Wap showed emotion during his verse while Stefani did not.  Live performances  \\"Asking 4 It\\" was selected by Stefani for inclusion at her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour (2016). The song was included during Act 3 of the concert series, immediately following a performance of Talk Talk's \\"It's My Life\\". On the opening night of the tour on July 12 at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield, Massachusetts, the show was broadcast live through a feed generated by Live Nation Entertainment and Yahoo! Music. It was accompanied with \\"bumptious hip hop beats\\", alongside the singer wearing a green corset designed by The Blonds, in addition to Mariel Haenn and Rob Zangardi.

J.) Winer (June 18, 1917 - May 30, 1984) was an American research psychologist and academic. He served as a psychology professor at Purdue University and was president of the Psychometric Society. He has been listed as one of the most highly cited psychologists in the United States, having authored a well-known textbook on statistical analysis. Biography Born in Oregon, Winer attended the University of Oregon and he served as a personnel research bureau assistant for the psychology department head, Howard Taylor. He earned a master's degree in psychology from Oregon in 1940 before serving in the military for five years. He held positions with the United States Civil Service Commission and The Pentagon while he took evening graduate courses in statistics at George Washington University. After briefly attending graduate school at Princeton University, Winer went to Ohio State University, where he earned a Ph.D. in industrial psychology in 1951. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina and he received joint teaching appointments in statistics and psychology at Purdue University in 1954. He had a full-time appointment in the psychology department by 1956, but statistical analysis remained a strong area of emphasis for him. Working with Andrew Halpin, Winer studied behavioral approaches to leadership. They concluded that two concepts, initiating structure and consideration, characterized the behavior of successful leadership. Winer was the 1967-68 president of the Psychometric Society. In 1983, he received a Quantitative Methods Teaching Award from the American Psychological Foundation. He authored an influential textbook, Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. The book was reviewed in journals including Educational and Psychological Measurement, Ergonomics and the Journal of the American Statistical Association. In 2002, Winer was ranked fourth on a list of American psychologists most frequently cited in the professional literature; Statistical Principles in Experimental Design remains his most cited work by far. Upon his death, Winer left a gift to Purdue to further the study of mathematical psychology. The university established a memorial lecture series in his honor. A distinguished professorship at the school was named after him in 1998.

It was released on March 18, 2016, along with the rest of This Is What the Truth Feels Like by Interscope Records. The track was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, and Greg Kurstin; Kurstin was the track's sole producer. \\"Rare\\" is an electropop and folk pop influenced song and serves as the album's closing track. Lyrically, the song discusses finding love when all hope was lost. Several media outlets speculated that \\"Rare\\" was written about Stefani's boyfriend Blake Shelton and his ex-wife Miranda Lambert. \\"Rare\\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, some of which called the song \\"glamorous\\" and predicted that it would become a future \\"summer hit\\".  Background  In 2013, following Stefani's work with No Doubt, she enlisted the help of Greg Kurstin to write and produce songs for her upcoming third studio album. After Stefani's 2014 single releases, \\"Baby Don't Lie\\" and \\"Spark the Fire\\", received mixed responses, she scrapped all of her completed material for the opportunity to start fresh. A year later, Stefani enlisted other potential collaborators, like Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, for work on the album shortly after she announced her divorce from Gavin Rossdale. Stefani later revealed that during the writing of several songs, including \\"Rare\\", she and Michaels had taken \\"stream-of-conscious\\" lyrics from her computer and fit them into melodies. \\"Rare\\" was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, and Greg Kurstin; Kurstin serves as the track's sole producer. The track was mixed by Serban Ghenea, with John Hanes and Phil Seaford serving as assistant mixing engineers; Julian Burg and Alex Pasco were in charge of recording, with Stephen Felix serving as an assistant recorder. \\"Rare\\" became available for purchase on March 18, along with the rest of This Is What the Truth Feels Like. Blake Shelton, Stefani's boyfriend, declared on Twitter that \\"Rare\\" was his favorite song on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, to which Stefani tweeted back \\"Wonder who that one is about?\\", alluding to the fact that it was written about him. Several of the songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like were written about Shelton, including the \\"Rare\\" and the album's second single, \\"Make Me Like You\\"; even though her writing sessions began with lyrics revolving her breakup with Rossdale, the songs slowly became centered on her newly found relationship with Shelton.  Composition and lyrics  \\"Rare\\" includes lyrics reportedly written about Blake Shelton's ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. Musically, \\"Rare\\" is an electropop and folk pop influenced ballad, that has \\"an acoustic guitar and galloping beat\\". Lyrically, \\"Rare\\" discusses finding love in the \\"perfect\\" man, presumably Shelton. Patrick Ryan of USA Today called \\"Rare\\" an \\"outright declaration of love for Shelton\\", summarizing the song as \\"a rare moment of vulnerability for the singer who, for the most part, keeps her emotions close to her vest.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly declared the song a \\"sweetly smitten confessional\\". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the lyrics as \\"her shock to have found someone this late in the game\\", while Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe felt that the lyrics observe \\"that 'only a stupid girl' would let the 'perfect' man go.\\" After the release of This Is What the Truth Feels Like, several news outlets speculated that the lyrics of \\"Rare\\" may be written about Shelton's ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. An article from Fox News reported that \\"the lyrics appear to be a slam at Lambert for letting Shelton go\\", particularly \\"You're rare / And only a stupid girl would let it go\\". Andrew Leung of Music Mic, who described the song as \\"a mid-tempo love ballad\\", also thought that the same lyrics pointed towards Lambert. Lauren DuBois of EnStars stated that \\"the song seems to allege that [Lambert] was the one who walked away from the relationship she had with Shelton, not the other way around.\\" Gossip website Hollywoodlife.com stated that in the song, Stefani praises Shelton but \\"totally disses Lambert\\".  Critical reception  \\"Rare\\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the closing track, calling it \\"tender\\". Leah Greenblatt, writing for Entertainment Weekly, said that Stefani \\"sound[s] like the world's most glamorous high school sophomore, passing mash notes after study hall.\\" USA Today's Patrick Ryan praised \\"Rare\\" and declared the track \\"one dance remix away from being a certifiable summer smash.\\" Stephen Sears of Idolator called the track \\"elegant and even-keeled\\" and said Stefani \\"[will] buck modern radio\\" with \\"Rare\\". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the song and called it an \\"album-closing ode to joy\\", further stating the track \\"uses its star's distinctive voice for moments of multi-tracked beauty or play; often there's a lovely sensation of floating upwards.\\" As the album's closing track, Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter appreciated the \\"vulnerable side of Stefani\\" and noted how it slows the album's pace down. However, Chuck Campbell of Go Knoxville gave the song a negative review, describing Stefani's vocals as \\"a pale facsimile of Ariana Grande\\".  Live performances  \\"Rare\\" was selected by Stefani for inclusion at her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour (2016). The song was included during Act 3 of the concert series, immediately following a performance of No Doubt's \\"Hella Good\\".

It runs from Agade on the border with Frederiksberg in the southwest to √òsterbrogade in the northeast, linking Falkoner All√© with Strandboulevarden. The street passes Assistens Cemetery, University of Copenhagen's North Campus and F√¶lled Park. History Jagtvej viewed from the same bridge in about 1880 Meyer Hertz' tannery and shoeware factory Jagtvej viewed from present-day Nuuks Plads in the 1900s The road originates in a track which was established in the 1660s to enable royal hunting parties to travel more easily from Frederiksberg Palace to J√¶gersborg Deer Garden and Frederiksborg Castle in North Zealand. The so-called Demarcation Line, which enforced a no-built zone outside Copenhagen's fortifications, was moved to the track in 1682. In 1750, it was expanded into a larger, tree-lined road which was used for royal hunts. Riders would wait for signal at N√∏rrebro Runddel (N√∏rrebro Circle). The road extended from the Royal Falconry and was initially reserved for members of the royal court but later in the century opened to the public. The Demarcation Line was moved to The Lakes in 1852 and Jagtvej was subsequently built over in the second half of the 19th century. Meyer Hertz moved his tannery and shoeware factory to Jagtvej (No. 211) in 1875. The railway crossing on the street disappeared in 1930. Notable buildings and residents The former home of the Regional Archives for Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm (No. 10) is located at Nuuks Plads. The oldest part of the complex was built in the National Romantic style by Martin Nyrop in 1891-93\\\\. There are plans to redevelop the site with youth housing. The primary school N√∏rrebro Park Skole (No. 34) is located at Assistens Cemetery. The school was formerly called Jagtvejens Skole. It was built at the site was built in 1888 to design by Ludvig Fenger. The school was most recently expanded and received its current name in 2008. Fogedg√•rden Fogedg√•rden and Fogedmarken are residential developments for senior citizens built in the 1940s to design by Kay Fisker and C. F. M√∏ller.

The under construction Niels Nohr Building will span the street with a long skywalk. Other buildings located directly on the street include the Museum of Zoology and the August Krogh Building. NEXT EDU, formerly Copenhagen Technical College, has a building at No. 163. The building is from 1941 and was built for K√∏benhavns Tekniske Skole to design by Henning Hansen. Taksigelseskirken (No. 165) isa Church of Denmark parish church. It is from 1927 and was designed by Frederik Ki√∏rboe. St. Augustine's Church The Roman Catholic St. Augustine's Church was completed in 1915 to design by Emil J√∏rgensen. The complex also contained a convent which now houses Niels Steensens Gymnasium, a Catholic upper secondary school, and a hall of residence. The listed housing block Kanslerg√•rden (Borgmester Jensens All√© 1-5/Jagtvej 200/Serridslevvej/Kanslergade) is from 1918‚Äì19 and was designed by Henning Hansen. Kanslerhus (No. 202-208: Kanslerhus, Jagtvej/Kanslergade) is designed in a somewhat similar style. Meyer Hertz' former shoeware factory was demolished in 1987 and replaced by a Postmodern housing development called Garverg√•rden (No. 211) designed by Tegnestuen Vandkunsten. It reuses a few elements from the industrial complex. Transport Copenhagen Metro's operated City Circle Line has three underground stations along the road.

It is an erect shrub, usually with short, wide, serrated leaves and white to lilac-coloured flowers. It occurs in the south west of Western Australia. Description Eremophila lehmanniana is an erect, sometimes spreading shrub that usually grows to a height of between . The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches, sometimes overlap each other, and are usually elliptic to egg-shaped, mostly long, wide, often shiny and sticky when young and often have prominent, rounded teeth on their margins. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a straight, glabrous stalk, up to long. There are 5 overlapping, green, lance-shaped, sepals, long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to lilac-coloured on the outside, white inside and there are pale yellow-brown spots on the lowest petal lobe. Both surfaces of the petal tube and lobes are glabrous but the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to November and the fruits that follow are dry with a crusty covering, oval-shaped and long.Kondinin Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Otto Wilhelm Sonder in 1848 and given the name Halgania lehmanniana. The description was published in Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's 1848 Plantae Preissianae. In 1981, Robert Chinnock changed the name to Eremophila lehmanniana. The specific epithet (lehmanniana) honours the botanist, J.G.C. Lehmann. Distribution and habitat Eremophila lehmanniana occurs between Esperance and Geraldton in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It is found growing on a range of soil types, usually in open woodland. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is very hardy and suitable for a low maintenance garden. It has been grown in all mainland states of Australia and can tolerate temperatures as low as . It is easily propagated from cuttings and grows in most soils, including clay in full sun or partial shade. It only needs an occasional watering in long droughts and will grow in humid areas like Sydney, although it does need some protection from strong winds.

The treaty ended a long-simmering conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia, but indirectly started a new conflict between Ethiopia and Italy. It had seven articles. The terms of the treaty were negotiated at Asmara, in the northern reaches of the Ethiopian empire, by Mason Bey for Egypt, Admiral William Hewett for Britain and Ras Alula, also acting as host, for Ethiopia. Once terms had been agreed, the party moved to Adwa, where the treaty was presented to Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia. The emperor demanded a seaport for Ethiopia, but later compromised. The final treaty represented a triumph of Anglo-Egyptian interests. The first article of the treaty provided that Ethiopia would have free transit for all goods, including arms, through the port of Massawa. Britain undertook to protect this right. In the second article, Egypt returned Bogos, occupied since 1868, to Ethiopian control. In the third article, Ethiopia agreed to assist the evacuation of Egyptian troops from Kassala, Amadid and Senhit. In the fourth article, Egypt agreed to permit the passage of newly-appointed Abunas to Ethiopia. In the fifth article, Egypt and Ethiopia agreed to the extradition of criminals. In the sixth article, Ethiopia agreed to accept British arbitration in any case of disagreement with Egypt over the terms of the treaty. Shortly after its ratification, the Italians occupied Massawa, which had been evacuated by Egypt, with tacit British approval.

Through much of its history much of the area has been marsh ‚Äì some drainage was made during the medieval period ‚Äì a canal, the Forthdyk (later Foredike) was cut in the 13th century. The Engine Drain was cut , with windmills aiding drainage of the area. In the 1770s construction of the Holderness Drain incorporated part of the Foredike into its route, and further improved drainage in the wider area. After drainage to the later 20th century the land use was exclusively agricultural. The estate was developed from the 1990s onwards on low lying agricultural land lying immediately east of the River Hull, and adjacent to the Bransholme Estate to the south-east, separated by the A1033 and Wawne Road. In addition to the housing the area includes a large shopping area, Kingswood retail park, including an Asda superstore and several other warehouse type shopping outlets, plus leisure facilities including a cinema, indoor bowling, and several fast food restaurants. Geography Kingswood Retail Park (2007) The Kingswood's area boundaries are the River Hull to the west, the Wawne Road to the east, and the Wawne Drain and Foredyke Stream to the south; the northern boundary can be taken to be the boundary between the City of Kingston upon Hull and the civil parish of Wawne. The western side of the new development (beyond Engine Drain), is sometimes referred to as Kingswood Parks. The route of the Engine Drain passes through the estate, roughly north-south, and has created a clear boundary between parts of the housing development. Green spaces include an undeveloped area of former farmland, Midmeredales, located along the north side of the Wawne Drain; and the wood, Ings Plantation, the boundaries of which date to at least the 1850s, is retained within the modern development. As well as the Wawne Drain and Foredyke Stream drain at the southern boundary, which are closely paralleled by the John Newton way/Bude Road on the eastern half, there are several large scale man made features at the edges of the estate: the easternmost end of the A1033, named Raich Carter Way, connects to west Hull and Beverley via the Ennerdale Link Bridges; in the south-western corner, just outside the retail park area is a large water storage area, and a former sewage works, now the site of Bransholme Surface Water Pumping Station. Most of the area is under above sea level, though to the east the land rises to up to or over . The Kingswood area is vulnerable to floods under certain conditions: overtopping of the River Hull; flooding from water from the Holderness Drain or other local land drains; or flooding from local surface water. In the long term the area may be affected by sea level rise. Almost all parts of Kingswood excluding those parts in the east at higher ground are in a Flood Zone risk 3a.iii (high hazard) area. In 2011 Kingswood's population was 5,314 of which more than 95% were white; the employment rate was 67%, close to the national and regional averages (70, 68%) (2011 Census). History =Background= From the prehistoric period to the medieval ages the land in Holderness east of the River Hull was predominately marshland, excluding local rises in the land were villages were established. The southern part was subject to inundation from the sea as a result of tides, and was brackish; whilst the northern part was still swampy but freshwater; the transition between the two was around Wawne at the furthest tidal reach of the River Hull. Whilst most of the area was within the flood plain, the eastern parts rise to a peak in the north-eastern of up to above sea level ‚Äì the higher areas are glacial till. No evidence has been found (1995) of human activity in the area during the prehistoric period, though finds from the period have been found nearby at Sutton, Wawne and in west Hull. Extensive pottery and other finds from the Romano-British period, as well as evidence of ditches have been found close nearby on the west bank of the River Hull, evidencing a settlement. In the medieval period flood defences allowing the improvement of land were first made in the wider area ‚Äì these included banks preventing flooding, and dikes to drain the marshes; additionally due to the lack of roads navigational cuts were also made to allow boats to travel to inhabited places in the marshes which also sometimes functioned as drains. The drain known as the Forthdyk (now Foredike Stream) was first cut in the early 13th century. The drain's primary function is thought to have been as a waterway, though it drained Wagne (Wawne), Sutton, Bransholme, and Swine. It was wide by deep, with two bridges, built to allow boats to travel along its length; one near the river, the other across the Wawne Road, At the river bank a watermill was made by the monks of Meaux which was driven by differences in height of water between river and drain at both low and high tides. In order to maintain the Foredike as a waterway a second parallel dike was cut, Sutton- dyk. At the river end of these waterways there was a mill pond also used as a fish pond. Archaeological and documentary evidence indicates human activity in the medieval period was focused in the south-west corner of the area, near the medieval mill; the physical evidence includes earthworks and pottery finds. In the Engine Drain was cut for drainage, emptying into the River Hull somewhere near the original Foredike outlet; windmills were built to power the draining. In 1764 land to the east of the River Hull was permitted to be further improved by drainage by an Act of Parliament. The work carried out included the cutting of the original path of the Holderness Drain, as well as embankment of the east bank of the River Hull to prevent flooding. Much of the work had been completed by 1772 at a cost of ¬£24,000. Further work was carried out on the draining of the river valley, the second phase from 1787‚Äì1805 at a cost of ¬£16,000. In 1850 the land on which Kingswood would be developed consisted of rectangularish enclosed fields, with extensive drainage. The only recorded structures were two farms, Ings Farm and Gibraltar, both near the bank of the River Hull; another farm, South Field was on the east side of the Wawne-Sutton road; there were no roads inside the area, except the short Midmeredales Lane, branching west at South Field for around ; farm tracks from the lane led to the two river bank farmsteads. On the Ordnance Survey map the general area was labelled as The Ings (see Ings), The only woodland was a small plantation, Ings Plantation. This pattern of use and development remained completely unchanged for the next 100 years.Ordnance Survey Sheet 226NW, 226NE 1:10560 1909, 1925‚Äì6, 1938, 1946‚Äì8, 1956‚Äì7 In 1968 part of the parish of Wawne was transferred to the city of Hull. Gibraltar farm was demolished by the beginning of the 1970s, by which time the Bransholme Housing Estate had begun to be developed to the south of the Wawne/Foredike Drain, with a large sewage works (see Bransholme water works) established on the south side of the Wawne Drain, adjacent to the River Hull.Ordnance Survey 1:10000 1973‚Äì77, 1982‚Äì4; 1:2500 1965, 1972 In the 1970s the estate was extended north of the Foredike into the (former) parish of Wawne, along the east side of the Wawne Road.Ordnance Survey 1:10000 1973‚Äì7; 1:2500 1980‚Äì3 Development of the Bransholme estate continued to 1983 with around 9,000 houses built. The first building to be built within the future 'Kingswood' area was Broadacre County Primary School built west of Wawne Road, sometime in the late 1980s.Ordnance Survey 1:10000 1984‚Äì93 =Kingswood estate= Initial development at Kingswood took place in an ad hoc way around Kesteven Way, essentially as an extension of northern Bransholme west of the Wawne Road (). In 1989 Hull City Council and estate developers agreed to jointly develop the land west of the Wawne Road, north of the Foredike/Wawne Drain, and east of the River Hull. Planning permission for this large development was given in December 1994 -development of the entire area was expected to take 15 to 20 years. The development area was around in size of which was allotted to housing, to employment, and to shopping, civic buildings and greenspaces. Ennerdale Link Bridges and (A1033) Raich Carter Way (2013) A key event in the development of Kingswood was the construction of the Ennerdale Link Bridges over the River Hull in 1997. Work on the link began in the early 1990s, with the crossing originally planned to be a tunnel, difficult ground conditions forced a change of plan in 1994, resulting in the construction of two bridges.See Ennerdale Link Bridges. The new crossing allowed the Raich Carter Way (A1033) to connect to the main Hull to Beverley road to the west (A1079 and A1174). Cineworld Cinema multiplex (2007) By 2003 considerable development had taken place; within the four regions within Kingswood (defined by land use) the developments were: at Kingswood Retail Park, the development was complete ‚Äì an Asda superstore had been built (1996), and Matalan, Boots, and Comet had established stores (2001); at Kingswood Leisure Park a David Lloyd Leisure facility (1999), a UGC cinema (2000), a Hollywood Bowl bowling centre (2003), and food and pub facilities had been opened, with undeveloped; at the Kingswood Business Park work had commenced but not been completed on around a quarter of the site; and at the housing estate proper around 400 houses had been built, in addition to the approximate 1,000 houses around Kesteven Way. The Hull City Plan (2000) expected that the development when complete would house around 12,000 people in 5,000 houses, with the area providing around 4,000 jobs in manufacturing and services. In 2007 some parts of Kingswood were flooded (see also 2007 United Kingdom floods) ‚Äì these were those constructed under the 1994 planning permissions; houses constructed under the 2004 permissions were not flooded internally due to the flood mitigations required by the 2004 planning requirements. The primary cause of the flood was a breakdown at the Bransholme Pumping Station. Typical housing in Kingswood Parks west of the Engine Drain (2013) By 2011 a total of around 2,270 houses had been built in Kingswood, of which a thousand were from the early Kesteven way builds; 514 from the phase 1 planning permissions gained in 1994; and 756 houses built of the 5,295 permmitted by phase 2 planning permissions obtained in 2004. In 2013 the Kingswood Academy school opened, built on the site of the former Perronet Thompson School, established in 1988 for the Bransholme estate.See Kingswood Academy By end of March 2015 a total of 3,576 houses had been in the Kingswood area, with a potential 3,105 plots remaining. The original 1994 land allocation for employment use, and the aspiration of 4,000 jobs created in the area had not been realised by 2015, with much of the assigned land undeveloped for industry. Building development of the 'local centre' or 'village centre' started with the construction of the Kingswood Health Centre. Further building development in the village centre started in 2013/4: Kingswood Parks Primary opened in 2014; additionally planning permission for two small multi occupancy shop and flat units was given in 2013; construction began in early 2014 for completion late in the same year ‚Äì the occupant of the largest unit was to be a Co-op store. In late 2015 groundwork began on a large Next plc store opposite the existing retail park. Hull City Council's plans for further expansion of shopping facilities at Kingswood were shelved in 2016, following concerns raised by a government inspector on any further development's impact on the wider commercial economy in the Hull area. In mid 2016 planning permission was given for a 750 home 'phase 1' development of total area expanding housing development west of north Bransholme and Wawne Road; east of the existing Kingswood Parks and Engine Drain; and north of the early (1980s) development north of Kesteven Way. The whole development, named \\"Wawne View\\", was expected to consist of over 1,600 homes, with a ten-year construction schedule.

Brazil has more than 1900 birds species, and according to Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and Ministry of the Environment, there are 240 species and subspecies of Brazilian birds enlisted as threatened species, 6 as extincts and two as extinct in the wild.PORTARIA No - 444, DE 17 DE DEZEMBRO DE 2014 the Brazilian definition uses the same criteria and categories of IUCN. Among the 33 bird orders which occurs in Brazil, 22 has threatened species. The passerines (songbirds), besides being the most diverse order in Brazil, is also the order with most species on Brazilian red list, immediately before the Parrots. The Brazilian Northeast, notably in Atlantic forest and Caatinga, has the most number of endemic and threatened birds, and two of them, the Alagoas curassow and the Spix's macaw, has been considered extinct in the wild. The \\"Pernambuco Center\\" of endemism presents many critically endangered species due to the intense destruction of the Atlantic forest. Some species might be extinct in Brazil, like the Glaucous macaw and the Eskimo curlew. The actual list of threatened species was published in Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o, on December 17, 2014. Even though some species have been removed from the list, (for instance, the Hyacinth macaw), the number of threatened species has increased in comparison with the former list (which had had 160 taxa). Furthermore, the number of known species of birds has been increasing considerably since the last half of the 20th century, and this fact has influenced the number of enlisted species. In spite of using the same criteria, ICMBio list often shows a different conservation status than IUCN. That's because both assessments have been done in different moments and by different researchers.

The goal of the GWF is to maintain these pristine habitats and allow native wildlife to flourish. The GWF is triple bottom line: * progressive environmental effects through collaborative scientific research; * responsible social response through community and school engagement, internships, and volunteer opportunities; and * positive economic outcomes through responsible wilderness tourism which supports conservation. Loggerhead hatchling at Gnaraloo Bay History Gnaraloo is a remote and undeveloped section of Western Australian coastline, located at the southern extreme of the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. This conjunction of rugged outback and desert beach is home to threatened sea turtles, a World Heritage coral reef, and an immense diversity of birds and other native terrestrial and marine life. In 2005, the Gnaraloo Station Trust purchased the land and initiated efforts to preserve the unspoiled environment at Gnaraloo. In early 2016, the non-profit Gnaraloo Wilderness Foundation was officially created to actively work towards the conservation of this natural and undeveloped stretch of coast. Research & Conservation The GWF runs the Gnaraloo Turtle Conservation Program and the Gnaraloo Feral Animal Control Program to protect sea turtle rookeries along the Gnaraloo coast. The population of loggerhead turtles that nests in WA belongs to the South-East Indian Ocean subpopulation. A lot of basic but critical biological data still remains unknown for this population, including the number of individuals, how often females nest, and where they migrate to forage once they leave the rookery. By working to preserve the natural ecosystems at Gnaraloo, the GWF is helping to protect species that occur within them. In addition to scientific fieldwork, a vital component of the GWF is community engagement. Education and widespread awareness of environmental issues provides a connection that can inspire conservation. In the field at Gnaraloo, community members and school groups are invited to join the GTCP on beach surveys to learn about daily monitoring techniques and applied science. Once the nesting season concludes, the GTCP then travels along the coast, stopping at various WA cities to give presentations to thousands of students about sea turtle biology and conservation.

Since its implementation in 2009, the GFACP has worked to reduce the impact of feral predators on sea turtle nests within these rookeries. Gnaraloo is located at the southern end of the Ningaloo Coast, a World Heritage Site. The Ningaloo Reef and surrounding coastline are home to important wildlife, including vulnerable and endangered sea turtle populations. Threats to sea turtle nests & hatchlings Sea turtles are listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and are recognized as nationally significant species in Australia. The predation of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings is a threatening process for these conservation-dependent species. Because a threshold of feral presence in the rookery where predation does not occur is currently unknown, any evidence of non-native predators in the vicinity of sea turtle nests suggests that predation is likely. The Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife has recognized that feral predators have a significant impact on threatened species, specifically stating that fox predation may cause up to 70% mortality of sea turtle nests on beaches within the region. Together, the GTCP and GFACP work to preserve the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) population that nests at Gnaraloo by controlling non-native and feral predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, namely the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats, and wild dogs. Throughout nesting season each year, the GTCP scientific field team tracks and records any evidence of feral activity or predation (e.g. eggshells, dead hatchlings outside of nest cavity) within the rookeries. The GFACP has been extremely effective in reducing and removing threats posed by feral animals within Gnaraloo‚Äôs sea turtle rookeries. Since the 2010/2011 nesting season, the program has eradicated feral predation, maintaining 100% protection of sea turtle nests. The continually successful protection of sea turtle nests at Gnaraloo demonstrates that sea turtle rookeries can be preserved through effective and consistent feral animal control programs.

A snack is a small service of food and generally eaten between meals. Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home. Traditionally, snacks are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of preparation. Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks. With the spread of convenience stores, packaged snack foods became a significant business. Snack foods are typically designed to be portable, quick, and satisfying. Processed snack foods, as one form of convenience food, are designed to be less perishable, more durable, and more portable than prepared foods. They often contain substantial amounts of sweeteners, preservatives, and appealing ingredients such as chocolate, peanuts, and specially-designed flavors (such as flavored potato chips). Beverages, such as coffee, are not generally considered snacks although they may be consumed along with or in lieu of snack foods. A snack eaten shortly before going to bed or during the night may be called a \\"bedtime snack\\", \\"late night snack\\", or \\"(mid)night snack\\".  Snacks in the United States  In the United States, a popular snack food is the peanut. Peanuts first arrived from South America via slave ships and became incorporated into African-inspired cooking on southern plantations. After the Civil War, the taste for peanuts spread north, where they were incorporated into the culture of baseball games and vaudeville theaters. Along with popcorn (also of South American origin), snacks bore the stigma of being sold by unhygienic street vendors. The middle- class etiquette of the Victorian era (1837‚Äì1901) categorized any food that did not require proper usage of utensils as lower-class. Pretzels were introduced to North America by the Dutch, via New Amsterdam in the 17th century. In the 1860s, the snack was still associated with immigrants, unhygienic street vendors, and saloons. Due to loss of business during the Prohibition era (1920-1933), pretzels underwent rebranding to make them more appealing to the public. As packaging revolutionized snack foods, allowing sellers to reduce contamination risk, while making it easy to advertise brands with a logo, pretzels boomed in popularity, bringing many other types of snack foods with it. By the 1950s, snacking had become an all-American pastime, becoming an internationally recognized emblem of middle American life.  Snacks in Asia =Indonesia= Kue tahu isi, pisang goreng, risoles, timpan, lemper, and kue pisang. Indonesia has a rich collection of snacks called kue (cakes and pastry), both savoury and sweet. Traditional kue is usually made from rice flour, coconut milk, and coconut sugar, and is mostly steamed or fried rather than baked. Traditional kue are popularly known as kue basah (\\"wet kue\\") that has a moist, soft texture because of rich coconut milk. Kue kering (dried kue) is the local name for cookies. Indonesia has several variations of kue, both native and foreign-influenced. Traditional crackers Krupuks in air- tight tin cans. Traditional crackers are called krupuk, made from bits of shrimp, fish, vegetables or nuts, which are usually consumed as a crunchy snack or an accompaniment to meals. These crispy snacks are sometimes added to main dishes for their crunchy texture; several Indonesian dishes such as gado- gado, karedok, ketoprak, lontong sayur, nasi uduk, asinan and bubur ayam are known to require specific types of krupuk as toppings. There are wide variations of krupuk available across Indonesia. The most popular ones would be krupuk udang (prawn crackers) and krupuk kampung or krupuk putih (cassava crackers). Other popular types include krupuk kulit (dried buffalo-skin crackers), emping melinjo (gnetum gnemon crackers), and kripik (chips/crisps), such as kripik pisang (banana chips) and keripik singkong (Cassava chips). Rempeyek is a flour-based cracker with brittle of peanuts, anchovies or shrimp bound by a crispy flour cracker. Rengginang or intip (Javanese) is a rice cracker made from sun-dried and deep fried leftover rice. =Japan= Japan has a very wide range of snack foods ranging from onigiri to Melon pan. For more details see List of Japanese snacks and Japanese cuisine. =Malaysia= * Cincin - a deep fried dough pastry-based snack popular with East Malaysia's Muslim communities. * Roti john - a spiced meat omelette sandwich, popularly eaten for breakfast or as a snack. * Bakkwa (Chinese : ËÇâÂπ≤) - literally \\"dried meat\\", bakkwa is better understood as barbecued meat jerky. While this delicacy is especially popular during the Chinese New Year celebration period, it is available everywhere and eaten year round as a popular snack. * Idli - made from a mashed mixture of skinned black lentils and rice formed into patties using a mould and steamed, idlis are eaten at breakfast or as a snack. Idlis are usually served in pairs with vadai, small donut-shaped fritters made from mashed lentils and spices, chutney, and a thick stew of lentils and vegetables called sambar. * Murukku - a savoury snack of spiced crunchy twists made from rice and urad dal flour, traditionally eaten for Deepavali in South India. * Vadai, vada or vades - is a common term for many different types of savoury fritter-type snacks originated from South India with a set of common ingredients. The most common ingredients are lentils, chillis, onions and curry leaves. * Tebaloi - is a sago biscuit snack which is traditionally associated with the Melanau people of Sarawak. * Pisang goreng - a common snack sold by street vendors, battered fried bananas are also served in a more elaborate manner at some cafes and restaurants as a dessert. Cempedak and various tuber vegetables are also battered and fried in the same manner as variations. =Thailand= * Miang kham ‚Äì dried shrimp and other ingredients wrapped in cha plu leaves; often eaten as a snack or a starter. * Sai ua ‚Äì a grilled sausage of ground pork mixed with spices and herbs; it is often served with chopped fresh ginger and chilies at a meal. It is sold at markets in Chiang Mai as a snack. Snacks and health =Nutritional concerns= Government bodies, such as Health Canada, recommend that people make a conscious effort to eat more healthy, natural snacks - such as fruit, vegetables, nuts, and cereal grains ‚Äì while avoiding high-calorie, low- nutrient junk food. A 2010 study showed that children in the United States snacked on average six times per day, approximately twice as often as American children in the 1970s. This represents consumption of roughly 570 calories more per day than U.S. children consumed in the 1970s. =Snacks and cognition= A Tufts University Department of Psychology empirical study titled \\"Effect of an afternoon confectionery snack on cognitive processes critical to learning\\" found that consumption of a confectionery snack in the afternoon improved spatial memory in the study's sample group, but in the area of attention performance it had a mixed effect.

It is found in the eastern United States, where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae. Fruit bodies of the Appalachian waxy cap are bright purplish-red to reddish-orange. They have convex to somewhat funnel-shaped caps that are in diameter, held up by a cylindrical stipe up to long. The gills are thick and widely spaced, with a color similar to that of the cap or paler, and a whitish-yellow edge. Microscopically, the spores and spore-bearing cells are dimorphic‚Äîof two different sizes. Systematics The fungus was described as new to science in 1963 by mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their monograph on North American species of Hygrophorus. Hesler collected the type on July 28, 1958 in Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Tennessee). The fungus was recorded from the same location in a fungal survey conducted about 50 years later. It was transferred to the genus Hygrocybe in a 1998 paper by Ingeborg Kronawitter and Andreas Bresinsky. In this publication, the basionym was given as \\"appalachiensis\\" instead of the original spelling appalachianensis, and so Hygrocybe appalachiensis is an orthographic variant spelling. A reference to the type locality‚Äìthe Appalachian Mountains‚Äìappears in both the specific epithet and in the common name, Appalachian waxy cap. Because of its color and habit, Hesler and Smith originally thought the unknown agaric was H. coccinea or perhaps a large form of H. miniata, but study of its microscopic characteristics revealed that it was distinct from these. They noted that the fibrillose-squamulose texture of the cap (i.e. that it appears to be made of thin fibers, or covered with small scales) and the large spores suggested a relationship with H. turundus. The type of Hygrocybe appalachianensis is of an immature specimen, and the description of the basidia only accounted for microbasidia (i.e., the smaller of the two forms of basidia in the hymenium). The immature macrobasidia were described as pleurocystidia (i.e., cystidia arising from the side, or face, of the gill), which Hesler and Smith described as \\"more or less embedded in the hymenium\\".Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 17. Microspores (the smaller of the two spore types produced by the fungus) were not accounted for in their original description, although they are present in the type. Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a reorganization of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H. appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe.Lodge et al. (2014), p. 4. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H. rosea, and H. trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), and the development of the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and appear as if they have a stalk.Lodge et al. (2014), pp. 29‚Äì30. Description The gills are well spaced, somewhat decurrent, and often have whitish-yellow edges. Fruitbodies of H. appalachianensis have convex caps that are in diameter. As the mushroom matures, the cap margins curl upward, and the central depression in the cap deepens, becoming more or less funnel shaped. Its color is bright red to purplish-red, which fades in age. The cap margin is often whitish. The well- spaced gills are initially adnate-decurrent, becoming more decurrent in age. Their color is that of the cap or paler; the gill edges are sometimes whitish- yellow. The cylindrical stipe, which measures long by , is more or less the same width throughout its length. Its surface texture is smooth to slightly scurfy, and it is often whitish at its base. The flesh of the mushroom lacks any distinctive taste or odor. It is yellowish with orange tinges, with reddish color near the cap cuticle. Alan Bessette and colleagues, in their 2012 monograph on eastern North American waxcap mushrooms, note that the mushroom is \\"reported to be edible\\".Bessette et al. (2012), pp. 14‚Äì15. Hygrocybe appalachianensis mushrooms produce a white spore print. Both the spores and the basidia are dimorphic. The larger spores (macrospores) are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure 11‚Äì17.5 by 7‚Äì10 ¬µm. They are hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The macrobasidia are club shaped, measuring 38‚Äì57 by 8‚Äì14 ¬µm, and can be one- two-, three- or four-spored. The ratio of macrobasidia length to macrospore length is usually less than five to one. Clamp connections are present on the hyphae of several tissues of the mushroom. The hyphae of the gills (the lamellar trama) are arranged in a parallel fashion. The colors of Hygrocybe mushrooms originate from betalains, a class of red and yellow indole-derived pigments. Specific betalains found in H. appalachianensis include muscaflavin, and a group of compounds called hygroaurins, which are derived from muscaflavin by conjugation with amino acids. =Similar species= There are several lookalike species found in North American with which the Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H. appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7‚Äì12 by 4‚Äì8 ¬µm.Bessette et al, p. 20. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin. Widespread and common in the Northern Hemisphere, the scarlet waxcap (Hygrocybe coccinea) is most reliably distinguished from H. appalachianensis by its smaller spores, measuring 7‚Äì11 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm.Bessette et al. (2012), p. 23. The sphagnum waxcap, H. coccineocrenata, also has colors that are similar to H. appalachianensis. In addition to its smaller spores (8‚Äì12 by 5.5‚Äì8 ¬µm), its fruit bodies have smaller caps, measuring in diameter, and it is typically found fruiting in mosses.Bessette et al. (2012), p. 24. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies of Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground. Like all Hygrocybe species, the fungus is believed to be saprophytic, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.

In much of his writings, he calls for the learning of a \\"dying art\\", which he describes as becoming necessary at a time when death comes too late, rather than too early. This phenomenon is often referred to as the 'fourth phase' of the epidemiological transition. He frequently argued that there are cases in which there exists a right to die, especially when prolonging life imposes a great burden on loved ones. His arguments have been very influential among contemporary philosophers.

Early life Komatsu was born on June 26, 1988, in Kurihara, Miyagi, Japan where he also grew up. He became interested in professional wrestling by watching it on TV with his parents from the age of three. While in school he joined the wrestling club, learning amateur wrestling at a young age. Professional wrestling career After graduating from University Komatsu began training for his professional wrestling career at the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) dojo. Initially he worked a part-time job while trying to pass the NJPW \\"Young Lions\\" test, which he finally passed in May, 2012. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2012‚Äì2016)= Komatsu in March 2015 He made his debut for NJPW on November 19, 2012, on NJPW's NEVER project's Shodai NEVER Musabetsu Kyu Oza Kettei Tournament show where he lost to Takaaki Watanabe. Komatsu competed as one of NJPW's \\"Young Lions\\" a class of rookie wrestlers who work mostly against each other early on, wearing all black gear and with no particular ring character, all part of the structured learning process in NJPW. In 2013 he competed in his first major NJPW tournament, teaming up with Kushida to compete in the 2013 Super Junior Tag Tournament. The team lost in the first round to Bushi and Valiente. On January 4, 2014 Komatsu teamed up with Jyushin Thunder Liger, Manabu Nakanishi and Super Strong Machine to work a non-televised match at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, NJPW's biggest show of the year. The team lost to Bushi, Captain New Japan, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Tomoaki Honma. Throughout 2013 and 2014 Komatsu often faced off against fellow Young Lion Sho Tanaka, with both men trading victories in both singles and tag team competition. By 2015 Komatsu and Tanaka had begun teaming together on a regular basis, including working together in the New Japan Rumble as part of Wrestle Kingdom 9 on January 5, 2015. The two teamed up to eliminate Tiger Mask and Taichi but were both eliminated by Tama Tonga On January 15, 2015 Komatsu competed at the Fantastica Mania 2015 event as he was called upon to replace the injured Rey Cometa in the NJPW/Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) co-promoted event.

A few days later, at Destruction in Kobe Komatsu and Tanaka defeated fellow Young Lions David Finlay and Jay White. In early 2016 it was announced that Komatsu and Tanaka would compete in the 2016 Fantastica Mania series of shows, competing in what NJPW called the \\"Yohei Komatsu and Sho Tanaka send-off game\\", announcing that the two would travel to Mexico and work for CMLL as part of their continued in-ring skill development. The team worked the opening match for each of the six Fantastica Mania events, losing each time. On the last night Tetsuya Naito, Komatsu's original trainer, called Komatsu to the ring and implied that he was going to join Naito's group Los Ingobernables de Japon, but then proceeded to beat him up with Evil. =Overseas learning excursion (2016‚Äì2017)= Komatsu and Tanaka would be the latest in a long line of young Japanese wrestlers to travel to Mexico to learn the lucha libre style. In Mexico, Komatsu was given the ring name Fujin, named after the Japanese God of Wind, teaming with Tanaka who would be known as Raijin, named after the Japanese God of Thunder. The duo made their Mexican debut on January 31, teaming up with Okumura, forming the most recent version of La Ola Amarilla (\\"The Yellow Wave\\"). The group was joined by Kamaitachi, the previous NJPW trainee who has worked for CMLL since 2014. On March 22, Fujin took part in the 2016 edition of The CMLL Torneo Gran Alternativa, a tournament in which rookies team up with veterans in a single elimination tournament.

However, an earlier loss to the team of Shingo Takagi and Bushi made the title match a triple threat, that Takagi and Bushi would go onto win, with Takagi pinning Sho. At New Japan‚Äôs 47th Anniversary Event, Sho and Yoh would defeat Takagi and Bushi to win the championships for a 3rd time. In June, Roppongi 3K would lose the Junior Tag Team Championships to the team of El Phantasmo and Taiji Ishimori.

It is located in the village of Saltr√∏d. The church is one of three churches in the Moland parish in the Arendal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in 1878 using plans from the architect Johan Christoff Friedrich Reuter. The church seats about 400 people. The church stands on a slope at Stuenes. It was originally built as a chapel of ease for the Stokken congregation of the Austre Moland parish. The structure is a long church () with timber framing. It was designed by Johan Christoff Friedrich Reuter and the builder Carl Svendsen was the lead builder. The altarpiece, depicting Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, was painted by Hedevig Lund for Austre Moland Church in 1869, but the work was not accepted by the congregation at the time. Some years later, it was given to the new church in Stokken. The work needed to have a new piece added to it to function as an altarpiece. In 1929, the master painter Emil Rummelhoff decorated the church's gallery with a frieze, with heads of grain and grapes to symbolize the Eucharist. At the same time, he painted the entire interior of the church, and for the restoration for the church's centennial in 1979 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage recommended that Rummelhoff's design be retained. The church bells were cast at the Olsen Nauen Bell Foundry in 1879. The organ has nine stops and was produced by Josef Hilmar J√∏rgensen in 1928. The plans for Stokken Church were later used to build F√¶rvik Church and Bjorbekk Church.

Her main business holdings included the Wisconsin & Arkansas Lumber Company, and Malvern Brick and Tile Company. She is the founder and benefactor of Garvan Woodland Gardens in Hot Springs, Arkansas.  Early life  Garvan was born Verna Cook in Groveton, Texas, in 1910. She was the daughter of Arthur Bacillus Cook and Essie Louise Bordis Cook, and had one sister, Dorothy. The Cook family relocated to Malvern, Arkansas, in 1916, where the girls were primarily raised. Arthur Cook managed the Wisconsin & Arkansas Lumber Company and later Malvern Brick and Tile, and consequently exposed Verna to business matters at a young age. For secondary education Verna and Dorothy attended Holton-Arms girls' school in Washington, D.C.  Personal life  Shortly after her father died in a tragic car accident, Verna Cook wed Alonzo \\"Lonnie\\" B. Alexander on October 1, 1934. Fourteen years her senior, Alexander was a United States Naval Academy graduate and member of a prominent business family in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The couple relocated to South Carolina and had one son, Arthur Cook Alexander. Arthur was born with cystic fibrosis and his health demanded great attention from his mother to manage his care. During a period of marital discord Verna moved to Florida with Arthur, believing it would aid his poor health. Arthur did not fare well in the Florida climate and eventually left his mother to attend school in Arizona for its drier climate. He remained in Arizona until his death in November 1954. In 1956, Verna's marriage to Lonnie Alexander ended in divorce, after two years of legal proceedings regarding Verna's stake in her late father's business holdings. Following the death of her son and dissolution of her marriage to Lonnie Alexander, the future Verna Garvan returned to her home in Malvern. She continued to lead management of the Cook family's businesses and soon met her second husband, Patrick Garvan, Jr. The couple wed on June 29, 1960 and chose to remain in Hot Springs where they met. Patrick Garvan's family was socially prominent in New York City, and his parents Francis Patrick Garvan, Sr. and Mabel Brady Garvan donated a significant collection of art and antiques to Yale University. Verna and Patrick planned to build a home on what is now the grounds of Garvan Woodland Gardens, but very little had been constructed when Patrick died in 1972. Garvan remained unmarried and continued her horticultural work, leaving a legacy of nature and education for the people of Arkansas.  Career  Garvan expressed interest in her father's business ventures as a child. After the death of her father, and her marriage to Lonnie Alexander, Verna took the lead in family business matters involving her father's company, the A. B. Cook Company. Her mother and sister hesitated to involve themselves in the businesses or let Verna manage them. Despite their concerns and her relocation to South Carolina, Verna Cook Alexander was able to run both Wisconsin & Arkansas Lumber, and Malvern Brick and Tile from afar through a hired manager. She later turned over the management of the businesses to her husband. During her divorce from Alexander, Verna fought for her business interests in Arkansas and maintained control of Malvern Brick and Tile. She returned to her home in Arkansas and continued to manage Malvern Brick and Tile until it was sold to Acme Brick in the 1970s. Garvan's personal corporation, ABCO, was dissolved after her death  Alexander v. Alexander  During the dissolution of their marriage, Lonnie Alexander and Verna became entangled in a lawsuit over business investments. Alexander claimed to own a majority stake in the Cook's family business. This fact was disputed by Verna, her mother, and her sister Dorothy, all of whom were vying for their own interests. Eventually Verna convinced her family to sever ties with Alexander and worked to settle the financial fallout. The legal battle intensified in January 1954, after Garvan's relocation to Florida. Lonnie attempted to have Verna committed to a psychiatric ward in Florida. He filed a petition against her and deputy sheriffs took her into custody. After being held without access to a telephone for three days, Garvan reached out to her friend Richard C. Butler. Butler was a prominent Little Rock attorney and successfully aided in the release of Garvan from the psychiatric facility. The courts later found her to be mentally competent and Alexander's charge without merit. Ultimately the court ruled in Verna's favor, returning her business assets. In October 1952, Verna filed for divorce, but was denied based on Arkansas's lack of jurisdiction. This was followed by a divorce suit filed by Lonnie in South Carolina in October 1953, which included charges of slander, missing property, and failure to pay salaries. During this time their son Arthur's health declined and Verna left to be by his side in Arizona. Arthur died in November 1954, and year later the economic charges were settled and their divorce was finalized.  Garvan Woodland Gardens  Beginning in 1956, Garvan began landscaping and construction on family property in Hot Springs. Continuing work during her marriage to Patrick Garvan, Verna's plan was to create a home set on a beautifully landscaped lot along the shoreline of Lake Hamilton. After Patrick's death, Garvan gave up her plans to build a house on the property. With the help of Acme Brick superintendent Warren Bankson and his assembled work crews, she was able to continue her landscaping project. After a significant amount of work was completed on the property Verna sought a benefactor that would agree to maintain the grounds after her death. This led her to create an endowment agreement with the University of Arkansas that remains in effect under the Fay Jones School of Architecture. One major landscape architecture component completed prior to Garvan's death is known as the Verna Cook Garvan Pavilion, co-designed by famed architect E. Fay Jones.

Wynne, 575 U.S. 542 (2015), is a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision which applied the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine to Maryland's personal income tax scheme and found that the failure to provide a full credit for income taxes paid to other states was unconstitutional. Background =Dormant Commerce Clause= The Commerce Clause provides that: Although the text of the clause appears to be a simple grant of power to Congress, the Supreme Court has long held that the clause was intended to include a negative command prohibiting state taxation that discriminates against interstate commerce, even when Congress has not acted. The doctrine, known as the Dormant Commerce Clause (or the \\"negative Commerce Clause\\" by its detractors), \\"strikes at one of the chief evils that led to the adoption of the Constitution, namely, state tariffs and other laws that burdened interstate commerce.\\" =Case background= Like most U.S. states, Maryland imposes a tax on the income residents earn both in Maryland and out- of-state as well as on the income earned within Maryland by non-residents.. The Maryland income tax consists of both a \\"state\\" income tax and a \\"county\\" income tax, both of which are collected by the state's comptroller of the treasury. Residents who earn income outside of Maryland may receive a credit against the state, but not the county income tax for income taxes paid on that income to other states. Nonresidents who earn income in Maryland must pay the state income tax and, in lieu of the county income tax, a \\"special nonresident tax\\" that was set at a rate \\"equal to the lowest county income tax rate set by any Maryland county.\\" In 2006, Maryland residents Brian and Karen Wynne, a married couple, earned income from other states through an S corporation, which filed state income tax returns in 39 states. An S Corporation passes income through to its shareholders for income tax purposes; in contrast, C corporations are considered separate entities from their shareholders for income tax purposes. On their 2006 tax return, the Wynnes claimed an income tax credit against both their state and county income taxes. The office of the Comptroller of the Treasury allowed the credit against the state, but not the county, income tax and, accordingly, assessed a deficiency. The Hearings and Appeals Section of the Comptroller's Office and, on appeal, the Maryland Tax Court both upheld the assessment. The Circuit Court for Howard County reversed, finding that the county income tax system violated the Commerce Clause. The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, upheld the Circuit Court's ruling that Maryland's income tax scheme violated the Commerce Clause, finding that the tax scheme violated the fair apportionment and nondiscrimination prongs of the four-prong test enunciated by the Supreme Court in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady. Opinion of the Court =Timeline= The case was first considered at the court's January 10, 2014, conference, after which the view of the Solicitor General was requested. The Solicitor General's amicus brief was received on April 4. The Supreme Court considered the case at their conferences on May 15 and May 22, after which they granted certiorari on May 27. Oral arguments were heard on November 12 and the court's opinion was released on May 18, 2015. =Majority opinion= Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion, in which Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor joined. The majority upheld the Maryland Court of Appeals' ruling on the grounds of stare decisis, stating that \\"our existing dormant Commerce Clause cases all but dictate the result reached in this case.\\" Three previous cases were \\"particularly instructive\\" in deciding the case; the cases all involved taxes on gross receipts that the Supreme Court struck down for posing the risk of multiple taxation. The majority rejected arguments that those cases involved gross receipts rather than net income and corporations rather than individuals. The majority also rejected the Comptroller's argument that individuals should be distinguished from corporations for the purposes of this case because individuals can vote to change the discriminatory tax scheme. In the majority's view, \\"the notion that the victims of such discrimination have a complete remedy at the polls is fanciful\\" and that \\"it is even more farfetched to suggest that natural persons with out-of-state income are better able to influence state.\\" They also found \\"no merit\\" in the Comptroller's argument that the statute is constitutional because it was not intended to discriminate against interstate commerce because the Commerce Clause \\"regulates effects, not motives, and it does not require courts to inquire into voters' or legislators' reasons for enacting a law that has a discriminatory effect.\\" The majority also criticized the primary dissent's arguments‚Äîthat the Dormant Commerce Clause does not limit the States' sovereign power to tax income of their residents, wherever earned‚Äîas \\"confus[ing] what a State may do without violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment with what it may do without violating the Commerce Clause.\\" The majority proceeded to explain the history and merits of the \\"internal consistency test.\\" The test considers the hypothetical situation in which every state adopted the tax structure in question and then asks whether interstate commerce would be at a disadvantage to intrastate commerce. The majority applied the internal consistency test to the hypothetical situation, paralleling Maryland's tax scheme, in which every state imposed a 1.25% income tax on residents' income earned within the state, a 1.25% income tax on residents' income earned in other states, and a 1.25% income tax on income earned by nonresidents within the state. In this case, intrastate income would only be taxed once at 1.25% but interstate income would always be taxed by both states involved (1.25% by the state of residence and 1.25% in the state where the income was earned). The majority, quoting West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, thus found that \\"Maryland's tax scheme is inherently discriminatory and operates as a tariff...which is fatal because tariffs are '[t]he paradigmatic example of a law discriminating against interstate commerce.'\\" Subsequent developments =Maryland tax refunds= Following the ruling, Maryland offered refunds to Maryland residents who had paid the local income tax without a credit for income taxes paid to other states. Local governments in Maryland had prepared for the prospect of having to issue refunds before the Supreme Court issued its decision. The local governments were estimated to be on the hook to issue $200 million in refunds to 55,000 taxpayers, with $115 million (including interest) owed by Montgomery County alone. The state government planned to pay the refunds, then recover the refunded money from local governments by reducing future tax revenue distributions. Due to the statute of limitations, the refund was available to all taxpayers affected by the Wynne decision for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014; refunds for tax years as early as 2006 were available for some taxpayers who had filed a timely amended return. In September 2015, Maryland governor Larry Hogan launched a campaign to raise awareness of the availability of tax refunds. Hogan, who assumed office in January 2015 after the Supreme Court had heard oral arguments in the case, relished that he had \\"the pleasure of sending refund checks.\\" The Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland, Peter Franchot, said he had an obligation to defend Maryland's tax scheme, but that he \\"always kind of secretly agreed with them.\\" =Iowa tax refunds= Iowa's personal income tax scheme did not offer a credit for out-of-state taxes against an income tax surcharge for local school districts. Following the Wynne decision, the state determined that this was unconstitutional and began to offer refunds for 2012, 2013, and 2014. The state estimated that if every eligible taxpayer filed to claim a refund the total amount would be $3 million annually for 2012, 2013, and 2014. The state would pay for the refunds from its general revenue fund, but local school districts would have to raise tax rates to cover the lost revenue in future tax years.

The fungus makes fruit bodies with flat to depressed caps measuring in diameter, supported by a short stipe measuring long by thick. The spines on the underside of the cap are measure 3‚Äì6 mm long. Initially white, they become brownish in age. The flesh has a \\"disagreeable\\" odor, with a \\"hint of cinnamon\\". Spores of S. ustalis are roughly spherical, covered in small, coarse warts (tubercules) up to 1.5 ¬µm, and measure 6.5‚Äì8 by 5.5‚Äì7 ¬µm. The color of the spore print ranges from avellaneous (dull grayish brown) to \\"pale dingy cinnamon buff\\".

Design The International Fountain was built on the site of the former Mercer Playground in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood. Mercer Playground had stood at that location since the 1910s. During the planning for Century 21, Mercer Playground was identified as the central site of \\"The Boulevards of the World\\", which was to be the centerpiece of the fair. The initial design concept called for a narrow lagoon with gondolas and crossed by a bridge, but a design competition was held for a \\"light, water and sculpture display\\" in the summer of 1960. Matsushita and Shimizu submitted the winning design, a fountain designed to reflect \\"mankind's efforts to explore the farthest reaches of outer space.\\" The 1960 design eschewed sculptural decorations in favor of water jets and the parabolic shapes they produced. The competition received 261 entries, of which 72 were international and 189 came from the United States. In the first stage of the competition, the jury narrowed the entries down to five finalists, each of which received a prize. The jury, which consisted of noted architects and sculptors Nathaniel A. Owings, Bernard Rosenthal, Garrett Eckbo, Peter Oberlander, Paul Thiry, and Fred McCoy, selected Matsushita and Shimizu unanimously from the five finalists. One juror commented \\"I feel that the scheme is not just good ... it's a big scheme, it's a terrific scheme ... and I think that the fact that he didn't have a model, when the other four did, and that he still got the winning vote is indicative of the fact that it is so outstanding ... I feel that this human experience has to happen; can happen in many ways.\\" At the time of selection, Matsushita was 29 and Shimizu was 26, and both were employed as associate architects with Taisei Construction Company in Tokyo. For their winning design, Matsushita and Shimizu were awarded . =1995 rebuild= WET plaque noting 1995 rebuild and patents (2006) The fountain was rebuilt in 1995 by WET Design as part of $6.5 million project including landscape design by Kenichi Nakano. Prior to 1995, the central dome had protruding nozzles and was surrounded by irregular white rocks to recreate a \\"lunar landscape\\", discouraging people from interacting with the water features. After the 1995 rebuild, the rocks were removed and the dome was reconfigured with myriad jets nearly flush with the dome's surface, allowing visitors to approach and play with the fountain. The fountain is controlled remotely from the north side of Seattle Center, and the pumping machinery is contained below the fountain floor. Two moats of water feed the jets: one moat for the \\"micro shooters\\" and another moat for the \\"fleur-de-lis\\" and \\"super shooters\\". The fountain recirculates the water and filters it through sand. During certain times of the day, the water display is synchronized to music for up to twelve minutes. The fountain jet designs are patented by WET. =Statistics= Peak height (2010) In 1962, the basin was in diameter, surrounding a dome high and in diameter covered in dark amber glass with 465 nozzles, of which 117 were active. The fountain is lit with floodlamps set in the floor. Following the 1995 rebuild, the fountain is contained in a bowl in diameter, and the dome was rebuilt in stainless steel to tall and in diameter.

From 1903 he studied in London, initially at a private life drawing class before enrolling at the Royal Academy Schools. From May to November 1905 he travelled on the continent, to France, Italy, Budapest, Berlin, and the Netherlands. In 1907 he completed his studies at the Royal Academy. He contributed works to the Summer Exhibition thirteen times between 1908 and 1927 as well as to the Belgian section of the 1915 War Relief Exhibition. He also became a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. While in England he submitted works to the Bunten exhibitions, winning several prizes. In 1918 he returned to Japan, taking with him works by British and Belgian painters for \\"The Exhibition of European Famous Painters\\" at Mitsukoshi that summer; a letter addressed to him from the Belgian ambassador to Japan, Georges della Faille de Leverghem (nl), indicates this was a charity event in aid of displaced Belgians.

He operated across the Kingdom of Naples as a teacher and as a preacher and he received widespread criticism from detractors that led to his immediate expulsion from the kingdom at the behest of the King. He was later readmitted into the kingdom after public pressure. Pirrotti assumed the name of Pompilio Maria of Saint Nicholas upon becoming a professed member of the order and assumed his deceased brother's name (Pompilio Maria) when he commenced his notiviate. In 1890 Pope Leo XIII beatified him and Pope Pius XI proclaimed him to be a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 19 March 1934. Life Domenico Michele Giovan Battista Pirrotti was born on 29 September 1710 as the sixth of eleven children to the nobleman Girolamo Pirrotti and Orsola Bozzuti - his father was a Doctor of Law. One brother was named Pompilio Maria Pirrotti. He was baptized the following 30 September. Despite the opposition of his parents when he was sixteen he consulted with his confessor on his religious vocation and fled his parents' home. He travelled to Benevento in order to pursue a path in a religious order. His father wrote to him a moving letter explaining his position on the matter and asking for his son's forgiveness; Girolamo also gave Pirrotti his blessing for his son's future. At the age of eighteen, he entered the Piarist order and assumed the name of \\"Pompilio Maria\\" in honor of his dead brother of that same name. The name 'Pompilio' derives from the Medieval Latin 'Pompilius,' meaning 'fifth born.' Perhaps the most famous person with that name was Numa Pompilius, who was the legendary second King of Rome, succeeding Romulus. After entering the order, Pompilio toured various Italian regions close to his hometown during his religious formation. He assumed the habit in the novitiate of Santa Maria di Caravaggio in Naples on 2 February 1727, and at the end of the first year of his novitiate obtained a special dispensation allowing for him not to proceed into the second; he made his solemn profession on 25 March 1728 in Brindisi, and it was then that he changed his name to that of \\"Pompilio Maria of Saint Nicholas\\". Pirrotti was sent to Chieti in order to continue his philosophical studies but he fell ill around this period. He believed that a change of climate would be to his benefit so was moved to Melfi in Potenza where he continued his studies. He later travelled for further studies in Turi in Bari in 1733 after recovering from his illness. It was there in Bari that he served as a teacher of literature. Pirrotti returned to Naples where he was assigned to a Piarist house in Lecce as its superior and the Master of Novices. Pirrotti was ordained to the priesthood on 20 March 1734 from the Archbishop of Brindisi Andrea Maddalena. He was stationed in Brindisi from 1736 to 1739 and was in Ortona from 1739 to 1742. During the famine that occurred near his hometown in 1765 he was on hand to distribute bread to the poor and to those suffering the most from the famine. He became known as a saint in his hometown and in the surrounding areas and was known for his strong Marian devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary whom he dubbed \\"Mamma Bella\\". Pirrotti also had a strong devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and spread the devotion of the Via Crucis. He also established the \\"Charity of God\\" as a means of spreading the Christian virtues and also to support the dying. From 1747 he began to suffer persecutions from detractors which led to him being suspended from hearing Reconciliation on the orders of the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples Antonio Sersale. King Charles III later signed a decree that led to Pirrotti's expulsion from the Kingdom of Naples; he rescinded the order upon increasing public pressure. On 15 April 1765 Pirrotti began the long journey to Ancona and arrived in Lecce on 12 July 1766. After celebrating Mass on 13 July, he went to hear confessions, but was suddenly taken ill and immediately confined to his bed. He died and was buried where he was, in Apulia; but in 1966 his remains were transferred to the Sanctuary created for him, Santuario San Pompilio Maria Pirrotti. Legacy There is a Roman Rite Catholic Church in Montecalvo Irpino, Italy, which is located in the Archdiocese of Benevento and is dedicated to St. Pompilio Maria Pirrotti. On 2 July 2006, a park in Campi Salentina was named in his honor. A \\"Pompiliano Year\\" was initiated in 2010 to commemorate the third centenary of his birth; in August 2010 his remains were briefly moved to his birthplace for the commemorations that took place in his hometown. Sainthood The proceedings for sainthood commenced in a diocesan process in Leece in 1835 and formal assent to the cause was granted not long after in which Pirrotti was accorded with the title Servant of God. Another process opened sometime after with the same intent of collecting documentation and material for compiling a large dossier on his life and works which was later transferred to the Congregation of Rites. On 17 November 1878 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Leo XIII recognized that the late priest had lived a model life of heroic virtue. The same pope celebrated his beatification on 26 January 1890 after he recognized two miracles attributed to Pirrotti. The pope later issued a decree allowing for the resumption of the cause on 4 December 1892. Following the recognition of two other miracles Pope Pius XI canonized Pirrotti as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 19 March 1934.  Family  Domenico Pirrotti was born in Montecalvo, Italy on September 29, 1710, the sixth of the eleven children of Jerome and Donna Pirrotti. His father was a lawyer and was of the noble class.

Description To the left of the entrance into the sanctuary of Apollo, opposite to the base of the Arcadians stood the large votive offering of the Lacaedemonians, celebrating their victory against the Athenians at Aegospotami in 405 B.C. It depicted Castor and Pollux, Zeus, Apollo, Artemis as well as the Spartan navarch Lysander, receiving a wreath by Poseidon, and finally the generals of the Lacaedemonians in this particular naval battle, such as Hermon (captain of Lysander's ship) and the soothsayer Agias: in total the monument comprised 38 bronze statues. Some fragments of the base, partly preserved and restored, are what is left nowadays from this pretentious monument. There are also preserved some fragments of epigrams from the base of the monument, referring to the Dioskouroi, to Lysander and to Arakos, admiral of the Lacaedemonian fleet. Pausanias mentions also some of the sculptors who worked for the construction of the monument: the Megarian Theokosmos had made the statue of Hermon, the Argive Antiphanes had made Castor and Pollux, Agias was created by Pison, originating from Kalavria in Troezen, and the Arcadians Dameas and Athenodoros had made the gods' statues.Pausanias, 10.9.7-9.

It was by this road that the Gauls marched into Aetolia in 279 BCE, when they surprised and destroyed Callium, and committed the most horrible atrocities on the inhabitants. et seq. Calliumn also lay on the road from Pyra (the summit of Oeta, where Heracles was supposed to have burnt himself) to Naupactus, and it was divided by Mount Corax from lower Aetolia. Its site is located near the modern Veloukhovos, at the site called \\"Steno\\", where the castle of Velouhovo was later built. Names and sources Thucydides mentions its inhabitants (Callienses or Kallieis) as the easternmost part of the Aetolian tribe of the Ophioneis. It was their chief town, and it is possible that Callium constituted the administrative centre of all the Ophioneis, as attested by Pausanias. In the Hellenistic period, as attested by the inscriptions, the city was called Callipolis, as cited by Stephanus of Byzantium. History Despite the fact that traces of habitation exist since the Geometric period, Callium was permanently settled in the 4th century BCE Its prosperity is possibly related to the rise of the Aetolian League into an important power in Greece. Its geographic location was particularly important and it is perhaps the reason why it was ravaged and completely destroyed by the Galatians in 279 BCE. Following their campaign, the city was rebuilt. Several of its citizens, as attested epigraphically, rose to the political hierarchy of the Aetolian League.Scholten, J., The POlitics of Plunder:Aitolians and their Koinon in the Early Hellenistic era (279-217 BC), University of California Press, 2000 Excavations revealed a wealthy city, with civic organization and sanctuaries. However, the inhabitants seem to have taken parts in the political frictions of the 2nd century BCE regarding the advent of ancient Rome. After the Battle of Pydna (167 BCE) it seems that Callium was destroyed by a fire possibly due to an arson. In the 9th century CE, Lidoriki appears to have succeeded Callium as it features in the episcopal lists of that time. In the 14th and 15th centuries only the castle of Lidoriki (Velouhovo) is mentioned, possibly identified with the remains of buildings and fortifications preserved on the ancient acropolis. Archaeological remains The site underwent systematic excavation in the period 1977-1979 by prof. Petros Themelis. Following the excavations, the site was inundated by the waters of the dam lake of Mornos. Among the archaeological finds counted the fortification precinct, the sanctuaries of Demeter and Kore and possibly of Eileithyia or Artemis Eileithyia, the bouleuterion, the agora, the theatre and the necropolis. In the renowned \\"house of the Archive\\" were discovered about 600 clay sealings, small pieces of clay with which the sender of a letter would stick on the ribbon which held it tied. This piece of clay bore the imprint of the sender's seal as a token that the letter was genuinely written by him. The sealings, which were probably not fired, were preserved due to the fire which destroyed the house. On the imprints one discerns symbols of city-states, such as Chios, Lamia, Delphi, mythological creatures and profiles of male figures, recognised as prominent kings, such as Ptolemy Philopator, Attalus I, Prusias of Bithynia etc. The entire group of sealings leads to the conclusion that Callium or at least the receiver of the documents bearing them maintained relations with the political authorities of large part of mainland Greece, of the islands as well as of the Hellenistic kingdoms. Several of the movable artifacts and finds are displayed in the Archaeological Collection of Lidoriki, whereas some have been transferred also into the Archaeological Museum of Amphissa.

Description Between the Bouleuterion and Sibyl's Rock in the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi there is a narrow pass leading to the fountain which the dragon Python was supposedly guarding. Apollo killed the dragon and then left for the land of the Hyperboreans in order to be expiated from the murder. This action signifies in mythology the transition from the early chthonic cults to the cult of the god of light and music. At that spot, in front of the rocks marking the pass, a round square is formed, called Halos (literally: a threshing floor), where several rituals were taking place. Among these rituals was the Septerion, the ritual re-enactment of the murder of Python by Apollo, taking place once every eight years. Plutarch Quaestiones Graecae 203C; Moralia, On Music, 1136A mentions that during the ritual cleansing of the site a boy, whose parent were both alive, would set fire on a wooden construction symbolizing the dwelling of Python and then went on to cleanse himself as Apollo had done, taking recourse initially in the Tempi Valley. Around the Halos, particularly on its north side, platforms and bases for monuments were erected, particularly in the Hellenistic period. Among them stands out the base for a statue of the Pergamene king Attalus II Philadelphus(159-138 B.C.), dedicated by the city of Delphi. To the northeast the Halos is delimited by the Polygonal wall, built after the destruction of the Temple of Apollo (Delphi) in 548 B.C., in order to support the ground for the erection of the new temple that was going to be built under the auspices of the Alcmaeonids. To the north of the Halos stood the Portico of the Athenians, also lying against the Polygonal wall. In 1939, in the course of repair works along the Sacred Way, a repository was discovered in front of the Halos, in which a large number of ex votos and other liturgical objects was discovered. These ex votos had been destroyed at a prior phase, by fire or other causes, and, according to the practice in those days, they were buried because it was forbidden to recycle or sell them.

On account of happiness and pleasures, the religion, renunciation and austerities was not possible. At the end of the third ara, the wish-fulfilling trees stopped giving the desired fruits and the people started living in the societies. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhanatha was born at the end of this period'. He taught the people the skills of farming, commerce, defence, politics and arts (intotal 72 arts for men and 64 arts for women) and organised the people in societies. That is why he is known as the father of human civilisation. * Du·∏•·π£ama-su·π£amƒÅ (read as Dukhma-sukhma) ‚Äì The fourth period was the age of religion, where the renunciation, austerities and liberation was possible. The 63 ≈öalƒÅkƒÅpuru·π£as, or the illustrious persons who promote the Jain religion, regularly appear in this ara. The remaining 23 Tƒ´rtha·πÖkars, including Lord MƒÅhavƒ´ra appeared in this ara. * Du·π£ama (read as Dukhma) ‚Äì According to Jain texts, currently we are in the fifth period. As of 2016, exactly 2,540 years have elapsed and 18,460 years are still left. It is an age of sorrow and misery. The maximum age a person can live to in this ara is not more than 125 years. The average height of people in this ara is six feet tall. No liberation is possible, although people practice religion in lax and diluted form. At the end of this ara, even the Jain religion will disappear, only to appear again with the advent of 1st Tirthankara in the next cycle. * Du·π£ama ‚Äì du·π£ama (read as Dukhma-dukhma)- The sixth period will be the age of intense misery and sorrow, making it impossible to practice religion in any form. The age, height and strength of the human beings will decrease to a great extent. In this era people will live for no more than 16‚Äì20 years. This trend will start reversing at the onset of utsarpi·πáƒ´ kƒÅl.  Panchama kƒÅla  The fifth period (dusamƒÅ) of the avasarpi·πáƒ´ is generally called Panchama KƒÅla. According to Jain texts, we are presently living in this period of time which started after 3 years and 8-and-a-half months of the liberation (nirvƒÅ·πáa) of the 24th Tƒ´rthankara MahƒÅvƒ´ra. It is said that at the end of this period, humans will be no more than one cubit in height, and twenty years in age. Bharata Chakravartin is said to have seen 16 dreams which were related to this period. These were explained by Tirthankara RishabhanƒÅtha.

Symptoms include redness of the skin, a burning sensation, and itchiness. This may then be followed by skin peeling. Itsan.org a reputable nonprofit are thought leaders in this area and work towards raising awareness and information for affected individuals. They also work with medical and regulatory bodies for policy changes of the drug use . It generally requires the application of a topical steroid at least daily for more than a year. It does not occur with normal use. It appears to be a specific adverse effect of steroid use. People with atopic dermatitis are most at risk. Treatment involves discontinuing the use of topical steroids. These can either be stopped gradually or suddenly. Counseling and cold compresses may also help. The condition is rare. Cases have been reported in adults with a few possible cases in children. It was first described in 1979. Signs and symptoms Red burning skin syndrome from topical steroids. Typical pattern on lower arms and hands Topical steroid addiction (TSA) is characterised by uncontrollable, spreading dermatitis and worsening skin inflammation which requires a stronger topical steroid to get the same result as the first prescription. This cycle is known as steroid addiction syndrome. When topical steroid medication is stopped, the skin experiences redness, burning, itching, hot skin, swelling, and/or oozing for a length of time. This is also called 'red skin syndrome' or 'topical steroid withdrawal' (TSW). After the withdrawal period is over the atopic dermatitis can cease or is less severe than it was before. = Duration = The duration of acute topical corticosteroid withdrawal is variable, it can take months to years to return to the skin's original condition. The duration of steroid use may influence the recovery factor time, with the patients who used steroids for the longest reporting the slowest recovery. Cause It generally requires the application of a topical steroid over long term. It does not occur with normal use. Cases have, however, been reported to occur after as short as 2 months of use.  Mechanism of action  Historically, it was believed that cortisol was only produced by the adrenal glands. Recent research has shown that keratinocytes in human skin also produce cortisol. Prolonged TS application changes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression pattern on the surface of lymphocytes; patients experiencing resistance to TSs have a low ratio of GR-Œ± to GR-Œ≤. In addition, the erythema characteristic of ‚Äò‚Äòred skin syndrome‚Äô‚Äô is due to a release of stored endothelial nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent vasodilation of dermal vessels. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on a rash occurring within weeks of stopping long term topical steroids. Headlight sign - redness of the lower part of the face but not the nose and around the mouth. Red sleeve - rebound eruption stopping suddenly at lower arms and hand. Elephant wrinkles - reduced skin elasticity. Differentiating from the skin condition the steroids were used to treat can be difficult. Red burning skin may be misdiagnosed.  Prevention  Prevention is by not using moderate or high strength steroid creams for periods of time longer than two weeks. ITSAN.org provides detailed information on how to prevent TSW . Treatment Treatment involves not using topical steroids. These can either be stopped gradually or suddenly. Counselling and cold compresses may also help. Antihistamines may help for itchiness. Immunosuppressants and light therapy may also help some people. Psychological support is often recommended. Epidemiology The condition is rare. Cases have been reported in adults with a few possible cases in children. One survey estimated that maybe up to 12% of people with atopic dermatitis have steroid addiction.

It is situated at a distance of 23 km from the city of Nafpaktos and 45 km from Galaxidi.Paths of Pausanias (in Greek). On the hilltop there have been discovered remains of an ancient acropolis with walls, subterranean cisterns and parts of a temple. On a lower level are traces of the ancient necropolis. Glyfada is a relatively recent settlement, as most inhabitants settled there in the beginning of the 1950s, coming from the mountain village Dafnochori (former Marazias), located to the north of Glyfada at an altitude of 905 meters. The name Glyfada comes from a fountain in this region, emanating brackish water, which flows into the sea close to the village's square. The inhabitants work as farmers, fishermen or herdsmen and especially with masonry. In the main square is situated the main church, dedicated to the Dormition of Mary. Administratively, Glyfada was an independent community until 1997. Between 1997 and 2011 it belonged to the municipality of Tolofon. From 2011 it is situated within the municipality of Dorida. Archaeology On the hill Paliokastro is located an ancient fortification, dating to the end of the 4th or beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Within this‚Äîso far unidentified‚Äìtown of western Locris one sees precincts erected on natural terraces and several remains of buildings, of which some were of a public or religious character.W. Woodhouse, Aetolia: Its Geography, Topography and Antiquities, 1897. Among them stands out a built cistern of relatively large dimensions. Outside of the fortification, particularly above the present-day settlement of Glyfa, is located the ancient city. To the northeast of the hill have been traced several remains of the Hellenistic period. In the region connecting Palaiokastro with the modern national road between Naupaktos and Itea was located the necropolis, of which some tombs are visible today. In the region was worshipped the goddess Vasileia, as attested by an ancient inscription found in Glyfa. Several views have been expressed regarding the town's identity: others identify it as ancient Anticyra, others with Oeantheia and others with Hyaeon polis, but none of these theories has so far been verified.Lerat, L., Les Locriens de l'Ouest, Paris, 1952 Cultural life In the summertime several cultural and athletic events take place in the village, particularly around the 15th of August. In the village function a maritime shelter, a public primary school, a medical station, a pharmacy and a center for the citizens' service. Glyfada has a homonymous football team as well.

It is a shrub with long leaves, sticky, shiny leaves and branches and bright red flowers Description Eremophila linearis is a glabrous shrub with sticky, shiny leaves and branches due to the presence of large amounts of resin. It grows to a height of between and its branches are thin with persistent leaf bases. The leaves are arranged alternately and densely clustered near the ends of the branches. They are mostly long, wide, linear to lance-shaped and covered with small raised resin glands. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk which is usually long. There are 5 sticky, overlapping, glabrous sepals which are mostly long but which enlarge to after flowering. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is bright red to orange-red on the top and yellow below and inside the tube. The outside of the petal tube usually has scattered hairs but the inside surface of the lobes is glabrous while there are some long hairs inside the tube. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs between March and December and the fruits which follow are dry, ovoid to conical in shape with a pointed end and a papery covering and are long.Karalundi E. linearis flower detail Taxonomy and naming Eremophila linearis was first formally described by botanist Robert Chinnock in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden in 1980. The specific epithet (linearis) is a Latin word meaning \\"linear\\". Distribution Harlequin fuchsia bush is widespread in central Western Australia, especially between Meekatharra and Newman in the Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions. It grows in clay-loam or sandy loam in depressions, river flats and rocky slopes. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Harlequin fuchsia bush is a compact, slow-growing but long lived shrub with bright green foliage and red flowers. Its growth habit makes it suitable as a windbreak or screening plant. It is one of the eremophilas that can be propagated from seed but only with difficulty from cuttings. Unless propagated by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock, it needs well-drained soil. It will grow in full sun or filtered shade and only requires occasional watering during a long drought. It will tolerate frost although severe frosts may damage branches that should be removed when the weather warms in spring.

The original French version Le Revolver de Maigret appeared in 1952.Carter, David. The Pocket Essential Georges Simenon. The Pocket Essentials, 2003. The theft of Inspector Jules Maigret's revolver from his home begins a detective story that leads to Maigret travelling from Paris to London to find the young man who stole it, and the woman who is in danger of being his victim. Summary An agitated young man visits Maigret's home while he is out, wanting to talk to him, but instead steals his revolver. Maigret and his wife later go to a dinner party of his acquaintance Dr. Pardon, where an expected guest, Fran√ßois Lagrange, a patient of Pardon whose occupation is a mystery, fails to appear. Dr. Pardon visits Lagrange, who seems to have had a shock, and whose son has disappeared. Aware of a possible link between Lagrange and the young man. Maigret visits the agitated Lagrange, learns something of his family and obtains a photograph of his son Alain; on his way out the concierge says that Lagrange had a trunk removed from his apartment the previous night. This is investigated: the trunk, left at the Gare du Nord, contains the body of Andr√© Delteil, a lawyer and deputy, well known for exposing scandals. He had been murdered before Maigret's revolver was stolen. Lagrange is incoherent, and Maigret, wondering if his behaviour is genuine or a pretence, has him taken to the Police Infirmary. The photograph, which Maigret's wife has confirmed is that of the mystery visitor, is circulated. Alain Lagrange has robbed someone of a wallet, threatening with Maigret's revolver, and has come to an apartment block nearby; the concierge says he did not visit anyone, but soon afterwards a resident with suitcases left for the Gare du Nord. This is Jeanne Debul: her maid tells Maigret she has a high-class social life, and Fran√ßois Lagrange regularly visited her. She is on her way to England via Calais. Maigret, suspecting that Alain Lagrange is following Jeanne Debul with the intention of killing her, travels to London, by air from Le Bourget Airport to Croydon Airport. He has found that Jeanne Debul's destination is the Savoy Hotel, and visits her in her room, but does not find out what business there is between her and Fran√ßois Lagrange. He spends some time in the reception hall waiting for Alain's appearance; detectives from Scotland Yard are also looking out for him. Maigret eventually finds Alain waiting in Jeanne Debul's room while she is out. Treating him to a meal in the hotel restaurant, Maigret learns about Alain's father and recent events at his home; the links between his father, Jeanne Debul and Andr√© Delteil become clear.

The temple was built during 12 century and was consecrated in the year 1130 AD by Saint Ramanujacharya. The temple is one of the earliest structures in Tirupati and also one of the biggest temple complex in Chittoor district. The Tirupati(down hill) city is built around this temple. The temple at current is being administered by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. Legend It is believed that during invasion of Govindaraja Perumal Temple in Chidambaram, the Utsava murti(processional deity) was brought to Tirupati for safe keeping. The Utsavamurtis were taken back after the invasions. History Sri Govindarajaswamy Temple was consecrated in the year 1130 AD by saint Ramanujacharya. However, there are structures inside the temple complex which belong to 9th and 10th centuries. Before consecrating Govindarajaswamy as presiding deity, Sri Parthasarathy Swamy was the presiding deity of the temple. Kotturu, a village at the foot of Tirumala hills was shifted to the vicinity of Sri Govindarajaswamy Temple which was later emerged into city of Tirupati. Presiding Deity The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who is referred to as Govindarajaswamy.The deity will be in reclining yoga nidra posture, facing east, by keeping right hand under his head and left hand straight over his body. Sridevi and Bhudevi the consorts of Vishnu will be in sitting posture at the foot of Govindaraja. Before Govindaraja shrine consecration Sri Parthasarathi Swamy was the primary deity of the temple. Architecture The temple is one of the huge temple complexes in Andhra Pradesh. A 50 m high, seven storied Rajagopuram was constructed on east entrance of the temple by Matla Anantaraja, a local chieftain. This structure has Ramayana scenes and portrait of Matla Anantaraja and his three wives carved onto the passage walls. Towards the west of Rajagopuram, there are two enclosures of the temple, arranged one behind the other. The outer enclosure hosts sub shrines of Pundarikavalli and Alvars. The inner enclosure hosts the main shrine of Govindaraja along with shrines of Krishna with his consorts, Andal. Towards south west corner of the inner enclosure, there is a shrine dedicated to Kalyana Venkateswara which had a mandapa with finely finished colonettes on the outerpiers and with central space lined with yalis projecting inwards. The pavilion in the middle had columns of grey green granite and wooden roof. Administration The temple at present is being administered by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. Sub-Shrines Sri Govindarajaswamy temple is a huge complex with many other sub shrines in it. Parthasarathy temple, Kalyana Venkateswara Temple are of more importance among the sub-shrines. There are also shrines dedicated to Pundarikavalli, Andal, Chakratalwar, Alvars, Lakshmi Narayana Swamy, Anjaneya, Tirumala Nambi, Bhashyakars. =Parthasarathy Shrine= =Kalyana Venkateswara Shrine= Festivals  Gallery  File:Govindaraja brahmotsavams lightings.jpgGovindaraja temple in lights during brahmotsavams File:Govindaraja on Pedda sesha vahanam.jpgGovindaraja processional deity along with Sridevi and Bhudevi on Pedda sesha vahanam during brahmotsavams File:Unjal Mandapam of govindharaja Temple.jpgUnjal Mandapam of govindharaja Temple File:Matla anantha Raju and his family at rajagopuram govindharaja Temple.jpgMatlaanantha Raju and his family at rajagopuram govindharaja Temple File:A four pillared Mandapam in front of govindharaja Temple.jpgA four pillared Mandapam in front of Govindaraja Temple File:Sri Govinda Raja Swamy Temple in Tirupati.jpgRajagopuram of the temple See also *Hindu Temples in Tirupati *List of temples under Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams *Govindaraja Perumal Temple, Chidambaram  References  External links * Tirupati Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India Category:Hindu temples in Chittoor district Category:Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Category:12th-century Hindu temples Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1130 Category:Vishnu temples ","title":"Govindaraja Temple, Tirupati"},{"id":"49381946","text":"Abdurahman Khairallah (, born 23 February 1996) simply as Abdurahman Khairallah , he is a Saudi Arabian football player who currently plays for Al- Bukayriyah as a Winger .

Consumer Electronics (CE) products that are certified to the VidiPath Guidelines can directly support the full range of subscriber HD programs, movies, DVR content, channel guides, and other premium features, all with a consistent user interface (UI) from their service provider. In December 2012, the FCC ordered cable operators to use an open standard to update their cable boxes so they could support HD streaming over home networks to devices like PCs, smart TVs and tablets, and allow HD video recording on external devices through home networks, and cited the successor to the DLNA Premium Video Profile (later renamed VidiPath) as an example of a compliant protocol that cable companies could adopt. In May 2015, the FCC published an update saying that TiVo and cable operators that lease set-top boxes to subscribers now had until June 1, 2015 (or September 1, 2015 for smaller cable operators) to comply with the rule, and that TiVo had been issued a waiver until June 1, 2017, temporarily deferring TiVo's implementation of the DLNA standard. VidiPath was also identified by the FCC in an August 2015 Final Report of the FCC's Downloadable Security Technology Advisory Committee (DSTAC). DSTAC promotes the competitive availability of navigation devices (e.g., set-top boxes and television sets) in furtherance of Section 629 of the Communications Act.

The group aims to share content and technology practice within the transformation the journalism industry is currently experiencing, in an environment characterised by rapid growth in Internet-based readers. The members of LENA are Die Welt (Germany), El Pa√≠s (Spain), La Repubblica (Italy), Le Figaro (France), Le Soir (Belgium), Swiss German-language newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, French-language newspaper Tribune de Gen√®ve and Polish-language newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. These publications have a joint readership of seven million, in addition to 43 million unique Internet users. Javier Moreno Barber, editor in-chief of El Pa√≠s from 2006 to 2014, was the group's director until May 2017. His successor is Christoph Zimmer, Head of Communications at Tamedia, who heads the group of member representatives. The initiative is intended to consolidate European public opinion through content that the seven members of LENA share and produce jointly. This includes exchanging journalists and other employees. The seven newspapers share new practices and digital techniques in technology, trade and publishing. Each newspaper submits selected articles to a shared platform, where members can select the ones they believe to be of greatest interest to their readers, to increase dissemination of content like interviews, reports and opinion articles, written by experts, academics and public figures from different disciplines. As part of its strategy, LENA promotes and organizes international events in Europe. In January 2016, as part of the World Economic Forum, held in Davos, LENA organized a debate on the challenges represented by integrating refugees. Issues for which LENA members have worked jointly include refugees of the Syrian Civil War, the Greek government-debt crisis, the political challenges of the EU and the consequences of economic sanctions on Russia.

It is one of the essential duties prescribed for both the ≈örƒÅvaka (householders) and ascetics. The preposition sam means one state of being. To become one is samaya. That, which has oneness as its object, is sƒÅmƒÅyikam. SƒÅmƒÅyika is aimed at developing equanimity and to refrain from injury. On the third pratimƒÅ (stage) the householder resolves to observe the sƒÅmƒÅyika vow three times a day. According to the Jain text, Purushartha Siddhyupaya: SƒÅmƒÅyika is also one of the five kinds of conduct (cƒÅritra) other kinds being reinitiation, purity of non-injury, slight passion and perfect conduct. It is of two kinds ‚Äî with and without time limit.  Duration  The sƒÅmƒÅyika is performed for an antara-muhurta (about 48 minutes) every day. Champat Rai Jain in his book The Key of Knowledge writes:  Procedure  In performing sƒÅmƒÅyika, the ≈õrƒÅvaka has to stand facing north or east and bow to the Pa√±ca-Parame·π£·π≠hi. He then sit down and recites the Namokara mantra a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in: *pratikramana, recounting the sins committed and repenting for them, *pratyƒÅkhyanƒÅ, resolving to avoid particular sins in future, *sƒÅmƒÅyika karma, renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike, *stuti, praising the four and twenty Tƒ´rthankaras, *vandanƒÅ, devotion to a particular Tirthankara, and *kƒÅyotsarga, withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self. According to Jain text, Puru≈üƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya: For the sake of strengthening the performance of daily meditation (sƒÅmƒÅyika), one must undertake fasting twice each lunar fortnight (pro≈üadhopavƒÅsa).  Posture  The posture for sƒÅmƒÅyika may be either ‚Äî # padma ƒÅsana, the sitting posture, with inter-locked legs (the right one placed on the left thigh and the left on the right), the hands placed in the lap with the palms facing upwards (the right one being on the top), and with attention fixed on the foremost point of the nose; # khadga ƒÅsana, the standing posture, with feet at a distance of about two inches from each other, the hands resting naturally by the sides, but not so as to touch the body; and attention fixed on the point of the nose as in the padma ƒÅsana; or # ardha padma ƒÅsana or the semi-padma posture, which differs from the padma in respect of the position of the left leg, which is placed under the right thigh.  Great vows  The householders, due to the absence of all sinful activities during the period of meditation (sƒÅmƒÅyika), observe great vows, although the conduct-deluding karmas remain in operation. According to AchƒÅrya Pujyapada's SarvƒÅrthasiddhi:  Transgressions  Jain texts list down five transgressions of the vow of sƒÅmƒÅyika. These are- Misdirected activity of the speech, mind, and body, lack of earnestness, and absent mindedness. In performing the samayika meditation the following points are prescribed for the monk: #he should not perform it disrespectfully, #nor filled with pride of learning, #nor to be considered pious by his fellow-men, #nor in a manner to cause disturbance to any other living being, #he should not move the body about at the time, #nor force it into a crooked position, e.g. bending the fingers. #not contract or gather together the bodily limbs, #not raise himself up and down like a fish on the top of a wave; #he should rid his mind of all cruel thoughts; #he should not encircle his knees with his hands; #he should not become engaged in its performance imbued with fear, #or with disgust, or without understanding its aim, #or filled with conceit at his supernatural acquisitions (if any), #nor with pride of birth; #he should not take to it (samayika) sneakingly, that is as a thief, i.e., behind the back of the (preceptor), #nor neglect its proper time, #he should not allow the mind to be filled with unholy thoughts of hatred and the like for others; #he should not excite fear in any one‚Äôs heart, #not talk to any one at the time, #nor think evil of any one, #nor suffer himself to frown, #nor entertain ungenerous sentiments in his heart, #nor allow his gaze to wander about in different directions, #nor sit down without carefully inspecting the ground, to avoid causing injury to insect life, #nor lose interest in the middle of the process. #nor should he neglect it altogether for the want of any of the necessary accessories, #he shouldn't allow his heart to be assailed by desire for sense-gratification, #nor omit to recite the whole of the recitation, nor get up in the middle (that is, before the end of the text appointed for the purpose), #nor blur over his words, nor hurry over some parts and linger unnecessarily over others; #nor mumble, like a dumb person, nor make faces or signs, #nor vociferate in a croaky voice, like a frog; and, #he should not allow his mind to play the truant at the time, that is, to run after the good things of the world.

It specialises in the natural sciences and modern languages and is named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The school offers a bilingual English profile, which makes it unique in Karlsruhe.  Profile and school life today  English and French or Latin are taught from fifth grade at the Goethe Gymnasium. From seventh grade they offer a bilingual English profile. In eighth grade students have the option to choose between a language profile, with Italian as their third foreign language, or a natural science profile in which science and technology are compulsory. The bilingual orientation of the school entails intensive English lessons in fifth and sixth grade. In twelfth grade students have the option to take the Cambridge Certificate of Advanced English. The Goethe Gymnasium has their own Big Band and multiple choirs that perform inside and outside of school. A German drama group completes the cultural extracurricular activities of the school.  History  = Foundation (1908-1918) = The Goethe School was founded in 1908. Dr. Peter Treutlein was the first headmaster. Classes started with 417 students and 16 full-time teachers in the magnificent building that was built for 1 million German marks (now approximately US$500,000). During World War I the school was used as a barracks while classes were moved elsewhere. = Time between the wars and World War II (1919 - 1945) = The time between 1919 and 1933 was shaped by headmaster Dr. Karl Ott. In this period the school's reputation as a prestigious school that successfully combined the natural sciences and modern languages was established. After Hitler seized power in 1933 Dr. Ott was de facto replaced by convinced Nazi Dr. Oe√ü and actually dismissed in 1934. Like other schools the Goethe-School could not avoid Gleichschaltung - Nazi terminology for the process of establishing a totalitarian system of control over society. In World War II the school was once again used as accommodation for various organizations. The school was severely damaged by a series of airstrikes, especially on 26/27 September and 4 December 1944. = New beginning and stabilisation (1945-1965) = In the early years classes were taught in several buildings, sometimes even in the teachers' private homes. The rebuilding of the school started in 1947 and was formally reopened three years later in 1950. The Goethe Gymnasium still offers two profiles in continuation of the old tradition: a profile focused on modern languages with Latin as the first foreign language, and a profile focused on maths and the natural sciences with special emphasis on maths. In these years the school established a particularly good reputation through its contacts with the US, France, Italy and Finland. Professor Dolland (1945-1951) and Mr. Eisele (until 1966) were headmasters of the school at the time. = Years of change (1966-1995) = In the course of the babyboom years and a general lack of schools, teachers and funding (the so-called Bildungsnotstand), the school gained more and more students. However, the economic recession and multiple political and societal disruptions forced the school to reconsider things that were previously taken for granted. Not even the Goethe Gymnasium was spared from the repercussions of these events. After a period of conflict the school managed to resume a state of constructive collaboration with parents and students in 1973, granting them more say in school matters. At the same time the school was evolving in other areas: French was offered as a first foreign language from 1971. In the same year, coeducation was introduced, thereby ending the 45-year period as a school for boys. In 1977 the school started implementing the tracking system, where students are divided into separate classes according to their choice of courses, instead of continuing to educate them in the same class in all subjects, for their last two years of education. Like many other schools in Karlsruhe, the Goethe Gymnasium experienced a decrease in the number of students during the 1980s. However, their cooperation with the nearby Fichte Gymnasium allowed them to maintain a broad choice of courses. Mr. Steinbacher (until 1976) and Mr. Mangler (until 1993) were headmasters during these years. = A new profile (from 1995) = In the 1990s the school was further put to the test. Europeanization and globalization, as well as an ever-changing student body and new career expectations presented new challenges. The school reacted to these changes by creating a new profile that met the new requirements: in addition to the language profile, which offers Italian as a third foreign language, a natural science profile was introduced, which makes courses dedicated to scientific work compulsory. The students immediately accepted these new profiles.  Centennial  The school celebrated its centennial in 2008. In anticipation of this event the history club was founded in 2006. A book to commemorate the event was compiled from private and official archives and an exhibition was organized. The festivities culminated in a ceremony and celebration on February 23.  Alumni  Every year on the first Friday in February at 8pm the school organizes a reunion for all alumni.

The name of the operation, \\"Kikusui\\", comes from the hata-jirushi of the samurai Kusunoki Masashige. Background After the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Imperial Japanese Navy was close to decimation, and was no longer in a position to challenge the United States-led Allied fleet. But after Task Force 58 started to mount air raids on Kyushu in March 1945, the approach of the United States fleet affirmed to the Japanese military that the Allies were in dominance in the seas around Japan, and that so-called normal tactics had little effect in the face of overwhelming Allied firepower. To counter the Allies, extremist views regarding the use of weaponry started to appear among the Japanese military. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Japanese kamikaze aircraft had successfully sunk the escort carrier . In addition, kamikaze aircraft had caused heavy damage to 2 US Navy aircraft carriers during air battles off Kyushu. These incidents convinced the Imperial General Headquarters of the effectiveness of kamikaze attacks, and that they were an effective solution to turn the deteriorating war situation around; as a result, massive kamikaze attacks were planned against the US Navy. On 20 March 1945, the Imperial General Headquarters commenced Operation Ten-Go to defend Okinawa against the impending Allied invasion. Air groups mobilized included Carrier Division 5, 1st Mobile Land-based Air Fleet (Kyushu, commanded by Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki), 5th Land-based Air Fleet (Formosa), and the Imperial Japanese Army 6th Aviation Army's 8th Flying Division (Formosa, commanded by Lieutenant General Kenji Yamamoto). These forces undertook preparations for Operation Kikusui (which was an Imperial Japanese Navy code name; the Imperial Japanese Army referred to it as the \\"total air assault\\"), and stationed over 3,000 various combat aircraft in Kyushu. On 1 April 1945, the Imperial General Headquarters issued commands for \\"the conversion to special attack aircraft of all Army and Navy warplanes\\"; from then on, the vast majority of Japanese warplanes were used as kamikaze aircraft. On that same day, the Allies commenced Operation Iceberg. To hold back the Allied advance, orders for the Imperial Japanese Navy's \\"Operation Kikusui I\\" and the Imperial Japanese Army's \\"1st total air assault\\" were issued on the morning of 6 April. Simultaneously, the Hibiscus Fleet, consisting of new attack planes (Tenzans, Gingas, Hiryuus and Suiseis) belonging to the Imperial Japanese Navy participated in night attacks against the Allied fleet.  Battles  =Operation Kikusui I= On 6 April 1945, the Japanese military commenced Operation Kikusui I (referred to by the Army as the 1st total air assault), with 391 Navy planes and 133 Army planes (of which 215 Navy planes and 82 Army planes were kamikazes) taking part. US Navy anti- air radar picket destroyers deployed in the waters off Okinawa bore the brunt of the attack. At 12:26 pm, the destroyer Haynsworth became the first warship struck. The destroyers Bush and Colhoun were sunk by kamikazes and the destroyers Newcomb and Leutze took heavy damage; the battleship Maryland and 10 other destroyers were targeted by kamikazes as well. The US Navy claimed the loss of 3 destroyers, 1 amphibious warfare ship and 2 munitions transports, along with over 10 other ships heavily damaged. During Operation Kikusui I, the Surface Special Attack Force, consisting of the battleship Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and 8 destroyers, under the command of Vice- Admiral Seiichi It≈ç, left for Okinawa to support ground defense operations there, but were repulsed by over 300 carrier aircraft belonging to Admiral Mitscher's Task Force 58 at Bou-no-Misaki, between Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands, on 7 April; this came to be known in Japan as the Naval Battle of Bou-no-Misaki. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost the battleship Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and 4 destroyers. The Japanese military continued air attacks between 8 and 11 April, and on 11 April the aircraft carrier Enterprise and the battleship Missouri were damaged by kamikaze aircraft, and the aircraft carrier Essex took hull damage below the waterline. =Operation Kikusui II= Operation Kikusui II commenced on 12 April, and consisted of 354 Navy planes and 124 Army planes (of which 103 Navy planes and 72 Army planes were kamikazes). Main achievements by the operation include hits on the battleships Tennessee and Idaho; and at least eight other U.S. Navy warships. The human-operated flying bomb Ohka first appeared in Operation Kikusui II; this flying bomb was carried by bombers and was more difficult for US forces to shoot down due to its small size, light weight and high speed. The destroyer Mannert L. Abele became the first and only US Navy ship to be sunk by this type of bomb.'' =Operation Kikusui III= Operation Kikusui III commenced on 16 April, and consisted of 415 Navy planes and 92 Army planes (of which 176 Navy planes and 52 Army planes were kamikazes). Main achievements by the operation include sinking the destroyer Pringle, as well as damaging the aircraft carrier Intrepid and destroyer Laffey, the latter taking six kamikaze and four bomb hits from 22 attackers, earning her the nickname \\"The Ship That Would Not Die\\". =Operation Kikusui IV= Operation Kikusui IV took place from 21 to 29 April, and consisted of 845 Navy planes (of which 126 were kamikazes) and 11 Army planes. Only 3 destroyers were damaged. Due to Japanese kamikaze attacks in April 1945, US Navy losses in the seas around Okinawa began to climb. With the start of Operation Kikusui V, the US Navy carrier fleet began to receive attention by the kamikazes. =Operation Kikusui V= Formidable set ablaze by kamikaze attacks On 3 May, 449 planes of the Okinawa Aviation Fleet (including 160 kamikazes) commenced Operation Kikusui V. Main achievements include sinking 2 destroyers, damaging 1 escort aircraft carrier, and damaging the British aircraft carrier Formidable. =Operation Kikusui VI= Bunker Hill set ablaze by kamikaze attacks Operation Kikusui VI commenced on 11 May, and consisted of 345 planes (including 86 kamikazes); attacks from 12 to 15 May consisted of 237 planes (including 47 kamikazes). The most significant achievement in these attacks was major damage to Mitscher's flagship, the aircraft carrier Bunker Hill: 2 kamikaze aircraft; the first piloted by Sub Lieutenant Seiz≈ç Yasunori, the second by Ensign Kiyoshi Ogawa struck Bunker Hill and triggered large explosions, but did not sink her as a result of improved damage control capabilities on part of US Navy personnel; however, the damage was severe enough that Bunker Hill did not return to the battlefield before the end of the war. Mitscher transferred his flag to the aircraft carrier Enterprise after being evacuated off Bunker Hill. Among the crew, 352 sailors and pilots were killed, 41 disappeared and 264 were wounded. On 14 May, Mitscher's flagship, Enterprise, was heavily damaged by one kamikaze pilot, Lt. Shunsuke Tomiyasu, resulting in 13 deaths and 68 people wounded. The ship withdrew from the battlefield. As a result, Mitscher transferred his flag to the carrier Randolph. =Operation Kikusui VII= Operation Kikusui VII took place between 23 and 25 May, and consisted of 387 Navy planes and 174 Army planes (of which 107 Navy planes and 61 Army planes were kamikazes). However, the achievements were quite small compared to the previous operation, with only 1 transport sunk and 1 escort aircraft carrier damaged. =Operation Kikusui VIII= Operation Kikusui VIII took place between 28 and 29 May, and consisted of 217 Navy planes and 71 Army planes (of which 51 Navy planes and 57 Army planes were kamikazes). Due to reduced airstrike capabilities on part of the Japanese military, achievements were small, only sinking 1 destroyer, the USS Drexler and damaging several ships. =Operation Kikusui IX= Operation Kikusui IX took place between 3 and 7 June, and consisted of 367 Navy planes and 71 Army planes (of which 23 Navy planes and 31 Army planes were kamikazes). Main achievements include damage to the battleship USS Mississippi on 5 June, one escort aircraft carrier and the heavy cruiser USS Louisville on 5 June. In the Okinawa land offensive, the United States had taken the prefectural capital, Naha, and the Japanese were forced into the southernmost tip of Okinawa Island. =Operation Kikusui X= Due to the Japanese defeat in the Okinawa land offensive, the Imperial General Headquarters launched one final Kikusui operation between 16 and 22 June, while making preparations for a final showdown on the Japanese home islands. Operation Kikusui X consisted of 271 Navy planes (of which 67 were kamikazes); it achieved only 1 destroyer sunk; and one escort carrier ship damaged. Aftermath In total, the Imperial Japanese Navy deployed 940 aircraft and the Imperial Japanese Army deployed 887 aircraft, each of varying types, in Operation Kikusui. Of these, 133 planes scored hits, and 122 planes scored near misses. Casualties include 2,045 Navy aviators and 1,022 Army aviators killed (not including losses other than kamikazes). If non-kamikaze aircraft are included, 2,258 aircraft were lost. On the Allied side, 36 ships were sunk (but no cruisers or larger were sunk), 218 ships were damaged (including 8 aircraft carriers, 3 battleships, 2 cruisers and 33 destroyers), and 763 carrier aircraft were lost; casualties include over 4,900 killed or missing, and 4,824 wounded. Although the Kikusui kamikazes inflicted severe damage, no heavy Allied ships were sunk. One reason for this is the outstanding damage control capabilities on part of the Allies, successfully preventing many ships from sinking. Another reason is the poor training and discipline of the Japanese aircrews, which led them to attempt to sink whatever ship was in sight without effectively identifying their targets; as a result, the massive number of Allied destroyers effectively diluted the kamikaze attacks on large Allied ships, and led to the preservation of most of the Allied naval aviation firepower despite severe losses. Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, the officer in charge of Operation Kikusui, performed one \\"final kamikaze attack\\" after hearing of Japan's surrender, piloting a Suisei, and was shot down and killed in the seas around Okinawa.

Irma Bandiera began to help the demobilised Italian soldiers after the armistice and took an interest in politics, joining the Communist Party. In the village of Funo, where she would visit relatives, she met a medical student, Dino Cipollani from Argelato, the partisan \\"Marco\\". Irma joined the Resistance, at the time very active in the Bolognese plain, with the name of battle \\"Mimma\\" in the VII GAP brigade, Gianni Garibaldi of Bologna. On 5 August 1944 the partisans killed a German officer and a commander of the SS, which triggered a reprisal the next day in Funo. Three partisans were arrested and imprisoned. On 7 August 1944, Irma Bandiera was carrying weapons to the her group's base in Castel Maggiore.Radio Citt√† del Capo In the evening she was arrested at her uncle's house, along with two other partisans. They were locked up in the schools of San Giorgio, but she was separated from her companions. She was then transferred to Bologna, where her captors hoped to obtain further information about the Resistance from her. While her family was looking for her in prisons and barracks, Irma Bandiera was tortured for a week by the fascists of the Special Autonomous Company, led by Captain Renato Tartarotti, who blinded her, but Irma resisted without speaking, thus saving her fellow partisans. According to Renata Vigan√≤, \\"the most ignominious defeat of their bloody profession was called Irma Bandiera.\\"Renata Vigan√≤, \\"Donne della Resistenza\\" Finally, the Fascists shot her point-blank at the Meloncello di Bologna, near her parents' house, on 14 August.Il Martiro di Irma Bandiera On 14 August Irma's body was found on the pavement near a factory, where her torturers had left her in open display for a whole day as a warning. Her body was then taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in via Irnerio where a guardian, a friend of the Resistance, took pictures of her face devastated by torture. Irma was finally buried in the cemetery of the Certosa di Bologna, in the company of family and some friends. The Bolognese federation of the Italian Communist Party on 4 September 1944 circulated a clandestine paper in which they recalled the patriotic sense of the sacrifice of Irma, calling on people to intensify the partisan struggle for liberation from Nazi-fascism. In her honor, in the summer of 1944, a group of partisans operating in Bologna took the name of First Garibaldi Brigade \\"Irma Bandiera\\". A SAP brigade (Patriotic Action Team) operating in the northern suburbs of Bologna was also named after her, as well as a Women's Defense Group.  Honours and memory  Gold Medal of Military Valour At the end of the war Irma Bandiera was decorated posthumously with the Gold Medal of Military Valor, along with 18 other women partisans. The justification mentions how > \\"First among the Bolognese women to hold arms for the fight in the name of > freedom, she always fought with a lion's courage. Captured in combat by the > German SS, subjected to fierce torture, she did not say a word that could > compromise her comrades.

Irma Bandiera is remembered in the Shrine of Piazza Nettuno and in the Monument to the Partisan Falls in Villa Spada. Streets are named after her in the municipalities of Bologna, Argelato, Castel Maggiore, Castelnovo di Sotto, Cattolica, Copparo, Crevalcore, Granarolo dell'Emilia, Malalbergo, Molinella, Pieve di Cento, Sant'Ilario d'Enza, San Giorgio di Piano in Emilia-Romagna, as well as Rovigo, Terni, Civitavecchia, Ribera (in the province of Agrigento), Gonnesa, Sant'Arpino (in the province of Caserta) and Valenza (in the province of Alessandria).A large housing complex also bears her name in Frattamaggiore.

It was established in 1995 by group of people with just one goal: making a better Pakistan through education. It started out with just one school and handful of students in Karachi. Today, GCT aims to making schools a reality for deserving children in underprivileged areas of Sindh. It has expanded their schools network making them more accessible to these children.  Introduction  GCT is a professional non-profit organization operated by professionals under the supervision of the Board of Trustees, which runs schools in underprivileged areas of Sindh for the boys and girls in the rural and urban areas. The founders took this initiative with a very few number of students. Now with the same passion and enthusiasm, bestowed on that first school, GCT has managed to expand their journey of education and expended their chain of schools in all over Sindh. GCT aims to bring a behavioral change in the communities regarding quality education, community building, and motivation and providing opportunities to bring enhancements in their daily lives. For that they have expanded their services in Orphan Support Program, Centre for Educational Research and Development (CERD) for teachers training and Development, The Water Project for the people of Tharparkar. It is profoundly difficult in rural areas of Sindh to encourage families to gain education, especially for females. Hence, to achieve this, GCT hires the female staff from within the community and trains them for community mobilization, which greatly helps in convincing the parents to send their children to school. GCT has managed to increase female ratio from 20% to 40% in last 3 years.  Hilal Public School System  Hilal Public School System (HPSS) run by GCT since 1995 was initiated with just one school. HPSS is a network of curriculum-based schools providing subsidized education to underprivileged children across Sindh. HPSS is running 165 schools successfully all over the Sindh with more than 1200 teachers and 33,000 students.  Center for Educational Research and Development  Center for Educational Research and Development (CERD) is the professional training and development center for Teachers and Parents. CERD is providing training to all the GCT Teachers and Parents to bring about a substantial change in their lives through Education. CERD also provides training to other NGOs, Non-Profit Organizations and Charities.  Water Project  Water is one of the main and basic essences of every human. People of Tharparkar (Sindh, Pakistan) are starving for water, not only for them and their families, but also for the cattle they breed as their means of livelihood. The females of Tharparkar travel a minimum of 3 km daily in scorching heat for search of water for their families. GCT realized the need of water, when they found out that most of students of HPSS, are not in good health in the Tharparkar region. They took the initiative in 2014 and up till now the GCT has installed 430 water projects, which covers almost 90,000 beneficiaries. Every village now has their own project, providing a safe reliable source of water right outside their homes.  Orphan Support Program  Orphan Support Program (OSP) with the help of donors to help fulfilling the need of education, ethical and moral, health and sustenance need of orphans. Under OSP more than 1600 Orphans are getting supported. The four main elements are: * Subsistence: monthly ration, clothes, hygiene kits * Education: school fee, books, stationary, uniforms, shoes * Health: proper medical checkups, referrals * Social Activities: picnics, visits to amusement places, confidence building, art and creativity encouragement.  GCT Book Bank  GCT along with quality education also provides the necessities of education to the deserving students. GCT Book Bank is the program in which books are purchased for the students who could not afford them. These books are then laminated and made a hard cover, which increases their lifespan to 3 to 4 years, ensuring recycling and avoiding paper waste.  Donations  Being a non-profit organization, the main source of income is from donations, with most of the sources coming from Pakistan, which included corporate and development sectors. Almost 70% of the donations are utilized in education like building and running schools, providing basic equipment, computer and science labs, library books, uniforms and course books. The rest of the donations include 20% in OSP, CERD and Water Project and 10% is allocated for administration cost.

Biography  Boris Shcherbakov was born in Vasilyevsky Island, Leningrad, in December 11, 1949, his father was a chauffeur and mother a factory worker. The Shcherbakov family consisted of five people, who lived in a sixteen-meter communal flat in Opochinin's street on Vasilyevsky Island. The room window looked out onto the Gulf of Finland, to which were ships, and Boris dreamed of what it would be like to become a captain and travel. At the age of 12 Boris was selected for the role of Glebka Prokhorov in the children's adventure film Mandate. In 1967, Boris graduated from high school and tried to enter LGITMIK, but did not pass the competition on the third round. Despite this setback, he entered the Krupskaya Institute of Culture for the directing faculty. A year later, Boris Shcherbakov learned that in Moscow Pavel Massalsky would be recruiting a course at the Moscow Art Theatre School. He decided to quit everything and go to try his luck in Moscow. The dean of the Krupskaya Institute of Culture nevertheless insisted that Boris would stay and finish the exams. Departing to Moscow with a delay (because of the passing of exams), Boris was horrified to learn that the exams at the Moscow Art Theatre School were already finished - due to the fact that the theater was leaving for a tour to Japan, the exams were held a week earlier. Nevertheless, he managed to convince Massalsky to take him for his course. In 1972, Boris graduated from the Moscow Art Theater School and in the same year became an actor of the Moscow Art Theater. His first work in a new capacity was the role of Sanka in the production of \\"Steelworkers\\". In 2003, Boris Shcherbakov resigned from the Moscow Art Theater. In 1997, he starred in the clips of singer Lyubov Uspenskaya \\"Carousel\\" and \\"I'm Lost\\".

Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators. Methodology and user guide. OECD Publications, Paris.) for summarizing a set of individual indicators that are assumed to be not fully substitutable.The components of a composite index are called 'substitutable' if a deficit in one component may be compensated by a surplus in another (e.g., a low value of ‚ÄúProportion of people who have participated in religious or spiritual activities‚Äù can be offset by a high value of ‚ÄúProportion of people who have participated in meetings of cultural or recreational associations‚Äù and vice versa). Similarly, the components of a composite index are called 'non-substitutable' if a compensation among them is not allowed (e.g., a low value of ‚ÄúLife expectancy at birth‚Äù cannot be offset by a high value of ‚ÄúGDP per capita‚Äù and vice versa). It is based on a non-linear function which, starting from the arithmetic mean of the normalized indicators, introduces a penalty for the units with unbalanced values of the indicators (De Muro et al., 2011De Muro, P., Mazziotta, M., Pareto, A. (2011). Composite Indices of Development and Poverty: An Application to MDGs. Social Indicators Research, 104, 1‚Äì18.). Two version of the index have been proposed: (a) MPI, and (b) adjusted MPI (AMPI). The first version is the best solution for a 'static' analysis (e.g., a single-year analysis), whereas the second one is the best solution for a 'dynamic' analysis (e.g., a multi-year analysis). For a comparison between the two versions, see Mazziotta and Pareto (2015).Mazziotta, M., Pareto, A. (2015). On a Generalized Non-compensatory Composite Index for Measuring Socio-economic Phenomena. Social Indicators Research, DOI 10.1007/s11205-015-0998-2 MPI Given the matrix Y=y_{ij} with n rows (statistical units) and m columns (individual indicators), we calculate the normalized matrix Z=z_{ij} as follows: : z_{ij}=100\\\\pm[(y_{ij}-M_{y_j})S_{y_j}^{-1}]10 where M_{y_j} and S_{y_j} are, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of the indicator j and the sign \\\\pm is the 'polarity' of the indicator j, i.e., the sign of the relation between the indicator j and the phenomenon to be measured (+ if the individual indicator represents a dimension considered positive and - if it represents a dimension considered negative). Denoting with M_{z_j},S_{z_j},cv_{z_j}, respectively, the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of the normalized values for unit i, the composite index is given by : \\\\mathrm{MPI}_i^\\\\pm =M_{z_i} (1\\\\pm cv_{z_i}^2)=M_{z_i}\\\\pm S_{z_i} cv_{z_i} where the sign \\\\pm depends on the kind of phenomenon to be measured. If the composite index is 'increasing' or 'positive', i.e., increasing values of the index correspond to positive variations of the phenomenon (e.g., socio- economic development), then \\\\mathrm{MPI}^{-} is used. On the contrary, if the composite index is 'decreasing' or 'negative', i.e., increasing values of the index correspond to negative variations of the phenomenon (e.g., poverty), then \\\\mathrm{MPI}^{+} is used. In any cases, an unbalance among indicators will have a negative effect on the value of the index. AMPI Given the matrix Y=y_{ij}, we calculate the matrix R=\\\\\\\\{r_{ij}\\\\\\\\} as follows: : r_{ij}= \\\\left[\\\\left(y_{ij}-\\\\min_i y_i\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\max_i y_i - \\\\min_i y_i \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\right] 60+70 where \\\\min_i y_i and \\\\max_i y_i are the 'goalposts' for the indicator j, i.e., a minimum and a maximum value that represent the possible range of the indicator j for all time periods considered. If the indicator j has negative 'polarity', the complement of (1) with respect to 200 is calculated. To facilitate the interpretation of results, the 'goalposts' can be chosen so that 100 represents a reference value (e.g., the average in a given year). Let \\\\inf_j y_j and \\\\sup_j y_j be the minimum and maximum of indicator j across all time periods considered, and \\\\operatorname{Ref}_{y_j} be the reference value for indicator j. Then the 'goalposts' are defined as: {\\\\operatorname{Ref}_{y_j}}\\\\pm \\\\Delta, where \\\\Delta=(\\\\sup_j y_j-\\\\inf_j y_j) 2^{-1} Denoting with M_{r_i},S_{r_i},cv_{r_i}, respectively, the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of the normalized values for unit i, the composite index is given by : \\\\mathrm{AMPI}_i^\\\\pm = M_{r_i} (1\\\\pm cv_{r_i}^2)=M_{r_i}\\\\pm S_{r_i} cv_{r_i} where the sign \\\\pm depends on the kind of phenomenon to be measured. Applications The methodology is usually applied to the calculation of both composite indices of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù multidimensional phenomena (the higher the value the better the performance), such as well-being (Istat, 2015Istat (2015).

It usually has smooth bark, mostly only juvenile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of three, whitish flowers and cylindrical to barrel-shaped fruit that is four-sided in cross-section. Description Eucalyptus gamophylla is mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber but sometimes has an almost prostrate habit. It usually has smooth white, cream-coloured or brown bark that is shed in short ribbons but there is sometimes a stocking of rough, hard, stringy-fibrous bark at the base. Most of its leaves are juvenile, sessile, arranged in opposite pairs sometimes with their bases joined, glaucous, egg-shaped to heart-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves, when present, are more or less in opposite pairs, the same dull, greyish green on both sides, sessile, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in most months, depending on habitat and in some places follows rain. The flowers are whitish and the fruit is a woody conical, cylindrical, bell-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule four- sided in cross-section, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gamophylla was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1878 in his book Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The type specimen was collected by John Forrest from Mount Pyrten in the Hamersley Range and cited as In monte Pyrten tractus Hammersley-Range, altitudine 2,500' supra mare. According to Francis Aubi Sharr, the specific epithet (gamophylla) is derived from the ancient Greek gamos meaning \\"marriage\\" and -phyllus meaning \\"-leaved\\", referring to the bases of the opposite leaves being joined. A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon of Liddell, Scott and Jones give gamos (Œ≥Œ¨ŒºŒøœÇ) as the ancient Greek word for \\"wedding\\", \\"marriage\\" or \\"wedlock\\". and phyllon (œÜœçŒªŒªŒøŒΩ) as \\"leaf\\". Range Warilu is found on sandplains and sand dunes and in stony spinifex country. It has a range extending from the Mid West, Pilbara and Goldfields-Esperance regions of central Western Australia, then extending east into central and southern areas of the Northern Territory and the far north of South Australia. Species commonly associated with E. gamophylla include Triodia basedowii, Acacia ligulata, Acacia georginae, Eremophila longifolia and Eragrostis eriopoda. Cultivation Eucalyptus gamophylla is drought tolerant and hardy in the cold, able to tolerate temperatures as low as and is frost tolerant. When cultivated for the garden, it is bird attracting, fast growing, requires very little maintenance and can provide plenty of aromatic cut foliage for flower arrangements.

Background In February, the tennis match was decided by Malm√∂'s red- green city coalition to be closed to the public, a decision that was heavily criticised by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The Mayor of Malm√∂, Ilmar Reepalu, personally said he thought the game should not be played at all, and the decision was thus considered to be more politically motivated than to do with security concerns. Riots In anticipation of protests, around 1,000 police officers sanctioned off a large area around the Baltic Hall tennis stadium to keep protesters and rioters away. A reported 170 truck loads of pavement stones were transported out of the area before the protests, and three schools were closed. In addition, for the first time in history, riot vehicles were brought in from Denmark. The match was initially met with protest of around 6,000 to 7,000 anti-Israel demonstrators, with speeches held by the leader of the Left Party, Lars Ohly, who while wearing a Palestinian scarf was seen holding a map of Palestine with Israel eradicated. The demonstrators were joined by several hundred militants of which around 200 to 300 began attacking police with stones, fireworks and paint bombs. The anti- Israel rioters included AFA anti-fascists, militant Islamists, organised neo- Nazis, as well as activists from neighbouring countries. Police eventually detained around 100 rioters, arresting ten. An additional eighteen rioters were later identified and put on trial for their part in the riots, with several convictions. Aftermath The decision to close the tennis match to the public resulted in Malm√∂ being banned from hosting tennis matches by the ITF for five years. In addition to having to provide $15,000 in minimum gate receipts for the match, the Swedish Tennis Association was fined an additional $25,000. The Swedish Tennis Association responded by issuing penalties to Malm√∂ mayor Ilmar Reepalu for his involvement in the event. The protest and riots led to accusations of antisemitism in Sweden. Swedish history professor Kristian Gerner described the situation as \\"the worst crisis for Jews in Sweden since the Second World War.\\" A 2012 European Men's Handball Championship qualifier between Sweden and Israel set to be played in Karlskrona in June 2011 raised concerns due to the riots, and was considered for moving to another location by Swedish sports authorities. The match was played as scheduled, with a minor anti-Israel demonstration being held.

It has smooth grey to salmon-pink bark that is shed in short flakes. The adult leaves are lance- shaped, the same dull grey-green or yellow-green colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are born in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are long spindle-shaped, long and wide with a horn-shaped operculum that is three to four times a long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs from February to September or December and the flowers are creamy yellow or pale lemon-coloured. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gardneri was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1924 in his book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The species is named in honour of Charles Austin Gardner who collected the type specimen in 1922 from near Bendering along the railway line that runs between Narrogin and Narembeen. Noongar people know the species as woacal. In 1991, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *Eucalyptus gardneri Maiden subsp. gardneri; *Eucalyptus gardneri subsp. ravensthorpensis Brooker & Hopper has more robust, spindle-shaped flower buds than subspecies gardneri, and an operculum less than long. Distribution and habitat Blue mallet is found on breakaways, rocky ridges and slopes in the southern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia where it grows in gravelly lateritic soils. Eucalyptus gardneri commonly occurs with E. argyphea E. phaenophylla in woodland communities making up the overstorey. Associated species in the understorey include Melaleuca uncinata, Hakea multilineata, Phebalium tuberculosum, Allocasuarina acutivalvis, Beyeria brevifolia and Trymalium elachophyllum. Conservation status Both subspecies of E. gardneri are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

It has smooth bark, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, glaucous flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and conical to cup-shaped fruit.fresh barkflower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus georgei is a tree or mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale grey and coppery-orange coloured bark that detaches in long ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glaucous, egg-shaped to broadly lance- shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are either glossy green or glaucous, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a thick, glaucous, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels about long. Mature buds are glaucous, oval to pear-shaped, about long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between February and March and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, usually glaucous, conical to cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. The seeds are glossy red-brown, flattened oval and long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus georgei was first formally described in 1978 by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell from a specimen collected by Blaxell in 1975, east of Hyden on the track to Norseman. In 1993 Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus georgei subsp. fulgida Brooker & Hopper differs from subspecies georgei in having shiny green, non-glaucous leaves and smaller, shorter fruits; * Eucalyptus georgei Brooker & Blaxell subsp. georgei. The specific epithet honours the botanist Alex George for his assistance to both the authors. The epithet fulgida is from the Latin fulgidus meaning \\"shining\\". Distribution The Hyden blue gum is found in a small area where the Wheatbelt region meets the Goldfields- Esperance region between Hyden to east of Kalgoorlie. It grows on lateritic rises and in depressions in calcareous loam, clayey sand or sandy soils.

Media freedom, including freedom of the press, is the principal platform for ensuring freedom of expression and freedom of information, referring to the right to express value judgments and the right of allegation of facts, respectively. While the term media freedom refers to the absence of state monopoly or excessive state intrusion, Media pluralism is understood in terms of lack of private control over media, meaning the avoidance of concentrated private media ownership. The annual World Press Freedom Day is celebrated on 3 May. Press freedom and democracy Media Freedom is inherent to the decision making process in a well-functioning democracy, enabling citizens to make their political choices based on independent and pluralistic information and thus is an important instrument to form public opinion. The expression of a variety of opinions is needed in public debate to give the citizens the possibility to assess and choose among a wide range of opinions. The more pluralistic and articulated the opinions, the greater is the legitimising effect that media has on the wider democratic political process. Press freedom is often described as a watchdog over public power, underlining its significant role as an observer and informer of the public opinion on government actions. Freedom of expression refers back to individual journalists', as well as to press institutions' rights. In other words, its significance covers both the individual right of each journalist to express his or her opinion and the press' right as an institution to inform people. To guarantee the protection of free media, state authorities not only underlie the negative obligation to abstain from intrusion, but as well to the positive commitment to promote media freedom and act as a guarantor against intrusion of public as well as private actors.  Legislative framework and law enforcement  =International law provisions and enforcement= Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognise freedom of expression and freedom of information as fundamental Human rights. Even though these documents are recognised universally, their enforcement depends widely on the state's will on adapting measures of implementation. On the European level, the Council of Europe provides a legal framework through the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), whose enforcement is assured through the European Court of Human Rights' (ECtHR) jurisdiction. ECHR Article 10 on Freedom of expression says: > \\"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall > include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and > ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. > This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of > broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. > 2.The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and > responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, > restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a > democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial > integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the > protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or > rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in > confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the > judiciary.\\" As observable in the citation, within the ECHR freedom of expression is not recognised as an absolute right, meaning it can be restricted if there are other competing fundamental rights or legitimate objectives necessary for democratic society. These might be data protection, the right to privacy, reputation or criminal justice. However, the restriction needs to be proportional to the achievement of the competing objective and press freedom and needs \\"very high requirements before any restrictions can be imposed on the freedom of the press by the public authorities.\\" Even if Press freedom takes the function of a democracy guarantor, it does not only protect materials dealing with political issues, but is applied as well to tabloid journalism. However, the more significant a specific journalistic item is to form public opinion, the higher priority needs to be given to press freedom when it is weighed up against other legitimate interests. The ruling of the ECtHR looks back at a long history of jurisprudence regarding violations of article 10, starting in the late 1970s. In particular, ECtHR protects investigative journalism, journalistic sources of information and whistle- blowers and stresses the negative effect of sanctions against journalistic activities, as leading to auto-censorship and so hindering the purpose of journalism to inform people. On the other hand, the court has strengthened the protection of the right to privacy against reporting whose only purpose is to nourish people's curiosity. =European Union legislation and law enforcement= In the European Union, member states have committed to respect the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (The rights under Article 11 of the EU Charter correspond to those given by the ECHR under article 10), which entered into force with the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 as Article 6(1) TEU. However, long before the entry into force of the treaty, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) recognised EU fundamental rights as general principles of EU law and considered them part of the legal framework on which it bases its jurisprudence. In practice, the impact of fundamental EU laws and values on EU member states' behaviour is often limited. While indicating freedom of expression as a \\"key indicator of a country's readiness to become part of the EU\\", once a country has entered the Union, the EU institutions have a limited possibility to enforce the respect of fundamental rights and values, including those on freedom of expression and information. This phenomenon is also known as the Copenhagen Dilemma, an issue addressed, among others, by the European Parliament resolution entitled EU Charter: standard settings for media freedom across the EU , adapted in May 2013. The document stresses the importance of monitoring and supervising the development of national legislations regarding media freedom in the EU member states and proposes to attribute this task to the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA). Regarding television services specifically, the 2010 Audiovisual Media Services Directive establishes that hate speech and speech harming minors must be prohibited in all member states. What is more, the 2018 Audiovisual Media Services Directive is set to instate the following position on media freedom: \\"In order to strengthen freedom of expression, and, by extension, to promote media pluralism and avoid conflicts of interest, it is important for Member States to ensure that users have easy and direct access at any time to information about media service providers. It is for each Member State to decide, in particular with respect to the information which may be provided on ownership structure and beneficial owners.\\" This text was adopted by the European Parliament on 2 October 2018.  Monitoring media freedom in the EU  There is a wide range of international governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that advocate for media freedom within the EU and the EU Candidate, Potential Candidate, as well as Eastern Partnership countries. The organisations' work includes theoretical activities such as producing reports on the state of media freedom in different countries, as well as giving practical help, such as financial or legal support, to people active in journalism. = Governmental Organizations = * Council of Europe.

He is currently the head coach of the SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers in the National League (NL).  Playing career  Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Tomlinson played for the Prince Albert Raiders, the Roanoke Valley Rebels and the Raleigh Icecaps, before taking his game to Germany in 1992. After almost five years with EC Timmendorfer Strand, he had a short stint with the Berlin Capitals of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga during the 1996-97 season and then would spend the following three years in England, playing for Manchester Storm. In 2000, Tomlinson came back to the German capital city, signing with Eisb√§ren Berlin, where he would stay for the remainder of his playing tenure. After suffering a torn ACL in November 2002, he tried to come back to the game, but decided to end his playing career in 2004.  Coaching career  Tomlinson started his career behind the bench at the Eisb√§ren Berlin organization, serving as head coach of the club‚Äôs youth team, Eisb√§ren Berlin Juniors, between 2004 and 2007.

Following the collapse of a tailings dam, up to one billion liters () of wastewater flooded into the nearby Athabasca River ‚Äì what may be the largest coal slurry spill in Canadian history. The river's waters experienced immediate spikes in arsenic, metals, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Although the Athabasca was deemed safe for drinking and wildlife by the end of the year, the extent of the environment's recovery remains in doubt.  Spill  Located about east of Hinton, the Obed Mountain Mine was a thermal coal mine with the capacity to produce about 3.2 million tonnes () of coal per year; 2.6 million tonnes () are proven to exist, and up to 84.7 million more tonnes () were posited. Tailings ponds were constructed to contain water used to wash coal; besides wastewater, the pools also contained fine rock and clay particles, unrecovered coal, and flocculents. Operations were suspended in 2012 because of economic pressures, and around of the mine has been reclaimed. On October31, 2013, one of the mine's tailings dams failed, and from between 600 million to a billion liters () of slurry poured into the Plante and Apetowun Creeks. The plume of waste products then joined the Athabasca River, travelling downstream for a month before settling in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan, over away.  Environmental impact  In the first month after the spill, water quality tests revealed the presence of metals and chemicals such as cadmium, arsenic, manganese, lead, mercury, and PAHs in excess of limits for consumption or life along the first of the Athabasca River. Mercury, for instance, was found to be nine times higher than normal, while PAHs were at levels four times higher than the Canadian standard for potable water. As a result, residents were discouraged from both drinking any of the Athabasca as well as watering any livestock or pets. By December 2013, as the plume reached Fort McMurray, government officials reported that water from the Athabasca was once again below safety thresholds for both wildlife and drinking water. Monitoring has continued in the years since, although First Nations representatives have continued to dispute the rigor of the sampling program, its exclusion of data from sediment, and the lack of information made available to the public.  Aftermath  In October 2015, the Alberta Energy Regulator corporation filed charges against the mine's operators, Sheritt Coal and Coal Valley Resources Inc., on several counts of violations of the Environmental Protection and Enhancement, Water, and Public Lands Acts which could amount to up to a $2.2 million fine. Proceedings began on January20, 2016.

It was founded with the declared aim of creating a novel political centre based on the principles of classical liberalism and libertarianism. Girchi promotes itself as being open to youth willing to participate in politics. The party was established in November 2015, after four lawmakers (Zurab Japaridze, Pavle Kublashvili, Goga Khachidze, and Giorgi Meladze) quit the United National Movement, the former ruling and then parliamentary minority party. The party is chaired by Iago Khvichia. The name Girchi translates to pine cone and is a symbol of freshness and greenery that is also associated with the third-eye and the enlightenment. Girchi is the first Georgian online party that rejected a standard party structure and methods of political struggle by selecting Facebook as the main hub of its activities and as a platform of communication. From August to September 2016, Girchi was briefly a part of Paata Burchuladze's State for the People election bloc which they quit just eleven days before the upcoming parliamentary election, citing \\"serious problems in terms of management\\".  Ideology  Girchi advocates small, transparent/open and accountable government and deregulation of the economy. The party's ideology regards personal liberty and freedom from Government interference as the highest ultimate values and believes these as being the main prerequisites for welfare and prosperity. The party has been vocal regarding the ideals underpinning their work. Girchi defends by various means at their expense any non-violent activity since they believe that violence is the sole moral determinant of righteous and unrighteous behaviour, hence, only existence of violence entitles governments to interfere.  Girchi Portal  Girchi Portal is an online platform introduced by Girchi on 22 August 2019. It serves as a means for politicians and activists to present themselves and their views to the public which in turn through an internal voting system and the use of the party's digital currency (the GeD) will inform Girchi's party lists for elections and whom occupy certain seats of Georgia's representative bodies. Girchi has refused a standard party structure by initially selecting Facebook as a main platform of communication, later launching a website. The portal functions as a medium between the supporters and politicians whereby the former are able to accumulate the said digital currency, the GeD, and distribute them among the candidates (that is everyone who shows the desire to represent the party). This forms a hierarchy between the politicians that ultimately will determine their positions on the party lists. The platform allows for the reallocation of GeDs in the event that a supporters shifts their favour of one candidate to another. The public can earn GeDs through direct financial donations to the party or individual politicians/projects and actions that Girchi considers to be contributing towards the promotion and proliferation of the ideals of individual freedom and non-interference from the Government in non-violent consensual societal relationships. The greater the number of GeDs accumulated by a platform member, the greater his/her voting power in the political decision-making process. According to the party, the ultimate and most important purpose of the GeD is to function as a private currency in the futur in case Girchi assumes legislative power and returns assets worth trillions of US dollars to the Georgian population.  2018 presidential election  According to Georgian legislation, a party must have been registered in the previous parliamentary elections to present a presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. For the 2018 presidential elections Zurab Girchi Japaridze requested permission from the Ministry of Justice of Georgia to add ‚ÄòGirchi‚Äô to his name before registering. With this gesture Zurab Girchi Japaridze wanted to recognise the work of Girchi's staff and supporters by mentioning Girchi in ballot papers. While Zurab Girchi Japaridze's request was being processed, the Central Election Commission issued an order according to which Girchi and all the other parties which were not registered for the previous Parliamentary elections were allowed to present a candidate. The Georgian legislation envisages an interview before a person's name is officially changed. Since, the said interview was never scheduled, Zurab Girchi Japaridze did not withdraw his application. However, the Ministry of Justice, without informing the applicant, changed his name to Zurab Girchi Japaridze. Since the Georgian legislation only allows Georgian citizens to change their names once, Zurab Girchi Japaridze will remain Zurab Girchi Japaridze if essential changes to the legislation are not made in the future. The presidential election was the first election Girchi took part in. 36,000 people voted for Girchi's candidate equalling 2.26% of the total number of votes.  2019 mid-term parliamentary election  Due to the fact that Salome Zurabishvili was elected Georgia's fifth president in the 2018 presidential election, the mid-term parliamentary elections were scheduled for 19 May 2019. Girchi presented Hermann Sabo as a candidate. Girchi intended to demonstrate the flaws of the Georgian majoritarian electoral system and publicly called upon Girchi supporters to change their addresses of registration to Mtatsminda district in order to be able to vote in the elections. This is the mechanism that every government in Georgia has resorted to in secrecy. Up to 1,000 applications had been registered with the Ministry of Justice. The Georgian legislation does not envisage any conditions to be met in order for a person to change his/her address of registration. However, the Ministry of Justice of Georgia granted requests to only around 60 applicants, thus, breaching a constitutional right of every individual to freely choose their residence. Hermann Sabo got 4.8% of the total number of votes. 2020 Georgian Parliamentary elections Girchi said, if elected in 2020, it would award Tesla cars to voters who turn out in the 2020 election via state funding given to parties which enter the parliament .https://jam- news.net/come-out-to-the-polls-and-win-a-tesla-one-georgian-opposition-partys- initiative/  Activism  Girchi has run a number of initiatives and protest actions which include the founding of a religion and a live TV station (Girchi TV), the creation of a digital currency (the Georgian Dollar) and the planting of cannabis seeds on the party's premises. = Planting of cannabis on government premises = In the beginning of November 2016, Girchi put forward an ultimatum to the Georgian authorities threatening to plant, along with of- age supporters, cannabis seeds on Girchi party premises if the Government refused to change the existing drug policy, including the legalisation of cannabis and cannabis related products. On December 31, Girchi and volunteer supporters (totalling 84 individuals) publicly planted cannabis seeds. The process was aired live by the Georgian TV networks and live-streamed on Facebook by Girchi and social media channels. Although the planting/cultivation of cannabis is punishable under the current Criminal Code of Georgia and stipulates a maximum penalty of 12-years imprisonment the Government made the decision not to charge the participants of this act of civil disobedience. An investigation on the matter was conducted and the police confiscated 84 plant pots containing cannabis seeds for laboratory tests. Citing a low level of THC in the plants, the police closed the investigation. One of the leaders of the party, Zurab Girchi Japaridze, was presented with administrative charges and fined as an organiser. = Legal efforts to legalise cannabis possession and consumption = Planting of Cannabis seeds at the Girchi Party HQ On November 30, 2017, the Constitutional Court of Georgia decriminalised the personal consumption of cannabis and other cannabis-based products. The decision came in a case brought by a citizen, Givi Shanidze, who wished to have his criminal record for repeated cannabis use erased. The plaintiff was represented by the Chairman of Girchi, Iago Khvichia. While affirming the right to consume cannabis, the Court's decision stated its potential health risks and did not legalise the sale, distribution, or production of cannabis. With the Court's decision, criminal charges for cannabis use were deemed to be in violation of Article 16 of the previous redaction of the Constitution of Georgia (Article 12 of the 2017 Constitution) which enshrines every individual's right to free development of their personality. However, the decision only applied to criminal penalties and did not end the possibility of a fine or other administrative sanctions for consumption of cannabis. On July 30, 2018, the Constitutional Court of Georgia released the second decision on the matter of cannabis consumption which was prompted by a lawsuit filed by the leaders of the Girchi party, Vakhtang Megrelishvili and Zurab Girchi Japaridze, effectively abolishing administrative punishment for the use of the drug. According to the applicants: > The consumption of cannabis is not an act that threatens society. In > particular, it can only harm the users' health, making that user him/herself > responsible for the outcome. The responsibility for such actions does not > cause dangerous consequences for the public. The Constitutional Court of Georgia noted that giving legal permission to consume cannabis protects an individual's right to free development of his/her personality, and while prohibition of the consumption of cannabis is an action directed against its turnover and therefore serves the aim of consumer protection of health, according to the Court, the role of an individual user in the support of cannabis circulation is very small, and consequently the threats from individual consumption are likewise small. Due to the above- mentioned, the court ruled the punishment for consumption of cannabis to be disproportionate. The court took into account certain exceptions in cases when the use of cannabis might create threats to third parties and stated: > In addition, the Constitutional Court highlights the imposition of > responsibility of cannabis consumption when it creates a threat to third > parties. For instance, the Court will justify responsibility when cannabis > is consumed in educational institutions, public places, such as on public > transport, and in the presence of children. Georgia is the first former soviet country where the consumption of cannabis is legal, hence, does not entail any criminal or administrative penalties. = Christian Evangelical Protestant Biblical Freedom Church of Georgia = Levan Jgerenaia, the archbishop of Biblical Freedom In March 2017, the Public Registry of the Ministry of Justice of Georgia officially registered Girchi's church, the Christian Evangelical Protestant Biblical Freedom Church of Georgia. Georgian legislation provides special privileges and exemptions for the clergy and students at theological schools, including the deferment of compulsory military service. Biblical Freedom used the provision, the so- called legislative loophole, for the benefit of young men and issues state- recognised documents to those who do not wish to join the army, certifying that they are priests. It serves to effectively exempt them from mandatory military service, so that they can lead their lives according to their own free will, values and opinions. The consecration process takes ten minutes. Girchi fights for individual liberty and considers the mandatory one-year term of military service for youngsters to be a manifestation of state violence against its citizens and constitutes a contemporary form of slavery. Girchi established Biblical Freedom for the sole purpose of helping young men to avoid military service and, to date, has helped approximately 25 000 men from having to either undertake the term or having to pay 2 000 GEL for postponing it for one year. Girchi believes that this is an immoral legal mechanism, extorting money from the citizenry for the benefit of the state. People of various backgrounds have approached Biblical Freedom for help. Congregants of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Muslims, Protestants, Catholics and even atheists are among them. According to Girchi whether a human being is trained in combat or undergoes any other type of non-military service is not of principal importance. For the party members any form of labour or service is unacceptable if it occurs through use of force by the State. This sentiment underpinned a concerted protest action directed against the draft law proposed by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Irakli Sesiashvili on 13 March 2019 within the framework of which he asked the Parliament to abolish the law allowing priests of any religious denomination to postpone their compulsory term of military service. The amendment would not affect priests of the Georgian Orthodox Church, due to a Constitutional Agreement between the Church and the Georgian state, creating an alternate legal regime. It was obviously directed against Biblical Freedom. According to the bill introduced by Irakli Sesiashvili, young men who refuse to complete Mandatory Military Service on the basis of their religious beliefs, personal endeavours or conscience will have to undertake a term of non-military service. Logo for Girchi's Shmaxi initiative, established to in opposition to legislation passed on Taxis in Georgia The initiative was proposed despite the fact that the Constitutional Court of Georgia has already noted in its decision that: > The recognition of the special role of the Church (the Georgian Christian > Orthodox Church) is related to its historical merits and does not serve as > means for creating privileged legal conditions for the Orthodox Christianity > in the future. The historical merits shall not be considered as a legitimate > source of privilege. The differentiation and creation of privileged legal > conditions are not and shall not be the objective of the Constitution. The said initiative was supported by the most influential religious institution in Georgia, the patriarchate of Georgia. The statement was made on the official website of the Georgian Orthodox Church that referred to Biblical Freedom as constituting a pseudo-religion that is engaged in anti-state actions: > Exemption from the compulsory military service is a commonly accepted > practice and we support it. A non-military alternative service should also > be guaranteed by the state. However, all the necessary measures must be > taken to prevent pseudo-religious organisations from abusing this practice > for the purposes of implementing their mercantile interests which is a > manipulation of religion and an obvious case of anti-state action. Girchi's and its supporters' public outrage against the bill that included press briefings and public statements turned out successful since the legislative was not registered with the Parliament. The party was conspicuous in its fight against the bill. The members ordered the face of Irakli Sesiashvili to be printed on condoms and a poster of that condom was sent to the National Library of Georgia so that it would be kept for generations in order to let them know who was one of the main villains of freedom in Georgia. The Church has its unique and simple set of rules (seven commandments of Biblical Freedom), fitting into the ideology of classical liberalism that places the individual at the top of the value system: # You have one life and it completely belongs to you. # To live is to be free and to be free is to live. # A deprivation of property is a deprivation of life. # The body is your sacred form of property, it fully belongs to you. # Homicide deprives you of life, theft of your property, slavery of both; these are immoral. # Only the existence of violence entitles governments to interfere; taxation and paternalism are morally the same as robbery and theft, hence a deprivation of life. # Freedom is the product of constant struggle; if someone takes it, one must fight to seize it back. = Shmaxi = On October 1, 2019, new taxi market regulations entered into force in Tbilisi, Georgia. According to the new laws, the holders of a 'category A license' have the legal right to pick- up passengers as long as their cars are white, have 4 doors, a trunk and are left-hand drive vehicles. Additionally, the vehicles must have undergone and passed mandatory technical inspections and have a sign stating ‚ÄòTaxi Tbilisi‚Äô. Girchi, founded a new educational initiative and registered a company ‚ÄòShmaxi‚Äô with the Ministry of Justice of Georgia. Shmaxi employs those who have recently lost their jobs as a result of the new regulations and any interested individuals. To circumvent the law, Shmaxi will hire these former taxi drivers as not drivers but as teachers' called shmaxists. Their role will be to educate their passengers on the ideals of freedom and liberty and will provide for viewing relevant video/audio content, including lectures of Milton Friedman, during the journey. This is the service passengers are going to be charged for. The price will be calculated according to the length of lectures, not the distance covered by a Shmaxi. As of October 2019, Shmaxi employs more than 500 shmaxsists. = 2017 local elections = Girchi became the first political party in Georgia to organise the public collection of signatures in order to register for the 2017 local elections through a special on-line application platform. Political parties functioning in Georgia have been pretending to collect the 25,000 genuine signatures necessary to register for participation in the elections. In reality, they have been copying data from the Central Election Commission/CEC database into the application forms designated by the commission. This documentation is then presented to the CEC, which registers a political party for elections. Girchi rejected this tradition of forging supporters‚Äô signatures and announced that it would participate in the elections only if it collected 25,000 on-line signatures of exclusively genuine supporters. In less than one month, Girchi managed to collect 7,200 signatures, which was not enough to take part in the elections. = Lotto civil disobedience = Since 2009, according to Georgian legislation, conducting lottery activities in Georgia is the sole domain of one company - Georgian National Lottery - lotto.ge. According to Girchi, giving a monopoly to one company is unfair, immoral, economically unjustified and poses questions related to the existence of corruption. To protest this state of affairs, in July 2018 Girchi members carried out an act of civil disobedience on the party's premises and, in breach of existing legislation, played lotto for money. This was accompanied by live coverage. There was no reaction from law-enforcement agencies, which proved once again how absurd the legislation prohibiting citizens to play lotto or organise a lottery is. = Cannabis Legalisation Festival = On 20 October 2018, one week before the presidential election, Girchi and its activists held the Cannabis Legalisation Festival in Tbilisi, protesting the new aim of Parliament to pass a bill restricting the consumption of cannabis. The event was not green-lighted by the authorities, and police prevented organisers from actually holding the festival. Nevertheless, Zurab Girchi Japaridze publicly handed out cannabis joints to certain individuals, hence, committed another act of civil disobedience by breaking Article 273(1) of the Criminal Code of Georgia. Zurab Girchi Japaridze was eventually detained along with several other participants who protested for the legalisation of Cannabis consumption at the festival. Based on Girchi's statements, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia launched an investigation under the 2nd and 8th Paragraphs of Article 273 (1) of the Criminal Code of Georgia on the illegal possession, use and trade of cannabis or cannabis-related products . However, no formal charges were presented and Zurab Girchi Japaridze and the other detainees were released the same day. = Girchi TV = Girchi TV Logo Girchi TV started broadcasting on August 21, 2019. One of the leaders of the party Zurab Girchi Japaridze, explained that they want to reach a segment of the Georgian population that still receives political information from television and not from the Internet. According to the representatives of the party, their new channel will not pay taxes until their debt reaches 24,984,000 GEL since other leading Channels had the debt of somewhat similar amount annulled by the Government of Georgia. According to the party Georgian Broadcasters use two different methods in order to avoid taxes: either working for the Government, in which case they are simply exempt from their obligations, or the opposition, so that when the State attacks the latter the society perceives it as a fight against the freedom of speech. = Girchi Brothel Pioneer = In 2019, just one week before the mid-term parliamentary elections which Girchi participated in, Girchi opened a brothel in its headquarters. With this act of civil disobedience Girchi addressed the arrest of 3 individuals on charges of promoting prostitution and opposed relevant Georgian criminal legislation, that has become a source of arbitrary justice on many occasions in Georgia. As a result of such Government actions people who support themselves and their families through selling sexual services and who have not harmed anyone, are left without any financial means. They additionally suffer public reproach, since the social stigma associated with being a sex service provider is deeply rooted in Georgian society. Girchi believes that, whether to engage in any job/activity that does not involve elements of physical or psychological violence should be subject to the discretion of freely consenting adults. Following this line of reasoning, Girchi believes that prostitution is a fair and acceptable occupation. Girchi states that the only path towards ending this situation and, consequently, protecting people involved in the sex- industry from violence and abuse, coming mainly from the law enforcement agencies, is the legalisation of prostitution. According to Girchi, the full legalisation would also benefit society at large through preventing the spread of AIDS/HIV among other sexually transmitted diseases. With this act of civil disobedience Girchi staff violated paragraph 3 of Article 254 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (Promotion of Prostitution) which states that: > Making available an area or dwelling place for prostitution committed > jointly by more than one person shall be punished by imprisonment for a term > of three to six years. = Purchase of bio-drugs = Throughout years, Girchi has protested against current drug policies. One of the issues that Girchi continuously underlines is that existing prohibitions and punishments prescribed by legislation for drug-related offences are of financial interest for some individuals. While it is very difficult to obtain cannabis which grows wildly in almost all regions of Georgia, it is very easy to purchase other drugs of dubious origin and composition. These reach Georgia from abroad, having had to cross customs borders. To illustrate this state of affairs, on February 24, 2017 Girchi undertook a so-called bio-drug purchase, shooting a video depicting all details of the process. It was completed in under an hour. The documentary was distributed to the public as well as media companies. The drugs obtained were then submitted to the police in accordance with relevant procedures. Through this act, Girchi intended to demonstrate how accessible bio-drugs are in Georgia, including for under-age citizens, and how false were the claims by the Ministry of Internal Affairs that the current repressive regime on narcotics has any positive effect.  Statistics  * More than 147 000 followers on Facebook. * 13 000 members of Closed Girchi Group or supporters on Facebook. * The first political party in the world that started collecting funds in cryptocurrency. * Translated more than 200 educational videos, * With the support of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, translated all ten parts of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose. * Made more than 40 videos on economic and political topics, using the infographics. * Participated in up to 2,000 TV programmes.

It lasted from December 23, 1996, to January 1, 1997, and reached speeds of up to 165 kilometers per hour, or 90 miles per hour. In additions to its winds, the storm caused heavy rains and severe flooding, causing significant damage to property in some areas. Meteorological history The precursor tropical disturbance to Severe Tropical Cyclone Fergus was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on December 19, 1996, while it was located about to the southeast of Bairiki in Kiribati. Over the next day the system moved south-westwards and became better organised, which prompted the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system during December 20. However, this alert was cancelled during the next day as atmospheric convection, associated with the systems low level circulation center significantly decreased. The system subsequently passed over the southern Solomon Islands during the next day, before convection associated with the systems low level circulation center became better organised. As a result of this the system was classified as a tropical low by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) during December 23, while the JTWC issued another tropical cyclone formation alert on the low. During that day, the depression gradually deepened further before the BoM reported, that it had developed into a tropical cyclone and named it Fergus later that day. The JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on Fergus, early the next day and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 13P, while it was located near Rennell Island. After being named, Fergus performed a cyclonic loop in an area of weak steering flow, before it started to move south-eastwards, under the influence of an approaching upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, it crossed 160¬∞E and moved into the South Pacific basin during December 26, shortly before becoming a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The system subsequently continued to move south- eastwards towards a weakness in a subtropical ridge of high pressure, before it passed in between Vanuatu and New Caledonia's Loyalty Islands between December 27‚Äì28. At around this time the Fiji Meteorological Service estimated that the system had peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). The JTWC also estimated during December 27, that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Preparations, impact and aftermath Fergus and its precursor tropical disturbance brought strong winds and heavy rain to the Solomon Islands, which caused serious flooding on the islands of Guadalcanal, Rennell and Bellona. As a result, significant property damage and hundreds of food gardens were destroyed throughout the island nation. Two deaths were also reported, while several regions were declared disaster areas by the Government of the Solomon Islands. The National Disaster Council also launched an appeal for cash and rice, to help ease the food crisis in affected areas. As a result, Taiwan donated and of vegetable seeds for disaster relief, while Australia and New Zealand donated to the relief effort via the Solomon Islands Red Cross. After impacting the Solomon Islands, Fergus moved south-eastwards where it moved in between and parallel to Vanuatu and New Caledonia's Loyalty Islands. As a result, New Caledonia's eastern Loyalty Islands were placed on high alert with people urged to reinforce doors and windows and limit their movements, while the rest of the French territory was placed on a precautionary alert. On Matthew Island, a significant drop in air pressure was recorded, as Fergus moved past, but no wind speeds were recorded at the weather station as the station's anemometer had been broken. Cyclonic winds and torrential rains were subsequently recorded within Vanautu, with food gardens in Aneityum damaged as a result. Ahead of the system impacting New Zealand, MetService issued warnings for gale-force winds and heavy rain in various districts of the North Island. They also warned that Fergus would bring with it around about thirty hours of rain and six to eight hours of damaging winds. As a result, all campers and hikers who were holidaying on the North Island's East Coast were told to pack up and leave the area. Ahead of Fergus impacting New Zealand, the ground was becoming saturated as a shallow trough of low pressure and moist northeast flow, had caused rain to set in from Northland to the Bay of Plenty. Fergus caused extensive damage in New Zealand after making landfall. Play in the qualifying and first rounds of the 1997 ASB Classic tennis tournament to be significantly disrupted, due to torrential rain, poor light and strong wind caused by Fergus.

Starting off as a restaurateur and salt merchant, he then became a kingpin and amassed a fortune in some four years of dealing with opium. He was often referred to as China's \\"King of Opium\\". Zeng was also a philanthropist and donated large sums to charities and schools. He died in July 1964, aged 76, in Chongqing. Zeng's former residence in Shapingba District is now listed as a local monument. Early life and career Zeng was born on 6 September 1888 in Weiyuan County, Sichuan, China; his birth name was Chenxun (). He also had an art name, Zhengran. His grandfather was Zeng Huailun (ÊõæÊÄÄ‰º¶), a coal factory and dye-house owner. Chenxun's father Zeng Bencan (ÊõæÊú¨ÁÅø) took over the business from the eldest Zeng. He began working in salt harvesting at the age of 9, and became a salt merchant around 1905, forging connections with other traders and local authorities. Concurrently, he worked at the Luzhou-based Rong Ji Provisions Store (Ëç£ËÆ∞Á≤ÆÂ∫ó) with his wife and uncle. Owing to local unrest, food prices were high and Zeng profited from the situation. He used these earnings to open a tavern named \\"Big Diner\\" (Â§ßÈ§êÊ•º) in 1914; it was, at that time, the biggest food establishment in Luzhou. In 1928, Zeng partnered with a fellow salt merchant to establish a Hubei-based trading firm named Yu Marketing (Ê∏ùËøêÈîÄÊπñÂåó). At the peak of its operations, their business handled three hundred- odd \\"loads\\" (ËΩΩ) of salt daily, with one load weighing around 93600 catties (approximately 46,000 kilograms); this made them one of the largest salt carriers in the country. For ten years, Zeng served as president of the Chongqing Salt Merchants' Association. His stint in the salt industry ended after three decades. Salt taxes hit a new high and substantially affected earnings. In 1935, during the boom of the opium trade, Zeng decided to pursue the riches involved in drug-dealing. Nonetheless, he was initially apprehensive of the risk involved. He approached a handful of banks for loans, and signed a pact with friends Li Chongjiang (ÊùéËàÇÊ±ü) and Shi Zhuxuan (Áü≥Á´πËΩ©), Zeng was able to pool together 300,000 yuan to start his new business, and then reportedly earned nine times that amount. Fortunately for Zeng, his established dealings with high-ranking officials, including He Guoguang (Ë≥ÄÂúãÂÖâ), Xia Douyin, Xu Yuanquan, and He Chenrui (‰ΩïÊàêÁùø) gave him leeway in operating his opium empire. In fact, the authorities unofficially allied with opium dealers as a means of netting extra revenue and the drug trade was difficult to clamp down on. By-and-by the opium-dealing circle grew in size, largely due to an influx of salt merchants, and Zeng was granted the right to legally ship opium by his friends in the government who also invested in his firms. He was appointed chairman of the \\"Special Business Association\\" whose members included drug dealers and smugglers from all parts of the world. At the height, Zeng was taking in more than a hundred thousand yuan from drugs daily. Zeng would be informed of a tax increase coming his way, and he would then promptly arrange for a meetup with members of the Sichuan treasury, to present them with gifts and a promissory note. His wealth enabled him to purchase various plots of farmland in China. In addition to owning a mega tobacco company, Shu Yi (ËúÄÁõäÁÉüËçâÂÖ¨Âè∏), he was sole proprietor of Victory Bank (ËÉúÂà©Èì∂Ë°å) and had shares in Sichuan Meifeng Chemical, Sichuan Salt, and \\"eleven other banks\\". Zeng's disciple was Jiangjin-raised Wang Zhengping (ÁéãÊîøÂπ≥), who went on to found his own cartel. Retirement and death Following a nationwide crackdown on drugs and growing competition, Zeng retired from the trade in 1939 with substantial savings. He published an account of his time in the realm of opium, titled Five Years In The \\"Special Business\\" (ÁªèËê•Áâπ‰∏ö‰∫îÂπ¥Á∫™Áï•). In the later half of his life, he donated to a range of organisations, including a primary school in Sichuan. During a famine in Sichuan in 1943, Zeng personally fed victims whom he observed looting a grocery store at the Shangqishi Market. Zeng was a supporter of the Chiang Kai-shek-led Kuomintang and expressed dismay at its defeat in the civil war against Mao Zedong in 1949. He reportedly said, \\"All the success I have attained in my life has been a fa√ßade; alas, I fall together with the Kuomintang government. I have overcome all challenges, bar this.\\" Zeng Junchen died on 6 July 1964 in Chongqing, China, at age 76. His former residence in Shapingba, Chongqing, a two-story building with a garden, was gazetted as a monument by the local government in May 2006. Zeng's estimated earnings of five to six million yuan trading opium made him one of, if not the, most successful drug barons of China during his period. Li Xiaoxiong writes in Poppies and Politics in China that Zeng was the \\"most famous opium merchant (who) made a huge amount of money at the peak of the opium mania.\\" Zeng is frequently referred to as the \\"King of Opium.\\" His contemporaries regarded him as the \\"opium king of East Sichuan\\"; an Italian drug dealer, a Jenkins, lauded Zeng for transforming Sichuan into the \\"drug capital of the world\\", whereas an unnamed Chongqing official remarked that Zeng was responsible for the livelihoods of \\"so many\\".

Description On the right hand side, straight after the entrance to the sanctuary of Delphi, one sees the base of the bull that the Corcyraeans dedicated at about 480 B.C., in order to commemorate an exceptionally good catch of tuna fish. The statue was made by the sculptor Theopropus from Aegina. According to Pausanias,Pausanias,10.9.3 a bull in Corfu every day abandoned the flock and went down to the seashore, moaning. The herdsman watched him and followed him, thus noticing that the sea was full of fish. He averted his fellow citizens and they rushed to the seashore, but they couldn't get hold of the fish. Then, they sent an envoy to the Delphic oracle and, following its advise, they sacrificed a bull to Poseidon and then caught the fish. With the tithe of the revenues they acquired by selling the fish, the Corcyreans erected the bronze bull.

He is composing music for German television series, documentaries or film. Besides several solo albums, including his 1978 masterpiece ‚ÄöMickie D‚Äôs Unicorn, he has worked with different bands, musicians and producers like Agitation Free, Ash Ra Tempel, Klaus Schulze, Michael Hoenig, Michael Shrieve, Wolfgang Loos (Alphaville) or Conny Plank. Early years He started out as singer/ songwriter in the late 1960s, was an early founding member of Agitation Free and toured with the German cast of the musical HAIR in 1970/ 71. In 1972 Ash Ra Tempel asked him to join them as singer for their recording of the psychedelic album Seven Up, that took place in collaboration with Timothy Leary in the Sinus Studio in Bern, Switzerland. 1973 he was founding member of the Berlin band Metropolis with whom he played and toured for the next three years. After recording the album Metropolis and releasing the single \\"Super Plastic Club\\", the band produced a multi-media show based on Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man, before they split in 1976. While still with Metropolis he was asked to write the music score for ‚Äì and perform in ‚Äì the theater play Die H√§lfte des Himmels und wir (La Moiti√© du ciel et nous) by French author and director Armand Gatti, which was played in 1975 at the Berlin Forum Theater. In 1977 he founded Albatros Concerts and for a short time promoted bands like Patty Smith, Bob Marley, Blondie or early Dire Straits before he again concentrated on his career as composer and musician. Michael Hoenig asked to help him with a sequence that was meant to be a part of his first solo album ‚ÄúDeparture from the Northern Wasteland‚Äú. So Duwe composed and played harmonies and the melody that then became the instrumental \\"Sun & Moon‚Äú. When Klaus Schulze founded his IC-Label in 1978, Michael Duwe was the first artist signed. Together they produced his first solo work, Mickie D‚Äôs Unicorn, an album full of dragons, witches, fairies and elves, which set a milestone in the fusion of pop and synthesizer music at the time, and with guest musicians ranging from Manuel G√∂ttsching (Ash Ra Tempel) to Michael Shrieve (Santana). Over the following years he produced five more solo albums, but none as successful as his first one. Later years In the mid-'80s he founded his own production company Einhorn media & entertainment GmbH, and later, in close cooperation with Edel Records, the label Navigator. For the Berlin Akademie der K√ºnste he helped to develop and manage two labels for contemporary music, ‚ÄúThe Listening Room‚Äú and ‚ÄúAcademy‚Äú, wrote and produced the musical show X-94 and planned and directed, together with Christian Kneisel, the festival for young art & culture - ‚ÄúZ 2000‚Äú. In 2002 Edel Records released the CD and the book \\"Erotic Fairytales‚Äú, written and performed by Mickie D and guests (like George Kranz). This production was based on authentic traditional erotic fairytales from all over the world, collected, edited and retold by Mickie D, and finally transformed into a musical that hit the stage the same year. Since the mid 1990s he writes and produces soundtracks for German TV-documentaries, docu-dramas such as Sphinx - Geheimnisse der Geschichte (also known as ZDF Expedition), Terra-X and movies such as Polizeiruf 110, often in collaboration with his long-time partner Torsten Sense. He also composes music for meditation (Brenda Davies - Welcome Prosperity), plays the Ukulele with the Berlin Ukulele Orchestra and still is an occasional guest musician.

Specifications  The Tapiro is powered by a longitudinally mounted air-cooled 2.4 liter flat- six engine producing at 7,800 rpm, and connected to a 5-speed manual transmission. This engine could propel the Tapiro to an official top speed of 152 mph (245 km/h).  History  The Porsche Tapiro was introduced to the world at the 1970 Turin Auto Show, in Turin, Italy. The car subsequently made its US debut at the 5th Annual Los Angeles Imported Automobile and Sports Car Show in 1971. In 1972, the car was sold to a Spanish industrialist who used it as his daily driver. The car was mostly destroyed after it caught fire. Most sources say the cause of the fire was a group of labor activists protesting its owner's labor policies, who planted a bomb under the Tapiro. The bomb exploded, burning the car but not destroying the chassis. Other sources say the car was involved in an accident and caught fire that way.

Description As the visitor moves along the Sacred Way, having on the left hand side the eastern side of the Polygonal wall, one sees the remains of a row of famous monuments. The first one, according to Pausanias,Pausanias 10.10.6-8 was the base where stood the ex votos of the Tarentines: it consisted of the bronze statues of a dolphin, of the Lacaedemonian hero Phalanthus and of the eponymous hero Taras, son of Poseidon, as well as of some other figures not mentioned specifically by Pausanias. The latter, however, mentions the foundation myth of Tarentum, according to which an oracle from Delphi had predicted that the Lacaedemonians, on their way to Italy, would found a city when there would be rain in clear weather. Phalanthus, leader of the expedition, was hopeless, as no matter how many efforts he made he could not prevail among the locals and get a piece of land to found his colony. His wife, who was called Aethra (=clear weather) would take him in her arms and cry over his head out of compassion for her husband. Phalanthus, then, realized the meaning of the oracle and attacked Taras right away, in the middle of the night, thus managing to capture the city. The ex voto was made by the famous sculptors Onatas from Aegina and Ageladas from Argos and dates to the beginning of the 5th century B.C. Behind the monument stands a base with a circular plinth, where the citizens of Croton in Southern Italy had erected a tripod, dating possibly also to the same period.Bommelaer, J.-F., Laroche, D.,1991, Guide de Delphes.

Howe (20 July 1849 ‚Äì 4 January 1909) was an architect in Kansas City, Missouri and Boston, Massachusetts. He was a partner with Henry Van Brunt in the prominent firm of Van Brunt and Howe. He later partnered with Henry F. Hoit as Howe, Hoit & Cutler.  Life and work  Frank Maynard Howe was born on July 20, 1849 in West Cambridge, Massachusetts, which later became Arlington. He attended public schools and Cotting Academy. He was part of the first class of a special course in architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). While still in school, Howe went to work for Ware & Van Brunt in 1868. William Ware and Henry Van Brunt started the Boston architectural firm in 1864. In 1881, Ware retired to become the founding chair of the School of Architecture at Columbia University. Howe then partnered with Van Brunt creating the firm of Van Brunt & Howe. Van Brunt & Howe had a national reputation with clients in several areas of the country. Around 1885 to 1887, Van Brunt & Howe opened an office in Kansas City that was originally managed by Howe. Van Brunt later joined Howe in Kansas City. Howe was a member of the board of consulting architects for the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He held a similar position with the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. Van Brunt returned to Massachusetts after retiring where he died in 1903. In 1904, Howe partnered with two employees who were also graduates of the program at MIT, Henry F. Hoit and William H. Cutler. The firm of Howe, Hoit & Cutler became Howe & Hoit upon the death of Cutler in 1907. Two years later, Howe succumbed to heart failure and died on January 4, 1909 at the age of 59. He had been ill since the previous June and traveled with his wife and daughter (Dorothy) to Great Britain, Holland, Germany, and France prior to his death. Howe was married in 1871 to Mary Elizabeth Wyman, of Arlington. They had two daughters, Katherine (Munger) and Dorothy. They designed and built a home in 1887 at 1707 Jefferson Street in Kansas City. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Howe belonged to the Papyrus Club in Boston, the Kansas City Club, the Commercial Club, was president of the Knife and Fork Club, president of the Philharmonic Society, and was a thirty-second degree Mason, and Shriner. Joining the American Institute of Architects in 1899, he was president of the Kansas City chapter in 1901 and 1908. He was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (FAIA) in 1901.

Blocking and censorship Mp3skull claimed to comply with the DMCA and removes infringing content reported by content owners. On 17 April 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the operators of the website. The music companies involved in the suit asked for $520 million in statutory damages and a permanent injunction that prevents domain registrars and registries from working with the site. It has been speculated that the lawsuit was filed as a way for the record labels to backdoor SOPA and use it further as a precedent to take other domains and websites down. Similar lawsuits against Hotfile and IsoHunt ended with both sites being shut down and settlements of $80 million and $110 million respectively. In October 2015, the website was submitted to USTR as a notorious pirate site by RIAA. According to RIAA, Mp3skull is the most highly trafficked MP3 website of its kind in the world as of 2015. As of February 9, 2016, RIAA had requested a total of 1,769,414 URLs on mp3skull.com to be removed from Google's search results. RIAA has mentioned the website specifically in their blog as well as in a public forum by CEO Cary Sherman. The site's domain name was changed from mp3skull.com to mp3skull.to early in 2015, and the site has been operating via different domains ever since. On 24 February 2016 group of prominent RIAA labels have won a default judgment against the site in a lawsuit started on 17 April 2015. Listing 148 music tracks as evidence, the companies asked for the maximum $950,000 in statutory damages for each, bringing the total to more than $190 million. This award was granted by U.S. District Judge Marcia G. Cooke, who additionally issued a permanent injunction preventing the site's operators from engaging in copyright-infringing activity in the future. The site is consequently now offline.

It was, after all, one of the most powerful cities of the archaic and classical period. Description Next to a portico apparently built by the Arcadians along the Sacred Way in the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi the visitor would see a semicircular pedestal, dedicated by the Argives after 369 B.C., in order to stress their contribution in the building of the city of Messene, capital of the liberated Messenians. The so-called pedestal of the Argive kingsPausanias, 10.10.3-4 depicted the mythical founder of the dynasty, Danaos, and some of his descendants. Cyriacus of Ancona, visiting the antiquities of Delphi in 1436, mistook the semicircular base of this ex voto of the Argives for the remains of the temple of Apollo. Three ex votos by the Argives and one by the Athenians stood next to the ex voto of the Lacaedemonians further up the Sacred Way. The first one depicted the Seven heroes who campaigned against Thebes led by the fallen king Polyneikes. The rest of the heroes were Adrastus, Amphiaraus, Kapaneus, Tydeus, Eteoclus, Alitherses and Hippomedon. Nothing is unfortunately preserved from that ex voto. Pausanias mentions that a simulation of the Trojan HorsePausanias, 10.10.1 was also dedicated by the Argives, of which only the rectangular base is preserved; finally an impressive semi-circular pedestal where the statues of the descendants of the Seven Heroes stood.

He did not die in battle, but of a heart attack in Lincolnshire, but nevertheless officially became the first Major and second officer to die during the war. Life He was born in Boston, Lincolnshire on 22 April 1858. Dickinson went to Boston Grammar School, the Alfort Ec√¥le de Veterinaire in Paris and the New Veterinary College in Edinburgh run by Prof William Williams. He took over his father‚Äôs veterinary practice in Boston in 1881, marrying two years later. He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and later served as President of the Lincolnshire Veterinary Medical Society. In 1904 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were D‚ÄôArcy Wentworth Thompson, William Owen Williams (son of Prof William Williams, Dr John MacMillan, and Dr James Hunter. He joined the Lincolnshire Garrison Artillery Volunteers in February 1902, as Veterinary Officer, and was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1905, and then Major in 1913. He belonged to the Territorial Force, the 1st Battery, 1st North Midland Brigade, Royal Field Artillery. When the threat of war increased in July 1914, the government took the precaution of buying horses from farmers across the country to meet the requirements of possible mobilisation. Dickinson‚Äôs combination of military position and veterinary knowledge made him the first choice to oversee this duty in the Boston area. On 6 August, two days after war was declared, and 36 hours into the conflict, he was visiting a Butterwick farm and, having negotiated the sale of some horses, he returned to his car and collapsed dead. He had a history of heart disease, and was killed by arterosclerosis. He was 56. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission‚Äôs definition qualifies this, and all other military deaths regardless of cause, as a ‚Äòwar death‚Äô, entitling Dickinson to an official war grave. He is buried in Boston Cemetery beneath a standard Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone, listing him as a Major in the Royal Field Artillery.

Biography Pirro was the eldest son of Francesco II, third duke of Andria, and Sancia di Chiaramonte, the sister of Isabella of Clermont, the Aragonese king Ferdinand I of Naples's wife. In 1451 he married Maria Donata del Balzo Orsini. After her father died while fighting in the final siege of Constantinople (1453), he received from Maria Donata the fief of Venosa and other cities in the Kingdom of Naples. During the war between John of Anjou and the Aragonese, Pirro, along with his father, sided for the latter. When the Aragonese were routed at Sarno (7 July 1460), Pirro and his father were besieged at Andria by the main Angevine commander, Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini; both were taken prisoners, while Pirro's wife and sons were also captured at Spinazzola. However, the Aragonese obtained a decisive victory at Troia on 18 August 1462; in exchange for his loyalty, king Ferdinand gave him the fief of Ginosa and, after his father's death, named him Grand Constable of the Kingdom of Naples (1481) as well as the title of Prince of Altamura. In 1480 Pirro took part in the defense of Otranto against the Ottoman Turks. In 1485, Pirro decided to change side, and took part in the so-called \\"Conjure of Barons\\" against Ferdinand. When he received the royal order to fight against the invasion of Abruzzo by Giovanni della Rovere, he instead occupied lands for himself at Spinazzola, Genzano and Barletta. However, his conquest were soon lost to Ferrante of Naples and, after his hometown of Venosa had been captured, on 18 December 1486 Pirro was forced to submit to Ferdinand. The plot had not finished, and the following year Pirro was arrested along with numerous other barons and jailed at Castel Nuovo. All his lands were assigned to Frederick of Naples, who had married his daughter Isabella. Pirro died in prison at Naples in 1491.

Rather than refer to themselves as being black Greeks, they prefer African Fraternalists. It was formed under a new conscious belief for men of color as well as African Fraternalism. The group's name partially comes from the Swahili name of Malcolm X. The group had originally used an all Swahili name but was forced to change it because or the college requirements at the school that all fraternities have at least two Greek letters in its name. The fraternity was founded by 15 men of color. Several of the Founders of the fraternity were of Latino ancestry. Ideologically, the fraternity is against the idea of black Greeks. The group is outside of the National Pan Hellenic Council. Chapters have been opened at New York Institute of Technology, Hofstra University, SUNY College At Old Westbury, Stony Brook University, University at Albany, Binghamton University , and Cornell University. Currently there are 7 MALIK Undergraduate Kingdoms (chapters) and 5 Shabazz Graduate Kingdoms (chapters); primarily in the East Coast. Founders Roland K. Hawkins, Larry B. Martin, Darryl L. Mitchell were the inspiration behind the founding of the fraternity and thus known as Khalifas, however the shapers of the brotherhood were: SC. James Banks, SC. Joseph Diaz Jr., SC.

Beck approaches a wide range of subjects in his work, often painting live under distracting and difficult circumstances. He addresses some larger topics through multiple-painting \\"essays\\", in which each image describes a facet of the subject. Beck is also a writer, teacher, curator and lecturer; he writes a monthly column for ICON magazine that parallels his painting, and is the past host of a weekly radio interview show on WDVR-FM. In 2014, he was awarded the Philadelphia Sketch Club Medal for Excellence and Contribution to the Arts.  Background  Beck grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Beck left a career in the business world at the age of 40 to pursue painting, and subsequently attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  Exhibitions  Beck's paintings have been the subject of in-depth museum exhibitions at the James A. Michener Art Museum (Bucks County Painters, 1999) and the City of Trenton Museum at Ellarslie (Love's Notions and Novelties, 2007). His exhibition at the Maine Maritime Museum Robert Beck: Over East, an Artist's Journal] ran from 17 September 2016 to January 22, 2017) and the accompanying catalog features his essays, or 'word paintings' as well as his oil paintings which, according to Amy Lent, the Museum's executive director, have captured the soul of the life there. His paintings have been included in invitational exhibitions at the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley (Second Time Around, 2014) the James A. Michener Museum (Local Mill Makes Good, 2014; Art and the River, 2008), New Hope Arts (Continuum, 2012), the Gratz Gallery (Now & Then, 2010), Stephen Friedman Gallery, London (American Artists, 2006), The Phillips Mill 75th Anniversary Retrospective (2004), and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (The Unbroken Line, 1997). Beck‚Äôs work has been presented in 30 solo gallery exhibitions, including the National Arts Club, NY (Iconic Manhattan, 2012Iconic Manhattan Exhibition Catalog with Introduction by Joyce Towbin Chasan, Art Consultant), the Rosenfeld Gallery, Philadelphia (Philadelphia Heartbeat, 2011), the Morpeth Gallery, Pennington and Hopewell, NJ (1997‚Äì99); also in solo and joint exhibitions at the Gallery of Robert Beck (2000-).  Painting  Beck is known for painting in series ‚Äì multiple images addressing diverse aspects of the same subject. These ‚Äúvisual essays‚Äù include work created while traveling the Mississippi River on a towboat pushing barges, amidst a symphony orchestra during its performances with a racing team in Europe, and traveling with surgeons in Senegal. His paintings depicting life in the Maine maritime community, Over East, are his largest body of work with a single focus; he has been likened to Winslow Homer for traditional genre painting.  Writing  Beck has been a columnist for ICON magazine since 2005. His essays address his life as an artist, describing techniques, environment, and issues involved in creating an image, but also issues that surround his subject. His essay Over There tackles his own challenges of painting in a third-world country, as well as those of the surgeons he was travelling with and the people of Senegal who were his subjects. Twelve of Beck's ICON essays were modified to form the text of the companion piece to his exhibition at the Maine Maritime Museum, Robert Beck: Over East, a book of his painting and writing that documents life in fishing villages on the Maine coast (2016).  Videography  Beck was interviewed in the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley exhibition video, Second Time Around (2014, Larry Carroll for MSV), and in the James A. Michener Museum exhibition video, Local Mill Makes Good (2014, presently being used as promotion for the Bucks County Playhouse).

While serving in the European theater, Miller made publicly recorded comments about the top secret date of the Allied invasion of Normandy in May 1944. After Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower found out, Miller was demoted to lieutenant colonel and sent back to the United States.  Early life  Miller was born on 10 September 1890, in Alloway Township, New Jersey, to John and Mary Miller. After attending local public schools, he enrolled in the United States Military Academy and graduated with the class of 1915.  Military career  After graduation, Miller was assigned as a second lieutenant in the United States Cavalry and served near El Paso, Texas, during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916. He was promoted to captain in 1917 and then major in 1918. In 1917, Miller transferred to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps and completed primary flight training at Rockwell Field. He served with the American Expeditionary Forces in England from September to December 1918 during the last months of World War I. In 1919, Miller returned to the United States. Between October 8‚Äì31, he participated in the Army Transcontinental Air Race, organised by the United States Army Air Service. Seven airman were killed, two en route to the race. In the interwar period, Miller served many assignments in the United States Army Air Service and then the United States Army Air Corps. When he became commanding officer of Duncan Field Air Depot, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Army Air Corps on 10 July 1941. Training and logistics units had kept the older name while all other units had been redesignated as the United States Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941.

The PSE was designed to detect vibrations and tilting of the lunar surface and measure changes in gravity at the instrument location. The vibrations are due to internal seismic sources (moonquakes) and external (meteoroids and impacts from the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages). The primary objective of the experiment was to use these data to determine the internal structure, physical state, and tectonic activity of the Moon. The secondary objectives were to determine the number and mass of meteoroids that strike the Moon and record tidal deformations of the lunar surface. Specification Apollo 12 astronauts Pete Conrad and Al Bean examining the Passive Seismometer prior to the flight The PSE unit was constructed principally of beryllium and had a mass of 11.5 kg, including the electronics module and thermal insulation. It was housed in a drum-shaped enclosure 23 cm in diameter and 29 cm in height. The enclosure was rounded on the bottom and rested on a leveling stool. The PSE consisted of two main subsystems, a sensor unit and an electronics module. The sensor unit contained three matched long- period (LP) seismometers aligned orthogonally in a triaxial set to measure one vertical and two horizontal components of surface motion. The horizontal component seismometers were very sensitive to tilt and were leveled to high accuracy by means of a two-axis motor-driven gimbal operated by ground command. A third motor adjusted the vertical component seismometer in the vertical direction. A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 2.5-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially. A gnomon and level sensor were mounted on the top center of the shroud. Total power drain varied from 4.3 to 7.4 W. The seismometers consisted of an inertial mass on a sensor boom suspended by springs and hinges, a capacitor plate and a damping magnet. The LP seismometers could function in a flat-response mode and in a peaked response mode. In the flat response mode, the LP seismometers had a natural period of 15 s. In the peaked-response mode, they acted as underdamped pendulums with a natural period of 2.2 s. Sensitivity to ground motion peaked sharply at 0.45 Hz in peaked response mode with a useful frequency range of 0.004 to 2 Hz. Maximum sensitivity was enhanced by a factor of 5.6 in the peaked response mode, but sensitivity to low-frequency signals was reduced. All seismometers could detect ground motions as small as 0.3 nm. At tidal frequencies, gravitational acceleration was measured by monitoring the feedback current used to center the seismometer mass. The sensitivity of the instruments was 0.008 mgal. The lunar surface impacts of the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages were used as external calibration sources for the seismometers. The known mass and velocity of these stages at surface impact and the lunar impact point coordinates enabled the computation of energy generated at impact and the point of energy application. (The calibration characteristics were determined by measuring seismometer response to these energy sources.) Deployment A recording of the Apollo 13 S-IVB's impact on the lunar surface as detected by the Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment The seismometers were deployed on 19 November 1969 and operated at reduced gain while the astronauts were on the lunar surface and turned to maximum sensitivity for most of the time after that. The ALSEP central station was located at . The passive seismic experiment was deployed 3 meters east of the central station. The SP seismometer displayed reduced sensitivity at low signal levels following deployment. Seismic disturbances were noted throughout the lunar day, but particularly near sunrise and sunset, these were believed to be due to expansion and contraction of the mylar shroud and/or the cable to the central station. Once the astronauts had returned to the CSM, the LM ascent stage was released and collided with the Moon. The LM hit the lunar surface at 6,048 km/h and created an estimated 9 meter wide crater. The shock waves from the impact were a surprise to the scientists, with the Moon vibrating for over 55 minutes. The seismometers also recorded signals that were totally unlike any received before, starting with small waves that gained in size to a peak which persisted for a long time. It was reported that even after an hour the smallest reverberations had not yet stopped. The Apollo 13 S-IVB with its Instrument Unit was guided to crash onto the lunar surface on April 14, 1970, providing a signal for the PSE. Operation was normal with a few minor incidents over the years until the PSE was commanded to standby on 30 September 1977 as part of the ALSEP station shutdown.

Born in Stoke Newington, Cant joined the Young Socialist League at the age of fifteen, and immediately became involved with the successful campaign against wage reductions at the Thames Iron Works. He was appointed as the organiser of the Young Socialist League in 1912, and then as the London organiser of its parent group, the British Socialist Party (BSP) in 1914. He was part of the majority opposing British involvement in World War I, and wrote extensively in the party newspaper, The Call.Graham Stevenson, \\"Cant Ernie\\", Compendium of Communist Biography Due to his opposition to the war, Cant registered as a conscientious objector and was imprisoned in 1917. Two years later, with the war over, he commenced a hunger strike in protest at his continued incarceration, and was soon released. He was then appointed as the BSP's Scottish organiser, and in this role took part in the discussions which formed the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The party appointed him as its first London District Organiser, although he left the position in mid-1925. Later in 1925, Cant was one of twelve leading figures in the CPGB arrested on a charge of sedition and was imprisoned for six months. On release, he relocated to South Wales, where he spoke in support of miners during their lock-out, then moved to the Soviet Union, working for the International Class War Prisoners Aid Movement and the Comintern. From the early 1930s, Cant was the CPGB organiser in Nottingham, where he attempted to build support among miners, and was also active in the local co-operative movement.

Other pseudonyms she used were J√∫lia de Castro, Leonel Sampaio, C√©lia M√°rcia, and M√°rio Villar. She was best known for publishing short stories, novels, plays, literacy criticism, and journalistic essays or cr√¥nicas.  Life  Em√≠lia Moncorvo de Figueiredo was born on March 11, 1852 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Dr. Carlos Hon√≥rio de Figueiredo and D. Em√≠lia Moncorvo de Figueiredo. Raised by a traditional upper-class family, she received an education and initially, began writing as a hobby. She married Dr. Jer√≥nimo Bandeira de Melo and had four children, including Cecilia Bandeira de Melo, a prominent and successful writer in the 1920s. Shortly after her husband death, she became a writer and frequently contributed to the newspapers O Pa√≠s and Correio da Manh√£. Her weekly column in O Pa√≠s featured cr√¥nicas and brief nonfiction pieces about Brazilian life. The cr√¥nicas demonstrated Dolores activism for women's rights, arguing for fair wage legislation, educational reform, and the repealing of anti-divorce laws in Brazil.  Work and Influence  In 1910, a collection of the cr√¥nicas was published in book form as Ao Esvoa√ßar da Id√©ia (\\"On the Fluttering of an Idea\\"). Her work emphasized women's rights to education, divorce, and women's work. She related feminist writers such as Virginia Woolf and Nisia Floresta to women's roles in society. Dolores' works were well received in Brazil during her lifetime, though some critics found her style more \\"masculine\\" (i.e. more forceful and self-assured) than was thought proper for a woman. Critic writer, Afonso Henriques de Lima Barreto, in an otherwise highly positive appreciation of her work, criticized the Cr√¥nicas for their sharp social commentary.

Accordingly, new regiments have been formed which one of them was the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er REC. During the interwar period and in 1930, following the creation of the 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment 5e REI in Tonkin, the Legion stood strong at 30,000 Legionnaires . Accordingly, the need to organize the Legion was necessary and also the need to provide a clear structure of command that would safe keep the evolution of the legion in relation to the foreign service of its volunteers proved to be even more important. On March 2, 1931, the general staff headquarters of the Armies, a G√©n√©ral, signed the instruction of two formulations, which rather initial, would be the main founding legislative pillar acts of the Inspection of the Foreign Legion. This reorganization has been mainly and for a while preoccupied by the intentions of the Colonel Paul-Fr√©d√©ric Rollet while commanding the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE. Since 1928, Marshal of France Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey exposed in reports argumenting in favor of a new organization of the legion in reason of the increase of general enlistments and the existence of combat regiments mainly depending on two different arms, the infantry and armoured cavalry. The date of creation of the Inspection of the Foreign Legion was fixed on April 1, 1931. The inspection would be entrusted to a G√©n√©ral (or really exceptional Colonel), particularly specialized in Legion affairs. On March 26, 1931, Colonel Rollet passed command of the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er to Colonel Nicolas. On April 1, 1931, Rollet was promoted to G√©n√©ral de brigade and assumed the function of the G√©n√©ral Inspector of the Foreign Legion. Until his retirement in 1935, Rollet would serve his tailored function in total submission while comforting the culture of the Legion and codifying the essence of traditions. The inspection would be dissolved when G√©n√©ral Rollet would leave active duty. In 1948, the Inspection would have been seen activated for 2 years under the command of Raoul Magrin-Vernerey. Dissolved again in 1950, the inspection reappeared as Autonomous Group of the Foreign Legion (G.A.L.E) commanded successively by generals Jean Oli√© and Paul Gardy whom were designated as g√©n√©ral inspector. The Autonomous Group of the Foreign Legion (G.A.L.E) compromised then, 1 Headquarters Staff in Sidi bel-Abb√®s, the Communal Depot of the Foreign Regiments, the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment 1er REI which regrouped all training/instruction units and the moral service for works of the Foreign Legion (S.O.M.L.E). The inspection of the French Foreign Legion would give later form to the Foreign Legion Command.

Probably built before 1800, it is one of the state's oldest stone bridges, and is remarkably well-preserved for its age. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Pemaquid River roughly bisects the peninsula on the Maine coast that the town of Bristol occupies. The village of Bristol Mills is located near the peninsula's geographic center, stretching out along Bristol Road (Maine State Route 130). Near its northern end, Benner Road crosses the river just below the outlet of Biscay Pond, providing access from the village to the northeastern part of the peninsula. The bridge it crosses on is a dry-laid stone arch structure with span of and a total length of . It is built out of field stone and roughly quarried stone and river cobbles, with its base laid directly on bedrock. The top of the arch is about above the bedrock, and it is built up another to the paved roadway. The sides of the bridge are lined with granite curbing and modern wooden guardrails. The actual construction date of the bridge is unknown, but circumstantial evidence and its construction methodology suggest a date before 1800. Town records before 1825 and after 1895 give no indication of funding for a bridge at this location. Benner Road is found on 1795 and 1815 maps of the area, and an 1857 map clearly identifies an arched bridge at this location. Its construction method is consistent with a similar bridge on Upper Round Pond Road (replaced with a metal culvert in 1984). The bridge has needed only modest repairs since its construction.

He is known also as friend and biographer of Samuel Johnson. His 1781 paper on the Ossian controversy is still considered a good survey of critical points. Life Shaw was born on 3 February 1749 at Clachaig in the parish of Kilmorie on the Isle of Arran. He was educated at Ayr and at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated M.A. in 1772. On leaving university he went to London, where he was employed by a merchant as a tutor. He became acquainted with Dr. Samuel Johnson, and was one of the literary coterie which met at Bolt Court and Streatham Park. Entering the ministry of the Church of Scotland, Shaw was presented by the Duke of Gordon, in July 1779, to the parish of Ardclach in the presbytery of Nairn; but resigned the charge 1 August 1780. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 17 May 1781. Induced by Johnson, he took holy orders in the Church of England, and subsequently graduated B.D. from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1800. On 1 May 1795 Shaw was presented to the rectory of Chelvey, Somerset. He died there on 16 September 1831, aged 83. Gaelic language and literature Shaw's first work, published by subscription, was An Analysis of the Gaelic Language, London, 1778 (2nd edition Edinburgh, 1778). Part of the \\"Proposals\\" for this work was written by Johnson. The Elements of Gaelic Grammar (1801) of Alexander Stewart later took its place. Shaw also planned to collect the vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic. Johnson approved and Shaw set off for the Scottish highlands, financing himself since the Highland Society of London would not, and Johnson sent him on his way, saying: \\"Sir, if you give the world a vocabulary of that language, while the island of Great Britain stands in the Atlantic ocean your name will be mentioned\\". Johnson supported the prospective work with an introduction to the publisher William Strahan.Jeff Strabone, Samuel Johnson: Standardizer of English, Preserver of Gaelic, ELH Vol. 77, No. 1 (Spring 2010), pp. 237‚Äì265, at p. 260.

London, 1780. On 20 January 1786 he won an action in the court of session against some of the subscribers, who argued that they were not bound to accept the book because it was defective; it was admitted that he \\"had not fulfilled the terms of his printed proposals\\". Highlanders had refused to give him information unless paid for it. Shaw had more luck in Ireland, with the result that the work contained strictly Irish words. In the controversy with James Macpherson (1736‚Äì1796) over the authenticity of his Ossian (supposed translations), Shaw sided with Johnson, and published An Enquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems ascribed to Ossian, London, 1781 (Dublin, 1782); a second edition, with a reply to John Clark's answer, was published (London 1782, also Dublin), part of the reply being by Johnson.
