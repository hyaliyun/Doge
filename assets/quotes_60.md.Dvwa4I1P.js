The breed dates back to the late 19th century, resulting from the crossing of the Smooth Fox Terrier with the Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz. This dog is recognised by the Kennel Club of Chile (KCC), but is not recognized by the FCI. Since 2011, the breed is classified into Group 3 of Alianz Canine Worldwide (ACW). History Talking about the Chilean Terrier involves traversing the Chilean history since the 18th century and that there is a history of their presence in the country since colonial times, when European immigrants settled in the territory of South America, bringing Smooth Fox Terriers with them in order to exterminate rats and small rodents. Of their English ancestors inherited the restless temperament and barking, while local dogs traced the balance, courage, loyalty and spirit of duty. Tireless companion during the 18th and 19th centuries, the breed was developed in the estates of south-central Chile, easily acclimating to a rustic life, often in a stable. Thus, both peasants and landlords were able to share with this great little dog, so never during that period of our history is identified with a particular social class or caste. In the late 19th century and the Industrial Revolution, many farmers migrated to the cities, bringing their families and their Chilean Terriers. Quickly able to adapt to urban life, being used in new industries and new human settlements (CITES) for the extermination of rats. Because of this last factor, Chilean Terriers were identified for most of the last century with the working-class proletarian country element that played against those who were beginning to take the first steps to establish the activity in Chile, mostly immigrants and members of the bourgeoisie of the time, those more interested in the entry and development of foreign breeds in achieving recognition of the Chilean Terrier. Despite the near-zero interest of local breeders of the time he appeared in, the Chilean Terrier continued to be present in the homes of the middle class of the country, further through the comic Condorito and his ever-faithful Washington, a Chilean Terrier which demonstrates ¬´the Chilean¬ª of this little dog. Today the Chilean Terrier is present throughout the country, it has the virtue of adapting to a variety of climates of Chile, still being used in rural areas as a hunter of mice and in the city, including an excellent dog company, attentive and lively. Description A Chilean Terrier Its main color is white, which is accompanied by black and brown markings. It has a shorthaired undercoat that sometimes hints at some dark spots visible through the white mantle. The ears are set high with a forward- leaning as a \\"V\\" tip. It has a well-developed teeth and bite. Males have a height of between 32 and 38 cm tall at the withers, the ideal height being 35 cm. Females have a height of between 28 and 35 cm tall at the withers, being the ideal height of 32 cm males weigh between 5 and 8 kg, ideal weight is 6.5 kilos. females weigh between 4 and 7 kg, and the ideal weight is 5.5 kg. Famous Chilean Terriers A famous Chilean Terrier is Washington (from the comic Condorito), Condorito's dog. Even though it was only recognised internationally in 2011 by the ACW (Alianz Canine Worldwide), there have been several Chilean Terrier exhibitions in Chile for many years, and now the breed is selling through Internet pages all along Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, and other South American countries.

The film follows a group of campers in the Rocky Mountains who are stalked and murdered by a disfigured assailant. It was the final film credit of Coogan, who died in 1984. The film was written by director Brown and his wife, Summer, for Essex Productions, a film studio that specialized in adult films. Brown had previously worked as a producer on one of their features, the softcore thriller Human Experiments (1979). Inspired by such films as The Hills Have Eyes (1977), the husband and wife wrote the screenplay collaboratively. Filming of The Prey took place in late 1979 in Idyllwild, California. The Prey was acquired for distribution by New World Pictures, and was released theatrically in the United States in November 1983, approximately four years after it was completed, and concurrently showed on premium television in Canada . It was later released on VHS by Thorn EMI in 1988. In 2019, Arrow Films announced they had completed a restoration of the film in preparation for an impending Blu-ray release, marking the first home media release of the film in North America since 1988. Contemporary critical opinion of the film has varied, with its sparse dialogue and pacing being points of criticism. Other film scholars, however, have praised the film for its languorous pacing, which accelerates considerably in the final act. Plot In 1948, a wildfire ravages the North Point section of the Keen Wild national forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, decimating a rural community of gypsies who live in seclusion in a cave. Thirty two-years later, in 1980, an older couple, Frank and Mary Sylvester, are cooking food over a campfire in North Point. Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched by a mysterious figure in the shadows. While Mary walks to the lake to rinse their dishes, she hears her husband scream and returns to the campsite to find her husband's decapitated corpse. She is then killed by the killer wielding her husband's axe. Several weeks later, three teenage couples‚ÄîNancy and Joel, Bobbie and Skip, and Greg and Gail‚Äîembark on a hiking excursion in North Point. While purchasing their nature permits, the women speak with Mark O'Brien, a forest ranger, who tells them that few people venture into North Point. As the group progress deeper into the wilderness, the high-maintenance Gail earnestly tells her friends that she senses someone has been watching them, but they dismiss her fears. During their first night in the woods, Gail hears a noise and sends Greg to investigate the disturbance. Gail is then smothered with her sleeping bag by the killer, and Greg subsequently has his throat torn open. The following morning, the others awaken to find Greg and Gail have disappeared along with their camping gear. While searching the woods, Nancy finds a tree smeared with blood, but dismisses it as being from an animal. Assuming Gail and Greg returned home, the group leave a note behind at their campsite, and decide to continue with their trip. Meanwhile, Mark meets with the head ranger, Lester Tile, who informs him that he has received a call from the police regarding the disappearance of Frank and Mary Sylvester. Lester goes on to tell Mark a story about his witnessing a young gypsy boy wandering the woods after the 1948 fire, horribly disfigured by burns. Skip and Joel decide to hike to the infamous Suicide Peak to rappel down, while Nancy and Bobbie suntan at the base of the peak along a river. Mark meanwhile hikes into North Point to search for the Sylvesters, and comes across the note left behind at the group's campsite. Nearby, he finds vultures consuming Greg and Gail's decomposing bodies, which have been concealed under brush. Meanwhile, as Joel is rappelling down the peak, the killer attacks Skip, breaking his neck, before cutting Joel's rope, causing him to fall to his death. Nancy and Bobbie hear his screams and run to the peak. Upon reaching the top, they find Skip's dead body, and are confronted by the disfigured killer: the gypsy boy from Lester's story, now fully grown, and with razor-sharp claws. Nancy and Bobbie flee down the peak in terror, but Bobbie stumbles into one of the killer's booby traps, which lifts her into the air and thrashes her body against a tree, killing her. Cornered by the killer, Nancy faces him alone until Mark appears, shooting him with a tranquilizer gun and bashing him in the face with a large stick. Mark then comforts Nancy, but the killer awakens and kills him by crushing his throat. Instead of attacking Nancy, the killer smiles as he reaches softly towards her. Some months later, during springtime, the crying of an infant child‚Äîostensibly that of Nancy and the killer's‚Äîis heard emanating from a cave in the mountains. Cast Production =Concept= The Prey was directed by Edwin Scott Brown, who also co-wrote the film with his wife Summer Brown, who served as the film's producer. The film was produced during the height of the slasher film boom, which had become popular after the wake of John Carpenter's immensely profitable 1978 film Halloween. The film was director-producer team's first non-pornographic feature, as they had previously worked making adult films. After serving as a producer on the softcore thriller film Human Experiments for Essex Productions, studio executive Joseph Steinman offered Edwin Brown a writing and directing job making \\"a horror film shot in the woods,\\" a setting which at that time had not been greatly featured in horror films. Brown and his wife Summer wrote the screenplay, choosing the Colorado Rockies as the setting, and were inspired by Halloween, as well as Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes (1977). Brown stated that he devised most of the film's plot trajectory and characters, writing drafts of scenes which Summer subsequently edited and organized into a comprehensive screenplay. =Casting= The film was lead actress Debbie Thureson's first screen role; she had previously appeared in a Maxim coffee advertisement with Kirk Douglas that aired in Japan. Thureson recalled that the screenplay featured little written dialogue, and that much of the filming involved improvisation between the actors. The film also marked actress Lori Lethin's first major film role, appearing as Bobbie, Nancy's friend. Former child star Jackie Coogan was cast as forest ranger Lester Tile. Coogan had previously starred in Charlie Chaplin's 1921 film The Kid before later starring in the role of Uncle Fester in the 1964 television series The Addams Family. The Prey would be Coogan's final film role before his death from cardiac arrest on March 1, 1984 at the age of 69. Gayle Gannes, who portrayed Gail, was a UCLA student and friend of Edwin and Summer Brown who was encouraged by them to audition for the part. Gannes recalled that she was encouraged by Edwin Brown to play the role as \\"playful and ditzy.\\" Carel Struycken, a Dutch actor, was cast in the role of the Monster due to his imposing figure, standing at in height. =Filming= Suicide Rock in Idyllwild, California figures significantly in the film Director Brown had wanted to shoot the film on location in Colorado, where it is set, but was unable to afford the production costs. The filmmakers initially scouted Big Bear, California, but decided to use Idyllwild instead, as it was less populated at the time, and was in close proximity to Los Angeles. Bostwick recalled that the filming locations were \\"In the mountains above Palm Springs, around the USC Music camp. Principal photography began in Idyllwild on in the fall of 1979, with a budget of approximately $150,000. The film was shot over the course of ten days, with filming occurring Monday through Friday between October 15 and October 29. The film was shot on 35mm with a Panaflex camera by cinematographer Jo√£o Fernandes, who was credited under the pseudonym \\"Teru Hayashi.\\" Additional photography of the wildlife close-ups was completed by Gary Gero. Edwin Brown incorporated the various footage of animals as an \\"analogy\\" to the relationship between predator and prey, which applies to both animals and humans, though he conceded that some of the nature footage was added to increase the film's running time. Brown estimated that around 70 percent of the nature footage in the film was stock footage, while 30 percent was filmed by Fernandes and Gero. He has stated that, due to budgetary restrictions and running out of film stock, some sequences in the screenplay went uncompleted, including one in which Mark, the forest ranger, joins the campers at their campfire. Producer Summer Brown spent a significant amount of time on set, and Thureson recalled her as being a \\"mother hen\\" figure to the cast and crew. Much of the dialogue between the characters was improvised, specifically during their hiking scenes. While the majority of the film was shot in Idyllwild, some sequences were filmed elsewhere: Coogan's scenes in the forest ranger station were shot on a studio set, while the sequence featuring Bostwick playing banjo was an insert shot filmed in Lake Mead, Nevada. Additional pickup shots were completed in Los Angeles in early 1980, including the final shot of the cave, which was filmed at the Bronson Caves in Griffith Park. =Special effects= John Carl Buechler served as a special effects designer on the film. Struycken recalled undergoing an elaborate latex makeup application to achieve his character's deformed appearance. =Music= The film's score was composed by Don Peake, who had also composed the score of The Hills Have Eyes (1977). Director Edwin Brown was an acquaintance of that film's producer, Peter Locke, and was put in contact with Peake to write a musical score. Producer Summer Brown stated that Edwin wanted a musical score that was \\"Rachmaninoff[-like]‚Äîbig, thundering.\\" Release The Prey was released by New World Pictures on November 4, 1983, screening in cities such as Louisville, Kentucky. It subsequently screened on premium television stations in Canada beginning November 8, 1983, and continued to screen on the Showtime television network throughout September 1984. The film continued screening in the United States in various cities throughout 1984. =Critical response= TV Guide awarded the film one out of five stars, writing: \\"The killer in this standard mad-slasher-in-the-woods effort is a crazed gypsy mutant horribly burned in a fire that occurred 30 years before. Still angry and wielding an ax, he lumbers off after a bunch of camping youths. There is not one iota of creativity here.\\" Ron Castell in the Blockbuster Video Guide called the film a \\"tiresome shocker, which contains the absolute minimum of plot and dialogue required to make a horror film.\\" Charles Tatum from eFilmCritic.com awarded the film one of five stars, stating, \\"There is not one minute of suspense here.\\" Tatum summarized by saying, \\"Sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980s were not worth the celluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced.\\" The slasher film website Hysteria Lives! gave the film an unfavorable review, stating, \\"THE PREY is dumb, boring (I had to push needles into my legs just to stop from slipping into a catatonic state), and pitifully indulgent.\\" Dread Central gave the film a favorable review, calling it \\"an effective little backwoods slasher offering some vicious kills and a memorable, downbeat shock ending\\". Film scholar John Kenneth Muir praised the film, writing: \\"For horror aficionados, The Prey remains a superior (and vastly underrated) film of its genre because it reaches a fever pitch of terror near the climax.\\" Muir also notes the recurrent \\"man vs. nature\\" theme in the film, accentuated by the repeated sequences of wildlife interspersed throughout the narrative. Film scholar Thomas Sipos, however, characterized the film as \\"basically a travelogue\\" due to its ubiquitous nature footage. In his book The Gorehound‚Äôs Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s, Scott Aaron Stine echoes a similar sentiment, writing: \\"The highlights (be as they may) are some impressive National Geographic-style nature photography. In fact, there's so much stock footage (did I just hear someone shout \\"padding\\"?) that the person responsible was given co-cinematographer's, and deserved it.\\" Stine also commented on the film's gore, calling it \\"standard,\\" and noted the monster makeup as \\"shoddy.\\" =Home media= Thorn EMI Video released the film on VHS in the United States in 1988, featuring the original 80-minute theatrical cut. The Prey remained unavailable on DVD and Blu-ray until 2019, when Arrow Films announced a 2-disc Blu-ray release, featuring a new restoration and three different cuts of the film. The restored theatrical version of the film was screened at the 2019 Texas Frightmare Weekend with stars Lori Lethin, Carel Struycken, and Jackson Bostwick in attendance. The Blu-ray was released on September 17, 2019 in the United Kingdom, with a street date of October 1 in North America. Alternative cut An alternative international home video cut of The Prey, which runs approximately 97 minutes, incorporates an expository flashback and eliminates 6 minutes of the nature footage present in the original 80-minute cut. The flashback, set in 1948, elucidates the origins of the film's killer, only alluded to by the forest ranger, Lester Tile, in the theatrical cut. The flashback entails two men who commit arson at the gypsy commune after one of the men finds that a gypsy has had sex with his wife; it is implied that the killer, then a child, was maimed in this fire. The additional footage featured in this sequence was shot by an unknown director in the summer of 1981, and was incorporated as a campfire story told by Joel to his friends. In order to make the insertion of the footage more seamless, dubbing from an unknown actor was used in place of Steve Bond. This flashback sequence is present on several international VHS editions, including the Japanese release, and was added at the insistence of Essex Productions executive Joseph Steinman, who wanted the film to contain more nudity. the flashback features several sex scenes. Edwin Brown stated in 2019 that he had no involvement in the writing or filming of this footage, and felt it was \\"badly shot and badly edited.\\" Notes and references =Notes= =References= =Sources=      External links   Category:1983 films Category:1983 horror films Category:1983 independent films Category:1980s horror thriller films Category:1980s mystery films Category:1980s serial killer films Category:1980s slasher films Category:1980s teen horror films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American monster movies Category:American natural horror films Category:American slasher films Category:American teen horror films Category:Backwoods slasher films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in forests Category:Films shot in California Category:New World Pictures films ","title":"The Prey (1983 film)"},{"id":"8856021","text":"Arnaud Maire (born March 6, 1979) is a French football defender.

The work was compiled by a team of scholars of the Song dynasty, led by Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi. It was originally simply called the Tangshu (Book of Tang) until the 18th century.  History  In Chinese history, it was customary for dynasties to compile histories of their immediate predecessor as a means of cementing their own legitimacy. As a result, during the Later Jin dynasty of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a history of the preceding Tang dynasty, the Old Book of Tang () had already been compiled. In 1044, however, Emperor Renzong of Song ordered a new compilation of Tang history, based on his belief that the original Old Book of Tang lacked organization and clarity. The process took 17 years, being finally completed in 1060. Contents The New Book of Tang differed dramatically from the older version in its organization and contents, in part due to the literary and philosophical inclinations of its chief compilers. Ouyang Xiu frequently invoked the principle of reason in evaluating historical accounts, and purged all accounts containing elements of myth or superstition, thereby dramatically shortening many of the biographies of emperors and major figures. In contrast, the New Book of Tang included several new sections of more practical interest to Tang history. These included a much expanded series of Treatises (), including topics on the horse trade with Tibet and military affairs, and a table of the bureaucratic hierarchy of the Tang administration which was missing from the old Old Book of Tang.From a description by Wang Yingling, in his Yuhai () Another feature which was revived was the use of \\"tables\\" (), annalistic tables of events and successions which included not just the emperors themselves but also chancellors and jiedushi. The style of prose in the New Book also differed, due to Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi being both admirers of the simplified, 'ancient' prose style of Tang scholars such as Han Yu, rather than the flowery prose style found in official Tang documents. This led them to change the original wordings in the documents that they quoted in the book. However, in the reduction, the direct use of Tang court records was lost, some reduced passages were unclear, and many errors were introduced in attempting to find more 'ancient' words to rephrase the Tang originals.Endymion Wilkinson. Chinese History: A New Manual. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph Series New Edition; Second, Revised printing March 2013: ), 737. =Annals= The annals of the Tang emperors are covered in volumes 1‚Äì10. Wilkinson notes that the annals in the New Book of Tang are considerably shorter than the Old Book of Tang. =Treatises= The treatises are contained in volumes 11 through 60. As noted above the treatises are greatly expanded compared with the Old Book of Tang. The section on Rites and Music () is the largest occupying 12 volumes (11-22). The New Book of Tang was the first of the standard histories to include a treatise on selecting and appointing officials (). This included a description of the examination system, which had become an increasingly important aspect of recruiting officials in the Tang, especially after 780. =Tables= The tables are contained in volumes 61-75. =Biographies= Four biographies of women appear in this new book that were not present in the first Old Book of Tang. The women kill or maim themselves in horrible ways, and represent examples of Tang dynasty women that were intended to deter contemporary readers from extreme behavior. For example, Woman Lu gouges her own eye out to assure her ailing husband that there will be no second man after him. Biographies of 35 overly filial and fraternal men are also included in the work, though these men do not resort to the extremes of female mutilation found in the female biographies.

A merger is similar to an acquisition but refers more strictly to combining all of the interests of both companies into a stronger single company. The end result is to grow the business in a quicker and more profitable manner than normal organic growth would allow. Process The process begins with defining the type of business that would make a good acquisition. Generally businesses within the same segment or a highly complementary market segment are targeted. Once defined the target business is approached and if interest is shown due diligence is performed to ascertain the financial and other conditions of the business. When the financial terms are agreed upon, and the contract is signed the merger portion of the acquisition begins. Overlapping processes, personnel and products are evaluated and the better-performing pieces are retained. Single business acquisitions and split and sell A single acquisition refers to one company buying the assets and operations of another company and absorbing what is needed while simply discarding duplicated or unnecessary pieces of the acquired business. \\"Split and sell\\" acquisitions involve buying an entire business in order to gain one or two pieces of the business. The acquiring business may wish to retain the customer list and a product line, while moving manufacturing and other production related duties to an existing line. In this case the excess is often sold off to recapture some of the acquisition cost. Affiliate acquisitions Businesses that use affiliates to sell and market their products may find themselves in the position of losing control of the marketing portion. This presents a danger as the entire business cycle is dependent on the sales cycle, which is now external to the business. In this scenario the acquiring business may be forced into paying a premium to the affiliate, to regain control of the process without upsetting current customers and cash flow. In rare instances the affiliate will gain so much influence that it can purchase the parent company.  Risks  There are many risks related to business acquisition and a number of mergers or acquisition fail ending up inducing higher operating costs. There are a set of criteria that are usually followed to know if a business is a good target for acquisition such as : having operative processes, a profitable and documented customer acquisition strategy, good profits, a good customer retention strategy, etc. Category:Business terms Category:Mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Business acquisition"},{"id":"8856061","text":"Reading Junior Senior High School is a public high school in Reading, Ohio, United States.

It stars Kevin Spacey as Quoyle, Judi Dench as Agnis Hamm, and Julianne Moore as Wavey Prowse. Cate Blanchett, Pete Postlethwaite, Scott Glenn, Rhys Ifans, Jason Behr, and Gordon Pinsent appear in supporting roles. Plot When Quoyle was a young boy, his father, Guy, tossed him into a lake, expecting him to swim naturally. Images of flailing in water and nearly drowning often resurface in Quoyle's memory when he is under stress. Quoyle, now an ink setter at a small newspaper in Poughkeepsie, New York, lives a lonely life. He becomes infatuated with and marries a vivacious local woman named Petal. Petal is an unfaithful wife and a negligent mother to their six- year-old daughter, Bunny. Petal runs off with a lover, taking Bunny with her. Soon after, Petal and her boyfriend are killed in a car accident. The police return Bunny to Quoyle, informing him that Petal sold her to a black market adoption operation for $6,000. Shortly before those events, Quoyle's elderly parents committed suicide together. Quoyle's aunt, Agnis Hamm, arrives to pay her respects to her late brother, though her real motive is to steal Guy's ashes (which she later dumps down an outhouse hole and urinates on). Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in Newfoundland, which has been abandoned for 44 years. Agnis agrees to stay a few more days to help Quoyle through his recent turmoil, then persuades him to move to Newfoundland with her. While struggling to build a new life, restore the derelict house, and care for Bunny, Quoyle meets Wavey Prowse, a widow whose young son, Harry, has a learning disability. Wavey and Quoyle gradually develop a deepening relationship. Wavey eventually admits she pretends to be widowed, ashamed that her philandering husband left when she was pregnant. Quoyle learns that the ancient Quoyles were pirates that ran ships aground and savagely pillaged them. When those Quoyles were driven out, they moved their house over a frozen lake to its present location, now known as Quoyle's Point. Quoyle's cousin Nolan, an old hermit, reveals that young Agnis was raped and impregnated by her teen-aged brother (Quoyle's father), resulting in an abortion. Quoyle applies for an ink setter job at the Gammy Bird. Owner and publisher, Jack Buggit, instead hires him as a reporter covering auto wrecks and the town's shipping news. With no journalism experience, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles, incurring managing editor Tert Card's constant scorn. Reporter Billy Pretty tutors and encourages Quoyle. When Quoyle's article about a millionaire's vintage yacht docked in town is popular with readers, Jack assigns him a weekly column profiling an interesting boat in port. Meanwhile, Agnis resumes her former occupation as a boat upholsterer to help support the family. She later confides to Quoyle that the woman she loved died six years earlier from leukemia. Rather than running his newspaper full time, Jack Buggit commercially fishes to prevent his adult son, Dennis, who nearly died at sea, from obtaining his own commercial license, which are limited. Jack drowns while securing his boat in an oncoming storm. During the funeral wake at the Buggit house, shock and chaos erupts when Jack miraculously revives from a coma-like state caused by hypothermia. Jack gives Dennis his fishing license, believing the generational curse of Buggits dying at sea has been broken. After Jack's revival, Bunny is upset and angry at Quoyle, believing Petal could also have been \\"awakened\\", but she finally accepts her mother's death. Agnis, Quoyle, and Bunny have been living in town during the winter months while their house is renovated. On the night of the big storm, Bunny awoke and could \\"see\\" the house at Quoyle's point being blown away. When the family drives to their property, they discover the house is gone, symbolically freeing them from the dark Quoyle legacy.

He is only a timid ink setter in the film and he does not begin writing as a reporter until after he arrives in Newfoundland. In the novel, he is already a journalist. Another difference is that several characters, such as the younger Buggit family, are deleted or merged.

Originally compiled during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, it was superseded by the New Book of Tang which was compiled in the Song dynasty, but later regained acceptance. The credited editor was chief minister Liu Xu, but the bulk (if not all) of the editing work was actually completed by his predecessor Zhao Ying. The authors include Zhang Zhao, Jia Wei (), and Zhao Xi (). Zhao Yi, Ch. 16 \\"Old and New Books of Tang\\" (), Notes on Twenty-two Histories ().  Structure  The Old Book of Tang comprises 200 volumes. Volumes 1-20 contain the annals of the Tang emperors. Twitchett notes that coverage over time in the annals is most dense during the early and middle Tang, including only very sparse information in the late Tang after 847. Volumes 21-50 contain treatises, including rites, music, calendar, astronomy, five elements, geography, officials, carriages and clothes, literature, food and commodities, and law. The section on rites (volumes 21-27) is the longest and most detailed, showing the relative importance placed on ceremonial matters. This section includes descriptions of temple design, sacrifices, and festivals. The section on geography (volumes 38-41) contains a description of the regional administration of the Tang empire around the year 752. The section on officials (volumes 42-44) contains a description of the Tang administrative system. The section on the five elements () contains a description of earthquakes, floods, and other natural events. Volumes 51-200 contain biographical related content, including empresses and consorts (51-52), imperial families, and the peoples populating the areas bordering the Tang empire (194-200). History The book's compiling began when the Later Jin's founding emperor Shi Jingtang ordered its compilation in 941. The original chief editor was Zhao Ying, who was also the chancellor then. However, by the time of its completion, Liu Xu had become chancellor and taken over the work of organisation; as a result he was credited as chief editor when the work was presented in 945 to Emperor Chu of Jin. Being a relatively quickly compiled work of official history, the Old Book of Tang was a compilation of earlier annals, now lost; it further incorporates other monographs and biographies, using as sources (for instance) the Tongdian of Du You. These sources were often directly copied from records and earlier histories, and the result would be severely criticised during the Northern Song; Emperor Renzong of Song, for example, called the book \\"poorly organised, burdened with unimportant details, wanting in style and poorly researched\\". These errors even included duplicated biographies of characters. Because of these criticisms, in 1044 a new history of the Tang dynasty was commissioned; with Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi as editors, the New Book of Tang was then produced. After the New Book was presented, the original Old Book of Tang went out of print, and over centuries it became very rare. It was during the Ming dynasty when the remaining copies were gathered and the book was once again published, eventually becoming canonised as one of the Twenty-Four Histories.

During the first stages of the rebellion, various areas elected their own regional governing councils. These were replaced by the united administration at the First National Assembly of Epidaurus during early 1822, which also adopted the first Greek Constitution. A series of National Assemblies ensued, while Greece was threatened with collapse due to civil war and the victories of Ibrahim Pasha. In 1827, the Third National Assembly at Troezen selected Count Ioannis Kapodistrias as Governor of Greece for seven years. He arrived in 1828 and established the Hellenic State, commanding with quasi-dictatorial powers. He was assassinated by political rivals in 1831 and was succeeded by his brother, Augustinos Kapodistrias until the Great Powers declared Greece a Kingdom and selected the Bavarian Prince Otto to be its king.

She also has published under the pen name Zoe Dozier, and with her sister Mary Burrus Williams, she writes historical romance under the name Bronwyn Williams. She is a recipient of the RITA Award. Biography Dixie Burrus was born in 1930 on North Carolina's Outer Banks, daughter of professional baseball played Maurice Lennon \\"Dick\\" Burrus. She learned from a young age to enjoy the water and the outdoors, and to spend plenty of time lying down with a good book as well. Browning considers herself foremost an artist. She studied and later taught art. She paints landscapes and seascapes in watercolor, and is listed in Who's Who in American Art.Browne PCL In 1975, Browning began writing a newspaper column on art. Shortly thereafter, she decided to try fiction. As she had recently begun reading romance novels, she attempted to recreate the pieces of the genre that appealed to her. This tactic worked, as in 1976, Avalon published her first two romances. She has since published over 100 category romance novels. She has been awarded a Romance Writers of America RITA Award, and been a five-time RITA finalist. She has also won three Maggies, and numerous awards from the National Federation of Press Women and the NC Press Club. At the end of 2004, after Browning had submitted yet another manuscript, she realized that writing was not as exciting for her as it had been. She began painting again, and now concentrates primarily on her art. Browning cofounded and served as the first president of The Watercolor Society of North Carolina. She is also a co-owner of Browning Artworks in Frisco, North Carolina, which features her own work as well as that of her son and daughter- in-law. Browning lives in North Carolina with her husband of over fifty years.

He was also known by his name Chen Zengze (), Weiming being his hao, a pen-name. Chen came from an educated family with roots in Qishui, Hubei, China. His great- grandfather was a famous scholar; and his mother was skilled at calligraphy. As a boy, Chen prepared for the civil service exams by studying the Chinese classics, Chinese calligraphy, poetry, and essay-writing. He passed the mid- level exam of juren in 1902, and received a post in the Qing History Office. His two brothers also became scholars and authors. Chen began to study the Chinese martial arts in Beijing under Sun Lutang (1859‚Äì1933), with whom he studied xingyi (hsing-i) and bagua (pa-kua). He then began to study taijiquan (t'ai chi ch'uan) with Yang Chengfu (1883‚Äì1936), grandson of Yang Luchan, founder of the Yang family lineage. In 1925, Chen moved to Shanghai and established the Zhi Ruo (Achieving Softness) Taijiquan Association. Chen recorded Yang's teachings in three books under his own name: Taijiquan shu (The Art of Taijiquan, 1925), Taiji jian (Taiji Sword, 1928), and Taijiquan da wen (Questions and Answers on Taijiquan, 1929). These books are important not only for their content, but because they were among the first taijiquan books published for a mass audience. Chen also wrote several scholarly books under the name Chen Zengze. He wrote prefaces to Sun Lutang and Zheng Manqing's taijiquan books. Though Chen did not create a large following through his teaching as did his classmates Dong Yingjie (Tung Ying-chieh) and Zheng Manqing (Cheng Man-ch'ing), his books have remained influential and are important references about taijiquan in the early 1900s.

Description Fine bubble diffusers produce a plethora of very small air bubbles which rise slowly from the floor of a wastewater treatment plant or sewage treatment plant aeration tank and provide substantial and efficient mass transfer of oxygen to the water. The oxygen, combined with the food source, sewage, allows the bacteria to produce enzymes which help break down the waste so that it can settle in the secondary clarifiers or be filtered by membranes. A fine bubble diffuser is commonly manufactured in various forms: tube, disc, plate, and dome. Bubble size The subject of bubble size is important because the aeration system in a wastewater or sewage treatment plant consumes an average of 50 to 70 percent of the energy of the entire plant. Increasing the oxygen transfer efficiency decreases the power the plant requires to provide the same quality of effluent water. Furthermore, fine bubble diffusers evenly spread out (often referred to as a 'grid arrangement') on the floor of a tank, provide the operator of the plant a great deal of operational flexibility. This can be used to create zones with high oxygen concentrations (oxic or aerobic), zones with minimal oxygen concentration (anoxic) and zones with no oxygen (anaerobic). This allows for more precise targeting and removal of specific contaminants. The importance of achieving ever smaller bubble sizes has been a hotly debated subject in the industry as ultra fine bubbles (micrometre size) are generally perceived to rise too slowly and provide too little \\"pumpage\\" to provide adequate mixing of sewage in an aeration tank. On the other hand, the industry standard \\"fine bubble\\" with a typical discharge diameter of 2 mm is probably larger than it needs to be for many plants. Average bubble diameters of 0.9 mm are possible nowadays, using special polyurethane (PUR) or special recently developed EPDM membranes. Fine bubble diffusers have largely replaced coarse bubble diffusers and mechanical aerators in most of the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.

Some similar species are the western ribbon snake, common garter snake, plains garter snake, and Butler's garter snake.(Mayer 2003) The other three subspecies are the northern (T. s. septentrionalis), southern (T. s. sackenii), and bluestripe (T. s. nitae) ribbon snakes. Description The eastern ribbon snake gets its name from its very thin body. At maturity, it grows to between in length.(Kingsbury 2007) It is a slender, black snake with a yellow mid-back stripe and one on each side. A brown stripe of one or two rows of scales extends onto the sides of the belly. The rest of the belly is a greenish-white color. It also has two rows of black spots between the back and side stripes. It also has a long tail that is about one-third of the length of its body. The labial scales around the mouth of the snake are unmarked and uniformly bright yellow or white. A white or light yellow bar borders the front of the eyes.(Kingsbury 2007) Juveniles are colored like adults.Biological Sciences Towson University Some aspects of the eastern ribbon snake make it different from a close relative, the common garter snake. The eastern ribbon snake has a much thinner body than a common garter snake, its tail makes up about one-third of its body length, it has stripes on the third and fourth scale rows and it has pure white lips and a mark of white color in front of its eyes. It is not venomous. File:Eastern RibbonSnake.jpg File:GarterSnake.jpg File:Ribbon Snake.jpg Habitats The common ribbon snake is typically found in the southeastern United States, usually in wetlands and near the edges of ponds and streams.(Kenney 2007) They are found both in and out of water; they are adapted to both environments. When they are frightened, they take to the water or bushes. They do not dive like water snakes; they glide across the surface of the water, instead. Diet The ribbon snake generally eats small fish, tadpoles, salamanders, small frogs and toads, and occasionally insects. In some cases, the female has been observed eating her young. The typical time for snakes to hunt is in the morning or early evening. Once the snake has spotted its prey, it will quickly slither to catch its prey and swallow it whole.Ohio Department of Natural Resources Reproduction Reproduction in eastern ribbon snakes takes place after they emerge from hibernation in the spring, in April or May. Mating occasionally takes place in the fall, but the female will delay fertilization and development until the next spring. The average gestation period is three months. The average number of young is around 12 but can range four to 27. Females give birth in late summer or the early fall. After birth, no parental care is involved; the young are left to fend for themselves. Most young reach sexual maturity after two years, but most usually wait until the third year.Biological Sciences Towson University Behavior T. s. sauritus stays active year around. However, in colder months, the snake may be forced to hibernate, typically in ant mounds, mole tunnels, crayfish burrows, muskrat lodges, and bank burrows. Ribbon snakes rarely bite when handled, but they do produce a foul musk from their anal glands when they feel threatened.(Buchanan 2007) References External links *Center for Reptiles and Amphibians *INHS Amphibian and Reptile Collection *Eastern ribbon snake *Snakes of Massachusetts *Telling garter snakes and ribbon snakes apart *Center for Reptile and Amphibian Conservation and Management *UMASS Extension's Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation Program sauritus sauritus Category:Reptiles of the United States Category:Reptiles described in 1766 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Thamnophis sauritus sauritus"},{"id":"8856192","title":"DTX (form factor)"},{"id":"8856200","text":"Maric√° () is a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro.

The Stickney House is currently the Bull Valley Police Headquarters since 1985.Fanjul, Juan Carlos. WGN Cover Stories: Stickney House, WGNtv.com, 31 October 2005. Retrieved Jan. 2007. The structure has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. The house is widely considered bizarre due to its design, which was based, in part, on George and Sylvia Stickney's belief in Spiritualism.Stickney Mansion , Ghosts, Ghosts.org.uk. Retrieved Jan. 2007. George and Sylvia Stickney George and Sylvia Stickney built this English country house in 1865. They chose such an isolated place for the peace and quiet and for their spiritualistic activities. Both of them were said to be accomplished mediums and they wanted to host parties and seances for their friends. The seclusion offered by the Illinois countryside made the perfect setting. The Stickneys may have drifted toward spiritualism as a way to communicate with their dead children; they had ten children but only three survived to adulthood. It is known that the family conducted seances on the second floor of the building, in Sylvia's ballroom. In the years since the house left the hands of the Stickney family, owners have reported supernatural occurrences. Architecture The house itself was very unusual in its design. It has two stories, although the second floor was reserved for a ballroom that ran the entire length of the building. The house is actually very big for being built in the 1800s. Upstairs has two rooms, one with a bathroom, and down the hall is Sylvia's ballroom that has three more rooms connecting to it. During the Civil War, the house also served as quarters for Federal soldiers and was home to the first piano in McHenry County. This was not why the house gained its fame though! The Stickneys insisted on adding distinctive features into the design of the house. These features, they assured the architect, would assist them when holding seances and gatherings at the property. They believed that spirits have a tendency to get stuck in 90 degree corners. It has also been suggested that the Stickneys believed that corners attracted the attention of evil spirits as well, a common belief in Spiritualist circles of the time. Therefore, the home's interior was designed with no 90 degree angles between the walls. Rumor has it that there is one 90 degree angle in the house, and this is also where George Stickney died. Not true, Richard confirmed that the house was searched and documented and there was no 90 degree angles found at the time of George's death. He also confirmed that George's death was never documented, so no one knows how he died. Paranormal activity  Today the mansion is occupied by the Village of Bull Valley and its police department. In 2005 Bull Valley Police Chief Norbert Sauers described his experiences with possible paranormal events in the Stickney Mansion. Sauers said that village employees have heard numerous sounds that seem to defy explanation. He described hearing footsteps in the second floor ballroom, a room that today is used only as storage for village records but was used for seances when the Stickneys owned the mansion. The footstep sounds have extended out onto the stairwell at times. Other occurrences include hearing human sounding noises or voices. They sometimes even hear the toilets flushing when they are alone in the house. The Chief said he has also personally experienced objects moving around on his desk, lights turning off and, door knobs turning and a door opening, seemingly by themselves, and voices from thin air, having once heard a shout in his ear when no one was around him. Another police officer in Bull Valley claims to have come face to face with an apparition of Stickney's father-in-law.

As a player, he made 169 appearances in the Football League as a Defender for Workington before a near fatal car crash ended his career. Middlemass has gone to see his parents in Sheffield (with his wife and son) to inform them about a possible transfer to Ipswich Town. However, on the way home his car was hit by a lorry near Bradford. After nearly a year out of the game, Clive returned to the side at Workington (then in the 3rd tier), but after a few appearances he realised his injuries had been too severe, and retired from professional playing. In his only role as a manager, he took over at Carlisle United in November 1987, converting a club that had suffered consecutive relegations from the Second to the Fourth Division, to one that narrowly failed to reach the promotion play-offs on goal-difference in 1990. During this season, where Carlisle United had led the division for several weeks, Clive was complimented by the national press on the way he played an attractive style of football with three at the back. A good FA Cup run also saw them drawn against Liverpool, which ended in a 0‚Äì3 defeat in front of nearly 20,000 at Brunton Park. However, two broken legs to key players, and a run of 4 consecutive away matches to London (in a two weeks) towards the end of the season took their toll. The following season the side failed to kick on, and Clive left the club in March 1991. Clive started his career away from playing as Assistant to Terry Cooper at Bristol Rovers (1980), and then Bristol City (1982). After leaving Carlisle United (1987-1991), Clive had a brief stint as First Team Coach at Darlington (1991), before becoming Assistant to Jimmy Mullen at Burnley (1992). After Jimmy Mullen left in 1996, Clive briefly took over as Care-taker Manager, before becoming Assistant Manager to Adrian Heath and then Chief Scout under Chris Waddle. In 1998, he joined Preston North End as Chief Scout to David Moyes, and remained for the tenures of Craig Brown and Billy Davies. In 2006, he left as part of Billy Davies' back-room team to take over as Chief Scout at Derby County. In 2010, he hooked up again with David Moyes (a centre-half during Clive's days at Bristol City) as Opposition Scout at Everton.

As manager, he spent the 1991‚Äì92 season in charge of Carlisle United. Career McCaffery began his career as an apprentice with Newcastle United and went on to captain the England Youth side. He turned professional in January 1974 and made his league debut against Ipswich Town in March 1975. His first senior goal for the club came in an FA Cup replay against Sheffield United in January 1977. After 59 league games for the Magpies (scoring four goals) he moved to Derby County in August 1978 for a fee of ¬£60,000, making his Rams' debut on 15 September in a 3‚Äì2 win against West Bromwich Albion at the Baseball Ground.

The following season, he scored the only goal of the game as Rovers beat local rivals Bristol City for the first time in ten meetings. He was loaned by Rovers to their local rivals Bristol City in February 1982, when City were in a financial crisis that saw them come very close to extinction and lose many of their players. He returned to Bristol Rovers and became a regular in their side, playing 184 times and scoring 11 goals in five seasons. In March 1985 he joined Torquay United on loan and in July that year moved to Exeter City on a free transfer. He made 58 league appearances for the Grecians before a ¬£3,000 move back to his native north-east, joining Hartlepool United in February 1987.

A physical director of the Vancouver police, Gillis was famous as the \\"Western Giant\\". At Winnipeg 1909 he became Canadian all-round champion. He set a shot put record that stood for 34 years. He was just 42 points short in 7,000 of winning the North American all-round. A member of the 1912 Olympic team, he hoped to compete with Jim Thorpe but he had to read about it from a tuberculosis sanitorium. He died at North Sydney on July 4, 1913 at age 29. In May 2006, he was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame. History John Hugh Gillis was the son of cabinet maker Angus Hugh Gillis and his wife, Margaret Ann MacFarlane, who had moved from the Margaree Valley to North Sydney. After she died in 1904 Angus married again and moved to Glace Bay. John Hugh attended St. Francis Xavier College but dropped out after a year or two. Cross-continent walk On a bet and a dare, on January 31, 1906 at the age of 22 he set out from North Sydney, Nova Scotia, with two others to walk to San Francisco and back within a year. They hiked on the railroad track, crossed central Maine in cold and blizzard and reached Montreal, Quebec. There they disagreed. Gillis, suffering from sore feet, went on alone towards Vancouver, British Columbia. Charles Jackman, retired from the Toronto lacrosse team, decided at Montreal to follow him. Jackman caught up with him near Ignace, Ontario. The two tall athletes, both 6 feet 4¬Ω inches, walked 1,800 miles (2,700 km) together with many adventures and strode into Vancouver station to a waiting crowd at midnight September 24, 1906. =Documentation= Jackman kept a little diary of the daily happenings and took 250 pictures. That diary, the pictures that survived, and the newspaper stories about the walk led to a book, Transcontinental Pedestrians, published in October 2006 by Fitzhenry & Whiteside, of Toronto. Track and field sports When they came back from Victoria, Charles and Jack shook hands as Charles took the train for Halifax and home. They would never see each other again. Jack Gillis decided to stay in Vancouver because there was great interest in track and field sports. At the 1907 meet there he won the 120-yard hurdles, the high jump and the shot put. The Vancouver Police Force, attracted by his athletic prowess, inducted him as a physical director. He and another athlete in the police force, Duncan Gillis, probably a distant cousin, lived at 852 Cordova Street. =Physical director of the Vancouver Police Force= In the Vancouver meet of May 23, 1908, Jack was first nationally with a shot put of 40 feet 7 inches.Radcliffe, Ted & McNulty, William. Canadian Athletics, 1839‚Äì1992. Ottawa: Athletics Canada, 1992 From The Winnipeg Tribune July 19, 1909: In Toronto, the Globe of July 28, 1909, page 9, featured a photograph of John H. Gillis, the \\"giant Vancouver policeman, who won the all-round championship of Canada at the C.A.A.U. annual championship meet at Winnipeg. From The Citizen, Ottawa July 29, 1909: Five thousand spectators crowded the Scarborough Beach Athletic Grounds to watch the twenty-seventh meet held by the Toronto Police on Saturday, July 31, 1909. The Globe on page 3 the following Monday reported that J.H. Gillis, the Western giant, had won the gold medal with 20 points, had come first in five events and second in two, having placed in all events in which he had taken part. Duncan Gillis won ten points. Four days later on August 4 at the Hamilton meet Jack Gillis came first in the running high jump, the running broad jump and the pole vault and second in the 100-yard race. Duncan was first in the 16-pound hammer throw, the caber tossing and the 16-pound long throw and second in the 56-pound high throw.Toronto Star, August 5, 1909, page 10 At Brockton Point July 28, 1910 Jack Gillis won the all-round contest and Duncan came first in the 56-pound throw, the discus and the 16-pound hammer.The World August 1, 1910, sports page The North American all-round championship for 1910 was fought out at Marshall Field in Chicago on August 13 in a seesaw battle between F.C Thomson of Los Angeles, the favourite, and J.H. Gillis. Their rivalry gripped the crowd of 3,500, for the result was very close. Thomson scored 6.951 points and Gillis 6,909‚Äîjust 42 points short. The winner of the third spot gained 6,120 points. This was a remarkable accomplishment for an athlete who had neither a trainer nor an advisor in attendance. He had not enough strength in the 16-pound shot and the 56-pound weight: otherwise he would have come first.The Daily World, August 15, 1910, sports page Before a crowd of 4,500 at the Toronto Police athletic meet August 17, Gillis cleaned up with 21 points, the nearest competitor winning 9 points. The Toronto Daily Star of August 18, page 13, had a three-column montage of Gillis in action. Another athlete and competitor in Jack's career was Martin Sheridan, who came from County Mayo to the United States in 1897, became a New York policeman, won nine Olympic medals and won three U.S all-round competitions, forerunners of the decathlon. In the first all-round between Gillis and Sheridan, Gillis won four events and Sheridan won six. In their second all-round, certified by Thomas Flanagan of the M.A.A.U, Sheridan won only two and Gillis won eight. Health issues On September 17, 1910, Jack Gillis suddenly resigned his position as first-class constable with a salary of $1,200.(Barbara Fenwick, Archivist, Vancouver Police Museum) He was feeling vaguely unwell, losing weight, and was frequently tired. Announcing the all-round championship The Daily World of August 5, 1911, sports page, mentioned \\"Vancouver's star athlete\\" and added, \\"Jack had intended to train early for this year's championship but later abandoned the intention.\\" He went to work for Customs but had no longer the energy to go out socially. Gradually he grew worse: coughing, low fever, cold sweat at night, poor appetite, wasted appearance. On December 9, 1911 Dr, Kennedy admitted him to the sanitarium at Tranquille, near Kamloops.(Admission Book, Anti-Tuberculosis Society Records, 1907‚Äì1947. BC Archives, MS-1916, vol. 7) Recognition The Sydney Record of July 5, front page, remembered that he had walked across the continent. The Sydney Daily Post of the same date, page 5, remarked, \\"He was looked on as the most likely aspirant for the honors so long held by Martin Sheridan, but the disease which ultimately brought about his death fastened upon him and cut short his athletic career.\\" The Daily News-Advertiser of Vancouver July 7, 1913 on its sports page carried the headline \\"Jack Gillis Passes Away in Nova Scotia\\" and the sub-head \\"Former Vancouver Athlete Succumbs to Tuberculosis After Long Illness‚ÄîWon Many Trophies on Athletic Field\\".

History, garrisons, campaigns and battles  Regimental Color Guard of the 1er R.P.I.Ma Despite its name, the 1er RPIMa is part of the French Army, like other Marine units. The naval infantry background dates back to 1762, when units of the French Army were detached to the French Navy for ship-borne and overseas duties. It is the heir to the first Colonial Parachute Commando Demi-Brigade, whose origins date back to World War II. Under the command of Captain Georges Berg√©, the 1st Air Company was created in England on September 15, 1940 with parachute units of the Special Air Service (SAS). The 1e CCP/SAS was created in 1941 in Scotland. From 1942 to 1944, this company was engaged in Crete, Libya, Tunisia, Brittany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Afterwards, the company was dissolved and re-designated as an SAS Parachute Demi-Brigade from 1946 to 1949, then 1st Colonial Parachute Commando Demi-Brigade from 1949 to 1955 in Indochina. It was classified as B.P.C in Algeria from 1955 to 1958, the B.C.C.P dissolved and re-designated from 1959 to 1960 as G.I.B.P.OM then in 1960 B.P.C.I.Ma and renamed in 1962 1erR.P.I.Ma which retained the SAS emblem. = Successive garrisons = * September 1940: RAF Ringway (England) * 1941: Beirut then Damascus. * 1942: Kabrit on the Suez Canal. * 1943: Camberley, United Kingdom * Following the war, in France * 1960: Creation of the 1eR.P.I.Ma and Garrison at Bayonne Marching parade companies of the 1er R.P.I.Ma. = World War II = The 1er RPIMa inherited the traditions of the two Free French Special Air Service (SAS) Regiments that served with distinction alongside their British brothers-in-arms of the SAS Brigade during World War II. On September 15, 1940, General Charles de Gaulle signed the activation order of the 1√®re Compagnie d'Infanterie de l'Air (1√®re CIA) of the Free French Forces, or 1st Free French Airborne Infantry Company, under the command of Captain Berg√©. The 1√®re CIA began operational missions, parachuting into occupied France in March 1941. The company was then split into two units, a covert action unit used for clandestine operations and a conventional and uniformed company sent to North Africa in September 1941 to fight the Axis Forces along with British Forces. A very good relationship was quickly established between Captain Berg√© and Major Stirling, the commander of the newly created Special Air Service (SAS); the French detachment was soon incorporated into the SAS and became the French Squadron. From 1942 to 1943, the French SAS roamed the region, ranging as far as Crete hunting down Axis forces and destroying their aircraft and supply dumps. In November 1943, the 3rd and 4th Air Infantry were created and incorporated into the SAS Brigade along with their British and Belgian counterparts, the 1st and 2nd SAS Regiments. The Free French SAS took an important part in the liberation of Europe. In Brittany, a little after midnight on D-Day, June 6, 1944, Caporal Emile Bou√©tard (born in Brittany, 1915) was the first soldier killed in action in Plumelec, Morbihan. On August 1, 1944, the 3rd and 4th Air Infantry battalions were renamed the 2nd and 3rd Chasseur Parachute battalions. As a reward for their bravery, King George VI awarded the Free French SAS the right to wear the red beret of the British SAS, which replaced the black beret worn until then. As the war drew to a close, 52 French SAS \\"sticks\\" (705 men) were parachuted into the Netherlands on April 7, 1945, causing major havoc in the rear areas of German occupation forces and easing pressure on the forward thrust of the 2nd Canadian Army Corps. The Free French SAS took a major part in the epic battles of the SAS in Africa, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, earning French and foreign awards (including many British DSOs, MCs and MMs). The regimental colours of the 1er RPIMa have also been decorated with the U.S. Bronze Star Medal, the Dutch Bronze Cross and the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Today, this SAS heritage is still evident in its regimental motto \\"Qui Ose Gagne\\" (\\"Who Dares Wins\\") and in the awarding of the RAPAS Wings, reminiscent of the wartime SAS \\"Operational Wings\\" that can only be awarded to 1er RPIMa operators after they have successfully passed a series of strict selection requirements, including operational deployments. = 1945-1974 = Between 1945 and 1954 the unit that was later to become the 1er RPIMa after a series of name changes, took part in the war in Indochina, performing several of the more than 160 combat jumps carried out by French paratroopers during that conflict. After the war, the regiment underwent structural changes and became a training depot for the entire colonial airborne forces. As such, it did not take part in the Algerian conflict. In 1960 1er RPIMa was created. It continued in the training role until 1974, when the 1er RPIMa was transformed into a Special Forces unit, a role it still plays today. = 1974-2006 = The unit's mission has been mostly to support France's interests in Africa. Between 1974 and 1981, the 1er RPIMa underwent another mission change to focus on long-range reconnaissance patrols for almost a decade, while it still used its training skills to training friendly forces abroad. In the 80s and 90s the regiment deployed dozens of times to various hotspots on the planet. While engaged in Operation Desert Storm, the 1er RPIMa lost two of its men in Iraq in 1991. A year later, the creation of the French Special Operations Command (Commandement des Op√©rations Sp√©ciales, COS) led to a major shake-up of French special forces units to incorporate the lessons learned in the First Gulf War. As part of this process, in 1997, the nucleus of what was to become the army's BFST (Brigade des Forces Sp√©ciales Terre) (Land Special Forces Brigade) was created and the 1er RPIMa became its core unit. All the while, the regiment participated in operations in the Balkans and in Africa; it was specifically involved in stalking war criminals in Bosnia, leading to several successful arrests of individuals indicted for war crimes.  Today  Shoulder insignia Part of the French Army Special Forces Command (COM FST), the 1er RPIMa is a modern, highly skilled and experienced Special Forces unit organized along company lines. The main strength of the regiment lies in its three RAPAS companies (RAPAS meaning Airborne Reconnaissance and Special Action) each specialised in a specific field such as HAHO/HALO, Counter-Terrorism, amphibious, jungle, mountain or motorized patrols operations and its RAPAS Signal company dedicated to the C3 (Command, Control and Communications) support of Special Operations. The 1er RPIMa also fields a Training and Operations company tasked with providing selection, basic and continuation training of the unit's manpower and a Logistics company which supports the regiment in its daily and operational missions. = Unit specialization = * CTLO (Counter-terrorism and hostage rescue teams (InvEX)'Contre-Terrorisme et Lib√©ration des Otages') * GDC (Bodyguards Garde du Corps) * THP (Snipers Tireurs Haute Pr√©cision) * RCO (Paratrooper ‚Äì Rapas Chuteurs Op√©rationnels) * PRS (motorized patrols Patrouilles de Reconnaissances Speciales(PAT-SAS)) * RPO (Combat divers Rapas Plongeurs Offensifs) * Mountain, arctic, desert, and jungle warfare * Explosives and demolitions  Organisation and structure  Due to its long history with the British Special Air Service much of the 1er RPIMa core aspects are based upon the British SAS. Each company specialises in a particular area such as maritime, air and parachuting operations, mobility. * Four main RAPAS (Airborne Reconnaissance and Special Action) combat companies:  1e Compagnie (Paratroopers HAHO, HALO / combat divers/ Urban warfare, counter-terrorism and bodyguards)  2e Compagnie (mountain, arctic, desert and jungle warfare)  3e Compagnie (motorized patrols)  4e Compagnie (recon, acquisition, training) There is also one command and logistics company and a training and operations company which is in charge of providing the selection, initial and continuation training. Each company is split in RAPAS sections. Each section includes 30 men. The 1er RPIMa is based in Bayonne, which makes amphibious and mountain training possible. It is also ideal as it is very close to the Centre d'Entrainement Adaptee (CTA), Europe's largest and most modern Close Quarter Battle (CQB) facility and to the dedicated assets of the French army's Special Forces Aviation Detachment (DAOS) and airborne school (ETAP), two establishments that are essential to its training and operations.  Weapons and equipment  The main weapon used by the 1er RPIMa is the HK416 5.56x45mm assault rifle. Besides this, SIG 550, M4 and FN SCAR assault rifles are also used by French Army Special Forces. Sometimes M203 or HK69 grenade launchers are also used. For CQB the MP5 series and FN P90 are used as the main weapons, the 10.4 inches version of the HK416 is also sometimes used. The Glock 17 and H&K; USP are the standard sidearm carried by the soldiers. The ARWEN 37 mm grenade launcher is used in CQB work to launch CS gas into buildings. The Benelli M4 shotgun is also used during CQB, to take down doors. FN Minimi is used as light machine gun, 5.56mm and 7.62mm, and snipers use the HK417 or Hecate II rifles. Sometimes MILAN missiles have been used in combat to provide fire support. They wear standard French camouflage and webbing, except when doing CT/HR/CQB work. CQB kit includes a black balaclava, black nomex coveralls, non-slip boots, special webbing and holsters, medical kit for teams medics, gas masks, and special communications equipment. VPS Panhard VPS (V√©hicule Patrouille SAS), based on the Mercedes- Benz 270 CDI G-Class 4x4 light tactical vehicle, is the vehicle used by French Army Special Forces. It is a rapidly deployable vehicle capable of long- duration missions in extremes of climate. An armored floor provides anti- landmine protection to the crew and VPS is air transportable by C-160 Transall or C-130 Hercules. In the French Army the VPS is equipped with 360¬∞ ring-mount over the rear body which is armed with a Browning 12.7mm heavy machine gun or Gatling machine gun. One more 7.62mm machine is mounted on swivel station at the front of the crew compartment which is operated by the vehicle commander.  Skills  The 1er RPIMa is tasked with several jobs. These include: bodyguard for VIPs in conflict areas, direct action, reconnaissance, sabotage, unconventional warfare and hostage rescue. While their name states they are Marine Infantry, they are in fact Army. The 1er RPIMa relies on a number of skills to successfully carry out its missions. Most skills are either regiment or brigade-specific and need constant honing to be kept at the desired level of proficiency. They can be divided into several generic fields: * The RAPAS (Airborne Reconnaissance and Special Action) basic skills  RAPAS skill training is given to enlisted men and NCOs after they have completed a series of organic and basic regimental courses  Basic training leading to the first rung of the RAPAS ladder is the elementary RAPAS technical certificate, which takes six months to earn.  RAPAS training covers all the basics of special forces functions and is complemented by specific courses (marking out drop zones (DZ) and landing zone (LZ), basic and advanced close quarters combat, sniping‚Ä¶)  A RAPAS group is led by a senior non-commissioned officer or a lieutenant. NCOs are generally former enlisted men who rose from the ranks of the regiment, while officers come from various specialized schools (mostly Infantry, Armour and Engineer) before following a specific course complemented by on-the-job training.  When fully qualified and operational, a RAPAS team member reaches the rank of Caporal-chef (Master Corporal), and has been in the regiment for five years and spent more than two thirds of that taking classes, has been deployed in real-world operations, probably once a year. * Air insertion  Parachute operations: each member of the regiment is static-line parachute qualified using some specific low-altitude (125 meters) dropping techniques. The 1er RPIMa can also field different teams proficient in both HAHO and HALO techniques. Each company has HALO capability.  Helicopter operations: Fast-roping and helicopter rappelling, special purpose infiltration and extraction rigs, LZ marking, special operation procedures, helicopter fire support, helicopter-borne sniper support, light helicopter insertion and extraction  Air delivery: the 1er RPIMa is unique in the way it has integrated air delivery component with teams able to rig and airdrop light to heavy loads and pallets in support of special operations from cargo aircraft of dedicated special operations division of the French air force. * Amphibious operations  Open circuit breathing apparatus: the 1er RPIMa can field a complete open air circuit (scuba) team for beach recce or riverine operations using light crafts, including kayaks  Closed circuit breathing apparatus: the 1er RPIMa can field a complete closed circuit team for covert underwater missions. This team is not a combat diver team; its purpose is to use waterways as another infiltration method. * Motorised operations  True to their SAS ancestors, the 1er RPIMa has always maintained a motorized patrol capability. It currently centres on PATSAS patrols that are tasked with developing and refining the methods and equipment needed for such operations. In addition to the PATSAS, each RAPAS company fields several motorised RAPAS groups. The mounts of motorised patrols are modified Peugeot P4s, Mercedes VPS and ACMAT VLRA trucks, all fitted with machine guns, automatic cannons, mortars, AGLs or ATGWs.  The Special Recce Patrols (PRS): Having understood with time and experience that it is always better to act on intelligence which had been gathered and analyzed by operators that intimately know which method of operation would be best used by the action groups, the 1er RPIMa has decided to include in its specialized teams the PRS concept. The PRS are infiltrated ahead of the action teams and provide real time intelligence on the target area. The information gathered by the PRS is then transmitted by a variety of secure means to the command level which then disseminates it to the action groups. * Counter Terrorism  The 1er RPIMa can field several CT teams, all backed by specialized sniper teams proficient in calibers ranging from 5.56 mm to 12.7 mm (.50 cal)  All ranks of the company are CT trained  The Regiment benefits from proximity to the Centre d'Entra√Ænement Adapt√© (CTA), Europe's largest and most modern CQB facility (CQB = Close Quarters Battle or Killing House). The CTA is located in Pau and offers unmatched live firing capabilities for all sorts of CT scenarios.  The CQB skills are kept honed to a high level thanks to regular training in the CTA and cross training with French and Allied CT units. * Bodyguard teams  The 1er RPIMa has been involved in bodyguard duties for the last 25 years.  The Regiment only provides Bodyguard teams to high-ranking officials at theater level.  A fully qualified RAPAS team member is also Bodyguard qualified * Jungle, desert and mountain operations  So as to prepare RAPAS units of the 1er RPIMa for operations over difficult terrain it can use French and foreign training centers on the world  Mountain, jungle and desert training exercises are scheduled every year  RAPAS team members are sent regularly as permanent instructors to jungle and desert schools in French Guyana or friendly African countries  Every year, the Regiment sends some of its members to foreign schools to improve its tactics and procedures in hostile environments (jungle, bush‚Ä¶)  A regular influx of experienced NCOs volunteering from the French 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade keeps the Regiment up-to-date on modern mountaineering techniques  Selection and training  Officers and NCOs joining the regiment have to attend the same selection and training as enlisted personnel. Enlisted soldiers in the French Army can try to join super RPIMA, between their first and third years of active duty. First step is a profile selection: Candidates will be selected regarding unit requirements and personal file (e.g. if the regiment needs some mountain specialists, they will ask for more mountain troopers to come for the selection). Candidates selected must attend the two weeks basic airborne training prior the SF training, for those who are not already enlisted in an airborne regiment. Second step of selection is \\"adaptation training\\" and \\"stage commando\\" lasting twelve weeks. Candidates must be above average to continue the training. Most cases of failure and RTU occur during this phase. The last step of selection is the \\"stage CTE RAPAS\\" lasting six months. After completion of this \\"stage\\", candidates are fully assigned to the regiment as special force soldier. They will attend additional training to become specialists (bodyguards, pathfinders, etc.)  Traditions  = Anniversary of the Troupes de Marine = The anniversary is celebrated of fighting in Bazeilles, a village which was taken and abandoned four consecutive times under orders, on August 31 and September 1, 1870. ; Et au Nom de Dieu, vive la coloniale !

At age 35, he was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, where he would serve for 19 years. His most enduring legacy perhaps lies in his role in the establishment of the College of Law at the University of the Philippines. Background Acacia fraternity. Born in Concord, Michigan, Malcolm obtained his degree in law from the University of Michigan in 1906. While at the university, he was among the founding members of the Acacia fraternity. Following his graduation, Malcolm proceeded to the Philippines, which was then a colony of the United States. Malcolm served in several minor positions in the colonial government, starting as a clerk in the Bureau of Health, then subsequently in the Bureau of Justice. He rose quickly in rank, and by 1911, he was acting attorney- general for the Philippines.Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Vol. I, p. 84 Establishment of the U.P. College of Law U.P. Diliman campus. It was through Malcolm's efforts that the first English language law classes were established in the Philippines. The Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines had initially resisted Malcolm's proposal for the establishment of a law college within the University. Malcolm thus arranged for the Manila YMCA to offer law courses, which commenced in 1910. Malcolm acted as the Secretary of these law courses. Within a year, the Board of Regents relented and the University of the Philippines adopted these classes by formally establishing the College of Law on January 12, 1911.American Colonial Careerist, p. 96 Supreme Court Associate Justice Sherman Moreland had initially been designated as the acting dean of the college, while Malcolm was appointed as the College Secretary. Almost immediately, Moreland turned over his office to Malcolm, who served as acting dean while the University tried in vain to recruit American law professors to become the permanent dean of the college.American Colonial Careerist, p. 97 While there was some resistance in the idea of appointing Malcolm as the first permanent Dean of the College of Law, Malcolm was finally appointed to the post on October 11, 1911. Malcolm served as dean for the next six years. He also taught courses in constitutional law and in legal ethics. Three students who graduated during his deanship would eventually become Presidents of the Philippines ‚Äî Jos√© P. Laurel, Manuel Roxas, and Elpidio Quirino. Several other of Malcolm's students would later serve in the Supreme Court, including also Laurel, who would actually succeed to Malcolm's seat on the Supreme Court in 1936. Following the relocation of the university campus to Diliman, Quezon City after World War II, the building that housed the College of Law was named \\"Malcolm Hall\\" after Malcolm, a name that is carried as to this day. Supreme Court Justice In 1917, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Malcolm to sit on the Philippine Supreme Court. At age 35, he was the youngest person ever appointed as Justice to the High Court. He would serve in the Court until 1936, when he was forced to retire upon the enactment of the 1935 Constitution, which limited Supreme Court membership to Filipinos. Upon his retirement after 19 years, Malcolm had written 3,340 opinions for the Court.American Colonial Careerist, p. 139 Several of Malcolm's opinions for the Court remain influential to date. In Villavicencio v. Lukban, 39 Phil. 778 (1919), he spoke for the Court in granting the writ of habeas corpus to counter the deportation of prostitutes to Mindanao as ordered by Manila mayor Justo Lukban. In Villaflor v. Summers, 41 Phil. 62 (1920), Malcolm wrote that a judicial order compelling a woman to submit to a physical examination to determine if she was pregnant did not violate the constitutional proscription against self-incrimination. In Borromeo v. Mariano, 41 Phil. 329 (1921), and Concepcion v. Paredes, 42 Phil. 499 (1921), Malcolm authored opinions that shielded the members of the judiciary from the diminution of their powers by legislative action. In Alejandrino v. Quezon, 46 Phil. 83 (1924), the Court through Malcolm ruled it had no power to reverse the suspension of a senator by his colleagues in the Senate. In Government v. Springer, Malcolm refused to affirm the law that granted the Senate President and Speaker of the House the right to vote shares in a government corporation, citing that such authority did not fall within the functions of the legislature. Malcolm's opinion would be affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States upon appellate review, 277 U.S. 189 (1928), though the dissent therein of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. proved more memorable in time, with its eloquent pronouncement that \\"[t]he great ordinances of the Constitution do not establish and divide fields of black and white. Even the more specific of them are found to terminate in a penumbra shading gradually from one extreme to the other.\\" Baguio City Baguio City 2017 Malcolm's majority opinion in Rubi v. Provincial Board, 33 Phil. 660 (1919), remains controversial to date. The Court therein affirmed a provincial government resolution directed at the Mangyan ethnic minority, requiring the confinement of members of \\"non- Christian tribes\\" to a specially created reservation. Likening the plight of the Mangyan to that of Native Americans, the Court classified the Mangyan as \\"wards of the Filipino\\". \\"By the fostering care of a wise Government, may not these unfortunates advance in the \\"habits and arts of civilization?\\" Would it be advisable for the courts to intrude upon a plan, carefully formulated, and apparently working out for the ultimate good of these people?\\" In Baguio housing the summer quarters of the Supreme Court, the city square on Session Road near the public market is named Malcolm Square in his honor, and a bronze bust of Malcolm is located in the square.

Career After spending two years with the Philadelphia Quakers, Hallman attempted to jump to the Philadelphia Athletics of the Players' League. When the Quakers sought a legal injunction against the move, the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas refused to enforce Hallman's contract with the Quakers. The court pointed out that the contract was so one-sided (allowing the team to dispense with Hallman for virtually any reason) that it was unenforceable. Although he was primarily a second baseman, he did eventually play every position on the diamond, including one game as a pitcher in . In 1897, Hallman was a player- manager for the St. Louis Cardinals. Hallman was 13-46 as a manager; he served as the third of four managers in a disastrous 29-102 season. Though a handful of players of Hallman's generation also made appearances in theater, most of them were brief parts with little dialogue. Author Jerrold Casway wrote that Hallman and Mike Donlin were the only two ballplayers who could have traded in their baseball careers for careers in theater. Hallman last appeared in the major leagues in 1903, but he continued playing or managing in the Western League or South Atlantic League through 1909. Hallman's nephew Bill played in the majors for four seasons as an outfielder. Post-career Hallman died at his Philadelphia home of heart disease after being sick for about four months.

Stage set by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781‚Äì1841) for an 1815 production \\"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\\" (\\"Oh, don't tremble, my dear son\\") is the first aria performed by the Queen of the Night (a famous coloratura soprano role) in Mozart's singspiel The Magic Flute (Die Zauberfl√∂te). It is not as well known as the Queen's second aria, \\"Der H√∂lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\\", though no less demanding; the aria requires a soprano coloratura with extremely high tessitura and great vocal flexibility. Significance The role of Queen of the Night demands a range that until Mozart's time was almost never called for, and this opened the door for later composers to call for specific kind of singers (lyric, dramatic, coloratura etc.), rather than just \\"soprano\\", \\"tenor\\" etc. The part, in whole, includes two arias, O zittre nicht and Der H√∂lle Rache. The first calls for a rather lyric and flexible voice while the second requires a dramatic and powerful voice. Originally, the part was written for Josepha Hofer, the composer's sister-in-law, whose voice possessed both of these qualities. Most modern performers are specialists in either lyric or dramatic style. This, along with the difficulty of the two arias, makes the role of the Queen of the Night one of the most demanding in operatic repertoire. Context in the opera In the preceding scene, Prince Tamino was shown a portrait of the Queen's daughter Pamina and fell instantly in love with her, singing of his feelings in the aria \\"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch√∂n\\". The Queen then makes a dramatic entrance, preceded by the Three Ladies calling to Tamino \\"Sie kommt! Sie kommt!\\" (\\"[Here] she comes!\\"). The grand entrance music for the Queen is in B-flat, marked Allegro maestoso, with the following stage direction: :The mountains [in the scenery] are parted, and the stage is transformed into a magnificent chamber. The Queen is seated on a throne adorned with shining stars.Dover edition (1985, 41). Original German: \\"Die Berge teilen sich auseinander, und das Theater verwandelt sich in ein pr√§chtiges Gemach. DIE K√ñNIGIN sitzt auf einem Thron, welcher mit transparenten Sternen geziert ist.\\" (Source: NMA edition, linked below) Not all modern productions adhere to this prescription. In the aria, the Queen first quiets Tamino's fears and attempts to befriend him, then tells the sad, although misleading, tale of Pamina's abduction by Sarastro, and finally makes a stirring plea to Tamino to rescue her daughter. As the aria ends, the Queen and the Three Ladies leave the stage, leaving the astonished Tamino to ponder his task and gather his resolve. A performance takes about five minutes. Libretto The verse to which the aria was set was written by the opera's librettist Emanuel Schikaneder. Schikaneder was the impresario for whom the opera was written as well as the first performer of the role of Papageno. O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn, du bist unschuldig, weise, fromm Ein J√ºngling so wie du, vermag am besten, dies tiefbetr√ºbte Mutterherz zu tr√∂sten. Zum Leiden bin ich auserkoren, denn meine Tochter fehlet mir. Durch sie ging all mein Gl√ºck verloren, ein B√∂sewicht, ein B√∂sewicht entfloh mit ihr. Noch seh' ich ihr Zittern mit bangem Ersch√ºttern, ihr √§ngstliches Beben, ihr sch√ºchternes Streben. Ich mu√üte sie mir rauben sehen. \\"Ach helft! Ach helft!\\" ‚Äì war alles was sie sprach allein vergebens war ihr Flehen, denn meine Hilfe war zu schwach. Du, du, du wirst sie zu befreien gehen, du wirst der Tochter Retter sein! ja! du wirst der Tochter Retter sein. Und werd' ich dich als Sieger sehen, so sei sie dann auf ewig dein. Oh, don't tremble, my dear son! You are innocent, wise, pious; A youth like you is best able to console this deeply troubled mother's heart. I am chosen for suffering For my daughter is gone from me; Through her all my happiness has been lost, A villain, a villain fled with her. I can still see her trembling with fearful shaking, her frightened quaking, her timid effort. I had to see her stolen from me. \\"Oh help! Oh help!\\" ‚Äì was all that she said But in vain was her pleading, For my powers of help were too weak. You, you, you will go to free her, You will be my daughter's savior. Yes, you will be the rescuer of my daughter. And if I see you return in triumph, Let her then be yours forever. There are five quatrains, of which the third is written in amphibrachic dimeter and the remaining ones in iambic tetrameter, which is the normal meter for The Magic Flute. Mozart repeats the words \\"ach helft!\\" (\\"Oh, help!\\") and \\"Du\\" (\\"you\\", three times), so the lines with these words are not iambic tetrameters as they are actually sung. The rhyme scheme is [AABB][CDCD][EEFF][GHGH][IJIJ]. Music The soprano soloist (vocal range: D4 to F6) performs with an orchestra consisting of pairs of oboes, bassoons, horns, and strings. The three parts of the Queen's discourse are set as musically separate items, each marked by a change in key: # Recitative (B-flat major) ‚Äì continues the Allegro maestoso tempo marking of the entrance music, but often performed in free tempo # First part of the aria (G minor) ‚Äì Andante # Second part of the aria (back to B-flat major) ‚Äì Allegro moderato It is in the third part that the music reaches a high level of virtuosity for the soloist, including the following very difficult coloratura: 500px It can be seen that Mozart aligned the text (dann) to give the singer the most sonorous and singable vowel \\"a\\" for most of the passage. The highest note, F6 in scientific pitch notation, is claimed by a posthumous witness to have been mentioned by Mozart on his deathbed; the composer was (if the story is true) imagining his sister-in- law's performance. See Death of Mozart. Critical opinion While countless audiences have enjoyed hearing skilled sopranos navigate the difficult coloratura passage, Spike Hughes detects a more significant purpose in Mozart's writing: > The coloratura, which is never overdone for a moment in this aria, has a > tremendous dramatic impact. It is not intended as a display of a singer's > vocal prowess but of the Queen's character and as [in] Die Entf√ºhrung ... > coloratura is often synonymous in Mozart's mind with resolution and > anger.Hughes, Spike (1972) Famous Mozart operas.

Biography Jin Meyerson grew up in rural Minnesota, adopted into a Jewish- Swedish family, before pursuing his education in fine arts. He received his BFA from Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1995, and his MFA from Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1997. Meyerson has shown work internationally in several exhibitions and galleries including High Cholesterol Moment at Zach Feuer Gallery in New York, The Triumph of Painting at the Saatchi Gallery in London and at Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin in Paris. With a disposition for large scale painting of high detail, the work draws varied responses from critics, claiming to recognize a wide range of influences, and identifying Meyerson's underlying ambition \\"to hold his own with the big guns\\". The work has been termed \\"hybrid fiction, born from photojournalistic fact\\". Meyerson is represented by Emmanuel Perrotin in Paris. His exhibition Progress is No Longer a Guarantee opened at Galerie Michael Janssen on September 2007. with the catalogue Jin Meyerson - 2001-2007 also published in 2007 by Snoeck Verlag. Later solo exhibitions include There is no way out. But always a way through in 2008 at Galerie Nordine Zidoun in Luxembourg, Forecast in 2009 at the Arario Gallery in Seoul, and Carpal Fatigue in 2010 at the Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin. Meyerson's work has been included in a variety of group exhibitions in 2010‚Äì2011 taking place in New York, Paris, Tokyo and Singapore. His work is held in public and private collections around the world, among them the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, New York; Saatch Gallery, London; and Yuz Foundation, Jakarta. Interpretation Jin Meyerson‚Äôs paintings are schizophrenic semi-abstractions based on throwaway images from magazines and other random pieces of visual culture. Although the use of media imagery is common ground for many contemporary painters, Meyerson‚Äôs take on the topic is more manic than most; while artists such as Ulrich Lamsfuss, Johannes Kahrs and Gerhard Richter are more concerned with the faithful ‚Äì almost obsessive ‚Äì copy, Meyerson‚Äôs takes his source material as a sketch which he can distort, tear apart, rearrange and fill with psychedelic colour. Meyerson does not completely destroy or obscure the images, but by the end of his more-or-less unplanned interventions the painting‚Äôs origin is severely disguised. Most of Mayerson‚Äôs work displays his fascination with moving images, but for him a moment of speed or activity caught on film is not enough; the addition of swirling bands of striking colour add to the sense of motion to create something that functions beyond the limits of painting and photography, making the viewer ‚Äòfeel‚Äô the energy of the image and invoke the spectacle of real life action when the moment itself is long over.

About DiGiorno manufactures over 250,000 pizzas each day for consumers for national sale in the mainland United States. Total revenue from pizza sales in 2017 was just over $1 billion. The DiGiorno product line originally offered pastas and sauces in 1991, and pizzas have been available internationally in Canada and the U.S. since 1995. The brand's slogan is \\"It's not delivery. It's DiGiorno/Delissio,\\" which suggests that their frozen pizzas are of high enough quality that they might be mistaken for fresh pizzeria pizzas. DiGiorno rebranded to Delissio in Canada in 1999, although Kraft had previously used the Delissio brand for other pizza products in the 1980s. In 2010, Kraft sold the DiGiorno and Delissio brands, along with the rest of its frozen pizza business, to Swiss-based food manufacturer Nestl√©. The move helped to finance Kraft's bid for Cadbury, while also effectively ensuring that Nestl√© would not submit a competing bid for the confectionery company. Since Nestl√© acquired Kraft's frozen pizza business, the DiGiorno brand has expanded to include bonus appetizers in a box, including breadsticks, boneless chicken pieces called Wyngz, and Toll House cookies. In 2013, DiGiorno's dairy supplier, Foremost Farms USA, dropped Wiese Brothers Farm after the animal rights organization Mercy for Animals released undercover footage showing workers there beating, dragging, and whipping dairy cows, some of which appear unable to walk, while others have infected or freely bleeding wounds.

It is also the name of a popular tourist destination based on the novel. Local Status of Mount Huaguo Journey to the West In the novel, this mountain is located in the country of Aolai (ÂÇ≤‰æÜ) in the Eastern Continent of Superior Deity (), also known in Anthony C. Yu's translation as the \\"P≈´rvavideha Continent\\". It is known as the birthplace of Sun Wukong (the Monkey King), a protagonist of the novel. The large mountain has many demons and monkeys in its population and contains many hidden areas, such as the Shuilian Cave. After Sun Wukong bravely rushes through a large waterfall and into this cave, every individual in the mountain acknowledges him as their king. After Sun Wukong becomes king, this mountain becomes exceedingly civilized and well-trained for various future conflicts, such as war. This can be seen in the fact that Sun Wukong often left this mountain for various reasons, including his eventual task of protecting the Tang monk Tang Sanzang on his journey to India. Due to the natural and civilized ways of this mountain set by Sun Wukong, this mountain continues to thrive even after 500 years of conflict. Location Mount Huaguo is located in Yuntai, Jiangsu, seven kilometers southeast of Lianyungang City. It lies 625 meters above sea level and covers an area of 84.3 square kilometers, with 136 peaks. The area is a popular tourist attraction as a result of its appearance in the novel Journey to the West. Tourism Mount Huaguo is a popular tourist attraction, especially because of its role in the novel Journey to the West. It has over 100 scenic spots and thousands of visitors every year. Since the novel is very influential and popular in China, the mountain has many statues based on its heroes, such as a sculpture of the head of Sun Wukong (the Monkey King), a protagonist of the novel, who was also said to be born on the mountain. Near the entrance stand sculptures of the four main characters, along with 109 stone monkeys welcoming visitors as they enter and six stone lions guarding the mountain. Other attractions related to Sun Wukong include the Monkey Stone, Water Curtain Cave, Sanyuan Palace, Yuvu Peak, South Gate of Heaven, etc. =Monkey Stone= The \\"Monkey Stone\\" resembles a monkey from a distance. Because of this, people like to relate the stone with the Sun Wukong, who rules and protects his home just as the stone monkey seems to protect Mount Huaguo. =Water Curtain Cave= Water Curtain Cave, or Shuilian Cave (), is a natural waterfall over a cave that was formed by a ground fissure. There are many ancient carvings in front of the cave, with letters written by emperors from different dynasties. For example, \\"Âç∞ÂøÉÁü≥Â±ã\\" was written by the Daoguang Emperor during the Qing dynasty. Inside, there are tunnels leading to a platform inside the cave. There is a spring inside called Lingquan Spring; it is not big, but it is always full of water, even when there is a drought. It is said that the spring can lead you to the Dragon King's Palace. The cave is featured within the novel Journey to the West, written in the Ming Dynasty. Very early on, Sun Wukong becomes the king of this cave, and it is generally used for all the monkeys to train within and generally rest. Before such an event, Wukong, with his bravery, nominated himself to be the monkey that would rush through the Mount Huaguo's great waterfall in order to see what was behind it. He discovered :Emerald moss piled up in heaps of blue, :White clouds like drifting jade, :While the light flickered among wisps of coloured mist. :A quiet house with peaceful windows, :Flowers growing on the smooth bench; :Dragon pearls hanging in niches, :Exotic blooms all around. :Traces of fire beside the stove, :Scraps of food in the vessels by the table. :Adorable stone chairs and beds, :Even better stone plates and bowls. :One or two tall bamboos, :Three or four sprigs of plum blossom, :A few pines that always attract rain, :All just like a real home. Following this, Wukong :took a good, long look and then scampered to the middle of the bridge, from where he noticed a stone tablet. On the tablet had been carved in big square letters: HAPPY LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT, CAVE HEAVEN OF THE WATER CURTAIN (Chinese: Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±Á¶èÂú∞„ÄÅÊ∞¥Â∏òÊ¥ûÊ¥ûÂ§©). The stone monkey was beside himself with glee. He rushed away, shut his eyes, crouched, and leapt back through the waterfall.'' After many points following this, Sun Wukong returned to the Water Curtain Cave for miscellaneous reasons, either while returning from his celestial master, or because of an issue with his enlightened master, Sanzang. =San Yuan Palace= San Yuan Palace is the biggest building in Mount Huaguo, and one of the most ancient. It was initially built during the Tang dynasty. It contains three statues that represent the three gods of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

He was an apologist author of two books, Westbourne Grove Sermons and The Trades and Industrial Occupations of the Bible, published by the Religious Tract Society.  Influence  Lewis co-founded the London Baptist Association (within the Baptist Union of Great Britain) along with Charles Haddon Spurgeon and several other pastors. He was instrumental in urging James Hudson Taylor to publish China's Spiritual Need and Claims. His influence on both of these men is noteworthy. Spurgeon was encouraged by this fellow Baptist preacher, while he was beginning his ministry at the age of 19. Taylor, who was a member of Lewis' congregation, had lectured about the need for missionary work to be done in China, and as a result of compiling his lecture material into a book form, hundreds of missionaries were inspired to follow him back to China in the 1800s. Lewis was Taylor's pastor during the formative time of the China Inland Mission in 1865, and continued in support of the work, acting as a referee for the agency in 1872.Broomhall (1984), 449 Lewis was undoubtedly closely associated with the Anti-Opium Campaign led by another member of his congregation, Benjamin Broomhall, who sought to end British trade in the drug in China. The Broomhall children, too, grew up under the influence of this man, including author and missionary Marshall Broomhall. Lewis, speaking at the ceremony of laying the first stone of the new Metropolitan Tabernacle for the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon, which took place on Tuesday 16 August 1859, said the following. > I feel constrained to address my brethren in the ministry also to hear the > appeal which God in his providence makes to them, to be faithful, > uncompromising, simple, and bold in their declaration of gospel > truths.Spurgeon (1860) > > ‚ÄîWilliam Garrett Lewis In January 1881, Lewis was appointed to the pastorate of Dagnall Street Baptist Church.

Early life Flatley was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and graduated from St. Norbert College. He was a 1929 United States Naval Academy graduate who earned his wings in 1931. An early squadron assignment found him with Patrol Squadron 4 (VP-4F), flying Douglas PD and Consolidated P2Y flying boats. In December 1941 he was with Fighting Squadron 2 (VF-2) flying the Brewster F2A Buffalo, the Navy‚Äôs first monoplane fighter. World War II At the opening of hostilities in December 1941, Flatley was serving aboard . However, his squadron did not see combat in the early raids, as VF-2 was beached from 25 January 1942 in order to transition from the F2A Buffalo to the Grumman F4F Wildcat. Their place, in the meantime, was taken by the Grumman-equipped Fighting Squadron 3 (VF-3). In late April, 1942, just prior to the Battle of the Coral Sea, Flatley was dispatched to with orders to take command of Fighting Squadron 42 (VF-42). However, on arrival, he discovered that his academy classmate, Lieutenant Commander Charles R. Fenton, had already been appointed CO by the ship's captain. After a few days, the issue was sorted out: Fenton was recognised as VF-42's commander, and Flatley was ordered back to the United States to form a new fighter squadron. However, he managed to get permission to stay for the coming battle, and was thus retained as VF-42's executive officer. On 7 May, Flatley led a group of Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters to escort Douglas TBD Devastator from VT-5 in the attack that sank light carrier Sh≈çh≈ç. His group then engaged several Mitsubishi A5M fighters from Sh≈çh≈ç's Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and he managed to down one of them. In response to sinking of Sh≈çh≈ç, Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) main carrier force launched a night strike on USN carriers composed of 15 Nakajima B5N and 12 Aichi D3A bombers. Flatley led one of the groups of F4F Wildcats that were sent to intercept (another group was led by Lieutenant Commander Paul Ramsey from VF-2). The enemy strike force suffered heavy losses. The following day, on 8 May, he was involved in CAP that protected USN carriers. His group engaged several Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and he claimed one shot down, although no Zeros were actually lost in the engagement. After Coral Sea, he returned to the United States to form Fighting Squadron 10 (VF-10), flying F4F Wildcats. The squadron was nicknamed the \\"Grim Reapers,\\" and as commanding officer Flatley became \\"Reaper Leader\\" on board . During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, Flatley led several F4F Wildcat fighters to escort Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers from VT-10 in a strike on IJN carriers. While USN and IJN strike forces passed each other, A6M Zeros from Zuih≈ç led by Lieutenant Moriyasu Hidaka abandoned their escort duty and attacked USN aircraft. In the following fight, several TBF Avengers and F4F Wildcats were shot down, as well as several A6M Zeros. Flatley received one shared kill credit in this engagement. The strike force he was escorting could not locate the main IJN carrier force and instead attacked a cruiser instead. Flatley and his F4F Wildcats strafed it in order to support the torpedo planes, but all torpedoes missed the target. Later that day, his division of four F4F Wildcats encountered A6M Zeros from Jun'y≈ç strike force at higher altitude and deployed Thach Weave defensive tactics when they attacked. One of the attackers was Lieutenant Yoshio Shiga, who gave up after he made several runs. During the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 15 November 1942, Enterprise launched a strike force against the damaged battleship Hiei and Flatley's group of Wildcats provided escort. After returning to Enterprise, Flatley led a second strike force against IJN transports with reinforcement and supplies headed for Guadalcanal. His group then landed on Guadalcanal and performed another CAP before turning over their aircraft to Marines at Henderson Field. Following his tour as Commander Air Group Five (CAG-5) on board , during which he helped introduce the F6F Hellcat to combat in August 1943, Flatley at the age of 36 never flew combat again.\\"Naval Aviation News 2/2004\\" Commander Flatley as Commander Air Group 5 (CAG-5) in his F6F-3 Hellcat on the flight deck of USS Yorktown (CV-10) before takeoff during the Marcus Island raid on 31 August 1943. This raid was featured in the 1944 film The Fighting Lady. He received a Navy Cross for Coral Sea; two Distinguished Flying Crosses for heroism, a Bronze Star for action with Japanese forces in the Philippine Islands, and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Post war Flatley remained in the Navy after the war and became a key figure with the Navy's postwar air-training program. After commanding the escort aircraft carrier for a year, Flatley became deeply involved with assessing naval aviation's disastrous safety record and ultimately helped develop the Naval Aviation Safety Center, today's Naval Safety Center. After the war he was training director of the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi, Texas Air Station; commander of the Naval Air Station Olathe in Olathe, Kansas (which was renamed \\"Flatley Field\\" from 1962‚Äì1969); and commander of the Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia followed by command of the carrier . He also held various staff positions. He retired from the Navy on June 2, 1958 and was promoted to vice admiral concurrent with his retirement. He died barely a month after his retirement at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 9, 1958\\"Vice Admiral James H. Flatley, Jr., U.S. Navy\\", Biographies in Navy History, Naval History and Heritage Command. http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/flatley_jamesh.htm Retrieved on September 27, 2012. and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two days later. Tactician During the attack on the Sh≈çh≈ç, Flatley observed numerous torpedo and dive bombers wasting their ordnance on an already finished carrier, instead of diverting to other intact ships. Based on this observation, he later proposed that a designated strike coordinator be assigned during future operations to assign targets. Flatley criticized the practice of launching numerous small strikes piecemeal, as happened at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, since he felt strongly that one large force could accomplish much more than several small ones. Flatley ‚Äî along with John S. Thach and Butch O'Hare ‚Äî was instrumental in communicating tactical advice throughout naval aviation, and changing the perception that the F4F Wildcat was inferior to the Japanese Zero. Flatley's belief was that it was superior to the Zero when properly utilized, saying of the Wildcat: \\"Let us not be too critical of our equipment. It shoots the enemy down in flames and brings most of us home.\\" He was not overly impressed by the Zero, but attributed the Japanese fighter's success to the high quality of Japanese pilots. His writeup on enemy capabilities received favorable notice at senior levels of the U.S. Navy. The expression \\"Thach Weave\\" did not come into the lexicon until Flatley named it in his after action report for the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. He recounted how Lieutenant Commander John S. Thach‚Äôs \\"beam defense tactic\\" had allowed him to escape almost certain destruction during the battle. Flatley wrote: \\". . . the four-plane division is the only thing that will work, and I am calling it the Thach Weave.\\" Flatley later received a commendation for his bravery in retrieving wounded personnel after the carrier was hit by kamikazes on May 11, 1945.

Career In 168 games pitched (82 as a starter and 86 as a reliever), Moret posted a career win‚Äìloss record of 47‚Äì27 and an earned run average of 3.66. He notched 24 complete games, five hits and 12 saves. He allowed 656 hits and 339 bases on balls in 723 innings pitched, with 408 strikeouts. Moret led the American League in winning percentage in both 1973 (.867) and (.824). On August 21, 1974, he hurled a complete-game, one-hit shutout against the Chicago White Sox. An infield single by Chicago slugger Dick Allen in the seventh inning spoiled the no-hitter bid. Moret walked two hitters and fanned 12. Moret was a member of the 1975 American League champion Red Sox. After winning 14 of 17 decisions during the regular season in 36 games (including 16 starts), he appeared in four postseason contests. In the ALCS, he was the winning pitcher in relief of Reggie Cleveland in Game 2 against the Oakland Athletics, hurling a scoreless sixth inning and earning the victory when Boston broke a 3‚Äì3 tie in their half of the frame. Then, in the 1975 World Series, Moret worked in three games, including the legendary Game 6. He held the Cincinnati Reds scoreless in 1 innings pitched, although he allowed two hits and three bases on balls, one of those intentional. He was traded to the Braves for Tom House a little more than seven weeks after the conclusion of the Fall Classic on December 12, 1975.

It was completed in 1594. It was burned down in 1939 when the Germans were retreating from the eastern bank of the San River and the ruins were destroyed by the Nazis in 1941. The stone building was rectangular in shape, typical of the renaissance style of the time. The rectangular main hall remained the only section of the original building after a range of outhouses were added in later years. They included a yeshiva, two additional halls of prayer and offices. History The first legal regulation regarding the Jewish community of Przemy≈õl dates from March 20, 1559. The privilege, granted by King Zygmunt August, stipulates that \\"Jews have been living on the Jewish street in Przemy≈õl for a long time\\" have the right to settle permanently in Przemy≈õl and grants them trading rights. Jews were now considered under the royal jurisdiction, i.e. the waywode's court, (which is mentioned in acts of the year 1576 as the \\"Jews' court\\"). It appears from a lawsuit of the year 1560 that the Jews then possessed a wooden synagogue, said to have been founded by two wealthy Spanish immigrants. In 1561 the synagogue was attacked by the burghers. A year later in 1592, permission to build a Fortress synagogue from stone in place of the old synagogue was granted by the chapter. The new building was designed by Bononi, an Italian builder of fortifications. It was completed in 1594 and situated within the city, close to its defensive walls and made up part of the city's defence structures. The entire ghetto including \\"Jewish Street\\" in Przemy≈õl was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1637. The synagogue however remained unscathed. In 1661 the king issued a decree allowing the Jewish community to use the synagogue as collateral to borrow money. This illustrates the desperate economic situation of the Przemy≈õl Jewish community. In 1746 Jesuit students attacked the Jewish quarter, looting Jewish homes. They plundered the synagogue and demolished its interior. The Holy Ark was destroyed and the Torah scrolls were torn up into pieces which were scattered in the streets. They also destroyed the greater part of the valuable archives, which contained priceless documents of the waywode's court. Only a few of the original copies of the privileges were saved. The extent of the damage is indicated by the fact that after tedious negotiations the Jesuits finally paid an indemnity of 15,000 Polish gulden. According to statistics of the year 1765, there were at that time about 2,418 Jews in Przemy≈õl. During the years 1910-1914 the building was restored under direction of architect Tadeusz Mok≈Çowski. At the end of March 1919, a festive prayer service was held at the synagogue in honour of the Paris Peace Conference and its decision regarding Land of Israel. Many people took part in the prayer. In 1934 the building was listed on the register of historical buildings and in 1936 a special committee, led by H. Klagsbald, was established to renew and renovate the \\"Great Synagogue\\". Destruction In September 1939, after the invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union, Przemy≈õl was divided by the German-Soviet border which ran through the middle of the city along the San River. When the Red Army entered the city on 26 September, the town centre found itself in the Soviet Union while the Zasanie district, on the western bank of the San River, was within the borders of the Nazi empire. In accordance with the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, the Germans left the eastern bank on 28 September 1939. Before their withdrawal the Germans burned down the Old Synagogue. In 1956 the city authorities ordered the demolition of the synagogue which had laid in ruins since 1941 when the Nazis destroyed what remained after their earlier attempt to obliterate the building. The demolition was carried out despite objections from conservationists who had plans to rebuild the synagogue.

In June 2012 he announced his intention to retire with effect from the end of September. Views on sexuality Since issues of sexuality (particularly homosexuality) are the topic of endless debate and simmering acrimony in the Anglican Communion at present, Harper's election to the primacy immediately drew media interest to his views on these questions; previous interviews were given new scrutiny. Several commentators concluded that he is personally liberal but willing to be bound by more traditional views as long as the Church of Ireland has not as a whole signaled a desire for change.

Tired of one-night stands and sharing quarters with others, she sets out to find her own apartment, stopping in to a realtor‚Äôs office. There, she meets Paulot, a timid real estate clerk, who is immediately smitten by her. She invites him to see her perform in the small role she has as a maid in a boulevard comedy. After the play, Nina takes Paulot for dinner with her current boyfriend Fred, but the couple has a major row, breaking off their relationship. Paulot invites Nina to stay at his apartment while she finds her own place, but his roommate, Quentin, refuses to let her stay. They have to settle for a hotel room for the night. In their long walk through the city, she tells Paulot that she has slept with nearly every man she has encountered. She complains to him that she is tired of being used solely for easy sex and asks him to leave her alone. Quentin, however, has followed them to the hotel: he forces his attentions on Nina. Nina and Quentin then begin an intense and violent liaison. An actor who performs in a live sex show version of Romeo and Juliet, Quentin is unpredictable and provocative. Nina bounces between the two vastly different men: the gentle Paulot and the dangerous and intense Quentin. Nina has an approach/avoidance conflict with Quentin, all the while fending off offers by Paulot to take care of her. When he finds that she has slept with Quentin, Paulot starts to change his calm manners towards Nina, but he does not lose his craving for her. Quentin is run over and killed by a car, in what seems to be a suicide. The only other person attending his funeral is the elderly theater director, Scrutzler, who eventually explains that in London he had cast Quentin as Romeo, but Quentin had withdrawn after he survived a suicide pact with Scrutzler‚Äôs daughter, with whom he had a passionate love affair. During casting of Romeo and Juliet, Scrutzler recognizes Nina among the aspiring actresses for the role and cast her as Juliet. Full of self-doubt and fear, stimulated by the ghost-like appearances of the dead Quentin, Nina prepares for the role and copes with Paulot‚Äôs advances. They share an apartment, but have settled for a platonic relationship. However, Paulot is still in love with Nina and is jealous of Scrutzler's interest on her. Paulot confronts Scrutzler, but in spite of the director's assurance that his interest in her is only of a paternal nature, Paulot leaves Nina. Nina struggles to rehearse her role as Juliet in the forthcoming play but, after Paulot leaves her, realizes that he is the one she is really in love with. Nina goes to his work looking for him and entices him to make love to her. They have sex for the first time, in a violent and degrading coupling. Nina then insists in going for a long nocturnal walk, like the one they had the first time they met. She gives him a ticket for the coming opening night of Romeo and Juliet, but after he leaves her, Paulot tears up the ticket, reaffirming his decision to break away from her. Nina, nervously preparing for her entrance, suffers stage fright. Scrutzler calms her down, but then leaves for London, deciding she must continue on her own.

It is the ninth numbered game in the original Mega Man series (Or tenth game overall when including Mega Man & Bass). Mega Man 9 is the first home console game in the original Mega Man series since Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, which were released at least one decade earlier. Mega Man 9 was the first game in the series not to have a physical release, and was initially released only on the downloadable gaming services WiiWare, PlayStation Network (PSN), and Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA). In June 2017, it was announced that Mega Man 9 and 10 would have a physical release with their inclusion in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, along with a digital version released for Nintendo Switch in May 2018. Taking place during the early 21st century, Mega Man 9 continues the adventures of the android hero Mega Man. When destructive attacks by powerful robots begin occurring all over the world, Mega Man's creator, the good-hearted Dr. Light, is blamed. Mega Man's arch enemy, the evil Dr. Wily, claims to be uninvolved in the incidents. It is up to Mega Man to stop the robots, prove his creator's innocence, and reveal Wily's true intentions. Mega Man 9 uses the classic 2D side-scrolling gameplay on which the series is based. Using both action and platforming elements, the player must complete a series of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating each stage's \\"Robot Master\\" boss copies its unique weapon, which the player can select at will throughout the remainder of the game. Although the game was developed for modern consoles, Mega Man 9 features familiar 8-bit visuals and audio similar to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as a \\"retro\\" throwback to the earliest entries in the franchise. According to its producers Keiji Inafune and Hironobu Takeshita, the development team intentionally made the graphics, sound, and gameplay of Mega Man 9 as simple as possible to adhere to the likeness of the fan and critical favorite Mega Man 2, released in 1988. Mega Man 9 was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews from the press. The game's popularity prompted Capcom to create a sequel, Mega Man 10, which also utilizes a simple, 8-bit style. Plot Like previous entries in the series, the fictional events of Mega Man 9 take place during the 21st century (\\"20XX\\"). Dr. Light, the creator of the world's greatest android hero Mega Man, is blamed when several old and outdated models of \\"Robot Masters\\" he created suddenly go on a destructive rampage. Mega Man's nemesis Dr. Wily has no apparent connection to it. After showing a news video of Light declaring planetary domination and Wily refusing to follow him, Wily announces that he needs monetary donations to complete the robots he built to combat those of Dr. Light. Mega Man vows to fight to prove his creator's innocence and expose Wily's true intentions. After Mega Man begins combating the eight Robot Masters‚ÄîConcrete Man, Splash Woman, Magma Man, Hornet Man, Jewel Man, Tornado Man, Plug Man, and Galaxy Man‚ÄîLight is soon arrested. During the victory over the fourth Robot Master, a piece of scrap metal is left behind, revealing that the robot was shortly due for recycling. Mega Man eventually picks up the last Robot Master's memory chip, which is analyzed to reveal Dr. Wily vowing to help the robots survive this expiration date and ultimately reprogramming them. However, before the information can become public, Wily swoops in using his flying saucer and steals the chip. Mega Man breaks into Wily's robot city, which is guarded by powerful robots Wily built with the crowd's donations. Mega Man fights and defeats Wily, who immediately begs for forgiveness, at which point Mega Man scolds Wily by reminding him of all his begging from all previous main Mega Man series games. Mega Man then discovers that Wily was responsible for arresting Dr. Light, and that Light has fallen ill. However, Mega Man's ally Proto Man comes in and warns the hero that it is a trap, stating that the seemingly ill scientist is an impostor previously used by Wily to make the initial news video. Mega Man then takes his chances with Light and the impostor shocks him; Wily escapes while he is disabled. When the fortress comes down on him, Proto Man returns quickly to save him. In the end, Dr. Light is freed, and the status quo is restored. The eight Robot Masters are rebuilt and given new functions working alongside Light and his other robots. Gameplay Mega Man battles mini-boss Hanabiran in Hornet Man's stage. The game features the same graphics and gameplay of NES-era Mega Man games. Mega Man 9 is an action-platform game in which the player controls the titular character and must complete a number of 2D side-scrolling stages. The start of the game presents a select screen of eight stages from which the player can choose to complete in any order desired. Within each stage, the player advances by running, jumping, avoiding traps, shooting enemies and mini-bosses, and ultimately battling the Robot Master boss at the end. Mega Man begins with a \\"Mega Buster\\" arm-cannon weapon, but as each boss is defeated, a unique weapon is added to his arsenal. Because each Robot Master is weak to a specific weapon, the player may strategize the order in which the stages are cleared. The player also begins the game with the option to call on Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a \\"Coil\\" springboard for jumping higher or a \\"Jet\\" for traversing long distances in the air. Mega Man's health, his special weapons, and his Rush options are all limited by energy gauges that can be refilled by picking up items found throughout each level. Special screws can also be picked up and used to buy items at Auto's shop between stages. These items include extra lives, tanks that refill energy, and one- time-use items that call on Mega Man's companions Eddie and Beat for help. Using the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2 as the main inspiration for the gameplay in Mega Man 9, several significant features from previous games were left out. Specifically, Mega Man lacks the ability to slide along the ground and the ability to charge up his Mega Buster for more powerful shots. Aside from using or omitting various elements from past games in the series, Mega Man 9 introduces a time attack mode and 50 optional challenges where certain requirements should be met to be accomplished. These range from defeating a boss using only the Mega Buster to clearing the entire game without taking any damage. Downloadable content for all three versions of the game was made available for purchase during October 2008. Proto Man can be downloaded as an alternate playable character. Proto Man is able to slide, can charge up his buster, and takes double the damage of Mega Man, among other differences. Additional downloadable add-ons include higher difficulty modes, an endless stage, and a special stage featuring a new boss, Fake Man. This downloadable content was included in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, requiring the player to complete the game or enter a secret code.Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 is available now! -Capcom Unity Development Mega Man 9 was co-developed by Capcom and Inti Creates. The latter company had developed the Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX spin-off series and employs many former Capcom members who worked on previous Mega Man games. The first six games in the original Mega Man series were created for the NES during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A plethora of spin-off series, related games, and compilations were published by Capcom as a result of the original series' immense popularity. The most recent entries in the main series, Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, were first released on more advanced home consoles in 1996 and 1998 respectively. Keiji Inafune, a designer, artist, and producer at Capcom, has been involved in most of franchise's development. As early as 2004, Inafune, credited as \\"Inafking\\", publicly expressed his desire to make a Mega Man 9 as a \\"throwback to the super old school\\", but that its creation would highly depend on the input of fans. According to Inafune, the simple fun of a classic Mega Man game \\"doesn't fit into the grandiose and expansive world that the consumer gaming industry has become, and so you have to make games that match the current expectations\\". He also believed that pushing for the creation of a Mega Man in the style of the original \\"would be quickly criticized for things like being simplistic, outdated, or too expensive\\", thus making it too difficult to develop such games in the current climate. Inafune cited the rise of retrogaming services like Nintendo's Virtual Console for allowing the development team to put together Mega Man 9. Not only does the game carry the gameplay and storyline elements of older games, Mega Man 9 is a return to the series' roots, as the graphics and music resemble how their original games looked and sounded on the NES's 8-bit hardware. Inafune felt that the \\"time was right\\" for choosing this style of game to please its fans. Capcom's management was supportive in making Mega Man 9 downloadable, but they wanted the game to be 3D instead of 8-bit as they thought the latter would only appeal to Mega Man fans. The team additionally discussed giving players the option to choose between 8-bit and current generation styles. However, the idea for solely using 8-bit eventually won out. The staff was concerned with surpassing Mega Man 2 rather than Mega Man 8, as the second installment in the series tends to receive the most critical praise. Producer Hironobu Takeshita referred to Mega Man 9 as \\"the new Mega Man 3\\" in this regard. The development team that worked on Mega Man 9 consisted of about 20 people total. Takeshita explained that although Inti Creates used their previous experience to create the gameplay, the technical aspects like the graphics and sound, were more difficult to finetune. As the team had a tendency to make these attributes complex, Inafune would often scold them to simplify their work and \\"bring it back to the basics\\". Rather than use NES technology, Mega Man 9 runs on a new, proprietary engine that simulates the behavior of 8-bit video games. The game even includes \\"Legacy Mode\\", which emulates the low video processing power of the NES by partially rendering sprites, thus causing them to flicker when too many are on screen simultaneously. The developers also considered distributing the game on NES cartridges, but without technology to bridge the gap between the cartridges and current gaming hardware, the idea was scrapped. Takeshita clarified that Mega Man 9 is much too large to actually fit on an NES cartridge. Inafune designed both Plug Man and Splash Woman, while the artists at Inti Creates created the remaining six Robot Masters. Plug Man was used as an example to guide the younger designers in making characters with simple yet unique features. The idea for Splash Woman, the first female Robot Master of the original series, was requested by the planning team. Hornet Man was originally conceived as another female Robot Master named \\"Honey Woman\\" before being changed to a male after Inafune presented his design of Splash Woman. =Audio= The musical score and sound effects for Mega Man 9 were composed by Ippo Yamada, Ryo Kawakami, Yu Shimoda, and Hiroki Isogai. Yamada, a veteran composer for Capcom at this point, worked \\"with a sense of nostalgia\\", while the younger designers had to study and imitate the older games. Sound director Yu Shimoda analyzed the audio of the NES Mega Man games for several months before beginning the project. Yamada insisted that the game contains no actual NES music, but rather the \\"spirit of NES music\\", as no such hardware restrictions were present as they had been during the development of the first six games. Most of the tracks were created with the quality of these past games in mind, but only a handful actually reference songs from previous games. Character and levels designs were \\"fundamental to the process of generating the music\\". Computers running Music Macro Language were used to produce the game's sound effects. Yamada explained that taking away the sound of charging up the Mega Buster allowed for many more sound waves that it would have obscured or blocked out. Still, as a spiritual successor to Mega Man 2, layers of background music were deliberately designed to drop out when simultaneously heard with certain sound effects as they did in that game. Release Capcom officially announced Mega Man 9 during July 2008. Official details were first confirmed via the magazines Weekly Famitsu and Nintendo Power, revealing that the title would be appearing on the Nintendo Wii as a WiiWare title. It was initially slated to be exclusive to WiiWare, with earlier reports of Microsoft's XBLA and Sony's PSN editions being denied by Capcom. Gaming sites like IGN confirmed it for PSN and XBLA shortly thereafter. Various regions including North America, Japan, Europe, and Australia saw releases of the game between September 2008 and June 2009. A mobile phone incarnation of Mega Man 9 was also released in Japan in late 2010. The North American promotional artwork for the game, designed by Gerald de Jesus of iam8bit, was meant to be reminiscent of the domestic cover art for the original Mega Man game. According to Capcom employee Chris Kramer, the marketing group felt that if they were going to release a game that graphically resembled one that came from 1987, it would be best to have the marketing campaign reflect that. T-shirts bearing the artwork were created for Inafune and Takeshita to wear at the game's official debut at the Electronic Entertainment Expo during the summer of 2008. The T-shirts were later made available to the public via Capcom's online store. A \\"limited edition\\" press kit, intended for members of the media, using that same cover art was then created by iam8bit. Being as faithful to the original 1987 release as possible, the iam8bit crew disassembled one-thousand vintage NES cartridges and inserted mini CDs inside. Though the CDs do not contain the actual game, they feature an array of screenshots, artwork, and game information. That was then packaged in a custom-created, classic-looking NES box, complete with shrink-wrap and bargain bin price tags. The press kit was also put on sale at Capcom's store. To help promote the game in Japan, Capcom released merchandise including \\"E-Tank\\" energy drinks and two CD soundtracks. The Rockman 9 Original Soundtrack was released on September 12, 2008. The soundtrack, consisting of the game's 35 music tracks, includes a booklet with liner notes written by the Inti Creates sound team, as well as artwork and information on the eight Robot Masters. The Rockman 9 Arrange Album was released on October 10, 2008. This album features remixes of the game's songs arranged by Yamada, his team, and several guest composers from past entries in the Mega Man series. Reception and legacy Mega Man 9 has received mostly positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites. The WiiWare, XBLA, and PSN versions of the game currently hold aggregate percentages of 83, 82, and 77 respectively on Metacritic. 1UP.com gave the game a B+, praising its old- school aesthetic and challenge. IGN gave the game an 8.6/10 and awarded it with an \\"Editor's Choice\\" award across all platforms and praised it for \\"having some of the best level design in the series\\". The Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game 90% noting that \\"it will keep you busy for hours\\" and \\"screams retro\\". It did mark it down because \\"it might be too frustrating\\". However, Edge gave the game a score of six out of ten. The magazine responded positively to the game's enemy design, though criticized the game for trying to fit into the \\"retro cool category\\" and being not as good as the previous games. The WiiWare version of Mega Man 9 has received additional recognition from various publications. In Nintendo Powers \\"Game of the Year\\" section, Mega Man 9 was scored as the best WiiWare game of 2008 by both readers and staff. It was nominated for \\"Best Platforming Game for the Wii\\" by IGN in its 2008 video game awards. It was also nominated for \\"Best Wii Game\\" and \\"Best Downloadable Console Game\\" on GameSpot's \\"Best of 2008\\". Gaming Target selected it as part of their \\"40 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2008\\" feature. IGN has considered Mega Man 9 as one of the top 15 WiiWare games available. In 2011, IGN listed Mega Man 9 as the 5th-best WiiWare game and the 14th-best PSN game of all time. Although no financial figures for Mega Man 9 have been released, Christian Svensson (Capcom's Vice President of Business Development) debunked all sales rumors shortly after its launch, stating that the company was \\"cautiously optimistic\\" about its performance on WiiWare. Both Svensson and Capcom's Seth Killian stated months later that the company was \\"definitely happy\\" with the sales of the game. Inafune also expressed his satisfaction with the game's success, proclaiming that it far exceeded their expectations. A follow-up game, Mega Man 10, was released in March 2010 for WiiWare, PSN, and XBLA. This sequel also features retro-style graphics, audio, and gameplay. Mega Man 9 was later released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as part of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, which also made a slight change of allowing the player to unlock all of the former downloadable content.

It refers to the situation of large numbers of people in developing countries and some people in developed countries whose well-being is negatively affected by very low consumption of energy, use of dirty or polluting fuels, and excessive time spent collecting fuel to meet basic needs. It is inversely related to access to modern energy services, although improving access is only one factor in efforts to reduce energy poverty. Energy poverty is distinct from fuel poverty, which focuses solely on the issue of affordability. According to the Energy Poverty Action initiative of the World Economic Forum, \\"Access to energy is fundamental to improving quality of life and is a key imperative for economic development. In the developing world, energy poverty is still rife. Nearly 1.1 billion people still have no access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)\\". As a result of this situation, a new UN initiative has been launched to coincide with the designation of 2012 as the International Year for Sustainable Energy for All, which has a major focus on reducing energy poverty. Duke University has launched a research project on Household Energy and Health where work on energy poverty in India is listed. http://www.dukeenergyhealth.org/research/implications-of-energy-poverty-in- india/ Kumar, R. (2011) \\"Implications of \\"Energy Poverty\\" of the Poor in India.\\" Duke Household Energy and Health Initiative Domestic energy poverty Domestic energy poverty refers to a situation where a household does not have access or cannot afford to have the basic energy or energy services to achieve day to day living requirements. These requirements can change from country to country and region to region. The most common needs are lighting, cooking energy, domestic heating or cooling.Krauss, Alexander. 2016. How natural gas tariff increases can influence poverty: Results, measurement constraints and bias. Vol. 60. Energy Economics. Lack of access to electricity is one indicator of energy poverty. Other authors consider different categories of energy needs from \\"fundamental energy needs\\" associated to human survival and extremely poor situations. \\"Basic energy needs\\" required for attaining basic living standards, which includes all the functions in the previous (cooking, heating and lighting) and, in addition energy to provide basic services linked to health, education and communications. \\"Energy needs for productive uses‚Äù when additionally basic energy needs the user requires energy to make a living; and finally \\"Energy for recreation\\", when the user has fulfilled the previous categories and needs energy for enjoyment.\\" Sanchez T; The Hidden Energy Crisis, 2010 Practical Action Publishing 2010 Until recently energy poverty definitions took only the minimum energy quantity required into consideration when defining energy poverty, but a different school of thought is that not only energy quantity but the quality and cleanliness of the energy used Stoppok, M., Jess, A., Freitag, R., Alber, E.; Of culture, consumption and cost: A comparative analysis of household energy consumption in Kenya, Germany and Spain, Energy Research & Social Science, Volume 40, June 2018, Pages 127-139, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.12.004 should be taken into consideration when defining energy poverty. One such definition reads as: :\\"A person is in 'energy poverty' if they do not have access to at least: :(a) the equivalent of 35 kg LPG for cooking per capita per year from liquid and/or gas fuels or from improved supply of solid fuel sources and improved (efficient and clean) cook stoves :and :(b) 120kWh electricity per capita per year for lighting, access to most basic services (drinking water, communication, improved health services, education improved services and others) plus some added value to local production An 'improved energy source' for cooking is one which requires less than 4 hours person per week per household to collect fuel, meets the recommendations WHO for air quality (maximum concentration of CO of 30 mg/M3 for 24 hours periods and less than 10 mg/ M3 for periods 8 hours of exposure), and the overall conversion efficiency is higher than 25%. ‚Äù Major energy sources Rural areas are predominant in mostly developing countries, and the rural areas in the countries do not have modern energy infrastructure. They have heavily relied on traditional biomass such as wood fuel, charcoal, crop residual, wood pellets and the like. Because lack of modern energy infrastructure like power plants, transmission lines, underground pipelines to deliver energy resources such as natural gas, petroleum that need high or cutting edge technologies and extremely high upfront costs, which are beyond their financial and technological capacity. Although some developing countries like BRICs have reached close to the energy-related technological level of developed countries and have financial power, still most developing countries are dominated by traditional biomass. According to the International Energy Agency IEA, \\"use of traditional biomass will decrease in many countries, but is likely to increase in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa alongside population growth.\\" UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology. \\"Access to energy in developing countries,\\" December 2002 Number 191. Energy poverty projects involving renewable sources can also make a positive contribution to low-carbon development strategies. Energy ladder An energy ladder shows the improvement of energy use corresponding to an increase in the household income. Basically, as income increases, the energy types used by households would be cleaner and more efficient, but more expensive as moving from traditional biomasses to electricity. \\"Households at lower levels of income and development tend to be at the bottom of the energy ladder, using fuel that is cheap and locally available but not very clean nor efficient. According to the World Health Organization, over three billion people worldwide are at these lower rungs, depending on biomass fuels‚Äîcrop waste, dung, wood, leaves, etc.‚Äîand coal to meet their energy needs. A disproportionate number of these individuals reside in Asia and Africa: 95% of the population in Afghanistan uses these fuels, 95% in Chad, 87% in Ghana, 82% in India, 80% in China, and so forth. As incomes rise, we would expect that households would substitute to higher quality fuel choices. However, this process has been quite slow. In fact, the World Bank reports that the use of biomass for all energy sources had remained constant at about 25% since 1975.\\" Esther Duflo, Michael Greenstone and Rema Hanna. \\"Indoor air pollution, health and economic well- being,\\" SAPIENS, 2008 : Vol.1 / n¬∞1 Energy price increases and poverty Energy tariff increases are often important for environmental and fiscal reasons ‚Äì though they can at times increase levels of household poverty. A 2016 study assesses the expected poverty and distributional effects of an energy price reform ‚Äì in the context of Armenia; it estimates that a large natural gas tariff increase of about 40% contributed to an estimated 8% of households to substitute natural gas mainly with wood as their source of heating - and it also pushed an estimated 2.8% of households into poverty - i.e. below the national poverty line. This study also outlines the methodological and statistical assumptions and constraints that arise in estimating causal effects of energy reforms on household poverty, and also discusses possible effects of such reforms on non-monetary human welfare that is more difficult to measure statistically.Krauss, Alexander. 2016. How natural gas tariff increases can influence poverty: Results, measurement constraints and bias. Vol. 60. Energy Economics. Health issues Usually, gathering energy resources in the developing countries in particular sub Saharan countries is undertaken by women. And women spend much time on cooking in a kitchen. They spend much time on harvesting energy resources and thus correspondingly consume their physical energy, which bring chronic fatigue to women. Moreover, the women and children, who spend much time in their kitchens to serve their families and stick around their moms to help moms' house chores, respectively, are in danger of long-term exposure to indoor air pollution caused by burning the traditional biomass. During the combustion, carbon monoxide, particles, benzene, and the likes threat their health. Expected diseases are acute respiratory infections, lung cancer, asthma, and other diseases. \\"The health consequences of using biomass in an unsustainable way are staggering. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to indoor air pollution is responsible for the nearly two million excess deaths, primarily women and children, from cancer, respiratory infections and lung diseases and for four percent of the global burden of disease. In relative terms, deaths related to biomass pollution kill more people than malaria (1.2 million) and tuberculosis (1.6 million) each year around the world.\\" Rice University Jame A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy: The Baker Institute Energy Forum, \\"Poverty, energy and society.\\" Energy and Education There is a clear link between energy poverty and education. 90 percent of children in sub-Saharan Africa go to primary schools that lack electricity. In Burundi and Guinea only 2% of schools are electrified, while in DR Congo there is only 8% school electrification for a population of 75.5 million (43% of whom are under 14 years). In the DRC alone, by these statistics, there are almost 30 million children attending school without power. In September 2013 a Lifeline Energy intern undertook research in Lusaka, Zambia to discover if there was a link between energy access and education. Energy and development ‚ÄúEnergy provides services to meet many basic human needs, particularly heat, motive power (e.g. water pumps and transport) and light. Business, industry, commerce and public services such as modern healthcare, education and communication are highly dependent on access to energy services. Indeed, there is a direct relationship between the absence of adequate energy services and many poverty indicators such as infant mortality, illiteracy, life expectancy and total fertility rate. Inadequate access to energy also exacerbates rapid urbanization in developing countries, by driving people to seek better living conditions. Increasing energy consumption has long been tied directly to economic growth and improvement in human welfare. However it is unclear whether increasing energy consumption is a necessary precondition for economic growth, or vice versa. Although developed countries are now beginning to decouple their energy consumption from economic growth (through structural changes and increases in energy efficiency), there remains a strong direct relationship between energy consumption and economic development in developing countries.\\" UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology. \\"Access to energy in developing countries,\\" December 2002 Number 191. Government intervention and difficulties Energy is important for not only economic development but also public health. In the developing countries, governments should make efforts on reducing energy poverty that have negative impacts on economic development and public health. The number of people who currently uses modern energy should increase as the developing world governments take actions to reduce social costs and to increase social benefits by gradually spreading modern energy to their people in rural areas. However, the developing world governments have been experiencing difficulties in promoting the distributions of modern energy like electricity. In order to build energy infrastructure that generate and deliver electricity to each household, astronomical amount of money are first invested. And lack of high technologies needed for modern energy development have kept the developing countries from accessing modern energy. Such circumstances are huge hurdles; as a result, it is difficult that the developing countries governments participate in effective development of energy without external aids. International cooperation is necessary for framing developing countries' stable future energy infrastructure and institutions. Although their energy situation have not been improved much over the past decades, current international aids are playing an important role in reducing the gap between developing and developed countries associated with the use of modern energy. With the international aids, it will take less time to reduce the gap when comparing to nonexistence of international cooperation. International cooperation China and India which account for about one third of global population are growing fast economically and other developing countries would grow economically and in population too. As a result, their energy demand increases much more than now. As the dissemination of modern energy sources in the nations is not effectively progressing, but population in the developing world is growing rapidly. Without a new approach, more people in the developing countries will have difficult to access modern energy services. International development agencies have experienced that many of international society‚Äôs attempts have not been entirely successful. ‚ÄúInternational cooperation needs to be shaped around a small number of key elements that are all familiar to energy policy, such as institutional support, capacity development, support for national and local energy plans, and strong links to utility/public sector leadership. Africa has all the human and material resources to end poverty but is poor in using those resources for the benefit of its people. This includes national and international institutions as well as the ability to deploy technologies, absorb and disseminate financing, provide transparent regulation, introduce systems of peer review, and share and monitor relevant information and data.‚Äù =European Union= There is an increasing focus on energy poverty in the European Union, where in 2013 its European Economic and Social Committee formed an official opinion on the matter recommending European focus on energy poverty indicators, analysis of energy poverty, considering an energy solidarity fund, analysing member states' energy policy in economic terms and a consumer energy information campaign. In 2016 it was reported internationally how several million people in Spain live in energy poverty, causing deaths and also anger at the electricity suppliers' artificial and \\"absurd pricing structure\\" to increase their profits. =Global Environmental Facility= \\"In 1991, the Work Bank Group, international financial institution that provides loans to developing countries for capital programs, established the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to address global environmental issues in partnership with international institutions, private sector, etc., especially by providing funds to developing countries‚Äô all kinds of projects. The GEF provides grants to developing countries and countries with economies in transition for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants. These projects benefit the global environment, linking local, national, and global environmental challenges and promoting sustainable livelihoods. GEF has allocated $10 billion, supplemented by more than $47 billion in cofinancing, for more than 2,800 projects in more than 168 developing countries and countries with economies in transition. Through its Small Grants Programme (SGP), the GEF has also made more than 13,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totalling $634 million. The GEF partnership includes 10 agencies: the UN Development Programme; the UN Environment Programme; the World Bank; the UN Food and Agriculture Organization; the UN Industrial Development Organization; the African Development Bank; the Asian Development Bank; the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; the Inter-American Development Bank; and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.

The SCF serves as an overarching fund to support targeted programs with dedicated funding to pilot new approaches with potential for scaled-up, transformational action aimed at a specific climate change challenge or sectoral response. One of SCF target programs is the Program for Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries (SREP), approved in May 2009, and is aimed at demonstrating the economic, social and environmental viability of low carbon development pathways in the energy sector by creating new economic opportunities and increasing energy access through the use of renewable energy.\\" Climate Investment Funds See also *Agency for Non-conventional Energy and Rural Technology *Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy *Energy for All *Indian Solar Loan Programme *International Renewable Energy Agency *Renewable energy in Africa *Renewable energy in China *Renewable energy in developing countries *Solar for All *Solar power in South Asia *Solar powered refrigerator *SolarAid *Sustainable Energy for All *UN-Energy *Wind power in Asia *Gaspar Makale  References   External links  * Alliance for Rural Electrification - a not-for-profit business association which promotes access to energy in developing countries * Household Energy Network (HEDON) - NGO promoting household energy solutions in developing countries * Lifeline Energy - a not-for-profit organisation that provides renewable energy alternatives to those most in need in sub-Saharan Africa * - Paper on energy poverty of the poor in India * GatesNotes 2016 Annual Letter * Energizing Finance reports - Supply and demand for finance for electricity and clean cooking * Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Category:Energy policy Category:Renewable energy commercialization Category:International development Category:Poverty Category:Aid Category:Development economics Category:Humanitarian aid ","title":"Energy poverty"},{"id":"8856921","text":"Jingle bells as a musical instrument Sleigh bells Tuned chromatic sleigh bells, range F4-F6 A jingle bell or sleigh bell is a type of bell which produces a distinctive 'jingle' sound, especially in large numbers. They find use in many areas as a percussion instrument, including the classic sleigh bell sound and morris dancing. They are typically used as a cheaper alternative to small 'classic' bells. The simplest jingle bells are produced from a single piece of sheet metal bent into a roughly spherical shape to contain a small ball bearing or short piece of metal rod. This method of production results in the classic two- or four-leaved shape. Two halves may also be crimped together, resulting in a ridge around the middle. A glass marble may also be used as the ringer on larger bells. History Bells of this type were developed centuries ago from the European crotal bell for fastening to harnesses used with horses or teams of horses. The History of Sleigh Bells, retrieved 28 Nov 2014 Typically they were used for horse-drawn vehicles, such as carriages and sleighs. The bell was designed to make a jingly sound whenever the horse and thus the vehicle was in motion. The purpose was perhaps to herald the approach of someone important, or likely to warn pedestrians of the vehicle's approach so that they might step aside to avoid collisions and potential injuries. This was especially important for sleighs, which otherwise make almost no sound as they travel over packed snow, and are difficult to stop quickly. This instrument was also used for fun by children in games and songs. Uses Jingle bells are commonly used on Christmas decorations or as Christmas ornaments themselves, or hung around the neck like a necklace. They can also be strung onto a heavy wire and bent into a wreath shape, usually with a metal bow.

It was first described in 1848 from a specimen collected in Cumbria and has since been found at a number of other sites in Britain, mainly in the west. It was thought to be endemic to the island but is now also known to occur in Spain. It is about 4-7mm long and black with white bristles giving it a mottled appearance. For many years it was considered to be a variant of the related species Procas armillatus which is very similar. It is usually found in woodland clearings at sites where its only known foodplant climbing corydalis (Ceratocapnos claviculata) can be found. The larvae have not yet been discovered but may feed inside bracken stems.  References  * Fowles, A. P.

Early years Burrus was born in North Carolina's Outer Banks, where his family had lived for generations, to sea captain Dozier Burrus and Achsah Williams. When he was eleven, the family moved to Elizabeth City so that he could further his education. It was at Elizabeth City High School that Burrus was first introduced to baseball, playing pitcher and catcher for the school team. On the recommendation of one of his teachers, Burrus finished his high school education at Oak Ridge Academy, where he was eventually named to the school's All-Time Baseball Hall of Fame. Upon his graduation from the Academy, Burrus studied textile engineering at North Carolina State College. His education was partially funded by athletic scholarships, with the remainder paid from the proceeds of his summer and weekend jobs in construction and at the local iron works and dry docks. Burrus interrupted his education for two years to join the United States Army, serving at Camp Gordon in Georgia. He returned to NC State to letter in three sports. Baseball career In 1919, Burrus left college to begin his professional baseball career. He joined the minor league South Atlantic League as a first baseman for the Columbia Comers, and was paid $3000. Two months later, he was signed by Connie Mack to play for the Philadelphia Athletics. Because of inconsistent fielding, Burrus was sent to Columbus in the American Association, before being sold to Atlanta, where he helped win the Southern Association pennant. In 1925, Burrus returned to the majors, playing for the Boston Braves. That season he batted .340 with 200 hits, 41 doubles and 87 RBIs, all career-bests. He also led all National League first basemen in fielding with a .990 percentage in 151 games. Later that year, Burrus suffered a hernia and was never able to play at the same level. His contract was sold to the Indianapolis Indians for $10,000. He helped that team win the AA pennant. He later played for the Houston Buffaloes, and in 1930 was released for good by Atlanta. During his best years, his salary only reached as high as $9000. Post-baseball After his baseball career ended, Burrus returned to his native North Carolina. He served as a county commissioner, and worked as a fish buyer and Texaco distributor until his retirement in 1962. He then moved to Currituck County, North Carolina to live near a hospital. Burrus died of lung cancer in 1972, leaving behind his widow and four children, including daughters Dixie and Mary, and nine grandchildren.

The Wood family moved into the Greek Revival home situated at 12th and State Streets in Quincy, Illinois from an unusual two-story log cabin in 1837. Quincy is the county seat of Adams County. Wood founded both the county (1825) and city (1835). Wood's 14-room mansion was built by John Cleaveland and endured a move from its original site to its current location, about a block east, so Wood could build an even larger mansion. The Greek Revival building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 1970, and in 2007 was named by the Association of Independent Architects one of Illinois' 150 most important architectural structures. The John Wood Mansion features four large Doric columns, which Wood himself turned at a lathe he built for that purpose, four large chimneys and many ornate details inside and out.

The mission of the Buck Institute is to extend the healthy years of life. The Buck Institute is one of nine centers for aging research of the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research. The institute, a nonprofit organization located in Novato, California, began its research program in 1999, making it the world's first institute founded primarily to research aging. It is named for Marin County philanthropists Leonard and Beryl Hamilton Buck, whose estate funded the endowment that helped establish the institute, and the Buck Trust currently contributes approximately $6 million annually to support the institute's work. The campus of the Buck Institute was designed by architect I. M. Pei. In May 2007, the institute established a cooperative agreement with the University of California's Davis and Merced campuses to coordinate stem- cell research. History The Buck Foundation Trust was created by Beryl Hamilton Buck after the death in 1953 of her husband, pathologist Leonard W. Buck. Leonard's father, Frank Buck, was one of the founders of Belridge Oil. When Beryl Buck died in 1975, the bulk of the estate became part of the San Francisco Foundation, about $7.6 million dedicated to \\"charitable purposes in Marin County\\" including, \\"extending help to the problems of aging.\\" The Belridge Oil stock in the trust was bought in 1979 by Shell Oil for $253 million, increasing the trust's value substantially. Attempts by the San Francisco Foundation to use the cy pres doctrine to spend outside of Marin County resulted in litigation which the SF Foundation lost. As part of a 1986 court settlement, the Marin Community Foundation was established to administer the trust, valued in 2013 at approximately $1 billion. The settlement required that 80% of the trust's annual earnings be distributed to causes specific to Marin County. The remaining 20% is to be distributed among three Marin County organizations: *The Buck Institute for Research on Aging *The Buck Institute for Education *Alcohol Justice, formerly named The Marin Institute, which deals with alcohol-related problems. In 2016, the institute began talks with the Gladstone Institutes, a San Francisco-based foundation, regarding a possible research alliance or merger. That discussion ended in October 2016. Facilities The campus of the Buck Institute, as seen from Highway 101. The Institute is on a site located in the foothills of Mount Burdell, north of Novato, California. Of this, a portion is dedicated to permanent agricultural use; another portion is open public space. I. M. Pei, who responded in 1989 to a request to submit a proposal to design the research facility, was selected as the architect for the institute's facility. Pei's master plan called for of laboratory and facility space. The multi-stage plan calls for five interlocking buildings (four laboratory buildings and a support building) around a one-acre hexagonal courtyard, designed to provide a green oasis for quiet contemplation and outdoor activities. Pei used varied geometric elements and floating staircases, which appear throughout both the administrative and research buildings. The second of four research buildings approved in the master plan was completed in 2012. As of 2016, the institute had more than $80 million in bond debt from building its Novato headquarters in 1999 and completing its third building in 2012. It was leasing 27,000 sq ft of its campus to for-profit businesses, including BioMarin, Ultragenyx, Cellular Dynamics, An2H Discovery Limited, and Excel Venture Management. Research Facility of the institute The Buck Institute's research program has ten focus areas related to geriatrics and longevity. The institute had about 250 staff members as of 2017. Buck Institute conducts its research programs through twenty laboratories that focus on specific subjects. After a 12 year dispute with local animal activists, the institute agreed to limit research to animals no higher than rats and mice; many laboratories use no animals at all. As of 2013, about half of the institute's support came from peer-reviewed grants from the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies. Foundations and private donors contributed another 35% of the funding. An endowment from the Buck Trust Fund provided approximately 15 percent of the annual budget. Grant revenue in 2015 was $17.4 million, compared to more than $28 million in 2011. In 2015, California researchers opened the world‚Äôs largest publicly available stem cell bank, with samples stored at the Buck Institute. The initial bank had 300 stem cell lines, with an ultimate goal of 9,000 lines. In 2016, the institute launched a startup, called Unity Biotechnology First Company, aimed at developing medicines to treat age-related diseases and boost healthy lifespans. One drug developed at the institute, rapamycin, is being researched by Mount Tam Biotechnologies, a private company named for Mount Tamalpais, the highest peak in Marin County, with the institute owning significant legal rights to the drug. Leadership The founding president and CEO, Dale Bredesen, now heads the lab focused on Alzheimer's Disease research. In July 2010 he was succeeded by Brian K. Kennedy, who resigned in October 2016.

Her film career spanned much of the silent era, from 1912-1929. Early years Pauline Curley's mother, Rose Curley, brought her into show business at the age of 4, at first on stage in vaudeville shows. In 1910 at 6 years old Rose brought Pauline to New York City to find her work in the newly established silent movie industry and on the stage, getting her bit parts in a variety of movies, as well as weekly stage performances in Uncle Tom's Cabin and Little Lord Fauntleroy for the Jack Packard Stock Company. In 1915 at 11 she appeared on stage in \\"Polygamy\\" at the Park Theatre in New York City. Her mother gave different ages for Pauline depending on the requirements of the role, leaving her confused about her actual age, which she only learned in 1998 when she was 94.  Acting career  Pauline Curley's acting career spanned the period of 1903 starting as a baby and finishing when she was 25 in 1929, after which she retired from acting although she retained a connection to the movie business through her cinematographer husband. = Entry into movies = Curley's first motion picture was Tangled Relations (1912). She played one of the children in a movie which starred Florence Lawrence and Owen Moore. For an audition for The Straight Road in 1914, Pauline was dressed as a boy to land a part as an orphan; a variety of such roles followed, \\"cornering the market in orphans and waifs\\". In 1915 she played the ingenue Claudia Frawley in Life Without Soul, an adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  Personal life  She married cinematographer Kenneth Peach in 1922, taking his last name as Pauline Curley Peach and remaining married until his death in 1988. They were married for nearly 66 years. They had three children, two sons and one daughter. Pauline died a few days short of her 97th birthday.  Move to Hollywood  Her mother took Pauline Curley to Hollywood in 1917 in search of more lucrative work. She soon landed the role of Princess Irina of Russia in Herbert Brenon's The Fall of the Romanovs, her first Hollywood work and, according to Variety, her best known. In 1918 she was a leading lady in five films, including working as the leading lady in King Vidor's first full-length feature, The Turn in the Road. Curley supported Douglas Fairbanks and Tully Marshall in Bound in Morocco (1918). This is a farcical tale of a young American's adventures in Morocco. In 1920 she was featured in The Invisible Hand, a Vitagraph serial with Brinsley Shaw and Antonio Moreno. It was directed by William J. Bauman. This was her first Western, a genre that would henceforth dominate her work. In 1926 Curley played with Helen Chadwick, Jack Mulhall, and Emmett King, in The Naked Truth. It was a film about parents who failed to tell their children about the mysteries of life at the appropriate time. It deals with the consequences.

While their early sound was commonly filed under bluegrass, the group has continually defied expectations, drawing from other influences, such as folk and Americana music. They have released three albums. History Formed in Charlottesville, VA, in 2003, bluegrass sextet King Wilkie boast the talents of Reid Burgess John McDonald, Ted Pitney, Abe Spear, Nick Reeb, and Drew Breakey. Pitney and Burgess dedicated themselves to the genre after attending a festival while at college in Ohio. After relocating to Virginia in 2001 they recruited the remaining members and began work on their 2003 debut, the live and independent True Songs, with their studio debut, Broke, following in 2004. After releasing their 2004 debut album on Rebel Records, Broke, the group was hailed by bluegrass purists as the music's great young hope. Their second album, Low Country Suite, released in 2007 on Rounder Records was a stylistic departure produced by engineer Jim Scott, well known for his work with Rick Rubin, Tom Petty, and the Dixie Chicks. King Wilkie has toured extensively throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe.

In 2008 all members, with the exception of Burgess, left King Wilkie. Burgess attempted to keep the band going with new members and on April 28, 2009, King Wilkie released King Wilkie Presents: The Wilkie Family Singers, an expansive concept album on the newly minted Casa Nueva label which was even a bigger departure from the band's bluegrass roots. Consisting of songs written and recorded by the fictional Wilkie family, it is their most wide-ranging and ambitious project yet.

The theater stands as one of the city's most well-known landmarks, and remains operational today. The theatre is a National Historic Building of Significance featuring the 2,050-seat Kendall Kidd Performance Hall, and the smaller 200-seat Philanthropy Theatre. It hosts Broadway productions, musical concerts, individual performers and the annual Plaza Classic Film Festival. History Prior to the Plaza Theatre being built, there had been a large produce warehouse, belonging to Bernard and Ben Schuster, which occupied the location on Pioneer Plaza. In February 1927, the owner of the principal El Paso theaters, Louis L. Dent, bought the property on Pioneer Plaza with the stated intention of doing something good for the city of El Paso. Upon purchase of the property, he told the El Paso Times, \\"El Paso has been good to me, and I am going to put something everybody will proud of.\\" In 1929, construction of the Spanish Colonial Revival style Plaza Theater began. It was designed by the prolific Dallas architect W. Scott Dunne, who is credited with more than 30 theaters in Texas and Oklahoma. Today the Plaza is recognized as his surviving masterpiece. H. Ponsford & Sons built the theater, and constructed by C.A. Goetting Construction Company. The Plaza was designed as a modern film house in a Spanish Colonial revival style with the flexibility of presenting stage shows. Construction was completed in 1930. The Wurlitzer Company installed a $60,000 pipe organ. It was advertised as the \\"largest theater of its kind between Dallas and Los Angeles.\\" Opening night was on September 12, 1930 with the movie \\"Follow Through\\" to a capacity crowd of 2,410. Although several theaters existed in downtown El Paso at the time the Plaza Theatre opened, its size, elaborate decor, and technical innovations made it stand out. It was advertised as the largest theater of its kind between Dallas and Los Angeles. The Plaza has been a vaudeville or burlesque house as well as also showing movies. The theater featured an \\"atmospheric\\" ceiling complete with twinkling stars which were astronomically correct stars and projections of lazily floating clouds. It was the first public theater in the United States with air conditioning. In 1933, Interstate Theaters purchased the Plaza Theatre. On February 10, 1934, the Plaza's very first stage drama, Richelieu, was performed. The cast included then famous Walter Hampton, Dallas Anderson, John Davenport and Mable More. In 1939, the theater showed Gone With the Wind in two different showings because of Jim Crow laws in El Paso. The first showing was whites only, but a civil rights activist, Betty Mary Goetting, prevailed on the Plaza Theatre to show a midnight screening which African Americans could attend. The midnight show of Gone With the Wind was reported to be \\"packed.\\" In 1949, the Plaza hosted the world premier of the film \\"El Paso,\\" which drew a capacity and star-studded crowd, and also showed Tom Lea's \\"The Brave Bulls.\\" =Decline= By the 1950s, two major influences factored into a slow decline in the Plaza Theatre's patronage. The advent of television and the rise of suburban neighborhoods located farther and farther away from downtown served as major challenges to the Plaza Theatre in addition to other downtown establishments. At the same time, a new source of competition arose with the advent of drive-in theaters in the late 1940s. By the early 1970s, the theater had fallen into disrepair, and was sold. Many of its impressive amenities, including furnishings, artwork, and the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ were auctioned off. The Dipp family, owners of several downtown properties at that time, including the nearby Plaza Hotel, purchased the theater. The Plaza closed on May 31, 1974. In 1985, the state of Texas declared the Plaza Theatre to be a Historical Landmark. It was briefly reopened in 1970 and 1980, only to finally close its doors in 1989. In 1989, after years of infrequent programming, the Dipp family sought to demolish the Plaza Theatre in order to make way for a parking lot. Spurred by a groundswell of community support, the El Paso Community Foundation began negotiations to raise the required $9 million to save the theater from demolition. With only six weeks to raise the funds, fundraising events were held across the community with the most visible effort being staged by actress Rita Moreno the day before the deadline. It was announced that evening that enough money had been raised to save the Plaza Theatre. After the El Paso Community Foundation placed a new roof on the theater, it was donated to the City of El Paso in 1990. Even though this theater was falling, it was still trying to pull itself up. =Reopening= One of the few remaining theaters of its kind in the country, the Plaza had lost most of its original splendor. Furnishings and artwork had been removed, the facade had been altered, and parts of its once-advanced electrical systems were no longer functional, yet the interior structure appeared as it had for close to seventy years. In 2000, a volunteer steering committee, assembled by the El Paso Community Foundation, began to assess the viability of restoring the Plaza Theatre. The committee concluded that the project was feasible, and in 2001, a leading promoter, producer and marketer of live entertainment events, conducted an extensive survey of El Paso's local performing arts community. The survey concluded that: a market did exist in El Paso for additional performing arts programming, and that the public had a strong affinity for the Plaza and was eager to attend events at a restored Plaza. On July 30, 2002 the City of El Paso formally approved a public/private partnership with the El Paso Community Foundation to restore the Plaza Theatre to its original appearance. The Foundation committed to raising $12 million towards the renovation effort, to restoring and reinstalling the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ at the Plaza Theatre, and to donating the adjacent building (Centre Annex), which would be integrated into the overall operations of the Plaza. The City of El Paso agreed to fund the remaining cost of the restoration. Thos. S. Byrne, Ltd. and Arrow Builders were hired to perform the restoration. The companies took particular interest in the project, noting that \\"With over 2,000 seats at the commencement of restoration, the Plaza is currently one of the nation's largest non-functioning theaters in the United States.\\" The companies worked diligently to insure all phases of construction complied with historical restoration guidelines. At a cost of nearly $38 million, the Plaza reopened on March 17, 2006. The first performance hosted at the refurbished theater was Riverdance which played Friday, March 17, 2006 through Sunday, March 19 with multiple sold-out performances. The reopened theater boasts a 2,050-seat main theater with a 10-story stage house capable of handling large traveling Broadway shows. In addition, with the completion of the Centre Annex, the facility includes a 200-seat children's theater, a rooftop garden, meeting facilities and a privately managed restaurant. The smaller theater is named the Philanthropy Theatre. Despite the completion of the project, the El Paso Community Foundation continues appropriating funds to buy back original art and furnishings of the Plaza. The building The Plaza Theater at night. No expense was spared in creating the elaborate building. At the point where the entrance wing of the Plaza adjoined the auditorium, a domed tower rises in three tiers, projecting above the roof line. Other exterior references to the Spanish mission-style included modest brick delineations at the building's corners, simple cartouche motifs and stepped and curved parapets with tile accents along the roof line. While the exterior facade was designed to be reminiscent of a mission-style parapet, patrons were awed by the interior, with its intricately painted ceilings, mosaic-tiled floors, Posh carpeting, decorative wrought iron banisters and sconces and, to heighten the effect, antique furnishings. Due to such grandiose rococo design, the Plaza became known as \\"The Showplace of the Southwest.\\" =The Mighty Wurlitzer= Further emphasis of the illustrious interior stands in the $60,000 Mighty Wurlitzer Organ, designed to elevate from the orchestra pit to accompany vaudeville shows, sing-alongs, and to entertain patrons before and after films. Its \\"toy box\\" provides the organ with the versatility to replicate such sounds as horses' hooves, the ocean surf and birds chirping. The organ had 15 ranks with 61 pipes in each rank. In 1973, the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ was sold at auction and housed at the home of a private collector in Dallas. In 1998 the organ was restored and returned to El Paso as a donation by the late Karl O. Wyler, Sr.. During renovations of the theater, the organ was put on display at Sunland Park Mall located in Northwest El Paso The organ was rebuilt by Pipe Organ Artisans of Arizona, Tucson, and re-installed. The Opus 2123 console was returned to its original finish. It is the only one of its kind (a Wurlitzer Balaban III) left intact. Trivia * Through the years, the Plaza hosted such popular entertainers as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the Barrymore family, Sally Rand, Tallulah Bankhead, Hopalong Cassidy, John Wayne, the Marx Brothers, Rita Moreno, Henry Fonda, Tom Mix, and James Stewart. * The original seating capacity was 2,410, with 1,510 seats on the main floor, 508 in the mezzanine and 392 in the balcony. Before reopening, the seating accommodations were diminished to provide future patrons with wider, more comfortable seating. * Originally, colored patrons were only allowed to sit in the balcony of the theater. The main seating was segregated as white seating only. * The Plaza had one fallout shelter located beneath the stage. Prior to restoration, food rations could still be found within the shelter with the original packagings intact.

Its habitat includes dry slopes up to in elevation. Cultivation and uses T. chebula This tree yields smallish, ribbed and nut-like fruits which are picked when still green and then pickled, boiled with a little added sugar in their own syrup or used in preserves. The seed of the fruit, which has an elliptical shape, is an abrasive seed enveloped by a fleshy and firm pulp. Seven types of fruit are recognized (vijaya, rohini, putana, amrita, abhaya, jivanti, and chetaki), based on the region where the fruit is harvested, as well as the colour and shape of the fruit. Generally speaking, the vijaya variety is preferred, which is traditionally grown in the Vindhya Range of west-central India, and has a roundish as opposed to a more angular shape. The fruit also provides material for tanning leather and dyeing cloth. Terminalia chebula is a main ingredient in the Ayurvedic formulation Triphala which is used for kidney and liver dysfunctions. The dried fruit is also used in Ayurveda as a purported antitussive, cardiotonic, homeostatic, diuretic, and laxative. Chemical composition A number of glycosides have been isolated from haritaki, including the triterpenes arjunglucoside I, arjungenin, and the chebulosides I and II. Other constituents include a coumarin conjugated with gallic acids called chebulin, as well as other phenolic compounds including ellagic acid, 2,4-chebulyl-Œ≤-D-glucopyranose, chebulinic acid, gallic acid, ethyl gallate, punicalagin, terflavin A, terchebin, luteolin, and tannic acid. Chebulic acid is a phenolic acid compound isolated from the ripe fruits. Luteic acid can be isolated from the bark. Terminalia chebula also contains terflavin B, a type of tannin, while chebulinic acid is found in the fruits.

Due to its geographical location, allowing for the shortest land route between West Germany and West Berlin, most transit traffic to and from West Berlin used the Helmstedt- Marienborn crossing. Most travel routes from West Germany to East Germany and Poland also used this crossing. The border crossing existed from 1945 to 1990 and was situated near the East German village of Marienborn at the edge of the Lappwald. The crossing interrupted the Bundesautobahn 2 (A 2) between the junctions Helmstedt-Ost and Ostingersleben. History =First checkpoints= West German checkpoint in November 1989 Helmstedt‚ÄìMarienborn from the Soviet Occupation Zone in 1949 Looking down on Helmstedt‚ÄìMarienborn from the West German side in 1967 Former control point, passport control booths at GDR immigration A checkpoint was established on the site on 1 July 1945, which was on the demarcation line between the British and Soviet occupation zones. Its scope included the interzonal railway traffic as well as the motor vehicle traffic on the Reichsautobahn between Hanover and Berlin. The checkpoint buildings were located directly on the zones' border, and consisted of little more than temporary wooden buildings. The most important inner-German checkpoint, the Autobahn crossing at Helmstedt was named Alpha by the Western Allies. Its counterpart in the Berlin southern borough of Dreilinden was named Bravo. The connection between these checkpoints gained its importance from being the shortest connection between the western zones and Berlin, at . During the Berlin Blockade, which endured from June 1948 to May 1949, the Soviet checkpoint was closed. From 1950 onwards, the East German ' (later the ') performed the border control on the eastern side of the checkpoint, with the exception of the Soviet military, which escorted Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin. Due to the increasing tensions between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the border crossing was expanded extensively and security was increased during the following years. However, the original checkpoint was eventually regarded too unsafe to operate efficiently. =Expansion in the 1970s= East German stamps in a West German passport Command buildings Passport control Between 1972 and 1974, the GDR erected a new control portal on a field situated on a hill near Marienborn, about east of the border. The control portal was staffed with as many as 1,000 passport control, customs and border police employees. The buildings were linked with a tunnel system through which military or police units could reach the control portal quickly and secretly. The Western Allies kept control of their checkpoint on the western side, with small garrisons of French, British and American troops stationed in Helmstedt. The West German Bundesgrenzschutz had assumed control of the operative controls on the western side of the border crossing, where the buildings were notably smaller compared with Marienborn. ', a memorial on the former West German side The restrictive East German controls and the ever-increasing amount of traffic soon resulted in notable waiting times on the West German side. Therefore, the West German government added extensive car parks and rest areas on the autobahn approach to Helmstedt. Border controls were relaxed after the Wende during late 1989. The crossing was dismantled at midnight on June 30, 1990, exactly 45 years after its first opening. The former GDR buildings have been a listed building since October 1990, however the former GDR departures area has been demolished when the road was expanded to six lanes. A rest stop with a motel has now been built on part of the old GDR control portal's area.  Checkpoint Alpha  The Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint was one of three checkpoints used by the Western Allies. Its western side (in the former British zone) was labeled Checkpoint Alpha after the first letter of the NATO phonetic alphabet. The Allied side of the checkpoint for entry into West Berlin was named Checkpoint Bravo, and Checkpoint Charlie was the Allied checkpoint for entry into (and exit from) East Berlin. The nomenclature of \\"checkpoint\\", as opposed to the East German \\"Grenz√ºbergangsstelle\\" (which literally means \\"border-crossing- place\\") was a result of the Western Allies not recognising the legitimacy of East Germany as a state. That changed in 1973, when the GDR was admitted to the United Nations, but the term remained in use. Division memorial Entrance of the memorial site On the grounds of the former East German border control buildings, the \\"Gedenkst√§tte Deutsche Teilung Marienborn\\" was opened on August 13, 1996. The memorial is operated by the state of Saxony-Anhalt and features exhibitions and guided tours. The memorial site is accessible via the nearby rest stop's exit and can only be explored on foot. The West German buildings near Helmstedt have either been demolished or are now used for other purposes.

Gameplay The player first has a budget of 50,000 zables (a unit of in-game money), less zables in harder levels, and has to build a small store into a large enterprise. There are 6 players and at least one has to be a human player. Each company that each player can choose has a unique advantage. The player can control the business and do things such as loaning, buying products, paying workers their salaries, betting for many things. The player may also buy advertising and buy insurances.Zapitalism - www.thecomputershow.com The first player to win a certain amount of zables wins a round, and the first player to win 10 billion zables wins the game. A player expands their store only if they own building permits. If a building permit is paid to the building that gives out store constructions then the construction can finish within 1‚Äì4 weeks depending on the workers that construct the expansion of the building. The player may have to face things such as taxes, giving salary to the workers, natural disasters, vandalism, and many others. Insurance can be used to help protect the player against most disasters but only disasters in-between turns. This can help refund paying for the disasters and thus avoid more chances of being unlucky (and being more vulnerable to disasters).

The multiple gates may be controlled by a single gate electrode, wherein the multiple gate surfaces act electrically as a single gate, or by independent gate electrodes. A multigate device employing independent gate electrodes is sometimes called a multiple- independent-gate field-effect transistor (MIGFET). The most widely used multi- gate devices are the FinFET (fin field-effect transistor) and the GAAFET (gate-all-around field-effect transistor), which are non-planar transistors, or 3D transistors. Multi-gate transistors are one of the several strategies being developed by MOS semiconductor manufacturers to create ever-smaller microprocessors and memory cells, colloquially referred to as extending Moore's law (in its narrow, specific version concerning density scaling, exclusive of its careless historical conflation with Dennard scaling).Risch, L. \\"Pushing CMOS Beyond the Roadmap\\", Proceedings of ESSCIRC, 2005, p. 63. Development efforts into multigate transistors have been reported by the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Toshiba, Grenoble INP, Hitachi, IBM, TSMC, UC Berkeley, Infineon Technologies, Intel, AMD, Samsung Electronics, KAIST, Freescale Semiconductor, and others, and the ITRS predicted correctly that such devices will be the cornerstone of sub-32 nm technologies.Table39b The primary roadblock to widespread implementation is manufacturability, as both planar and non-planar designs present significant challenges, especially with respect to lithography and patterning. Other complementary strategies for device scaling include channel strain engineering, silicon-on-insulator-based technologies, and high-Œ∫/metal gate materials. Dual-gate MOSFETs are commonly used in very high frequency (VHF) mixers and in sensitive VHF front-end amplifiers. They are available from manufacturers such as Motorola, NXP Semiconductors, and Hitachi. Types Several multigate models Dozens of multigate transistor variants may be found in the literature. In general, these variants may be differentiated and classified in terms of architecture (planar vs. non-planar design) and the number of channels/gates (2, 3, or 4). =Planar double-gate MOSFET (DGMOS)= A planar double-gate MOSFET (DGMOS) employs conventional planar (layer-by-layer) manufacturing processes to create double-gate MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) devices, avoiding more stringent lithography requirements associated with non- planar, vertical transistor structures. In planar double-gate transistors the drain‚Äìsource channel is sandwiched between two independently fabricated gate/gate-oxide stacks. The primary challenge in fabricating such structures is achieving satisfactory self-alignment between the upper and lower gates. After the MOSFET was first demonstrated by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng of Bell Labs in 1960, the concept of a double-gate thin-film transistor (TFT) was proposed by H.R. Farrah (Bendix Corporation) and R.F. Steinberg in 1967. The concept of a double-gate MOSFET was later proposed by Toshihiro Sekigawa of the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) in a 1980 patent describing the planar XMOS transistor. Sekigawa fabricated the XMOS transistor with Yutaka Hayashi at the ETL in 1984. They demonstrated that short-channel effects can be significantly reduced by sandwiching a fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device between two gate electrodes connected together. The ETL demonstration inspired Grenoble INP researchers including Francis Balestra, Sorin Cristoloveanu, M. Benachir and Tarek Elewa to fabricate a double-gate MOSFET using silicon thin film in 1987. The double-gate control of SOI transistors was used to force the whole silicon film (interface layers and volume) in strong inversion (called ‚ÄúVolume-Inversion MOSFET‚Äù) or strong accumulation (called ‚ÄúVolume-Accumulation MOSFET‚Äù). This method of transistor operation, demonstrating the electrostatic properties and scalability of multigate devices, offered strong device performance, particularly substantial increases in subthreshold slope, transconductance, and drain current. A simulation program and experiments on SIMOX structures was used to study this device. Sekigawa fabricated an XMOS device with 2¬µm gate length in 1987. In 1988, an IBM research team led by Bijan Davari fabricated 180nm to 250nm dual- gate CMOS devices. In 1992, Sekigawa fabricated a 380nm XMOS device. In 1998, E. Suzuki fabricated a 40 nm XMOS device. The focus of DGMOS research and development (R&D;) subsequently shifted away from planar DGMOS technology, towards non-planar FinFET (fin field-effect transistor) and GAAFET (gate-all- around field-effect transistor) technologies. =FlexFET= FlexFET is a planar, independently double-gated transistor with a damascene metal top gate MOSFET and an implanted JFET bottom gate that are self-aligned in a gate trench. This device is highly scalable due to its sub-lithographic channel length; non-implanted ultra-shallow source and drain extensions; non-epi raised source and drain regions; and gate-last flow. FlexFET is a true double- gate transistor in that (1) both the top and bottom gates provide transistor operation, and (2) the operation of the gates is coupled such that the top gate operation affects the bottom gate operation and vice versa. Wilson, D.; Hayhurst, R.; Oblea, A.; Parke, S.; Hackler, D. \\"Flexfet: Independently- Double-Gated SOI Transistor With Variable Vt and 0.5V Operation Achieving Near Ideal Subthreshold Slope\\" SOI Conference, 2007 IEEE International Flexfet was developed and is manufactured by American Semiconductor, Inc. FinFET A double-gate FinFET device SOI FinFET MOSFET NVIDIA GTX 1070, which uses a 16 nm FinFET-based Pascal chip manufactured by TSMC FinFET (fin field-effect transistor) is a type of non-planar transistor, or \\"3D\\" transistor (not to be confused with 3D microchips). The FinFET is a variation on traditional MOSFETs distinguished by the presence of a thin silicon \\"fin\\" inversion channel on top of the substrate, allowing the gate to make two points of contact: the left and right sides of the fin. The thickness of the fin (measured in the direction from source to drain) determines the effective channel length of the device. The wrap-around gate structure provides a better electrical control over the channel and thus helps in reducing the leakage current and overcoming other short-channel effects. The first finfet transistor type was called a \\"Depleted Lean-channel Transistor\\" or \\"DELTA\\" transistor, which was first fabricated by Hitachi Central Research Laboratory's Digh Hisamoto, Toru Kaga, Yoshifumi Kawamoto and Eiji Takeda in 1989. In the late 1990s, Digh Hisamoto began collaborating with an international team of researchers on further developing DELTA technology, including TSMC's Chenming Hu and a UC Berkeley research team including Tsu-Jae King Liu, Jeffrey Bokor, Xuejue Huang, Leland Chang, Nick Lindert, S. Ahmed, Cyrus Tabery, Yang‚ÄêKyu Choi, Pushkar Ranade, Sriram Balasubramanian, A. Agarwal and M. Ameen. In 1998, the team developed the first N-channel FinFETs and successfully fabricated devices down to a 17nm process. The following year, they developed the first P-channel FinFETs. They coined the term \\"FinFET\\" (fin field-effect transistor) in a December 2000 paper. In current usage the term FinFET has a less precise definition. Among microprocessor manufacturers, AMD, IBM, and Freescale describe their double- gate development efforts as FinFET development, whereas Intel avoids using the term when describing their closely related tri-gate architecture. In the technical literature, FinFET is used somewhat generically to describe any fin- based, multigate transistor architecture regardless of number of gates. It is common for a single FinFET transistor to contain several fins, arranged side by side and all covered by the same gate, that act electrically as one. The gate may also cover the entirety of the fin(s). A 25 nm transistor operating on just 0.7 volt was demonstrated in December 2002 by TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). The \\"Omega FinFET\\" design is named after the similarity between the Greek letter omega (Œ©) and the shape in which the gate wraps around the source/drain structure. It has a gate delay of just 0.39 picosecond (ps) for the N-type transistor and 0.88 ps for the P-type. In 2004, Samsung Electronics demonstrated a \\"Bulk FinFET\\" design, which made it possible to mass-produce FinFET devices. They demonstrated dynamic random- access memory (DRAM) manufactured with a 90nm Bulk FinFET process. In 2006, a team of Korean researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center developed a 3 nm transistor, the world's smallest nanoelectronic device, based on FinFET technology. In 2011, Rice University researchers Masoud Rostami and Kartik Mohanram demonstrated that FINFETs can have two electrically independent gates, which gives circuit designers more flexibility to design with efficient, low-power gates. In 2012, Intel started using FinFETs for its future commercial devices. Leaks suggest that Intel's FinFET has an unusual shape of a triangle rather than rectangle, and it is speculated that this might be either because a triangle has a higher structural strength and can be more reliably manufactured or because a triangular prism has a higher area-to- volume ratio than a rectangular prism, thus increasing switching performance. In September 2012, GlobalFoundries announced plans to offer a 14-nanometer process technology featuring FinFET three-dimensional transistors in 2014. The next month, the rival company TSMC announced start early or \\"risk\\" production of 16 nm FinFETS in November 2013. In March 2014, TSMC announced that it is nearing implementation of several 16 nm FinFETs die-on wafers manufacturing processes: * 16 nm FinFET (Q4 2014), * 16 nm FinFET+ ( Q4 2014), * 16 nm FinFET \\"Turbo\\" (estimated in 2015‚Äì2016). AMD released GPUs using their Polaris chip architecture and made on 14 nm FinFET in June 2016. The company has tried to produce a design to provide a \\"generational jump in power efficiency\\" while also offering stable frame rates for graphics, gaming, virtual reality, and multimedia applications. In March 2017, Samsung and eSilicon announced the tapeout for production of a 14 nm FinFET ASIC in a 2.5D package. =Tri-gate transistor= A tri-gate transistor, also known as a triple-gate transistor, is a type of MOSFET with a gate on three of its sides. A triple-gate transistor was first demonstrated in 1987, by a Toshiba research team including K. Hieda, Fumio Horiguchi and H. Watanabe. They realized that the fully depleted (FD) body of a narrow bulk Si-based transistor helped improve switching due to a lessened body-bias effect. In 1992, a triple-gate MOSFET was demonstrated by IBM researcher Hon-Sum Wong. Tri-gate fabrication is used by Intel for the non-planar transistor architecture used in Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake processors. These transistors employ a single gate stacked on top of two vertical gates (a single gate wrapped over three sides of the channel), allowing essentially three times the surface area for electrons to travel. Intel reports that their tri-gate transistors reduce leakage and consume far less power than current transistors. This allows up to 37% higher speed or a power consumption at under 50% of the previous type of transistors used by Intel.Intel to Present on 22-nm Tri-gate Technology at VLSI Symposium (ElectroIQ 2012) Intel explains: \\"The additional control enables as much transistor current flowing as possible when the transistor is in the 'on' state (for performance), and as close to zero as possible when it is in the 'off' state (to minimize power), and enables the transistor to switch very quickly between the two states (again, for performance).\\" Intel has stated that all products after Sandy Bridge will be based upon this design. Intel announced this technology in September 2002.High Performance Non-Planar Tri- gate Transistor Architecture; Dr. Gerald Marcyk. Intel, 2002 Intel announced \\"triple-gate transistors\\" which maximize \\"transistor switching performance and decreases power-wasting leakage\\". A year later, in September 2003, AMD announced that it was working on similar technology at the International Conference on Solid State Devices and Materials. No further announcements of this technology were made until Intel's announcement in May 2011, although it was stated at IDF 2011, that they demonstrated a working SRAM chip based on this technology at IDF 2009. On April 23, 2012, Intel released a new line of CPUs, termed Ivy Bridge, which feature tri-gate transistors. Intel has been working on its tri-gate architecture since 2002, but it took until 2011 to work out mass-production issues. The new style of transistor was described on May 4, 2011, in San Francisco. Intel factories are expected to make upgrades over 2011 and 2012 to be able to manufacture the Ivy Bridge CPUs. As well as being used in Intel's Ivy Bridge chips for desktop PCs, the new transistors will also be used in Intel's Atom chips for low-powered devices. The term tri- gate is sometimes used generically to denote any multigate FET with three effective gates or channels. Gate-all-around FET (GAAFET) A gate-all- around (GAA) FET, abbreviated GAAFET, and also known as a surrounding-gate transistor (SGT), is similar in concept to a FinFET except that the gate material surrounds the channel region on all sides. Depending on design, gate- all-around FETs can have two or four effective gates. Gate-all-around FETs have been successfully characterized both theoretically and experimentally. They have also been successfully etched onto InGaAs nanowires, which have a higher electron mobility than silicon. GAAFETs are the successor to FinFETs, as they can work at sizes below 7 nm. They were used by IBM to demonstrate 5 nm process technology. A gate-all-around (GAA) MOSFET was first demonstrated in 1988, by a Toshiba research team including Fujio Masuoka, Hiroshi Takato, and Kazumasa Sunouchi, who demonstrated a vertical nanowire GAAFET which they called a \\"surrounding gate transistor\\" (SGT). Masuoka, best known as the inventor of flash memory, later left Toshiba and founded Unisantis Electronics in 2004 to research surrounding-gate technology along with Tohoku University. In 2006, a team of Korean researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center developed a 3 nm transistor, the world's smallest nanoelectronic device, based on gate-all- around (GAA) FinFET technology. As of 2020, Samsung and Intel have announced plans to mass produce GAAFET transistors (specifically MBCFET transistors) while TSMC has announced that they will continue to use FinFETs for the time being, despite TSMC developing GAAFET transistors. =Multi-bridge channel (MBC) FET= A multi-bridge channel FET (MBCFET) is similar to a GAAFET except for the use of nanosheets instead of nanowires. MBCFET is a word mark (trademark) registered in the U.S. to Samsung Electronics. Samsung plans on mass producing MBCFET transistors at the 3 nm node for its foundry customers.https://techxplore.com/news/2019-05-samsung-foundry-event-3nm- mbcfet.amp Intel is also developing MBCFET \\"nanoribbon\\" transistors. Industry need Planar transistors have been the core of integrated circuits for several decades, during which the size of the individual transistors has steadily decreased. As the size decreases, planar transistors increasingly suffer from the undesirable short-channel effect, especially \\"off-state\\" leakage current, which increases the idle power required by the device. In a multigate device, the channel is surrounded by several gates on multiple surfaces. Thus it provides better electrical control over the channel, allowing more effective suppression of \\"off-state\\" leakage current. Multiple gates also allow enhanced current in the \\"on\\" state, also known as drive current. Multigate transistors also provide a better analog performance due to a higher intrinsic gain and lower channel length modulation. These advantages translate to lower power consumption and enhanced device performance. Nonplanar devices are also more compact than conventional planar transistors, enabling higher transistor density which translates to smaller overall microelectronics. =Integration challenges= The primary challenges to integrating nonplanar multigate devices into conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes include: * Fabrication of a thin silicon \\"fin\\" tens of nanometers wide * Fabrication of matched gates on multiple sides of the fin Compact modeling Different FinFET structures, which can be modeled by BSIM-CMG BSIMCMG106.0.0, officially released on March 1, 2012 by UC Berkeley BSIM Group, is the first standard model for FinFETs. BSIM-CMG is implemented in Verilog-A. Physical surface-potential-based formulations are derived for both intrinsic and extrinsic models with finite body doping. The surface potentials at the source and drain ends are solved analytically with poly- depletion and quantum mechanical effects. The effect of finite body doping is captured through a perturbation approach. The analytic surface potential solution agrees closely with the 2-D device simulation results. If the channel doping concentration is low enough to be neglected, computational efficiency can be further improved by a setting a specific flag (COREMOD = 1). All of the important multi-gate (MG) transistor behavior is captured by this model. Volume inversion is included in the solution of Poisson's equation, hence the subsequent I‚ÄìV formulation automatically captures the volume-inversion effect. Analysis of electrostatic potential in the body of MG MOSFETs provided a model equation for short-channel effects (SCE). The extra electrostatic control from the end gates (top/bottom gates) (triple or quadruple-gate) is also captured in the short-channel model.

Jonathan is generally so cited without further designation; but there is ample reason for identifying him with the less frequently occurring Jonathan (or Nathan) b. Joseph (or \\"Jose\\").Compare Mekhilta Yitro Ba·∏•odesh 10, with Sifre, Deuteronomy 32; Mekhilta Ki Tissa 1, with Yoma 85b; Tosef., Niddah, 2:2, Ket. 60b, and Yer.

But his patriotism and innate love for the Holy Land would not permit him to remain abroad.Sifre, Deuteronomy 80 Jonathan and Josiah were educated together at the academy of Ishmael ben Elisha,Men. 57b whose dialectic system, as opposed to that of Rabbi Akiva, they acquired. It is even reported that Jonathan all but converted Ben Azzai, a \\"fellow student\\" of Akiva, to Ishmael's system, and made him deeply regret his failure to study it more closely. Ben 'Azzai then exclaimed, \\"Woe is me that I have not waited on Ishmael\\".Hullin 70b et seq. Nevertheless, in later years, probably after Ishmael's death, both Jonathan and Josiah adopted some of Akiva's principles. Of Jonathan it is expressly stated that \\"he followed the system of his teacher Akiva\\".Jerusalem Talmud Ma'as. 5 51d Teachings Together, Jonathan and Josiah devoted their analytical minds to midrash halachah, interpreting laws as they understood them from the corresponding Scriptural texts, but not suggesting them. Only one halakhah unconnected with a Scriptural text bears their names. Their argumentations are mostly embodied in the Mekhilta (about thirty) and in the Sifre to Numbers (over forty).See D.

M. 54a; Sifra Aharei 4:9, with Yoma 57b Contrary to the astrological views of his times, Jonathan taught the Scriptural idea of natural phenomena; quoting Jeremiah 10:2, he added: \\"Eclipses may frighten Gentiles, but they have no significance for Jews\\".Mekhilta Bo 1; compare Yalkut Shimoni Exodus 188 To the question as to the permissibility of profaning the Sabbath to save human life he answered, \\"The Law saysExodus 31:16 'The children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations'; but one may profane one Sabbath in order to preserve a man that he may observe many Sabbaths\\".Mekhilta, Ki Tissa; compare Yoma 85b According to him, an am ha'aretz is one who has children and does not train them in the knowledge of the Law.Sotah 22a; compare Berachot 47b Jonathan contradicted the general opinion of earlier and contemporaneous rabbis that a \\"rebellious son\\" (Deuteronomy 21:18-21) never was and never will be executed, and that the ir nidachat never did and never will occur; he declared that he himself had sat on the grave of an executed rebellious son and had seen a ruined ir nidachat.Sanh. 71a = Quotes = Jonathan was the author of many aphorisms, among them: *He that observes the Torah in poverty shall in the end observe it in wealth; and he that neglects the Torah in wealth shall in the end neglect it in poverty.Pirkei Avot 4:9; cf.

It is the location of a plant of Airbus and its airport. In 2016 the population was 11,727. History Finkenwerder was first mentioned in 1236 (as \\"Vinkenwerder\\"). The fishing village became part of Hamburg in 1445 and granted the status of a suburb (Vorort) in 1919. During World War II until April 30, 1945 a concentration camp was established in Finkenwerder. It was a subcamp to the Neuengamme concentration camp.The camp is listed as No. 554 Hamburg-Finkenwerder in the official German list of concentration camps. It was also the site of a U-boat bunker, which was heavily damaged by Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs in April 1945 and demolished post-war, although the foundations of the walls were uncovered during work to extend the runway of Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport. Geography The port of Hamburg covers a part of this quarter. In 2006 according to the statistical office of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, the quarter Altengamme has a total area of 19.3 km2. The western and northern border is the river Elbe in the North the borough Altona borders to Finkenwerder. Altenwerder and Waltershof are in the East.

As of March of 2019, nearly 400 taverns, bars, and restaurants across the United States host the popular weekly or twice-weekly tournament-format games. The manner of play is similar to a darts or pool league. All World Tavern Poker events are No-Limit Texas Hold \`em tournaments. Each tournament is free to play (one tournament game; \\"tournament\\" refers to certain rules of play, particularly the continual raising of the blinds) and begins with as few as two players up to hundreds of participants. The winner is the last player left with chips. World Tavern Poker awards over $100,000 every year in cash and prizes, including 40 seats annually to the World Series of Poker. League structure All World Tavern Poker host establishments offer a weekly poker tournament or tournaments over the course of two 26-week seasons year-round: Season 1 (February to August), and Season 2 (August to February). Host venues are grouped by state; larger states are divided into regions. Currently, the league has over 200,000 registered members in the United States. Seasonal structure Each regular season consists of 26 weeks worth of tournament games, with a mid-season TOC Championship week (Week 13) and 2 weeks of championship events (known as the Tavern Championship and Tavern TOC) at the end of the season. A venue may play one night a week (2 games) or as many as four nights, with each night serving as its own seasonal Tavern Ranking. During Tavern Championship Week (Week 25), the winner earns the title of Tavern Champion and a seat to the World Tavern Poker National Championship Finals. Venues also hold a Tavern Tournament of Champions event during Week 26. This TOC tournament includes the first, second, and third-place finishers from any tournament at that particular venue during the regular season. Taverns can sign up at any point in the season and still qualify players for regional and national championship events. Local tournament structure Chip counts and blind times are based on the World Tavern Poker Rules and Guidelines for all WTP venues. The WTP Rules and Guidelines serve as the primary reference for member locations on how to operate and run their tournaments. Still, these can vary depending on the amount of time a venue has to run games, and if bars participate in the Bonus Chip Program. Mid-Season TOC Championships During Week 13, each tavern hosts a Mid-Season TOC Championship. The top 3 finishers from Weeks 1 through 12 receive extra chips (2,000 for each Top 3 finish), but anyone can play in this event. Individual tournament winners on Mid-Season TOC Night receive invitations to the National Tournament of Champions Semi-Finals, with the Mid- Season TOC Champion receiving a seat to the National TOC Finals. Tavern Championships Any player with 15 games played and at least one top 20 finish at that World Tavern Poker venue during the previous regular season qualifies for the Tavern Championship during Week 25. The winner of this event earns a seat to the WTP National Championship Finals, which takes place twice a year at the WTP OPEN or the World League Poker Championships (WLPC). Tournament of Champions (TOC) Tavern Tournament of Champions events take place during Week 26. Qualified players are those who finished in first, second, or third- place from each tournament in the previous regular season. The top 3 finishers of a tavern's Tournament of Champions qualify for WTP National TOC Finals at the OPEN or WLPC. Regional Championships At the end of each season, all qualified regions in the World Tavern Poker league host a Regional Championship Tournament. Regional Tournament prizes vary based on the number of participating bars in that area and include anything from plaques to travel packages to the WTP OPEN and/or the WLPC. Any player finishing in the top 20 in a qualified tavern at the end of the regular season automatically qualifies for the Regional Championships. National Championships, National TOC, the WTP OPEN, and the World League Poker Championships Two National WTP events are held each year. The National Championship events for Season 1 is held each fall at the World League Poker Championships (WLPC) in Las Vegas. The National events for Season 2 are held in May or June at the WTP OPEN at an east coast casino (location can vary - the last four OPEN events have taken place at Mohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania). Player Rankings A player's score for a game is determined by their finishing position relative to the number of players who started that tournament. First place in a tournament game receives 10,000 points plus 50 points multiplied by the number of players beginning the game. For example, a player who finishes third in a game that began with 31 players receives 10,550 points, and the winner 11,550; fewer players than that results in lower point totals. Points are awarded to the top 20 finishers in any tournament, or to all players if there are 20 or fewer participants. Any player who finishes outside of the top 20 in a WTP regular-season tournament receives no points (but earns a game played). A player only needs one Top 20 finish during a season at a given bar in order to receive a Tavern Ranking at that location. For ranking and scoring purposes, a game is a regular-season tournament in which the player finished in the top 20. Players are ranked at four levels every season. These averages determine eligibility for tournaments at the Tavern level and beyond: Tavern Ranking- The average of a player's top 15 scores at a given tavern; Regional Ranking- Average of a player's top 20 scores from any taverns in that region (in states divided into regions); State Ranking- Average of a player's top 25 scores from any taverns in a state; and National Ranking- Average of a player's top 30 scores from any WTP taverns in the nation.

Hardebec (10 December 1869 ‚Äì 10 February 1945) was an Irish composer and arranger of traditional music.Carl Hardebeck Biography Hardebeck, whose father was German and mother was Welsh, was born in Clerkenwell, London. He lost his sight when he was a baby. He attended the Royal Normal School for the Blind in London (1880‚Äì1892) where, under his teacher Frederick Corder (a professor from the Royal Academy of Music), he showed a marked aptitude for music. In 1893, at the age of twenty-four, he moved to Belfast, where he opened a music store, but the venture failed, and he became the organist of a small parish in the city, the Holy Family Church, Wellington Place.Axel Klein: Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert (Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, 1996), p. 408. He entered an anthem, O God of My Salvation for contralto and chorus, for the 1897 Dublin Feis Ceoil and won; on this occasion he heard folk song arrangements of Charles Villiers Stanford and others for the first time.Allen (1998), see Bibliography. At the 1901 Feis Ceoil, he again won a prize, this time for a large cantata, The Red Hand of Ulster. In 1914 Mary Reavy, Hardeback's wife died. In 1919, he was to become the director of the music school in Cork and became the first professor of Irish music at University College Cork in 1922.See Klein (1996), p. 409. Ill- suited for administrative tasks, he relinquished the post after one year and returned to Belfast, which after the Irish Civil War had become the capital of Northern Ireland. In 1932, he finally settled in Dublin, where he worked for An G√∫m, the Irish government publisher, as arranger of Irish traditional songs for piano and choirs, many of which became teaching material at schools in the nascent Republic of Ireland. He also taught Irish and traditional music in the Dublin Municipal School of Music for two years. On many occasions he acted as adjudicator in singing and musical competitions across Ireland. Despite his mixed German/Welsh/English background, the events of the 1913 Dublin Lock-out, the outbreak of World War I, and the 1916 Easter Rising radicalised him, turning him into an Irish nationalist. He was quoted as saying \\"I believe in God, Beethoven and Patrick Pearse\\".Se√°n O'Boyle: \\"Carl Hardebeck\\", in: The Capuchin Annual (1948). He studied the Irish language and collected folk songs from around the country, making some unique arrangements that bridged the gap between traditional and art song. When Hardebeck died in 1945, a Radio √âireann-sponsored symphony concert, held in the Capitol Theatre in Dublin, began with a sympathetic performance of his orchestral variations upon Seoith√≠n Se√≥. A state funeral was held in Saint Joseph's Church, Berkeley Road, Dublin. The church was packed; various government ministers, the Lord Mayor and representatives of the President and of √âamon de Valera were there. Hardebeck's own Kyrie and Agnus Dei were performed at the requiem mass. He was interred in Glasnevin Cemetery, where a Benedictus was chanted by the clergy present. A vote of sympathy was issued by the Irish National League of the Blind to Hardebeck's widow and relatives, in which the hope was expressed \\"that the nation as a whole would not be unmindful of the important contribution which the late Dr Hardebeck had made to Irish culture, music and art\\". Appearance and personality The following anecdotes are based on Gannon (2006); see Bibliography: Although a huge, well-built man, he was shy and retiring by nature. If it were not for his bald head and the forbidding round dark glasses that he always wore, he could have been described as a handsome man. In later life he suffered from bronchitis, and the present of a bottle of whiskey, which would \\"loosen him out\\", was always welcome. He spoke with a distinct Northern Irish accent and addressed everyone as \\"boss\\". \\"If I had my sight, boss\\", he would say, \\"I'd be conducting an orchestra on a cruiser.\\" At one time he played the organ in Saint Mathew's Church, Belfast. As there was an icy draught in the church, his bald head felt cold. Carl asked for and received permission to wear a priest's black beretta, which confused everyone. At home in Dublin, he played his excellent arrangements of Irish melodies on a Schiedmayer harmonium. The instrument had a 'percussion' stop, which Carl used to great effect. Carl also owned a Knauss piano, but played the harmonium by choice. He was quite an authority on plainchant. The noted Irish harpsichord maker, Cathal Gannon was a close friend of his for many years; Carl taught him how to appreciate the structure of the classical symphony and concerto and passed on his enthusiasm and love of Irish melodies. Recognition Unfortunately, very little attention has been given to Hardebeck, who was one of the instigators in the revival of Irish music; indeed he was largely forgotten about after his death. This was possibly due to his mixed origins and place of birth. His arrangement for orchestra of The Lark in the Clear Air was a fine piece of music, but he was content to sell it to the music publishers Boosey & Hawkes for just six guineas. In June 2013, a plaque to his memory was installed at Holy Family Church, Belfast; see ceremony at Youtube.

The German Commission was founded on May 12, 1950, one year before West Germany was officially admitted to UNESCO. It has a liaison function for German Multilateral Foreign Cultural Policy; thus, its regular budget is financed by the Foreign Office. It is a chartered non-profit voluntary association with up to 114 members: Its members represent the German Federal government and the governments of the Laender, representatives of important German institutions working within UNESCO's fields of competence as well as individual experts. The German Commission for UNESCO advises the government, parliament and all other public bodies on UNESCO issues, as well as on other issues of multilateral policy in education, culture and science. It coordinates the contribution of German government, academia, expert institutions and civil society to UNESCO‚Äôs programme activities: Education, Natural and Social Sciences, Culture, Communication and Information. Notable activities are the international volunteer service \\"kulturweit\\", the German implementation of the UN decade on \\"Education for Sustainable Development\\", the German implementation of the UNESCO convention on cultural diversity and a cooperation framework with Africa. The Secretariat with about 45 staff members is located in Bonn and Berlin. Since 2002, the President is Walter Hirche and since 2004, the Secretary-General is Dr. Roland Bernecker. The Bureau and the executive committee of the German Commission for UNESCO are elected for two years, by a general assembly meeting once annually.  UNESCO National Commissions  UNESCO was founded in 1946 as the United Nations Specialized Organization for Education, Science and Culture. Within its fields of competence, UNESCO will \\"contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among the nations through education, science and culture\\". It is the only UN Organization having National Commissions. All 193 member states of UNESCO dispose of a National Commission, with varying structures and architecture. All of them have similar tasks though: they involve the educational, scientific, and cultural communities as well as communication media of their countries into the planning, implementation, communication and evaluation of the multi-faceted programmes of UNESCO.  Germany's membership in UNESCO  In 1951, UNESCO was among the first of the United Nations Specialized Agencies in which the Federal Republic of Germany became a Member State, thus ending Germany's intellectual isolation provoked by the Nazi Regime 1933 to 1945. By joining UNESCO in 1972, the GDR also became a Member State, actually for the first time in a UN Organization. Since German unification on October 3, 1990, Germany is used as official name; the German Commission for UNESCO integrated the functions of the dissolved GDR National Commission. After the United States of America and Japan, Germany makes the third largest financial contribution to UNESCO. Like most other Member States, Germany has a Permanent Delegation to UNESCO in Paris. It ensures constant working contact with UNESCO and is in charge of Germany's political relations with UNESCO. Germany is participating very actively in UNESCO's programmes. There are more than 30 World Heritage Sites in Germany, 15 UNESCO biosphere reserves, some 200 UNESCO Associated Schools, 10 UNESCO chairs, 10 UNESCO clubs and national committees for the IHP, MAB, the IOC, the IGCP, the MoW Programme, and the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development.

Evolution Three stages have been identified in the evolution of Thevaram: first, the mark of Shiva as the supreme deity during the 7th‚Äì9th century; second, the Chola kings initiating the compilation of all the hymns and the installing of the images of the three saint poets during the 10th to the 11th century; and lastly, the restructuring done by the pontiffs of the mathas who incorporated the hymns into the Shaiva Siddhanta canon in the 13th century. Both the Saiva and Vaishnava textual tradition negated the Vedic orthodoxy and Smartha tradition practised during the era. The authority of the hymns was established in their stead, with the Saivities calling Tevaram \\"the Tamil Marai\\" and Vaishnavities calling their contemporaneous Nalayira Divya Prabandham \\"the Dravida Veda\\". The usage of Sanskrit liturgies for religion was superseded by the usage of Tamil in both Tevaram and Prabandham. Sangam literature established the convention of akam (internally oriented) and puram (externally oriented) poetry. Though the influence of Sangam literature is often seen in Thevaram, the strict conventions were not followed. The verses were more oriented towards the folk tradition, which made them easily accessible to people. Poets The first three volumes of Tevaram are composed by Sambandar, the next three by Appar, and the seventh by Sundarar. Appar and Sambandar lived around the 7th century, while Sundarar lived in the 8th century; all three are among the 63 Nayanars (). During the Pallava period these three travelled extensively around Tamil Nadu, offering discourses and songs characterised by an emotional devotion to Shiva and objections to Vaishnavism, Jainism and Buddhism. copper alloy statue depicting Sambandar, late 11th century =Sambandar= Thirugnana Sambandar was born into a family of Saivite Brahmins in Sirkazhi. Information about Sambandar comes mainly from the Periya Puranam, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the Tirumurai, along with Sundarar's Tiruttondartokai and other poetry, and Nambiyandar Nambi's Tiru Tondar Tiruvandadi. A Sanskrit hagiography called Brahmapureesa Charitam is now lost. Sambandar is said to have been breastfed by the goddess Umadevi, after which he sang his first hymn. On the request of Mangayarkkarasiyar, Sambandar went on a pilgrimage to Madurai to counter the Jain monks in her husband's court; after besting the monks in debate, the Pandya king converted to Saivism, and the Jains in Madurai were impaled to death in the aftermath. Sambandar died around 655 CE at the age of 16, on the day of his marriage. The first three volumes of the Tirumurai contain 384 poems, composed of 4,181 stanzas, attributed to Sambandar, which are all that survive out of a reputed totalling more than 10,000 hymns. His verses were set to tune by Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar, who is said to have accompanied Sambandar on his yal or lute. bronze, 12th century =Appar= Appar was born during the 7th century in Tiruvamur, and his childhood name was Marulneekiar. Details of Appar's life are found in his own hymns and in Sekkizhar's Periya Puranam. His sister Thilagavathiar was betrothed to a military commander who died in action. When his sister was about to end her life, he pleaded with her not to leave him alone in the world. She decided to lead an ascetic life and bring up her only brother. During his childhood, Appar was very much interested in Jainism and started studying its scriptures. He left home and stayed in a Jain monastery, where he was renamed Dharmasena. \\"Seeing the transient, ephemeral world he decided to probe into truth through renunciation.\\" After a while, afflicted by a painful illness, Dharmasena returned home. He prayed for relief at the Shiva temple where his sister served and was cured. He was also involved in converting the Pallava king Mahendravarman to Saivism. This was a period of resurrection of the smaller Shiva temples. Appar sanctified all these temples with his verses and was also involved in cleaning of the dilapidated temples in a ritual known as uzhavaarappani. He was called Tirunavukkarasar, meaning \\"the King of Divine Speech\\", and Sambandar called him Appar () when they met. He is believed to have died around the age of 81 in Tirupugalur. He extolled Shiva in 49,000 stanzas, out of which 3,130 are compiled in the fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes of the Tirumurai. =Sundarar= Sundarar was born in Tirunavalur to Sadaiya Nayanar and Isaignaniyar during the end of the 7th century. His own name was Nambi Arurar, and he was prevented from getting married owing to the divine grace of Shiva. He later married a temple girl named Paravi Naachiyaar and a vellala girl, Changili Naachiyaar. He was a close friend of Cheraman Perumal Nayanar and Eyarkon Kalikkama Nayanar. He is the author of 1,026 poems compiled as the Tirumurai's seventh volume. The hymns All the songs in Thevaram, called pathikam (), are believed to be in sets of ten. The hymns were set to music denoted by panns and are part of the canon of Tamil music. They continue to be part of temple liturgy today. Several of these poems refer to historic references pointing to the saint- poets' own life, voice of devotee persona, using interior language of the mystic. Multi-vocal rhetoric is commonly used taking on personal emotions and genres and some voices of classical Sangam literature. Of the three, Sambandar's life is better interpreted by his verses. According to Zvelebil, Sambandar's lyrics are characterized by egocentricism, by militancy and great ardour, by a warm feeling for the greatness and beauty of Tamil language with scholarly experimentation in meters showing familiarity with Sanskrit forms. Sisir Kumar Das regards this poem by Sambandar as exemplifying the structural and thematic distinctiveness of bhakti poetry: Appar's poems dealt with inner, emotional and psychological state of the poet saint. The metaphors used in the poems have deep agrarian influence that is considered one of the striking chords for common people to get accustomed to the verse. The quote below is a popular song of Appar glorifying Shiva in simple diction: Sundarar's hymns had a touch of humour, a rare thing in religious literature. In one of the verses, he playfully draws an analogy with Shiva with himself, both having two wives and the needs of nagging wives: The tendency to incorporate place names known to the folks in the idiom of the poems is another characteristic feature of Tevaram. The poems also involved glorifying the feat of Shiva in the particular location‚Äìthe usage of locale continuously occurring in the verses is a testament. According to Prentiss, the poems do not represent social space as a contested space, the hymns represent the hymnists were free to wander and to offer their praise of Shiva. The emotional intensity of the hymns represent spontaneous expression of thought as an emotional responses to God. The Paadal Petra Sthalams are 275 temples that are revered in the verses of Thevaram and are amongst the greatest Shiva temples of the continent, while the Vaippu Sthalam are places that are mentioned casually in the hymns., quoting The focus of the hymns suggests darshan (seeing and being seen by God) within the puja (worship) offering. Both human structures and natural places find a mention in Thevaram: in addition to temples, the hymnists make classificatory lists of places like katu (forest), turai (port or refuge), kulam (water tank) and kalam (field). Compilation The 3 foremost Nayanars with Manikkavasakar - collectively called the Naalvar: (from left) Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Sundarar, Manikkavacakar. Raja Raja Chola I (985-1013 CE) embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of Tevaram in his court. He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a priest in a temple.Xavier Irudayaraj, \\"Self-Understanding of Saiva Siddanta Scriptures,\\" in It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct of the Chidambaram Nataraja temple. The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple opposed the mission, but Rajaraja intervened by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram. Rajaraja thus became known as Tirumurai Kanda Cholan meaning \\"one who saved the Tirumurai\\". Thus far Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple. Nambi arranged the hymns of three saint-poets Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar as the first seven books, Manikkavacakar's Tirukovayar and Tiruvacakam as the eighth book, the 28 hymns of nine other saints as the ninth book, the Tirumandiram of Tirumular as the tenth book, and 40 hymns by 12 other poets, Tirutotanar Tiruvanthathi‚Äìthe sacred anthathi of the labours of the 63 Nayanar saints‚Äìand Nambi's own hymns as the eleventh book. The first seven books were later called as Tevaram, and the whole Saiva canon, which came to include Sekkizhar's Periya Puranam (1135 CE) as the twelfth volume, is wholly known as Tirumurai, \\"the holy book\\". Thus Saiva literature which covers about 600 years of religious, philosophical and literary development. Nambi was also involved in setting musical modes for Tevaram. He accomplished this by visiting the native village of Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar, where he met a woman of the Tamil Panar caste who learned the mode of divine revelation. She returned to Chidambaram with Nambi, where she sang and danced for Shiva. In 1918, 11 more songs were found engraved in stone temple in Tiruvidavayil in a village close to Nannilam, and it was the first instance found where Tevaram verses were found in inscriptions. In culture Tevaram was one of the sole reasons for converting Vedic ritual to Agamic puja followed in Shiva temples. Though these two systems are overlapping, the Agamic tradition ensures the perpetuation of the Vedic religion's emphasis on the efficacy of ritual as per Davis. The earliest singers of Tevaram hymns were referred to as pidarars, and were among the Tirupadiyam Vinnapam Seyvar that Nandivarman III provided for in Tiruvallam Bilavaneswara temple records dating from the 8th century. A few earlier records also give details about the gifts rendered to the singers of Tevaram from Parantaka I. Rajaraja deputed 48 pidarars and made liberal provisions for their maintenance and successors. A record belonging to Rajendra I mentions Tevaranayakan, the supervisor of Tevaram and shows the institutionalisation of Tevaram with the establishment of a department. There are records from Kulothunga Chola III from Nallanyanar temple in South Arcot indicating singing of Tiruvempavai and Tiruvalam of Manikkavacakar during special occasion in the temple. From the 13th century, the texts were passed on to the odhuvars by the adheenams and there was no more control by the kings or the brahmanas. The odhuvars were from the vellala community and were trained in ritual singing in Tevaram schools. Today, odhuvars, sthanikars, or kattalaiyars offer musical programmes in Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu by singing Tevaram after the daily rituals. These are usually carried out as a chorus programme soon after the divine offering. The singing of Tevaram is followed by musicals from the music pillars in such temples like Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple, Nellaiappar Temple and Thanumalayan Temple. Periya Puranam, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the Tirumurai, primarily had references only to Tevaram and subsequently expanded to 12 parts. One of the first anthologies of Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar's hymns, the Tevara Arulmuraitirattu, is linked to Tamil Saiva Siddhantha philosophy by grouping ninety-nine verses into 10 categories. The category headings are God, soul, bond, grace, guru, methodology, enlightenment, bliss, mantra and liberation‚Äìcorresponding to Umapathi Shivachariyar's work Tiruvarutpayan. Tirumurai Kanda Puranam is another anthology for Tirumurai as a whole, but primarily focuses on Thevaram. It is the first of the works to refer the collection of volumes as Tirumurai.

A mixed-media artist, Bickerton often combines photographic and painterly elements with industrial and found object assemblages. He is associated with the early 1980s art movement Neo-Geo. Life Born in Barbados in 1959, Bickerton is the son of Derek Bickerton, a linguist and scholar of Creole and pidgin languages. His father's research work caused his family to move around the globe every several years. As a child Ashley Bickerton lived in a number of countries across four continents. The family finally settled in Hawaii in 1972. British by birth, Bickerton became a naturalized US citizen in the mid-1980s. He spent 12 years in New York where he established his career before finally settling on the island of Bali in 1993, where he presently resides.Holland Cotter, Art in Review; Ashley Bickerton, The New York Times, May 19, 2006. Career Bickerton graduated from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982, then moved to New York to attend the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program. After exhibiting for a few years in New York, he was included in a four-person show at the Sonnabend Gallery in 1986, that included Jeff Koons, Peter Halley and Meyer Vaisman. In 2004 The New Museum exhibited \\"East Village USA,\\" a show that featured \\"Neo-Geo\\" artists including Bickerton. Tim Woods, Beginning Postmodernism, Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 126, In 2009 he was included in Pop Life: Art in a Material World, at the Tate Modern in London The following year he was exhibited in Collecting Biennials at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which acted as a counterpoint to the 2010 Biennial and paid homage to the previous 80 years of Whitney Biennials. He has had solo exhibitions at Lehman Maupin Gallery (2006, 2008, 2011), Sonnabend Gallery, (2000, 2004, 2006), both in New York, and White Cube in London (2001, 2009). Over the last twenty-five years, Bickerton has exhibited his work internationally and is included in public art and museum collections. His works are held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art; the Tate; the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, Paris; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Berardo Collection Museum in Lisbon, Portugal; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. In April 2014, Bickerton held his first solo exhibition at Gajah Gallery. The month-long exhibition, \\"Junk Anthropologies\\", marked a new direction for the American master of philosophical funk, where he re-established himself as a master painter in the grand tradition. The focus of the works is about the ongoing corruption of Bali that he witnessed being a resident there, with the styles greatly influenced by Paul Gauguin, for whom he has a perennial obsession. From April to August 2017, Bickerton had his first UK retrospective at Newport Street Gallery in London. Entitled \\"Ornamental Hysteria\\" and spanning more than three decades of the artist's career, the exhibition presented 51 works, many of which were new and previously unexhibited pieces. Amongst the featured works was Canoe, Shark, Woman (2016), a sculpture created in Yogyakarta Art Lab, which The Guardian described as \\"[having] the look of the ritual artefact of Bickerton‚Äôs tropical island obsession, creating a power object or fetish (as islanders do) with found objects (fish, flowers, beads) that is the more hypnotic for its solemn parody ‚Äì silver vestal offering a hammerhead shark, coconuts in her Indonesian canoe\\". Work Ashley Bickerton's work has explored issues in contemporary art related to the commidification of the art object itself. Often his objects are grotesque in a self-aware manner and are often a critique of capitalism. =Early constructions= In the 1980s Bickerton made a series of works which resembled packing cases and crates, covered with corporate logos.Irit Rogoff, Terra Infirma: Geography's Visual Culture, Routledge, 2000, p. 60, His early work is noted for its display of corporate logos and constructions titled as either \\"Self-Portraits,\\" \\"Commercial pieces,\\" or \\"Anthropospheres.\\" They are typically Assemblages of technological or industrial materials with the inclusion of found elements and screen printed iconographic images. These seemingly functional objects without clear purpose are often covered in various logos, technological signage, and codes. His artwork \\"Abstract Painting for People 4\\" made in 1987 is now included in the collection of Fran√ßois Pinault as of 2007. =Singapore Tyler Print Institute= The mixed- media pieces he made in collaboration with the Singapore Tyler Print Institute are \\"spooky\\" images of green-skinned creatures emerging from a sea littered with cans and bottles. =Collaboration with Yogyakarta Art Lab= Ashley Bickerton‚Äôs most recent project has been a collaboration with the Yogyakarta Art Lab (YAL). YAL is Gajah Gallery‚Äôs major initiative based in Yogyakarta - Indonesia‚Äôs up and coming art hub - co-founded in April 2012 by Indonesian artist Yunizar and owner of Gajah Gallery Jasdeep Sandhu. This collaboration involves Ashley Bickerton creating series of sculptures which examined what Bickerton would like to think of as the \\"mitochondrial eve\\". Originally derived from clay models the artist created in his Bali studio, they are being reinvented in Jogjakarta in a variety of archival materials centered on cast aluminum. These new works now coming out of YAL have been described by Jasdeep Sandhu as \\"Some of the more important contemporary sculpture produced in the past 10 years\\". =Recent works= Green Head with Inlay 1, 2007Bickerton continues to develop work within his established themes and iconography of tropical surrealism, green-headed characters, and assemblages. His work in 2006 and 2007 has taken the form of large-format digital prints and paintings with thick wooden frame constructions with various inlays. These elements can be seen in \\"Made's Warung\\" 2006 and \\"Green Head with Inlay 1\\" (2007). 2014 marked the start of a new series of Silver Ladies, which are manifested in a double portrait of two identical subjects, beautiful young Balinese women, nude except for a floral sash around their hips and coronas of tropical flowers. Their bare skin and dreadlocked hair are painted shiny silver, their lips in vivid colours. The first work in this series is a painting titled 2 C (A)W E2 P.G. 2 T(B) W.

Introduced onscreen in January 1969, the character role is the first ongoing antagonist to lead heroine Victoria Lord and last appears in November 1978. Casting Actress Catherine Burns originated the role of Cathy Craig from 1969 until 1970. The role was then assumed by actress Amy Levitt from 1970 through May 1971, when she was replaced by actress Jane Alice Brandon. Brandon appeared on One Life to Live from May 1971 through October 1972, when series creator Agnes Nixon recast the role again to Dorrie Kavanaugh. Dorrie Kavanaugh played Cathy longer than any other actress in the role, from October 1972 until June 1976, until she was fired by executive producer Doris Quinlan. In late 1975, actress Robin Strasser was offered a long-term contract with the series to take up the role but declined upon the knowledge that Kavanaugh would be fired to accommodate the recast. Strasser would later go on to be the permanent replacement of Claire Mallis following a brief recast in the role of Dr. Dorian Lord. Storylines Amy Levitt as Cathy Craig in a scene with Michael Storm as Dr. Larry Wolek, Cathy is initially introduced as the unseen child daughter of Llanview Hospital chief-of-staff Dr. Jim Craig (originally, Robert Milli) in 1968. When the character debuts on-screen in January 1969, she is aged to a seventeen-year-old teenager. Harboring an Electra complex toward her father, Cathy (Burns) grew increasingly jealous of the time her prospective stepmother Anna Wolek (Doris Belack) was spending with her father. Cathy (Levitt) rebelled against Jim (now, Nat Polen onward) and Anna by using drugs, eventually becoming an addict and killing her dealer Artie Duncan (John Cullum) in an LSD-fueled maniacal episode. Cathy seeks treatment for her addiction at the culturally relevant Odyssey House in New York City (a real treatment center) in 1970. She (Kavanaugh) soon begins reporting stories for The Banner when Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord Burke (Erika Slezak) hires her, becoming the character's first active nemesis. Cathy briefly engages in an affair with Banner chief editor and Viki's then-fianc√©, Steve Burke (Bernie Grant). Later, just before Viki remarries first husband Joe Riley (Lee Patterson) after returning to town following his apparent death, Cathy becomes pregnant by Joe from a brief romance in 1973. Joe insists on marrying her but she declines and resigns to single motherhood. Joe and Viki remarry in September, and months later Cathy gives birth to her and Joe's daughter, Megan Craig Riley, December 2, 1974. Joe is told that baby Megan is born with a congenital heart defect that ensures she would never live to adulthood; fearing she would not take the news well, Joe keeps Megan's condition from Cathy. While caring for stepdaughter Megan, Viki is involved in a car accident while rushing an ailing Megan to the hospital during a storm in October 1975. The accident leaves Viki in a coma and assures baby Megan's death. Believing Viki intentionally caused the accident, Cathy swears vengeance on the newspaper heiress. Emotionally reeling and plotting, Cathy (Harmon) marries Viki's newly arrived brother and maternal cousin, Tony Lord (George Reinholt), in 1976; unknown to Cathy, Tony was truly in love with sweetheart Pat Ashley (Jacqueline Courtney). Adding to Cathy's emotional strife was the fact that Viki became pregnant herself, and gives birth to baby boy Kevin Lord Riley that year, but the child does not inherit the heart condition that plagued Megan. Cathy's mental state wavers at this point, and she becomes obsessed with having a baby with Tony. Cathy miscarries her second child and proceeds to fall into psychosis. She then kidnaps baby Kevin and disappears for several months. When she is finally located in 1977, Cathy is found in catatonia but without baby Kevin. Many more months go by before Cathy recovered sufficiently to tell Joe, Viki, and Tony the location of the baby. After completely recovering from her breakdown, Cathy grants Tony a divorce and leaves Llanview. Reception The role of Cathy was created by series creator Agnes Nixon as one of the first feminists on American soap operas. Amy Levitt's portrayals of an increasingly drug- addled Cathy earned national coverage by media outlets who praised the show for its realistic showcase of addiction and drug rehabilitation. The last actress to play Cathy, Jennifer Harmon, earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1978, the first nomination in the category for the show.

The school's patron saint is St Thomas More, which is mainly celebrated annually on St Thomas More Day. The school is bounded on two sides by playing fields, belonging to two neighbouring schools, while private housing and a dual carriageway border the other two sides. Work has started on a state-of-the-art extension to the school being built by Davis Construction. It will house specialist subject and basic teaching rooms, and will also include an internal fitness suite. The building is expected to open its doors to students in January 2019. History The school opened as a two-form entry school in 1960 with around 100-200 pupils and has progressively expanded. In September 1973 it was extended to become a four-form entry school and its status was changed to a bilateral school offering 30 selective and 115 non-selective places. Various building projects have taken place including a modern sixth-form block, which was completed in 1996. The school became grant-maintained on 1 September 1993, and the first sixth-form intake was admitted in September 1996. It was converted to voluntary-aided status in September 1999. There was an extensive refurbishment project, completed in autumn 2001, which provided the school with a new reception area, extra classrooms, a brand new art department and an advanced music room with individual practice facilities. A new technology block was built in 2003, complete with state-of-the-art facilities. Former deputy head teacher and Head of RE Chris Danes, an author of best selling textbooks and fiction who has bipolar disorder and is now a writer and broadcaster, had to resign from the School in 1997 on the grounds of ill health and at the young age of 36. Danes maintains he retired from teaching after becoming dangerously ill in 1997, he believes largely because of the unsympathetic way he was treated at work. He talked candidly and movingly about this on a teacher's channel TV programme on mental health. Following protests by residents, in June 2003 the Council denied the School permission to install six 13-metre-high floodlights on the hockey pitch.\\"Westcliff: Victory in hockey protest\\", Gazette, Newsquest Media Group, 26 June 2003 These were subsequently installed in 2007. St Thomas More became a specialist Mathematics and Computing College in September 2004, and continues with the specialism today. Ex-headmaster Frank Keenan was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2005. The school celebrated its 50th Anniversary Jubilee in July 2011 and became an academy on 17 August 2011. In 2013, it was announced that ex-headteacher Mr P Travis had decided to work elsewhere; then deputy headteacher Mrs Gemma Ackred (n√©e Nye) was appointed as Acting Headteacher and later proceeded to become the Headteacher in late 2013 after wide support from the students and staff. After which, Mr Phillip Maxfield became the deputy headteacher of the school. Academic achievements Pupils enter the school aged 11 with above average standards and their attainment both at age 14 and 16 is above the national average. In the November 2005 Ofsted inspection\\"Southend-on-Sea (Schools)\\", House of Commons, Hansard - Written Answers the school was rated 'Good‚Äô (point 2 on a four-point scale) and an 'Outstanding' rating was given for 16- to 19-year- olds in the 'How good is the overall personal development and well-being of the learners?' category.Ofsted Report, November 2005 The school regularly competes in the annual UKMT Regional Maths Challenge.\\"Specialist Maths\\", St Thomas More High School In July 2013, the school was rated ‚ÄòRequires improvement‚Äô (point 3 on a four-point scale).July 2013 Ofsted Report, July 2013 In February 2015, the school was rated ‚ÄòGood‚Äô (point 2 on a four-point scale). However, Ofsted remarks that ‚Äòsixth form provision‚Äô is rated at ‚Äòrequires improvement‚Äô (point 3 on a four-point scale).February 2015 Ofsted Report, February 2015 Miss Elsa Genovese, head of the sixth form at the school, has made changes to the management of the sixth form to reflect on this rating. House system The school house system traditionally consisted of 4 houses representing the four patron saints of the United Kingdom; Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint Patrick. In commemoration of the school's golden jubilee in 2011 a new house, chosen by pupils, Saint Sebastian was added. Furthermore, this house system now denotes the names of forms students are placed in. Originally, forms were numbered from 1‚Äì5. After the introduction of Saint Sebastian house form names were changed and assigned a Patron Saint, e.g. 7S would refer to Year 7. In 2018, a new house was created which was temporarily known as \\"Six\\" before being named Saint Vincent. Each house has a house colour with the house colour of Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint Patrick, Saint Sebastian and Saint Vincent being blue, yellow, red, green, white and purple respectively. Sport In November 2006 three pupils were selected for advanced basketball training by England Basketball.\\"Trio are heading for England glory\\", Echo, Newsquest Media Group, 23 November 2006 In October 2014, a pupil competed in the ASA Word Swimming Championships \\"Spotlight - World Swimming Championship\\", St Thomas More High School, 3 October 2014 and their respective team placed third in England‚Äôs rankings. In 2014 and 2015, several students were offered scholarships to Harrow School due to their sporting ability.

Love Is a Many Splendored Thing actor Robert Milli originated the role from the pilot in July 1968 until 1969. Storyline Nat Polen as Jim, with Peggy Wood as Kate Nolan, and Amy Levitt as Cathy in 1970. At the start of the series, Jim is introduced as a neurologist and the chief of staff at Llanview Hospital in fictional Llanview, Pennsylvania. He becomes supervisor and mentor to Llanview Hospital resident physicians Larry Wolek (Paul Tulley, Michael Storm after 1969) and Price Trainor (Peter DeAnda). Jim, a widower, has a young daughter, Cathy Craig. He falls in love with a young patient and aspiring actress Clara Benari (Ellen Holly) at the start of series in 1968. Dr. Craig soon asks Clara to marry him, and she accepts, even though she knows she does love him as much as he loves her. Jim continues to profess his love of Carla, even after learning that the assumed Italian American \\"Clara Benari\\" is actually a light-skinned black American Carla Gray (Holly) passing for white. Nevertheless, Carla returns his engagement ring. Soon afterward, Jim falls in love with Anna Wolek (Doris Belack) in 1969, and the two marry onscreen April 10, 1970. Throughout the 1970s, Jim and Anna primarily serve as supporting characters, Jim as a primary town doctor, and Anna as a housewife and socialite who offers wise advise to the more dynamic characters. Jim's daughter Cathy, however, becomes a major troublemaker. Actor Nat Polen played the role for 12 years, working and taping episodes for the show until days before his death from undisclosed pancreatic cancer May 3, 1981, aged 66. The character is killed off concurrently and dies off-screen. Widow Anna leaves Llanview in December 1982. Impact One of the first popular storylines on One Live to Live involved the 1968 interracial relationship and love triangle of the white American Dr. Jim Craig (Milli), black American Dr. Price Trainor (DeAnda), and light-skinned black woman passing for Italian American Carla (Benari) Gray (Holly). The plot gained a following and a controversial reception, and prompted an ABC affiliate in Texas to temporarily drop One Life to Live from its ABC Daytime lineup due to uproar at \\"white\\" Carla engaging in a romantic relationship with Dr. Trainor, a story that revealed Carla to actually be black and her actual interracial romance being with Dr. Craig. The interracial love triangle storyline also caused the show to receive an increased amount of fan mail. The long-running pairing of Dr. Craig (Nolen) with Anna Wolek (Belack) was popularly received as familial patriarch and matriarch figures in early episodes of the series. The raising of Jim's daughter and Anna's stepdaughter Cathy Craig and their insistence that she seek treatment for drug addiction at the real-life Odyssey House in New York City brought the show critical acclaim.

Stahl and released by 20th Century Fox. The screenplay was based on the 1908 novel Buried Alive by Arnold Bennett.\\"Of Local Origin.\\" New York Times. September 15, 1943. It stars Monty Woolley and Gracie Fields, with Laird Cregar, Una O'Connor, Alan Mowbray, Franklin Pangborn, Eric Blore, and George Zucco in supporting roles. Screenwriter Nunnally Johnson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Plot Priam Farll is a famous English painter and recluse who has been living in various isolated places around the world with only his valet of 25 years, Henry Leek, for company. In 1905, Farll reluctantly travels to London to be knighted. Upon their arrival, however, Leek becomes very ill. Farll summons Dr. Caswell, but Leek succumbs to double pneumonia. The doctor mistakenly assumes it is Farll who has died, and the publicity-hating artist is only too glad to assume Leek's identity. When the King himself shows up to pay his respects, Farll learns that the body is to be buried at Westminster Abbey. Trying to end the masquerade, he only manages to convince his sole relative, a cousin he has not seen since childhood, that he is a lunatic. Farll sneaks into the funeral, but is ejected for weeping and is only saved from arrest by the arrival of Alice Chalice, a widow with whom Leek had been corresponding. It turns out that Alice had applied to a marriage bureau and had been put in touch with Leek. Since the photograph she was given shows both Leek and Farll, she too assumes that Farll is Leek. Impressed by her cheerful nature, combined with her practicality and quick thinking, he marries her and settles in Alice's comfortably large home in Putney. They are happy together. One day, Leek's wife, Sara, and three adult sons show up to reclaim their father. Farll is unable to convince her that he is not Henry Leek without giving away his true identity to his wife. Once more, Alice saves her husband through quick thinking, pointing out that the Leeks will be disgraced by having a bigamist as a father and husband. The Leeks hastily depart. Alice herself does not care that her husband may be a bigamist. When Alice's stock dividends are unexpectedly cut off, Farll tries to calm her worries about her mortgage by telling her that he can sell his paintings for thousands of pounds. When Alice remains unconvinced, he takes her to an art dealer to prove it, only to have the man offer him ¬£15 for his work. Farll is outraged and leaves. Later, however, Alice reconsiders and starts selling his paintings without his knowledge. Clive Oxford, Farll's art dealer, recognizes Farll's work, buys the paintings cheaply, and resells them for an enormous profit. One frequent buyer, Lady Vale, learns that her most recent purchase shows an omnibus that only went into service after Farll supposedly died, and takes Oxford to court for fraud. Oxford is certain Farll is still alive, tracks him down, and summons him to the trial. Farll loathes both parties and refuses to cooperate when he is on the stand. Oxford's solicitor, Mr. Pennington, gets Farll's cousin to testify that he has two moles on his upper left chest. Farll refuses to open his shirt, but Alice does it for him, proving his true identity. Afterward, Farll and Alice move to where he can paint in blissful seclusion. Cast Production Nunnally Johnson read the Arnold Bennett book in 1928, and was surprised no one had turned it into a film.Stempel, Tom. Screenwriter: The Life and Times of Nunnally Johnson. San Diego, Calif.: A.S. Barnes, 1980, p. 94. As it turned out, Johnson was incorrect. The book had been made into a film twice in the United Kingdom, and by Paramount Pictures in the United States in 1933 under the title His Double Life.Kael, Pauline. 5001 Nights at the Movies. New York: Henry Holt, 1991, p. 337.

Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it \\"a most delightful union between [Monty Woolley] and Gracie Fields\\", and said it was \\"a charming picture which is full of sly humor. And John Stahl has directed it with understanding of its smooth wit and satire.\\" He also had strong praise for actors Cregar, O'Connor, Mowbray, and Pangborn.Crowther, Bosley. \\"Delightful Union of Monty Woolley and Gracie Fields in 'Holy Matrimony' at Roxy.\\" New York Times. September 16, 1943. More recent appraisals have also been very positive. Film historian Tony Thomas wrote, \\"The humor of Holy Matrimony stems not only from the grand performance of Monty Woolley, but also from the offbeat casting of Gracie Fields as the warmhearted wife. ... [The film is] a perfect vehicle for an actor whom nature had already typecast as a crusty highbrow.\\"Thomas, Tony. The Films of the Forties. New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1975, p. 91.

Hollywood 1920-1970. New York: A.S. Barnes, 1977, p. 164. Legacy The film was so successful that Woolley and Fields were reunited again two years later in the motion picture Molly and Me. The film also spawned a literary legacy. According to Gore Vidal, a subplot in Dawn Powell's novel The Wicked Pavilion is lifted directly from Holy Matrimony.Vidal, Gore. The Selected Essays of Gore Vidal. Jay Parini, ed. New York: Doubleday, 2008, p. 220. In 1968, the Theater Guild (an organization that commissioned plays for production off-Broadway) turned the screenplay into a musical, Darling of the Day.Meyerson, Harold and Harburg, Ernest. Who Put the Rainbow in the Wizard of Oz?: Yip Harburg, Lyricist. Ann Arbor, Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1993, p. 331. So many changes were made to the play, however, that Johnson demanded that his name be removed from it. The Musical although not a huge hit was praised for its score, by Jule Styne and E. Y. Harburg, and the performance of Patricia Routledge, who won the Tony for Best Actress in a musical. Vincent Price co-starred with her as Priam Farll.

Patterson regularly appeared in the role from the inception of the serial July 15, 1968, through 1970, from 1972 through October 3, 1979, and briefly in 1987. Casting Series creator Agnes Nixon cast Patterson as one of the leading protagonists on One Life to Live in 1968. After two seasons with the show, Patterson departed the role in 1970, filming Chato's Land opposite Jack Palance and making guest television appearances including on ABC's The Immortal during his absence from the serial. The actor reprised the role on-contract with the series in 1972, playing Joe until the character's onscreen death October 3, 1979. In 1986, Patterson returned to One Life to Live in the contract role of Joe's long-lost twin brother, Tom Dennison. The actor made his final appearances on the series as Joe in episodic dream sequences aired in March and April 1987. Storylines Viki (Erika Slezak) remarry, 1974 In 1968, reporter Joe Riley clashes with icy heiress Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord (originally Gillian Spencer), who had little interest in romance and focused her time and energy on her work at The Banner. They soon start to fall in love, but publisher Victor Lord (Ernest Graves) disapproves of his daughter becoming involved with the working-class Riley and does all he can to keep them apart. Torn between pleasing her father and following her heart, Viki begins getting headaches  and mysterious, threatening notes telling her to end her relationship with Joe. Secretly plagued by multiple personality disorder, Viki (as alter ego \\"Niki Smith\\") becomes involved with Joe's best friend, Vince Wolek (Antony Ponzini). In love with \\"Niki\\", a heartbroken Vinny learns the truth and told Viki about her other personality. Viki seeks psychiatric treatment, and with her mental illness apparently under control, goes ahead with plans to marry Joe. But during the initial wedding ceremony, \\"Niki\\" reemerges and flees the ceremony with an ecstatic Vinny. When Joe urges \\"Niki\\" to marry him, however, \\"Niki's\\" own panic resulted in Viki regaining control, and Viki returns to Joe. During more intensive therapy, Viki remembers apparently writing the threatening notes as \\"Niki\\", and finally recalls the childhood memory that had apparently caused her personality to splinter. Now freed by the truth, Viki marries Joe December 11, 1969. In 1970, Joe begins investigating Llanview's increasing drug trade for The Banner. While making inquiries in California, Joe's car goes over a cliff and his body is never found, so he is presumed dead. A devastated Viki (Erika Slezak 1971 onward), at the insistence of her father Victor, signs papers declaring Joe legally dead in 1972, a move which shocks Vince and Joe's sister Eileen Riley Siegel (Alice Hirson), both of whom refuse to believe Joe to be dead. Joe Riley reappears in 1972 as Viki was marrying another man, new Banner editor Steve Burke (Bernie Grant). When Viki and Steve return from their honeymoon, she receives the news of Joe's survival of the accident and return to Llanview, promptly fainting. In love with (and married to) two different men, Viki eventually chooses to remain loyal to Steve in 1973. Heartbroken and still in love with Viki, Joe takes up with Cathy Craig (Dorrie Kavanaugh), who bears him a daughter, Megan, in 1974; when Cathy refuses Joe's offer to make an honest woman out of her, Joe and Viki remarry on the episode first-run September 16, 1974. Megan dies in infancy due to a car crash involving stepmother Viki on the episode first-run October 3, 1975, and Viki falls into a coma until December of that year. Joe and Viki remain married, despite countless marital woes, through 1979, bearing their first son, Kevin, on the episode first-run September 12, 1976, who is soon kidnapped by Cathy and found by her volition in 1977. Joe dies of brain tumor with Viki at his side on October 3, 1979, leaving Viki widowed and pregnant; she bears their second son, Joe, Jr., on the episode first-run January 8, 1980.

Both were consolidated to form Hamilton High in 1980 at Taft. In 2002, an addition was built across the school's front, giving it new entrances, a new facade, a new library/media center, and six new classrooms. A new fine arts wing was finished in 2004. A recent bond issue approved the construction of a new gymnasium and to convert the old gym into a larger cafeteria. In 2012, the school began construction on the new gymnasium and lunch room. It concluded in 2013. Hamilton had a high school at the corner of S. Second and Ludlow Streets downtown until 1915 when a new building was constructed at N. Sixth and Dayton Streets. The high school remained there until 1959, when Hamilton's population swelled and two high schools became necessary.

C-301 is the first member of the C-300 series AShM with four solid rocket boosters and two ramjet sustainer engines located aft of the missile body. When the booster motors have accelerated the missile to past Mach 1.8, the kerosene-fueled ramjet engines kick in, accelerating the missile to a cruise speed of greater than Mach 2.0. The maximum range is 180 km, and it can fly below 50 meters at its cruise altitude. The missile is programmed to descent from cruising altitude to a much lower altitude before the active- radar terminal phase begins, then dive onto the target just prior to impact. The general designer of C-101 is Liang Shoupan, who is also the general designer of another Chinese supersonic AShM C-101. The C-301 only saw very limited service in the People's Liberation Army Navy as a coastal defense missile, and a stopgap measure in a limited scale production as more capable missiles becoming more widely available. C-301 is also used as a stopgap measure to replace the obsolete C-601 anti-ship missile, the air-launched version of the Silkworm missile carried on the Xi'an H-6 bomber (with one missile under each wing, like the C-601), until more potent supersonic anti- ship missiles become widely available. C-302 An improved C-301 version, called C-302 was later developed as an upgrade. C-302 is highly digitized and fully solid state, and the cruising altitude is also decreased further. After entering Chinese service in very limited numbers for evaluation purposes, C-302 did not enter mass production, due to the obvious shortcomings of liquid fuel rocket: the operational cost is high because periodic maintenance is required much more frequently and the safety standard during handling is also higher in comparison to solid rocket powered AShM. The advantage of supersonic speed can be achieved via ramjet powered AShM. During its very limited service with the Chinese navy for evaluation, C-302 was only known to be land-based, though in theory, it could be deployed by large aerial platforms. However, unlike its smaller cousin C-101 that can be carried by numerous aircraft in the Chinese inventory, the C-301 and its upgrade C-302 can only be carried by Xi'an H-6 due to their large size and weight. It is safe to conclude that as newer missiles entering services in greater numbers, the C-301/302 would eventually reduced to a sole coastal defense missile. Just like its smaller cousin C-101, Chinese claim that other type of seekers such as infrared imaging and television seekers have been successfully developed for the missile, but the status is rather uncertain. C-303 The last member of C-300 series AShM is C-303, which differs drastically from C-301 & C-302. The C-303 differs from the other two AShM in that its flight path: instead of sea- skimming, C-303 would climb to 20 km altitude first before transition to level flight, and after cruising at 20 km altitude for most its journey, the seeker of the missile of would be turned on around 50 km away from target, dive down on its target at the terminal stage in a near vertical dive in a way similar to SS-N-19. C-303 can be either launched at a slant angle like most other AShM's, or launched vertically like a space exploration rocket. Just like its smaller cousin C-301 & C-302, C-303 only entered Chinese service in extremely limited numbers, mostly for test and trial purposes, due to the inherit drawback of liquid fuel rocket that prevented C-301 & C-302 AShM from being widely adopted. Unlike C-301 & C-302, C-303 can only be land-based. It is rumored on Chinese internet that future Chinese supersonic long-range AShM developed & under development utilizes experience gained from C-303, but such claims have yet to be verified by official Chinese governmental sources and other independent sources.

Biography Riccardo Brengola was born in Naples on 18 March 1917, to his father Carlo and his mother Maria Esposito. His father was a cellist, who also had a passion for lutherie, but the extremely harsh economic conditions in the immediate post war period pushed him to emigrate with his wife and son to Casablanca, Morocco in 1919. It was here that he opened a music shop that sold instruments, sheet music and albums. When Riccardo turned three his father Carlo decided to make him a violinist, by teaching and making him his first instrument. Riccardo was talented and the paternal teachings soon allowed him to perform Arabic music in public. At the age of six he was enrolled in the Casablanca Music Conservatory, where he was taught by Lucien Salin, who graduated from the Lucien Capet school. Meanwhile, Riccardo also attended a Spanish primary school where he was made to learn his fourth language. At this point in his life he spoke Spanish, French, Arabic, and the Neapolitan dialect, though he still did not speak Italian. At eleven he graduated from the Conservatory and in 1929 Mussolini offered him a bursary in Italy, which allowed him to move to Rome where he joined the Arrigo Serato School. A few years later he graduated from the renowned Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome and the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena. The latter was founded in 1932 by Count Guido Chigi Saracini, a great patron of Italian music. Thanks to his extraordinary foresight and generosity the new institution quickly became an essential landmark of international music. Brengola took part in numerous competitions and won prestigious prizes and titles, amongst which was the one in Taormina that includes all the national review winners of the Niccol√≤ Paganini prize, as well as the Accademia Chigiana prize for improvement. In 1937 he was the only Italian amongst the winners of the First International Music Competition in Geneva. Meanwhile, in 1938 he met the pianist Giuliana Bordoni in Siena, a student of the Alfredo Casella perfecting course at the Accademia Chigiana. At the time she was 18, and he was 21. They married in the summer of 1941 at the headquarters of the Accademia Chigiana: the Palazzo Chigi Saracini chapel. Their marriage lasted almost 60 years, and three children were born. They formed a stable duo, which received notable acknowledgements during numerous concerts across Italy and abroad, and they recorded the entirety of the Mozart Sonatas for the Radio Televisione Italiana. In 1939 Count Chigi decided to create a new chamber music group called Quintetto Chigiano, which was formed by choosing some of the best students of the Accademia: Riccardo Brengola, first violin and Ferruccio Scaglia, second violin (later Mario Benvenuti and Angelo Stefanato); Giovanni Leone, viola; Lino Filippini, cello; Sergio Lorenzi, piano. In a few years the Quintetto conquered international fame, touring the world, while being recognized as one of the best bands. Despite these performances, Brengola never stopped performing solo and conducting alongside his chamber music activity. These practices were disciplines he undertook after studying the Paul van Kempen course at the Chigiana. In 1941 he was appointed head teacher for exceptional merits at the Music Conservatory of Pesaro. He would then teach, in turn, at the conservatories in Venice, Bologna, Naples and Rome. In 1946 Count Chigi selected him as course director of the ensemble music course at the Accademia Chigiana, where he would teach until 1997. In 1966, the year after Guido Chigi‚Äôs death, the Quintetto became the Sestetto Chigiano d‚ÄôArchi: this was composed of, alongside Brengola, Giovanni Guglielmo (second violin), Mario Benvenuti e Tito Riccardi (violas), Alain Meunier and Adriano Vendramelli (cellos). Brengola taught chamber music for many years, facilitating training courses at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome, where he was an academic and a member of the Board of Directors. He taught courses and seminars in the most prestigious music institutes in the world, including those in Buenos Aires, Barcelona, Dublin, and Tokyo. Throughout his career Brengola played numerous violins: most of all the violins of Ansaldo Poggi (luthier from Bologna); the ‚ÄúContessa Crespi‚Äù (1747) by G.B. Guadagnini; the ‚ÄúConte di Fontana‚Äù (1702) by A. Stradivari, previously owned by David Oistrakh; and, in the eighties, an instrument made by Roberto Regazzi, another violin maker from Bologna. His intense concert activity was particularly dedicated to rediscovering the works by Boccherini for piano and violin and for quintet and sextet, also recorded on vinyl, and twentieth century music of which he was one of the first exponents and communicators. He performed, above all, works by Alfano, Mortari, Frazzi, Martucci, Malipiero, Casella, Ferrari, Respighi, Zafred, Lavagnino, Nordio, Busoni, Veretti, Pizzetti, Petrassi, Peragallo, Berio, Ravinale, and many others. Amongst his recordings: the three Brahm‚Äôs Sonatas With Pier Narciso Masi at the piano (UNICEF - FC UO 06, May 1982); Boccherini‚Äôs Quintets, Bloch, Brahms, Schumann, Shostakovich, Dvorak (Decca, Fifties). Brengola‚Äôs tours abroad and the courses at the Chigiana put him in contact with the most renowned musicians of the twentieth century, from Casella to Enescu, Franco Ferrara, Berio, Segovia, Casals, Oistrakh, Milstein, Celibidache, Giulini, Mehta, Gazzelloni, building meaningful friendships with many of them. One of his most authentic passions was teaching (some his students included Salvatore Accardo, Bruno Giuranna, Shoji Sayaka, Uto Ughi and the Tokyo Quintet), to which he remained greatly committed. As Constantin Zanidache, a close collaborator of his for over twenty years at the Accademia Chigiana, wrote: ‚Äúduring his lessons, he was able to create highly intense and emotive atmospheres. His lessons, often very strict, still never failed to make his students fall in love‚Äù. Particularly relevant, in addition to his teaching activity at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia and the Accademia Chigiana, was his contribution to the University of Tokyo in Japan in the 1990s. This was also thanks to the mediation and commitment of Shuku Iwasaki, his assistant at the Chigiana, and of Koko Kato, his student and dear friend. It was because of this activity that Brengola established a relationship with the emperor Akihito and the Empress Michiko. In 2003 the Japanese government bestowed upon him the high honor ‚ÄúOrdine del Sol Levante‚Äù (The Order of the Rising Sun) to acknowledge his contribution to elevating the standard of classical music in Japan. Other honors that deserve to be mentioned include the title of Commendatore of the Italian Republic, awarded by President Sandro Pertini in 1982, and the honorary citizenship of Siena in 1980. Riccardo Brengola died in Rome on 16 May 2004. In 2017, to mark a century from Riccardo‚Äôs birth, the Accademia Chigiana held a concert in his honor in Siena on 10 July, executed by a Quintet formed by Federico Guglielmo and Felice Cusano on violin, Laura Riccardi on viola, Alain Meunier on cello and Anne Le Bozec on piano.

Gray is a professor of cognitive science and director of the cognitive science doctoral program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  Research  Gray seeks to understand how goal-directed cognition is shaped by the accommodation of basic cognitive, perceptual, and motor operations to the cost-benefit structure of the designed task environment. These basic elements of integrated behavior, interactive routines, occur over a time span of 1/3 to 3 seconds and are typically beneath the level of our conscious awareness and deliberate control. Hence, non-deliberate forces that dynamically react to our task environment without our conscious awareness shape a large part of our mental life. There is a basic and applied component to this research agenda. The Cognitive Science side focuses on the control of interactive behavior, resource allocation, dynamic decision making, memory, attention, and motor movement. The Cognitive Engineering side can be characterized by the terms visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), cognitive workload, and human error. The two types of research feed into each other and are supported by a core of common techniques and methods including computational cognitive modeling, cognitive task analysis, and detailed collection and analysis of behaviors that take less than one second to occur (e.g., keystrokes, mouse movements, and eye gaze). Brief biography Gray earned his Ph.D. from U. C. Berkeley in 1979. His first position was with the U.S. Army Research Institute, where he worked on tactical team training (at the Monterey Field Unit) and later on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to training for air-defense systems (HAWK) (at ARI-HQ Alexandria, VA). He spent a postdoctoral year with John R. Anderson's lab at Carnegie Mellon University before joining the AI Laboratory of NYNEX' Science & Technology Division. At NYNEX he applied cognitive task analysis and cognitive modeling to the design and evaluation of interfaces for large, commercial telecommunications systems. His academic career began at Fordham University and then moved to George Mason University. He joined the Cognitive Science Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2002. He is an active member of his professional communities. Gray is the editor-in-chief for Topics in Cognitive Science, the newest journal of the Cognitive Science Society. He is a past associate editor for the Cognitive Science journal (2006-2008), the Cognitive Systems Research journal (2003-2008), the Human Factors journal (1998-2006), and the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (1995-2003). He chaired the Fourth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM-2001) and co-chaired the Cognitive Science Society Conference in 2002.

The album was recorded at Sawmills Studio in Cornwall and at WW1, Harrow Road, London. Background History Grand Union was written by Frank Tovey as an autobiographical album based on a set of coincidences that happened within his life. Frank described the album as a ‚Äòmetaphoric vehicle‚Äô. He found that people and places involved in his music were located around the Grand Union Canal in London; including Mute Records, whose premises back on to the Grand Union Canal in the Harrow Road.Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey, 2006 All the songs were written by Frank on acoustic guitar becoming rockier when recorded with additional bass and drums. Pressure was taken off of Frank through working with other musicians. Frank would turn up at rehearsals with an acoustic guitar and completed songs. The other musicians would then just join in; Frank never had to tell them what to play. He found this way of working really refreshing.Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey, 2006 At the time Frank had begun working with the Pyros. Originally from Ireland they had moved to London they began working with Frank after meeting up at Hermes Point (near the Harrow Road), where the Pyros were then living, they used to sit down and play some songs from Frank's Tyranny and the Hired Hand album. After getting on well they worked with Frank for the next couple of years. This was the beginning of what became Frank Tovey and the Pyros.Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey, 2006 All the time they worked with Frank, the Pyros became more electric while Frank became more folky. Acoustic instruments were used to form the basis with some traditional Irish music used to serve the whole recording. Frank was full of ideas, one being the building of a solid body, electric five string banjo for the recording of the album. Somewhere in the middle the ideas and influences met and made the Grand Union album.Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey, 2006 The songs included stories and ideas from the area around the Grand Union canal including ‚ÄòBad day in Bow Creek‚Äô which runs adjacent to the River Thames; and ‚ÄòPassing Through‚Äô about the building of a motorway through an area where Frank lived whilst growing up. ‚ÄòBethnal Green tube disaster‚Äô tells his Mother's story of when during the Blitz of London her father had taken her to the underground station to shelter from the bombing. In the blackout one of her shoes fell off and while searching for it avoided a terrible event that occurred that night. The panic stricken crowd who were rushing underground tumbled on the stairs and many people were crushed to death. Frank lived in Bethnal Green until he was five years of age. IKB (RIP) tells the story of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's death. Brunel is buried at Kensal Green next to the Grand Union canal. The main single released from the album was ‚ÄòThe Liberty Tree‚Äô. The video of ‚ÄòThe Liberty Tree‚Äô was filmed at Mudchute Farm on the Isle of Dogs. This is the same location where the cover artwork was shot of Frank riding a horse in front of Canary Wharf. The video was directed by Frank Tovey and Derrek Santini.Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey, 2006 ‚ÄòThe Liberty Tree‚Äô throws up a couple odd coincidences. The history of The Liberty tree comes from America. The British made the Liberty Tree an object of ridicule. Soldiers tarred and feathered a man named Ditson, and forced him to march in front of the tree. Americans would hang British officers in effigy form from the tree. Frank often appeared tarred and feathered (Gag album cover) and also wrote and sang many lyrics about hanging (Sam Hall) just a coincidence I am sure.Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey Booklet, 2006 Track listing # Bad day in Bow Creek # When the Victim Takes the Tyrant's Place # Passing Through # Bethnal Green Tube Disaster # Cities of the Plain # Fallen Angel # IKB (RIP) # The Liberty Tree # One November Morning # The Great Attractor Personnel Other musicians recording with Frank Tovey were [The Pyros] consisting of: *Paul Rodden - Solid body 5-string electric banjo, 5-string acoustic banjo and acoustic guitar. *John Cutliffe - 5-string electric bass, acoustic guitar and strings.

It is unusual in serving two separate dioceses (Connor and Down and Dromore). It is the focal point of Belfast's Cathedral Quarter. History St Anne's Cathedral from the northwest St Anne's Church, which preceded the cathedral Detail above entrance Interior The first architect was Sir Thomas Drew, the foundation stone being laid on 6 September 1899 by the Countess of Shaftesbury. The old parish church of St Anne by Francis Hiorne of 1776 had continued in use, up until 31 December 1903, while the new cathedral was constructed around it; the old church was then demolished. The Good Samaritan window, to be seen in the sanctuary, is the only feature of the old church to be retained in the cathedral. Initially, only the nave of the cathedral was built, and this was consecrated on 2 June 1904.\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p57: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 In 1924 it was decided to build the west front of the cathedral as a memorial to the Ulstermen and women who had served and died in the Great War. The foundation stone for this was laid by The 3rd Duke of Abercorn, Governor of Northern Ireland, on 2 June 1925 and the completed facade, to an amended design by the architect Sir Charles Archibald Nicholson, was dedicated in June 1927. In the meantime, the central crossing, in which the choir sits, was built between 1922 and 1924. The Baptistery, to plans drawn up by the late W.H. Lynn, who had assisted Sir Thomas Drew, was dedicated in 1928, and the Chapel of the Holy Spirit, with its beautiful mosaics depicting Saint Patrick, was dedicated on 5 July 1932, the 1500th anniversary of the arrival of St Patrick in Ireland. Edward, Lord Carson, the leader of the Unionist cause at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, was buried (with a state funeral) in the south aisle of the cathedral in 1935. In 1941 the cathedral was almost destroyed by a German bomb, which caused extensive damage to surrounding properties.Belfast Cathedral timeline, accessed 10/11/07 In 1955 work began on the construction of the ambulatory, at the east end of the cathedral. This work was dedicated in 1959, but it was not for another ten years that it was possible to begin work on the north and south transepts. The Troubles and inflation led to long delays and major problems with the financing of this work. The south transept, containing the Chapel of Unity, and with the organ loft above, was dedicated in 1974, and the north transept, with the large Celtic cross designed by John MacGeagh on the exterior, and housing the Chapel of the Royal Irish Rifles, was completed in 1981. In April 2007 a 40-metre stainless steel spire was installed on top of the cathedral. Named the \\"Spire of Hope\\", the structure is illuminated at night and is part of a wider redevelopment planned for the Cathedral Quarter.BBC News The base section of the spire protrudes through a glass platform in the cathedral's roof directly above the choir stalls, allowing visitors to view it from the nave. Annual charity In 1976, the Dean of Belfast, Samuel B. Crooks, started his annual Christmas 'Sit Out', spending the week leading up to Christmas on the steps of the cathedral, accepting donations large and small from passers-by, which were then distributed amongst many local charities. Dean Crooks soon became known as the \\"Black Santa\\", because of the outfit he wore to keep warm. The tradition has been continued by his successors. The week before Christmas each year, the Dean (currently Stephen Forde) and members of the cathedral chapter sit outside the cathedral from 9 a.m. till 5.30 p.m. each day to raise money for charity and are still collectively known as the 'Black Santa'. The tradition has raised several million pounds for charity.St Anne's Cathedral Black Santa St Anne's Cathedral Spire, December 2009 Cathedral Worship Services are held every day in the cathedral. Morning Prayer is said at 8:10 a.m.; Holy Communion at 8:30 a.m.; Midday Prayers at 1:00 p.m.; Choral Evensong 5:30 p.m. [Monday - Friday in term time, otherwise at Evening Prayer]; Evening Prayer Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. Holy Communion is also celebrated at 1:00pm on Wednesdays and Saints' Days and other Holy Days. On Sundays there are four services held in the cathedral, Holy Communion at 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., Choral Eucharist at 11:00 a.m. and Choral Evensong at 3:30 p.m. Organ The cathedral's organ with 4 manuals, is the second largest pipe-organ in Northern Ireland.

Gerontological nurses work in collaboration with older adults, their families, and communities to support healthy aging, maximum functioning, and quality of life. The term gerontological nursing, which replaced the term geriatric nursing in the 1970s, is seen as being more consistent with the specialty's broader focus on health and wellness, in addition to illness. Gerontological nursing is important to meet the health needs of an aging population. Due to longer life expectancy and declining fertility rates, the proportion of the population that is considered old is increasing. Between 2000 and 2050, the number of people in the world who are over age 60 is predicted increase from 605 million to 2 billion. The proportion of older adults is already high and continuing to increase in more developed countries. In 2010, seniors (aged 65 and older) made up 13% and 23% of the populations of the US and Japan, respectively. By 2050, these proportions will increase to 21% and 36%.  Scope  Gerontology nursing is a unique field in nursing which requires nurses to focus their care on older population. This population tend to have more comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart conditions, etc. This field requires complex care to fulfill their needs. Nurses are to be mindful of their long history for individualized care. Nurses use evidence based practice in their care to educate and promote well-being in gerontological population. Professional nursing involves the use of culturally competent care combined with scientific research to deliver clinical expertise. Geriatric nurses are expected to be skilled in patient care, treatment planning, education, mental health, and rehabilitation. They also take on many roles in the workplace. The main responsibility is as a caregiver. They can also be advocates, counselors, and educators for their patients. Gerontological nursing draws on knowledge about complex factors that affect the health of older adults. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to have one or more chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, hearing impairment, or a form of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. As well, drug metabolism changes with aging, adding to the complexity of health needs. There are many issues that arise as people age, which includes but are not limited to vision loss, hearing loss, dental issues, incontinence, and increased risk for falls . Gerontological nursing is complex and requires extensive interventions to keep the elderly safe. Nurses must be able to accommodate their patients for the vision loss, hearing loss, and dental issues. Elderly people with poor vision can be given reading materials with larger font, be provided with magnifying glasses, and brighter lighting . Interventions for hearing loss include finding a quiet place to talk among each other, speaking louder but not shouting, facing the person, speaking clearly, and providing gestures . Nursing may need to provide patients with dentures if teeth are missing to assist the patient in chewing their food . Incontinence care is crucial to preventing skin breakdown and skin infections such as candida albicans . Providing frequent incontinence care at least every two hours and skin barrier protection can decrease the chance of skin breakdown . Falls can cause fractures, hospitalizations, injuries, loss of independence, and possibly death . Many precautions can be implemented in preventing falls. Precautions include the elderly working with physical therapy to strengthen muscles and improve balance, wearing supportive shoes, making sure the environment is conducive to safety such as reducing clutter on the floor and the floor is dry, ensuring the room is well lit, and other interventions . Gerontological nurses work in a variety of settings, including acute care hospitals, rehabilitation, nursing homes (also known as long-term care homes and skilled nursing facilities), assisted living facilities, retirement homes, community health agencies, and the patient's home. The conditions of the geriatric patient's health determines what type of facility one should reside in. Assisted living facilities are also known as senior retirement homes, and they provide care services depending on health conditions. Skilled nursing, otherwise known as a nursing home, is a place where they can reside and get provided with 24/7 cares. Older adults have been referred to as \\"the core business of healthcare\\" by gerontological nursing experts. Population aging and the complexity of health care needs of some older adults means that older adults are more likely than younger people to use health care services. In many settings, the majority of patients are older adults. Thus, experts recommend that all nurses, not only those identified as gerontological nurses, need specialized knowledge about older adults. This position was endorsed by 55 US nursing specialty organizations. Including, GAPNA (formerly NCGNP) which was founded in 1981, by a group of Gerontological Nurse Practitioners with the intention of offering the first continuing education conferences designed specifically to meet the needs of advanced practice nurses providing care for older adults. Currently, GAPNA represents the interests of all advanced practice nurses who work with older adults. These advance practice nurses are active in a variety of settings across the continuum including primary, acute, post-acute and long-term care. GAPNA an organization for advanced practice nurses seeking continuing education in gerontological care as well as networking and peer support from experienced clinicians. = What Attracts Nurses to Gerontological Care = In the United States, caring for the elderly is predicted to be the quickest developing employment area in health care. The demand for nurses are high in geriatrics, however the nurses who are interested in geriatrics are low. Studies have found that less than 1% of nurses are certified in geriatrics and less than 3% of advanced practice nurses are certified in geriatrics. A qualitative, descriptive study was conducted by Negad (2017), it was found that to attract more nurse‚Äôs higher compensation and health insurance should be offered. Nurses should have safe working conditions, onsite training and education, support from administration, flexible scheduling and sign on bonuses. The last few decades have brought in more interest in older people as their numbers in society grow. More people than ever before are surviving to their senior years which substantially makes the demand for more working nurses in gerontology. Viewing aging as a natural process also develops more positive attitudes towards working with older adults. Gerontology study is becoming an important field in nursing and this is due to the increasing population of older adults. This increase requires an educated nursing staff who equipped to provide care to the needs of this growing aging population. There is a negative attitude towards old age and this bias can invoke negative feelings leading to great anxiety in many. Due to this prejudice, many fail to see the benefits and the opportunities that old age brings, focusing only on the challenges of old age. Gerontology educates people about old age and other issues that affect older adults. This field of study is important as it educates the public about the beauty of old age and it also encourages those advancing in age to embrace this change. Knowledge about the aging process not only helps people to understand the aging process but it also assists in helping older adults to achieve a better quality of life. = Gerontology vs Geriatrics = The terms Gerontology and Geriatrics are often used interchangeably, but there are differences between the two. Gerontology is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of ageing. Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. Gerontological Nurses need to know how to care for illnesses that affect the aging, the other factors affect aging, and how these impact people. History Gerontological nurses walk a tight rope stretching across the centuries from the past to the present that introduced the notion that those who entered could survive and recover. The modern hospital is 18th century innovation and those who entered were youths with acute injuries rather than chronic illnesses heavily seen in modern society. Beginning in the 1980s, nurse researchers have pursued answers on older adults about their well-being, and those suffering from serious chronic conditions. The NIH played a powerful role in advancement of geriatric nursing science in the 1980s and 1990s, since then the NIH has funding nurse investigators who are transforming understanding of gerontological nursing. Although nurses published articles about care of older adults as early as 1904, the specialty of gerontological nursing emerged beginning in the 1950s, with the publication of the first gerontological nursing textbook. Pioneers in the field of gerontological nursing include Vera McIver, Doris Schwartz, Mary Opal Walanin. Elderly woman A geriatric nursing specialty group was formed by the American Nurses Association in 1966, with the name changed to the Gerontological Nursing Division in 1976. In the US, the National Gerontological Nursing Association was founded in 1984 and in 1985 the Canadian Gerontological Nursing Association was founded. Standards of practice for gerontological nursing were published by the American Nurses Association in 1971. In the US, certification for geriatric nurse practitioners and clinical specialists were available in 1984. The specialty has advanced significantly since the 1990s through large scale education and practice development initiatives funded by the John A. Hartford Foundation, including the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing at New York University. Significant efforts to enhance nursing education have been made in the last decade. In 2010, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing and the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing published the Recommended Baccalaureate Competences and Curricular Guidelines for the Nursing Care of Older Adults. Between 2007 and 2009 the Geriatric Nursing Education Consortium created teaching tools and trained educators in the US to improve gerontological content in nursing education. A few initiatives that were taken to improve gerontological care is ‚ÄúThe Nurse Competence in Aging‚Äù project which focused on providing grants and assistance to over 50 specialty nursing organizations and provided nurses with a free online gerontological nursing resource center. This resource center can be assessed using the computer, an iPAD, or iPhone applications. The resource center provides nurses with the opportunity to review evidenced based articles to learn about how to care for the older adult. Another resource that was developed in 2009 was the Sigma Theta Tau‚Äôs center for Nursing Excellence in Long-Term Care. The Geriatric Nursing Leadership Academy was sponsored by Sigma Theta and it provided products and services to support nurse‚Äôs ability to grow professionally and become great leaders. Training and education Gerontological nursing includes generalist and specialist practice. A generalist is a registered nurse or Licensed Practical Nurse. A gerontological nurse specialist is an advanced practice nurse or nurse practitioner who has graduate education in gerontological nursing. Specific education in gerontological care is important for all nurses, even those who work outside of long-term care, because older adults make up a significant portion of patients across specialties. However, additional certification in Gerontological care is uncommon for registered nurses, with less than 1% being certified. Fewer than 3% of advance practice nurses in the United States have this certification. Registered nurses have the option of becoming certified in gerontological nursing. National nursing organizations such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center and the Canadian Nurses Association offer certification in gerontological nursing. Requirements for maintaining certification vary. The American Nurses Credentialing Center lists requirements as including 2 years experience as an RN, 2,000 hours of clinical experience and 30 hours of continuing education, both within the specialty of gerontological nursing. Post graduate certificates in gerontological nursing are also available by completing continuing education courses through colleges and universities. Gerontological nursing is often ignored within baccalaureate educational programs, with only 1/3rd of all schools requiring a specific course in geriatrics. This is due to educational programs focusing more attention on the sick rather than the well, who are more representative of the older population. Many nursing programs that do not have specific gerontological courses have instead integrated this content into the existing curriculum. 1/4th of all nursing programs in the United States do not have a gerontological staff member. To better identify those who are most qualified and experienced in managing patient care, there is an APRN Specialty Certification in Gerontology. This APRN Gerontological Specialist Certification (GS-c) distinguishes APRNs who possess expert knowledge, experience, and skill in managing the complex health needs of older adults. Due to the knowledge gap from nursing school to the work force, it is advised that nurse educators modify current curriculum to the fast growing elderly population by incorporating content specific to the care of the elderly from pre-licensure through the doctorate‚Äôs level. Researcher Cline was able to create a framework centering around the complexity of care among the elderly, that schools could use to educate students with the intention to improve quality of care. Another study by Hsu et al., revealed that nursing students were more likely to have a positive attitude towards older adults if they had good experiences in gerontological nursing courses and clinicals.  Issues in Gerontological Nursing  The nursing shortage continues to affect all aspects of nursing, and gerontological nursing is no exception. It is estimated that 50-150% more nurses will be needed in this speciality in the next decade. Often nursing students do not express a desire to work in gerontological nursing as their specialty. This can be due to negative stereotypes, misconceptions, and attitudes toward the aging that are common among nursing students. A study conducted by Garbrah et al. (2017) found that nursing students were less to work in gerontological nursing due to lack of experiences, negative experiences during clinicals, negative perceptions of aging, stereotypical attitudes, and prejudice. In order for nursing students to have an interest in gerontological nursing, students should first be introduced to healthy older adults. In addition, nurse educators should be enthusiastic, passionate, and knowledgeable about geriatrics. Nursing facilities should also implement age friendly curriculum to nursing students and current nursing staff. Another study conducted by Negad (2017) found a challenge nurse‚Äôs experience are having poor relationships with families and residents. Nurses in the study reported having difficulty caring for patients with unstable conditions such as dementia. Families will often have high expectations of the nurses, however due to the work load nurses were unable to perform some of the interventions that the residents needed. Gerontological nursing can be unpopular because geriatric nurses are sometimes perceived to be somewhat inferior in capabilities, or not good enough for other specialties. Facilities have also discouraged competent nurses from working in these settings by paying low salaries. Geriatric care facilities face a problem of staff retention of both professional workers (including registered nurses) and paraprofessionals (including nursing assistants). The American Healthcare Association found a turnover rate of 65% for registered nurses working in nursing homes. A study was conducted by White et al. (2019) and it was found that the work environment plays a major role in improving nurse retention in nursing homes. It was found that nursing homes with good versus poor working conditions were one-tenth as likely to feel dissatisfied with their job and one-eighth as likely to feel burned out when working in a good environment. A few interventions to improve staff retention and support nurses are to provide continuing education courses to nurses, preceptor programs should be provided to newly hire nurses, and, quality assurance programs should be implemented to help nurses identify areas that may need improvement. Burnout among nurses in geriatric care is common. Physical stressors, such as frequent heavy lifting, and emotional stressors, such as regularly encountering death, all contribute.

This example consists of an IEC 60320 C14 inlet connector and fuse holder. The fuse is protected by a sliding plastic cover, which requires the power lead to be removed before it can be opened. A power entry module (PEM) is an electromechanical component used in electrical appliances, integrating the appliance inlet with other components such as: * a switch, possibly including integrated or remote bowden cable actuation; * a circuit breaker, possibly including overload, overcurrent, or undercurrent protection, as well as remote triggering; * an appliance fuse holder; * a voltage selector; * an electromagnetic interference line filter; * an appliance outlet. Advantages of a power entry module over individual components: * compact dimensions; * unitized, standardized product with pre-assembled individual components; * efficient mounting; * alternative designs with similar dimensions may be substituted without major re-engineering; * protected, pre-wired, tested, and certified power components. Power entry modules are used to save labor in manufacturing electrical and electronic equipment powered by an external source, such as the AC powerline. They are also quite compact, taking up a small amount of space on the equipment‚Äôs chassis, or printed circuit board. Power entry modules frequently allow connections to the equipment circuitry using quick connect tab terminals, also known as blade connectors. An AC inlet connector allows use of a separate, detachable AC line cord that has the type of wall plug favored by the locality. IEC 60320 AC inlet connectors typically used can handle either 120 or 250 volts. Since most power entry modules connect to the AC powerline, they are subject to safety standards set by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik (VDE), and many other safety standards agencies such as the BSI Group (BSI). Power entry module manufacturers take on the responsibility of producing power entry module products in such a way that they meet the standards of one or more of these safety standard agencies, so that equipment manufacturers using them need not take responsibility for the internal details of safety certification. Power entry module manufacturers also pay independent testing labs to test their products against the safety standards, so that the products can carry the safety agency‚Äôs approval mark. Typical AC power entry modules often have dielectric strengths of 2000 volts or more, and can handle currents of up to 10 to 20 amperes at 250 volts maximum. Exceeding the ratings can cause unsafe operation and must be avoided. Medical devices can and do take advantage of power entry modules. Power entry modules are available with electromagnetic interference filters with very low leakage current ratings, even those suitable for direct patient contact in accordance with UL 544 and IEC 60601-1. Shock-safe fuseholders have also been integrated into power entry modules. These devices require a tool to remove the fuse for replacement. DC (Direct current) power entry modules have been less common, but are finding popularity with equipment manufacturers, especially those that supply equipment in both AC- and DC-powered versions. The DC-powered versions of such equipment are frequently used in telephone exchange applications. Power entry modules are also available rated as water resistant at IP65, with seal protection at the panel opening, around the fuse holders when provided, and between the inlet housing and connector pins.

They specifically address the identification of general principles governing information processing by neuronal circuits, and the development of imaging technologies and computational methods for image analysis. In 2017, it announced a new research area, mechanistic cognitive neuroscience. There are also several other ongoing projects: high-throughput characterizing of behavioral phenotypes on genetically defined small neural lesions in Drosophila, the development of large-scale neuroanatomical data for Drosophila (at the light and electron microscopy levels), and improving the technology so even larger anatomical projects can be approached in the future. In July 2018, this yielded the first entire full-brain image of Drosophila with neuronal resolution. The center was designed to emulate the unconstrained and collaborative environments at AT&T; Bell Laboratories and Cambridge's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Researchers are on six-year contracts and fully internally funded, independent of traditional research grant funding. Gerald M. Rubin was the first executive director of Janelia, and saw it from concept through construction to operation. Ronald Vale took over as director in early 2020. There are roughly 50 research laboratories headed by senior researchers; they include Eric Betzig, Barry Dickson, Tamir Gonen, Lynn Riddiford, and Robert Tjian. Campus The original Janelia Farm house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the property was purchased by HHMI from the Dutch software maker Baan Companies in December 2000. The campus features a 900-foot (270 m) long, arc-shaped laboratory known as the Landscape Building. The building, designed by Rafael Vi√±oly, deep at the ground floor, is built into a hill and designed to be the primary research facility. Site and landscape design were completed by Dewberry in 2006 and include over four acres of green roof meadow plantings which blend the building into the surrounding site. Additional landscape enhancements were designed by Lewis Scully Gionet, Inc., and were completed in fall 2008 (and won an Honor Award from the Maryland and Potomac chapters of the American Society of Landscape Architects). This work includes an architectural water feature, expanded path network, and siting of multiple pieces of artwork, as well as comprehensive planting additions constructed by Ruppert Nurseries. Community involvement Together with the Loudoun Academy of Science, HHMI donates approximately $1 million annual support for science education through the Loudoun County Public School District. Janelia also hosts a quarterly public lecture series for the public.  References   Further reading  * Gerald M.

Evolution Chilean mythology covers of a large collection of myths and legends from the beliefs of Chile's indigenous groups (Mapuche, Tehuelche, Aymaras, Changos, Diaguitas, Picunches, Pehuenches, Huilliches, Poyas and more). Their mythology shows a significant influence by European colonization, mainly during the Spanish colonial period. These influences have helped Chilean mythology to evolve and become distinct from other local mythologies such as Chilota mythology. The varied terrain and climate throughout Chile further influenced the development of beliefs and myths that expanded the country's collective culture. Mythological division In the study classification of ‚Ä≥Chilean mythology‚Ä≥, the myths are typically categorized geographically into Northern, Central, Easter Island and Southern Zones. =Northern Zone= These myths and legends involve characters closely related to the desert, religious devotion and mining. Examples include the myth of Alicanto, la Lola, el Yastay, the Achaches, the Umpillay, and the Quilpan√°. Other legends are Juan Soldado, the treasure of Guayac√°n, the Payachatas, La Tirana and the virgin of Andacollo. The northern myths draw upon the Inca and pre-Incan civilizations, but they became distinguished through a rooted base in Spanish colonialism. =Central Zone= These myths assimilated of many mythological characters from Mapuche tribal beliefs. The Spanish initially settled in the central zone, the most populated, leading to a unique mixture. This zone hosts many legends modified from the oral tradition. Some of the mythical figures include Pedro Urdemales, la Calchona, la Llorona, el Culebr√≥n, el Chonch√≥n and the Piuch√©n. Legends include the Inca Lagoon, the Burial of Cacique Vitacura and Rere's Bell. Additionally, stories discuss the appearance of the devil and encounters with witches. Another is the legend of the treasure of Juan Fern√°ndez, in the Juan Fern√°ndez archipelago. =Easter Island = The most important myth source is Easter Island. The inhabitants of Easter Island, the Polynesian Rapa Nui people, created singular explanations about the creation of man and their land. Examples of these myths include: Make-Make and Aku-Aku. =Southern Zone= This zone was also influenced by Mapuche indigenous beliefs. Legends include the City of the Caesars, The Three Pascuales, and spirits of Mapuche beliefs like Pill√°n, the Wangul√©n, the Wekufes, the Anchimall√©n, Tented and Caicos, and the Cuero. Chilo√© The Chilo√© Archipelago has its own stories, due to the geographical isolation and the union of indigenous and Spanish traditions. Natural phenomena such as mist, strong winds, thick forests, and rough seas feature in legends there. The most important are the Caleuche and the Trauco, followed by the Fiura, the Pincoya, the Invunche, the Camahueto, the Basilisco chilote, and the Millalobo. Mythologies and Legends The most important sources are: *Indigenous: Mapuche mythology Rapa Nui mythology *Others: Chilota mythology City of the Caesars Alicanto Iconography Marcela Donoso, a Chilean painter, made a set of oil paintings describing 30 Chilean myths.

He competed in fifteen Grand National Series events in his career. His win in Atlanta in 1961 made him the only Nebraska-born driver to win a race on the NASCAR circuit. Burdick made his debut in 1959, where he won the pole at Trenton Speedway in his first career NASCAR start. Although a fire took Burdick out of the event early, he earned his first career top-10 finish with a 9th-place effort in the next race at Nashville Speedway USA. After a crash at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Burdick ended the year with finishes of 6th, 6th and 2nd, including a pole at Columbia Speedway. During the entire year, Burdick led 25 laps (when he finished 2nd at Darlington) and never started worse than 9th. In addition, the 21st-place finish in points was Burdick's career best. Burdick had a scant schedule in 1960, only competing in two events, both at Daytona International Speedway. Burdick made it into the prestigious Daytona 500 field after finishing 7th in the qualifier race (the Daytona qualifiers were points races until 1971), but only managed to finish 60th in the actual 500. Burdick was able to rebound in 1961, finishing in the top-ten (8th) once again in the Daytona qualifier event. After another dismal finish in the 500, Burdick made up for it at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Burdick led 43 of the 334 laps and held off Rex White for Burdick's lone career victory. Following the triumph, Burdick ended the year with a 4th place at Darlington Speedway and 27th at Charlotte Motor Speedway, now named Lowe's Motor Speedway. Burdick once again was left to the Daytona races in 1962, as his career wound down. He finished 7th in the qualifying race, his final career top-ten, easily making the Daytona 500. Burdick then had a dismal 35th- place finish in the 500, and never again made another Cup event.

Clayton Vale is an area of green space in Clayton, Manchester, through which the River Medlock flows. Redeveloped in 1986, the land has a rich industrial and social history. Today the area is a natural habitat for wildlife and it has been designated a Local Nature Reserve. Natural history Fossils of plants and insects in the rocks of the area show a very different climate to what we see today. Swamp forests and luxuriant growth were encouraged by the warm moist air. At the start of the Triassic Period, Britain was largely covered by desert. The land sank producing a great salt lake over much of northern Britain, after which the desert conditions returned. Clayton Vale pre-1986 The Vale landscape was somewhat different before the late 1970s. The valley was home to many buildings from Bank Bridge Works and Tannery to The Smallpox Hospital. ;Bank Bridge Works and Tannery The chimney behind the Jewish Cemetery of Philips Park is all that remains of the once extensive complex, which was once shown on Johnson's Map of 1820. ;The Smallpox Hospital When the Manchester Ship Canal opened, and the city became an inland port, an isolation hospital was required to nurse sailors with infectious diseases. Originally known as Clayton Infectious Diseases Hospital, it was shown on the Ordnance Survey map of 1909. By 1933, it became known as Clayton Smallpox Hospital. On the north bank of the River Medlock, opposite the site of the print works, the foundation stone is clearly visible along with brick walling on top of the stonework. To the south of the river stood the nurses home, known as Clayton House. The site also contained other associated buildings. ;The Old Print Works Standing near Clayton Bridge, on the sharp bend of the river on the south bank was Clayton Vale Print Works. This was shown again on Johnson's Map of 1820, but by 1888 the OS map shows the works as being disused and in 1909 the ten buildings of the complex were demolished leaving little to be seen today. However, foundation stone can be seen in the river bed. ;Culcheth Dye Works Shown on the 1893 OS map as a collection of buildings with large reservoirs. Because the more modern dye works made a greater demand on the water supply than could be provided by the river, the industry, known as Failsworth Dyeing and Finishing Works, fell into disuse in the late 1960s. The site has since been landscaped. The works once stood next to the present day Visitors Centre. ;River Maintenance and Notable Bridges in the Vale A bridge, situated where Edge Lane meets Berry Brow, is mentioned as far back as 1696. Today, a stone bridge stands, known as Clayton Bridge. Before this there was a ford, suggesting an ancient river crossing which might have been used since prehistoric times. In 1872, the River Medlock rose suddenly and tore away part of the printworks complex, as well as washing away between 40 and 50 bodies from Philips Park Cemetery. After this, the river was lined with red bricks to prevent such a disaster from happening again. It is because of the red brick lining that the river is sometimes called 'The Red River'. This type of river engineering can be seen from the bridge nearby. In recent years, more river engineering has taken place further up the river bank, near the red brick bridge (known as Vale Street Bridge). The river course was changed in the early 1960s as steep stone walls were installed to prevent flooding. ;Coates Farm Coates Farm held a summer gala for local children before the First World War, with races, tea and lemonade. The stone wall next to the river is probably one of the remaining walls of the farmhouse. Edge Lane, Millstream Lane and Berry Brow is known locally as Pop Brew and the vale was also known locally as \\"the meddie\\". Coates farm was cleared by 1960 and a road was made taking Dustbin waste carts to a landfill site along the valley. The pig sty for the farm was demolished during World War Two and in its place stood an ARP Warden hut. a new build visitor centre now stands near the site of the old farm. Manchester Central Library online photo archive is a source, and can be accessed via a link below. ;The Bay Horse Inn and Clayton Bridge as a Hamlet Originally a farm building, it became a pub in the 19th century - known then as The Grey Mare. The inn served the small hamlet of Clayton Bridge which sprang up in the 18th and 19th centuries as a result of the dye and print works. It was home to many dwellings, including Andrews Brew - once a small lane off Berry Brow, it housed thatched roof cottages which were pulled down in the early 1990s. Saint Cuthbert Church was also erected around this time, but has since been demolished. Other Victorian terraced houses lined the west side of Berry Brow as it rose to the level crossing at Clayton Bridge railway station, the east side still being occupied by fields into the 1950s. ;Clayton Bridge Railway Station Clayton Bridge railway station on the line between Manchester and Stalybridge opened in April 1846 and became a victim of the Beeching Axe, closing in 1968. The station buildings were to the west of Berry Brow, the signal box was on the opposite side on the north of the line and was also used to manually operate the level crossing gates. Nothing remains of the station. ;Railway branch line In 1904, a railway branch line was completed which ran south through Clayton Vale to the Stuart Street Power Station. The line was later extended in 1916, across Ashton New Road into the Clayton Aniline Company works. For many years, waste coal ash from the power station was transported on the line and dumped as landfill into Clayton Vale. Clayton Vale post 1986 Before the mid-nineteen eighties, the land was heavily polluted with recent landfills and general neglect, and the buildings of the vale had either been vandalised or demolished. Redevelopment of the land went under way, known as the Medlock Valley Scheme. The area has been described as a shining example of urban country parkland and a haven for wildlife by The Heritage Trail. Trees were planted in the mid-1980s and after two decades stands a semi-mature forest, home to black-and-white blackbirds and squirrels in the taller trees. Silver birch, ash, sycamore, willow and poplars line to the top of the dell.

Synthesis Figure 1: Camellia japonica Emodepside is synthesised by attaching a morpholine ring ‚Äúat the paraposition of each of the two D-phenyllactic acids‚Äù to PF1022A, a metabolite of Mycelia sterile, a fungus that inhabits the leaves of Camellia japonicaMechanisms of action of emodespide - A Horder et al. ‚Äì a flowering shrub. Anthelmintic effects When applied to nematodes, emodepside has been shown to have a range of effects, inhibiting muscle in the parasitic nematode Ascaris sumIonophore and anthelmintic activity of PF 1022A, a cyclooctadepsipeptide, are not related - Gesner et al. and inhibiting locomotive and pharyngeal movement in Caenorhabditis elegans in addition to having effects in other tissues such as the inhibition of egg laying. Mechanism of action One of the ways in which this drug achieves its effects has been shown to be through binding to a group of G-protein coupled receptors called latrophilins, first identified as being target proteins for Œ±-latrotoxin (the other target protein of Œ±-LTX being neurexin, a membrane receptor with laminin-like extracellular domains), a component of black widow spider venom that can cause paralysis and subsequent death in nematodes and humans alike. LAT-1 (1014 amino acids, 113 KDa coded by the B0457.1 gene) and LAT-2 (1338 amino acids, 147 KDa coded by the B0286.2 gene)Wormbase are located presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction in Caenorhabditis elegans and share 21% amino acid identity with each other (the amino acid sequence homology LAT-1 shares with rat, bovine and human latrophilins has been shown to be 22, 23 and 21% respectively). Figure 2: Hypothesized structure of the LAT-1 receptor. Ref: An original drawing by James Buckley based on information from. Following receptor-ligand binding, a conformational change induced in the receptor activates the Gq protein, freeing the GqŒ± subunit from the Œ≤Œ≥ complex. The GqŒ± protein then goes on to couple-to and activate the signaling molecule phospholipase-C-Œ≤, a protein that has been identified as being key to the modulation of regulatory pathways of vesicle release in C.elegans. In its signaling cascade, PLC-Œ≤ (like other phospholipases) hydrolyses phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate to yield inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).The molecular biology of the cell - Alberts et al. As IP3 receptors have sparse or little distribution throughout the pharyngeal nervous system of C.elegans (one of the tissues where LAT-1 agonists such as Œ±-LTX and emodepside have their most predominant effects) and Œ≤-phorbel esters (which mimic the effects of DAG) have been shown to have a stimulatory action on synaptic transmission, it has been concluded that it is the DAG component of the cascade that regulates neurotransmitter release. Indeed, in C.elegans DAG regulates UNC-13, a plasma-membrane associated protein critical for vesicle-mediated neurotransmitter release and mutational studies have shown that two UNC-13 reduction of function mutants show resistance to emodepside, observations supporting this hypothesized mechanism of action. The mechanism by which activation of UNC-13 results in neurotransmitter release (the ultimate result of latrophilin activation) is through interaction with the synaptosomal membrane protein syntaxin, with UNC-13 binding to the N-terminus of syntaxin and promoting the switch from the closed form of syntaxin (which is incompatible with SNARE complex synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and syntaxin formation) to its open formation so that SNARE complex formation can be achieved, thereby allowing vesicle fusion and release to take place. At a molecular level, the net result of the activation of this pathway, is the spontaneous stimulation of inhibitory PF1-like neuropeptide release (this is suspected due to Emodepside's inhibition of acetylcholine-elicited muscle contraction requiring both calcium ions and extracellular potassium ions, similar to the action of PF1/PF2). Although in experiments on synaptosomes, Œ±-LTX triggered non-calcium dependent exocytosis of vesicles containing acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA,Role of calcium in neurotransmitter release evoked by alpha-latrotoxin or hypertonic sucrose - Khvotchev et al. both glutamate and GABA have been ruled out as the sole neurotransmitters responsible for emodepside's action) which then acts on the post-synaptic membrane (i.e. the pharyngeal/muscle membrane) of the nematode, having an inhibitory effect thereby either inducing paralysis or inhibiting pharyngeal pumping, both of which ultimately result in the death of the organism. Diagram Mutational studies involving LAT-1 knockout and LAT-2 gene deletion mutants have revealed that the role of latrophilin receptors in the different tissues that they are expressed differs between subtypes, with LAT-1 being expressed in the pharynx of C.elegans (thereby modulating pharyngeal pumping) and LAT-2 having a role in locomotion. In addition to exerting an effect on the nematode via binding to Latrophilin receptors, there is also recent evidence that indicates that emodepside also interacts with the BK potassium channel coded by the gene Slo-1.A possible mechanism for the action of the novel anthelmintic emodepside, using Ascaris suum body wall muscle preparations - Willson et al. This protein (see figure for structure) is a member of the 6 transmembrane helix structural class of potassium ion channels with each subunit consisting of 6 transmembrane helices and 1 P domain (this P domain is conserved in all potassium ion channels and forms the selectivity filter that enables the channel to transport potassium ions across the membrane in great preference to other ions).Potassium channels in C. elegans - Salkoff et al. These subunits group together to form high conductance BK-type channels that are gated by both membrane potential and intracellular calcium levels (this calcium ion sensing ability is accommodated by an intracellular tail region on Slo-like subunits that form a calcium ion binding motif consisting of a run of conserved aspartate residues, termed a ‚Äúcalcium bowl‚Äù), with their physiological role being to regulate the excitability of neurons and muscle fibres, through the way in which they participate in action potential repolariziation (with potassium ion efflux being used to repolarize the cell following depolarization). The presumable effect that emodepside interaction with these channels would exert on the neuron would be to activate the channel causing potassium ion efflux, hyper-polarization and subsequent inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter effect (acetylcholine if acting at the neuromuscular junction), having an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission, the production of postsynaptic action potentials and ultimately muscle contraction (manifesting itself as paralysis or reduced pharyngeal pumping). Which out of Latrophilin receptors and BK-potassium channels is emodepside's primary site of action remains to be completely deduced. Both LAT-1/LAT-2 and slo-1 mutants (reduction/loss of function) show significant resistance to emodepside with it being conceivable that the presence of both is required for emodepside to induce its full effect. Therapeutic use The patent for emodepside is owned by the Bayer Health Care group and is sold in combination with another anthelmintic (praziquantel) for topical application under the tradename Profender.

History The land where the gardens were located, located outside the Servian Wall, was purchased by Lucius Aelius Lamia, the Roman consul in 3 CE and friend of Tiberius, who developed the initial gardens on the land. Upon the deaths of Tiberius and Caligula, who developed the property, the gardens became imperial property and Caligula was briefly buried at the site.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars: Life of Caligula, 121 CE.

Rodolfo Lanciani began excavations in the area in the nineteenth century but his work was not completed. The immense building complex of the Horti Lamiani was brought to light in these excavations but was quickly re-buried. Decorations of the complex included frescoes, architectural elements in coloured marbles, and innumerable bronze sheets with inset gemstones.

Over the course of his illustration career, Hunt has created works for a wide variety of clients, including Bank of America, CBS Records, Criterion Collection, Dreamworks, Disney, Federal Express, MGM, The New Republic, Paramount, Random House, Rolling Stone, Universal Studios, The Wall Street Journal, Williams- Sonoma, Inc., and many more. Early life and education Robert Hunt was born in 1952 in Berkeley, California and attended High School at San Rafael High School in San Rafael, California. Hunt's grandparents lived a few miles from his family home and he would frequently visit his Grandfather who had suffered a stroke. The stroke left his grandfather with the use of only one arm and during visits he often emphasized the importance of appreciating the ability to do things with ones hands and to try make the most of your hands to create things that solve problems. The artist found early inspiration in what he observed growing up in the late 1960s. Films by Stanley Kubrick and David Lean inspired Hunt to imagine that a life as a creative artist was a possibility. Hunt attended university as an under-graduate at UC Davis, where he initially sought a degree in fine art and film making. With the encouragement of UC Davis professor Wayne Thiebaud, he later switched his undergraduate major to art history. After graduating from UC Davis with a degree in Art History in 1976, Hunt briefly taught mathematics at Esparto Middle School in Esparto, California. In 1978 Hunt went on to attend The Academy of Art in San Francisco where he was one of two students in the graduate illustration program. The other student was Kazuhiko 'Kazu' Sano, who would notably go on to illustrate the movie poster for \\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. The director of the illustration program at the Academy of Art when Hunt and Kazu attended was Barbara Bradley, one of the first women to pursue and succeed in commercial illustration. Bradley taught clothed figure drawing and heads and hands, and Hunt attended daily classes with her for one year. Hunt credits her with teaching him to turn off his ego while drawing. Hunt would graduate with an MFA from the Academy of Art in 1980. Illustration career =Getting started= Although the majority of work in illustration was coming from magazines and book publishers based in New York City in the early 1980s, delivering art from Hunt's home in San Francisco became a viable option with FedEx going nationwide to 90 cities in 1980. The San Francisco-based illustrator, David Grove had forged a successful career in illustration from the West Coast and Hunt, along with his friend Kazu decided that they could as well. Hunt's first published work appeared in 1980, at age 28 for Listen Magazine. His first appearance in the Society of Illustrators Annual came in 1983, with a piece titled Hidden Victims for Listen Magazine. His first book cover assignment was with Bantam Books in 1984, under the art direction of Jerry Counihan., for the book The Walking Drum by Louis L'Amour Notable works =DreamWorks logo= In 1994 Hunt was commissioned by Steven Spielberg to create the DreamWorks logo. Spielberg originally imagined a CGI generated image of a man fishing from the moon. On the recommendation of Senior Visual Effects Supervisor, Dennis Muren that the image instead be an original painting, Hunt was called in to execute the final image on which the motion version was based. The final motion logo took Hunt three months to complete and features a boy fishing from the moon. The model Hunt used for the child was his own son, William Hunt. =New Republic covers= Hunt was featured in an 11-year retrospective of New Republic covers by The Society of Publication Designers for his December 2, 2009 cover titled Trial By Fire picturing the back of President Barack Obama's head, art directed by Christine Car and Joseph Heroun. New Republic listed Hunt's October 20, 2011 cover portrait of US Presidential contender Rick Perry as an art director pick of the year. =Motion graphics= In addition to Hunt's motion logo for DreamWorks, the artist has created motion logos for Random House Worlds , and Broad Green Pictures =Book cover illustrations= Some of Robert Hunt's hundreds of book covers: *A Million Ways to Die in the West by Seth MacFarlane *Coming Out by Danielle Steel *Hidden Cities by Daniel Fox *Jade Man's Skin by Daniel Fox *Medusa's Country by Larissa Shmailo *Outlander by Diana Gabaldon (20th Anniversary Edition) *SuperFreakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen J.

It operated from 1886 to 1991. From the beginning of its existence through February 19, 1991, the railroad had but one purpose ‚Äî to bring loads of coal from the mines of Preston County to the B&O; interchange at Tunnelton for shipment to points far removed from the mountains of Appalachia. Until the late 1980s West Virginia Northern crews could be found somewhere along its roller coaster route switching its numerous coal tipples. The line became a tourist railroad in August 1994, operated by Kingwood Northern, Inc. The tourist operation ran until 1999, when its \\"First Annual Railfan Weekend\\" was abruptly announced to be its final run. Locomotives and equipment remained on site until 2002, when the two remaining locomotives unceremoniously ran the line one final time under their own power from Kingwood shops to the CSX interchange at Tunnelton, where they were picked up and moved to a Pittsburgh suburb for storage (they were moved again in 2005 to Eighty Four, Pennsylvania). Tracks were removed by 2005, leaving behind sparse evidence that a railroad ever existed there, with the exception of the trackless Kingwood shop area and ties stored near the former site of Marion Siding. Disposition As of 2020, the Preston County Parks & Recreation Commission is in the planning and development phase of creating the West Virginia Northern Rail Trail, after the right of way was acquired from the Kern Valley Railroad, who had purchased the line in the early 2000s for its scrap resources. Most of the structures at the former Kingwood Junction yard were removed in the late 2010s, although plans are in place to re-construct the old water tower in a slightly different location as the \\"gateway\\" for the new recreational trail. Virtual Train Simulator In 2017, the Virtual New Haven RR, a group that had previously developed a virtual train simulator game of the New Haven Railroad's Springfield line, released a new train simulator game based on the West Virginia Northern Railroad's route and surrounding topography and features. The game, released as the \\"B&O; Kingwood Branch\\", includes nearly identical re-creations of the Kingwood Junction and Tunnelton yards, as well as a fairly accurate representation of the prototype railroad between the two points, inclusive of the double switchback, towns, grade crossing locations, and coal mines along the route. The game can be acquired through Dovetail Games and Steam.

Burgh also ran a dissenting academy and wrote on subjects such as educational reform. In the words of Lyndall Gordon, his widow acted as \\"fairy godmother\\" to early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, then a young and unpublished schoolmistress, helping her to set up her own boarding school. Wollstonecraft entitled her first book Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), alluding to Burgh's Thoughts on Education (1747) which in turn alludes to John Locke's 1693 work, Some Thoughts Concerning Education. Life and works Burgh was born and raised in Madderty, Scotland. His father was a minister of the parish in the Church of Scotland. Burgh was raised a Presbyterian, which strongly contributed to his fight for moral issues. He attended St. Andrews University with the intention of studying for the ministry. An illness prevented him from completing his degree and he entered the linen trade. Failure at that sent him to England in the early 1740s. For a short time he was a printer's helper and then in 1746 he became an assistant master (teacher) in an academy just north of London. The next year, he became master (principal) of his own academy in Stoke Newington. In 1750, he moved his school to nearby Newington Green, and ran it there for 19 years.William Robinson. The history and antiquities of the parish of Stoke Newington in the county of Middlesex. J.B. Nichols and Son, 1842 ‚Äì 296 pages. In 1754, Burgh's The Dignity of Human Nature was published. This is his first major publication, and one that bears a striking resemblance to Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac. In 1761, Burgh wrote The Art of Speaking, an educational book focusing on oratory. In 1766, he wrote the first volume of Crito, a collection of essays on religious toleration, contemporary politics, and educational theories. The second volume followed a year later. This is his first work that included a strong emphasis on politics. Burgh became involved in the early 1760s with a group called the Honest Whigs, a club that met on alternate Thursday evenings in a coffeehouse, then an important social and political meeting place. Other members of the group included Richard Price, Joseph Priestley, Benjamin Franklin, James Boswell and others. In 1774, Burgh wrote his most popular work, Political Disquisitions. The three-volume work was intended by Burgh to be longer, but his deteriorating health caused him to stop after the third volume. Burgh died a year later on 26 August 1775. Political Disquisitions (1774) Of the three volumes of Political Disquisitions, the third is the most widely referenced. The book was inspired by the radical reform movement of the time, and includes many of Burgh's feelings on social, religious, political and educational reforms. Burgh also includes many other authors in the book, with the strongest influence being that of John Locke. Thomas Jefferson included the work with other writings in a course of recommended reading for James Madison and James Monroe. In 1803, while Jefferson was president of the United States, he urged the work on Congress. The book was popular among American colonists and became a source of inspiration for American Revolutionaries. =Quotations= From chapter 9, \\"Of the Liberty of Speech and Writing on Political Subjects\\", on public versus private liberty: :That all history shows the necessity, to the preservation of liberty, of every subjects having a watchful eye on the conduct of Kings, Ministers, and Parliament, and of every subjects being not only secured, but encouraged in alarming his fellow subjects on occasion of every attempt upon public liberty. On the consequences of libel: \\"Punishing libels public or private is foolish, because it does not answer the end, and because the end is a bad one, if it could be answered.\\" Burgh thought libel was acceptable as long as the accusation was aimed only at the political conduct. Private matters were not to be slandered. He explained this by saying that \\"we are to take care of the public safety at all adventures.\\" Public libel was not a crime to Burgh, but rather \\"the unavoidable inconvenience attendant upon a high station, which he who dislikes must avoid, and keep himself private.\\" On freedom of speech with limitations: :No man ought to be hindered saying or writing what he pleases on the conduct of those who undertake the management of national affairs, in which all are concerned, and therefore have the right to inquire, and to publish their suspicions concerning them. For if you punish the slanderer, you deter the fair inquirer. On the possession of firearms: :No kingdom can be secured otherwise than by arming the people. The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He, who has nothing, and who himself belongs to another, must be defended by him, whose property he is, and needs no arms. But he, who thinks he is his own master, and has what he can call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself, and what he possesses; else he lives precariously, and at discretion.

His name is used without the title \\"Rabbi\\" because, like Ben Azzai, he died at a young age, remaining in the grade of \\"pupil\\" and never receiving semikhah (Rabbinical ordination). Ben Zoma and Ben Azzai are often mentioned together distinguished representatives of this class. Like Ben Azzai, also, he seems to have belonged to the inner circle of Joshua ben Hananiah's disciples, and a halakhic controversy between them is reported in which Ben Zoma was the victor.Naz. 8:1 Esoteric contemplation Ben Zoma was specially noted as an interpreter of the Jewish Scriptures, so that it was said, \\"With Ben Zoma died the last of the exegetes\\" (\\"darshanim\\").So·π≠ah 9:15 The principal subject of Ben Zoma's exegetic research was the first chapter of Genesis. One of his questions on this chapter, in which he took exception to the phrase \\"God made\\",Genesis 1:7 has been handed down by the Judean aggadists (though without the answer), with the remark, \\"This is one of the Biblical passages by which Ben Zoma created a commotion all over the world\\".Genesis Rabbah 4 An interpretation of the second verse of the same chapter has been handed down in a tannaitic tradition, together with the following anecdote: Joshua ben Hananiah was walking one day, when he met Ben Zoma, who was about to pass him without greeting. Thereupon Joshua asked: \\"Whence and whither, Ben Zoma?\\" The latter replied: \\"I was lost in thoughts concerning the account of the Creation.\\" And then he told Joshua his interpretation of Genesis 1:2. When speaking to his disciples on the matter, Joshua said, \\"Ben Zoma is outside,\\" meaning thereby that Ben Zoma had passed beyond the limit of permitted research.Tosefta, Hagigah 2:5,6; compare Hagigah 15a As a matter of fact, Ben Zoma was one of the four who entered into the \\"garden\\" of esoteric knowledge (see Ben Azzai). It was said of him that he beheld the secrets of the garden and \\"was struck\\" with mental aberration.·∏§ag. 14b The disciples of Akiva applied to the limitless theosophic speculations, for which Ben Zoma had to suffer, the words of Proverbs 25:16, \\"Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled with it, and vomit it\\".Tosefta, Hagiga 2:5,6; Babylonian Talmud Hagigah l.c.; compare Midrash Mishlei on 25:16  Halachic teachings  Ben Zoma's erudition in the halakhah became proverbial, for it was said, \\"Whoever sees Ben Zoma in his dream is assured of scholarship\\".Berachot 57b Only a few of Ben Zoma's exegetic teachings have been preserved. The most widely known of these is his interpretation of the phrase, \\"that you may remember the day when you came forth out of Egypt\\" to prove that the recitation of the biblical passage referring to the Exodus is obligatory for the evening prayer as well as for the morning prayer. This interpretation, quoted with praise by Eleazar ben Azariah,Berachot 1:5 has found a place in the Haggadah for the Passover night. In a halakhic interpretation, Ben Zoma explains the word \\"na·∏≥i\\" (clean) in Exodus 21:28 by referring to the usage of the word in everyday life.Bava Kamma 41a; Kiddushin 56b; Pesachim 22b) Aggadah Ben Zoma, seeing the crowds on the Temple Mount, said, \\"Blessed be He who created all these to attend to my needs. How much had Adam to weary himself withal, until he could find a morsel of bread to eat! He ploughed [the ground], and then sowed it, and then harvested [the grain], and then bound it into sheaves, and then threshed it, and then winnowed it, and then cleansed it, and then ground it, and then sifted it, and then kneaded it, and then baked it, and only then did he eat it; but I get up in the morning and find all this ready before me. How much had Adam to weary himself withal, until he could find clothing to wear! He sheared [the sheep], bleached [the wool], combed and carded it, spun it, wove it, and only then did he find that which to clothe himself; but I rise up in the morning and find all this ready before me. All skilled trades come early at my door, and I have but to rise and I find all these things before me!\\"Berakhot 58a In the closing words of Ecclesiastes, \\"for this is the whole man,\\" he found the thought expressed, that the pious man is the crown and end of mankind; the whole race (\\"the whole world\\") was created only to be of service to him who fears God and respects His commandments.Berachot 6b; Shabbat 30b; see Arukh, s.v., 5 =Quotes= *Ben Zoma would say: ::Who is wise? He who learns from everyone. As is stated: \\"From all my teachers I have grown wise\\"; ::Who is strong? He who controls his impulses.

Tucci's coaching style was immediately beneficial and the veteran group of seniors helped turn the Hornets around. Tucci installed a Wing-T offense and a rarely seen 6-2 defense, which proved to be one of the best defenses in the Inter Valley Conference. The Hornets started the year with three straight shutouts over Berlin Center Western Reserve, Sandy Valley and East Canton.

The legend Now a village of just 1,000 inhabitants, Stavoren was once a wealthy port city in the Dutch province of Friesland but began to decline in the late Middle Ages after a sandbank formed outside the harbour, blocking ships from entering and exiting. Several stories have been told over the years to explain the forming of the sandbank, including the tale of the Lady of Stavoren. The story, of which more than 27 versions are known, involves an exceedingly rich patrician merchant widow, who desired ever greater riches. She sent a captain of her merchant fleet out in search of the greatest treasure in the world. When he returned with wheat, declaring wheat to be \\"the most precious thing in the world,\\" as it can feed the hungry, the widow, in her overweening pride and anger at his (as she perceived it) foolishness, let the wheat be thrown overboard into the harbour of Stavoren. When she was cautioned against this wicked behaviour, being reminded of the fickleness of fate and (despite her wealth and power) of the delicateness of her station, in hubris she took a ring from her finger and cast it into the ocean, declaring that she was as likely to fall into poverty as she was of regaining the ring. Soon afterwards, during a banquet thrown for her fellow Hanseatic merchant princes, she finds the ring inside a large fish served to her. As this event portended, she lost her wealth, living out her remaining years in destitution, begging for scraps of bread. In divine retribution the port had silted, and the wheat that had been cast overboard now grew in the resulting sandbank that closed the harbour and ruined the city. The tale shares its basic motif with the story of the Ring of Polycrates found in Herodotus.See generally, Herodotus' Histories, ss. 3.39-60, 3.120-125, 3.142-149, relating to Samos. Its Aarne-Thompson index number is 736A. The Lady made her first entrance in the Friesland Chronicle of Ocko Scarlensis (1597) and the story was gradually elaborated thereafter. The sandbar on which only empty ears of wheat will grow was added in the eighteenth century, while the motif of the discarded ring appears for the first time around 1810.Het vrouwtje van Stavoren at the Meertens Institute (Dutch language site) The tale has inspired songs, plays, operas and films. A statue of the fabled Lady gazing out to sea was erected in front of Stavoren harbour in 1969.

It petitioned for, and was granted, an additional Royal Charter in 1990, to become the Chartered Institute of Journalists, usually abbreviated as CIoJ. It also operates as a form of trades union for journalists although it is strictly apolitical. It set up a benevolent fund for distressed journalists in 1898, and an orphans fund in 1891, and also operates a pension fund and another for convalescent members. Unemployment benefits were introduced in 1910 although such benefits, if granted, later became handled by the Benevolent Fund. These charities are all registered with the Charity Commission as number 208176. Disaffected members left in 1910 to form the rival National Union of Journalists, and unsuccessful attempts to merge the two bodies were made in 1921, 1928, 1943, and 1966.

These are marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Tonnoidea and the clade Littorinimorpha.Gofas, S. (2010). Cassidae. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G. (2010) World Marine Mollusca database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=22999 on 2011-01-19 About 60 species comprise the family Cassidae; an example is Cypraecassis rufa. Nomenclature Despite its incorrect formation (the correct one would be Cassididae, based on the genitive form of Cassis), the ICZN has placed the name Cassidae Latreille, 1825 on the official list of family names, therefore avoiding homonymy with Cassididae Stephens, 1831 (based on Cassida Linnaeus, 1758, a chrysomelid beetle); Opinion 1023 (1974, Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 31: 127-129). Distribution Species of this family occur in tropical and temperate seas from the intertidal zone to depths of 100 m (330 ft), buried in the sand during the day and becoming active at night. Shell description Members of this family are shaped rather like bonnets or helmets, as their common name suggests. The shells are large, thick, subglobular with dextrally coiled, sometimes varicose, whorls, and a short spire. The coiling may be trochospiral or convoluted. The shells of many species have great variability, which has led to many misidentifications, resulting in many synonyms. Many species have a large and solid shield over the parietal body or beside the thick, plicated columella. Many species show blunt knobs and thickened axial ridges, known as varices. The thin, horny operculum is oval in shape and covers a long aperture. The siphonal canal is straight or slightly curved. The outer lip is somewhat thicker at its margin and toothed on the inside.  Anatomy  These snails have a large mantle and a large, muscular foot. Their large head has an extensible snout. The eyes are at the base of the single pair of tentacles. Feeding habits Helmet bonnets prey on echinoderms (especially sea urchins), starting by gripping them using the foot. The snail then makes a hole in the urchin through the combined action of a secretion which is rich in sulfuric acid and by rasping with their radula. The acid secretion is provided by two large proboscis glands.Hughes, RN  Hughes, HPI, Morphological and Behavioural Aspects of Feeding in the Cassidae (Tonnacea, Mesogastropoda) ; Malacologia.

There were also two spin off shows; The Baby Borrowers: Compilation showing highlight moments from the previous week, and The Baby Borrowers: Friends and Family asking what the teenage couples dearest and nearest think. Criticism Before being broadcast, the program received bad publicity as it was seen to be immoral to allow inexperienced teenagers to look after real babies. However, the BBC assured viewers that the parents of the babies had given consent, and that a nanny was on hand at all times to intervene if need be. In actuality, when the show aired in the UK, few parents intervened even when their babies were extremely upset, and the nannies gave controversial advice, including letting babies \\"cry it out\\".

Vehicle construction  NYPD ESU Heavy Rescue Truck 9 The design of squad trucks varies, depending on the geography and need in any given area. Areas with rough terrain or snow usually have squad trucks with four-wheel drive, jake brake, locking differentials, hydraulic brakes, and aggressive tires. Often, squads trucks are old ambulances that have been stripped to carry the necessary tools and equipment needed for an extrication, however, rescue squads or fire departments with a high amount of funding often purchase custom trucks that are more elaborate and functional squad trucks. As such, the size of squad trucks is varying, and can be classified into three distinct categories. Class I, or light duty squad trucks are the smallest, and usually the cheapest squad trucks. They can range from a converted ambulance or Chevy Suburban type truck, to custom built trucks on Ford F550 chassis. Class II, or medium duty squad trucks are substantially bigger in both the physical size of the truck and its weight. Medium duty squad trucks can range from smaller fire engines specifically designed for extrications to International truck cabs and chassis.

The shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) is a small and endangered species of North American sturgeon. The earliest remains of the species are from the Late Cretaceous Period, over 70 million years ago.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). Shortnose sturgeons are long-lived and slow to sexually mature. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders, which means they migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in rivers, deltas and estuaries. The shortnose sturgeon is often mistaken as a juvenile Atlantic sturgeon, because of their small size. Prior to 1973, U.S. commercial fishing records did not differentiate between the two species, both were reported as \\"common sturgeon\\", although it is believed based on sizes that the bulk of the catch was Atlantic sturgeon. The shortnose is distinguishable from the Atlantic sturgeon due to its shorter and rounder head. Conservation Status The history of the shortnose sturgeon exploitation goes back 4,000 years.National Marine Fisheries Service. (2020) . Native American fishermen harvested shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon for their meat and eggs. This continued with the Jamestown settlers in 1607 who utilized sturgeon as the primary food source for survival. Profitable fishery business using shortnose sturgeon began to grow in the 1800s leading to a rapid decline of the species population and distribution. By the late-1800s, sturgeon were being over-exploited. In 1890, over 7 million pounds of sturgeon were harvested in 1 year and as a result, in 1920, only 23,000 pounds of sturgeon were caught. Today, the shortnose sturgeon is in danger of extinction throughout its range and was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act on March 11, 1967.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). Shortnose sturgeon are protected in accordance with Section 1(c) of the Endangered Species Preservation Act of October 15, 1966 (80 Stat. 926: 16 U.S.C. 668aa(c)) after consulting the States, interested organizations and individual scientists, and finding that it was threatened with extinction. The IUCN has listed the shortnose sturgeon as a vulnerable species in 2004 with increasing action plans needed.The Red List of Threatened Species. (2004) title=Shortnose Sturgeon author= Friedland, K.D. author= Kynard, B. accessdate=2020-04-15 year=2004 Distribution Shortnose sturgeon range map along the East Coast Historically, shortnose sturgeon were found in the coastal rivers along the East Coast of North America. Living from the Saint John River in New Brunswick all the way to the Indian River in Florida. Currently, shortnose sturgeon can be found in 41 bays and rivers along the East Coast. Their distribution across this range is broken up, with a large gap of about 250 miles separating the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations from the southern metapopulation. National Marine Fisheries Service. (2020) . There has been a shift slightly with lower sturgeon levels in river systems particularly further south. Modern spawning locations for the sturgeon include areas such as the Saint John River, Bay of Fundy, and the Altamaha River with noticeable absences in North Carolina rivers. The southern metapopulations of shortnose sturgeon are currently found in the Great Pee Dee, Waccamaw, Edisto, Cooper, Santee, Altamaha, Ogeechee, and Savannah rivers. They may also be found in the Black, Sampit, Ashley, Roanoke, and Cape Fear rivers. Shortnose sturgeon were considered extinct in the Satilla, St. Marys, and the St. Johns rivers, but were recently found again in both the Satilla and St. Marys rivers. In the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in Saint John (Canada), Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin, Piscataqua, Merrimack, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers. They have also been spotted foraging and transiting in the St. George, Medomak, Damariscotta, Sheepscot, Saco, Deerfield, East, and Susquehanna rivers. On rare occasions, they have been seen in the Narraguagus, Presumpscot, Westfield, Housatonic, Schuylkill, Rappahannock, and James rivers.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). Habitat Shortnose sturgeon live in rivers and coastal waters that run from Canada to Florida. Because shortnose sturgeon are amphidromous fish, after spawning most of their time is spent in estuaries and rivers. Shortnose sturgeon rarely spend time in the Atlantic Ocean. However, if the sturgeon do enter marine waters to feed or migrate they stay close to the shore. Shortnose sturgeon are more likely to move through all areas of a river system. Times they remain at sites for an extended period of time include resting and feeding periods. Estuaries. (1987) title=Shortnose Sturgeon author=Hastings, R.W. author=O‚ÄôHerron, J.C. author=Schick, K. Critical habitat has not been designated for the shortnose sturgeon. This is an area of the conservation plan that is essential to the conservation of the species. Research needs to be done to identify what habitats are critical to ensure the protection of each life stage. One area of research for discovering and designating critical habitat of shortnose sturgeon will be the study of foraging ecology and growth of the various life stages, as well as defining the benthic habitats that support preferred prey. To enhance this understanding, results on the mapping of the benthic organisms will be needed to better define both the available and preferred diets of sturgeon. Probabilistic or generalized linear models or similar approaches used to map benthic habitat should be constructed to help identify the distribution of shortnose sturgeon density. Additionally, obtaining information on nursery areas and characterization of nursery habitat is a major priority. Scutes along the back of a sturgeon. Description The shortnose sturgeon is the smallest of three sturgeon species that are present in the eastern seaboard of North America. It has a cylindrical body and compared to the Atlantic sturgeon, its head and snout are relatively small. Younger shortnose sturgeons tend to have longer snouts compared to their older counterparts. Adult sturgeons have bony plates along their esophagus that help them crush hard items instead of having teeth. Shortnose sturgeon are cartilaginous with bones only in the skull, jaw and pectoral girdle. It is a physostome fish, so its swim bladder is connected to the intestinal tract by a special duct. This duct allows for gas pressure regulation through swallowing air or releasing air through the gut. The intestines for shortnose sturgeon are dark and have a spiral valve (important for nutrient absorption), similar to that of sharks and rays. As seen in the image, these sturgeons tend to be generally dark brown to olive/black on the dorsal surface. Shortnose sturgeon tend to consume small bivalves, gastropods, polychaetes, and small benthic fishes based on studies of their gut contents. The most common prey are amphipods, while Atlantic sturgeon primarily consume polychaetes. Some reports have found that female adult shortnose sturgeon feed throughout the year, but a study from the Saint John River found that pre-spawning females rarely had food in their stomachs and likely stopped feeding about eight months prior to spawning while ripening males generally had full stomachs. Sturgeon are often called \\"living fossils\\", due to their ancient lineage and a fossil record that points to a holarctic distribution. With the earliest reported remains of North American sturgeon dating to the late Cretaceous period. Sturgeons have bony plates called scutes that extend from the skull to the caudal peduncle and are divided into five rows on the body: one dorsal row, then two lateral and ventral rows respectively. The fins on the shortnose sturgeon are located far back on the body. The pectoral fins are positioned low, while the pelvic fins are along with the abdominal position. Prominent features of the shortnose sturgeon are the scutes, protractile tube-like mouth, and chemosensory barbels. Sturgeon tend to be long-lived, slow-maturing, and spawn infrequently, which have served the species well through evolutionary time but poorly to anthropogenic impacts like overharvesting, habitat loss, and degradation. Potential predators of the shortnose sturgeon include alligators, sharks, and other large fish such as catfish. Other known ones include sea lampreys gar, striped bass, common carp, northern pikeminnow, channel catfish, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, walleye, grey seal, fallfish, and sea lions.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). Behavior The life history of shortnose sturgeon beings with adults that lay their eggs in freshwater and then return to saltwater. The eggs are left to fend for themselves after spawning. As they age, the young fish slowly move to more saline water. Living in fresh or brackish water until they are at least a year old. Males can live up to around 30 years old while females can live to be close to 70 years old. Shortnose sturgeon spawn in moving freshwater water, over rubble or gravel bottoms. Time of spawning varies by latitude and is likely based on water temperatures in the range from 6.5‚Äì15 ¬∞C; this may be as early as January in South Carolina or as late as May in Canada. The eggs hatch after 13 days, into 7‚Äì to 11-mm-long hatchlings with a large yolk sac, minimal sight, minimal swimming ability, and a strong tendency to seek cover. After another 9‚Äì12 days, they mature to a swimming larval stage at about 15 mm in length, resembling a miniature adult by the time they reach 20 mm in length and begin feeding. They then drift downstream in the deep channels of the river, remaining in freshwater for the first year of their lives. Juveniles, up to 18 in long, generally move to brackish water, and move with it through the tidal cycle. Adults mature sexually around 18 to 22 inches in length. Males mature after 2‚Äì3 years in their warmest habitats or 10‚Äì14 years in colder climates, and females mature between 6 and 17 years of age (again, earlier in southern rivers). Adults continue to grow to between 3 and 4 ft in length. A male may breed every year or every other year and seldom lives beyond age 30. Females usually breed every third to the fifth year, lying between 40,000 and 200,000 eggs when they breed and can live to age 67. Females spend multiple years with reduced feeding and growth while they are producing the gonadal material needed for spawning. Behavioral information has been collected and demonstrated differences in the innate dispersal patterns in early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from the Connecticut River versus those of Savannah River origin. This research suggested that shortnose sturgeon are likely behaviorally adapted to unique features of their watershed. Major Threats to Species and Human Impact Although there are now about 12,000 adult shortnose sturgeon living within the Delaware River estuary, the population faces serious human-induced threats. Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey. (2020) author=Bowers-Altman, Jeanette Water quality contaminants such as endocrine distributing chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to reproductive and developmental disorders in many fish species. These contaminants were found in shortnose sturgeon tissue collected in 2001 and include PCDDs/TCDFs, DDE, PCBs, and cadmium. Other threats to Delaware River shortnose sturgeon include heavy industrialization and waterfront development. This destruction of habitat can affect the Sturgeon‚Äôs ability to travel to freshwater and spawn or can degrade the quality of the habitat.The Red List of Threatened Species. (2004) title=Shortnose Sturgeon author= Friedland, K.D. author= Kynard, B. accessdate=2020-04-15 year=2004 For example, some dams impede sturgeon travel back and forth between salt and fresh water, resulting in the disruption of natural spawning cycles and preventing the reproduction of the already struggling species. The Veazie Dam, the lowermost dam on the Penobscot River, has blocked Atlantic salmon, American shad, shortnose sturgeon, and eight other sea-run fish from reaching their spawning and juvenile growing habitat for nearly two centuries. Veazie will be the second dam removed in this monumental endeavor to recover these species. More human- induced threats include ship/boat strikes, poaching, mortality from commercial and recreational fishing (bycatch) due to high sensitivity to being caught, injury to early life stages from water intake systems, instream construction projects within the spawning area, and dredging, including the ongoing Delaware River deepening project. Sturgeon Biodiversity and Conservation. (1996) author= Boreman J. Additional research has been done to prove that algal blooms, which can be caused by increased nitrogen levels in runoff or other anthropogenic factors, sometimes result in Shortnose Sturgeon die-offs. Marine Ecology Progress Series. (2012) author=Fire, Spencer E. Overall, the combination of human-induced destruction of habitat and overconsumption have devastated many species along the Atlantic Coast. The future effects of climate change are not fully understood, however, these could potentially exacerbate many of these struggling populations even further. Current Conservation Efforts Conservation efforts for the shortnose sturgeon include removing outdated dams from their habitats. The most recent recovery plan was enacted in December 1998, for the National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The stated goal of this plan is to recover populations to levels of abundance at which they no longer require protection under the ESA. For each population segment, the minimum population size will be large enough to maintain genetic diversity and avoid extinction.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). NOAA Fisheries work with conservation organizations, energy companies, states, tribes, and citizens to evaluate barriers‚Äîbig and small‚Äîto improve upon fish passage. Breeding programs are currently being used to help the dwindling sturgeon populations. The fish are captured and bred to help provide important insight into the physical, chemical, and biological parameters necessary for the optimal growth, survival, and reproduction of shortnose sturgeon in the wild. Captive-bred animals are also used in permanent educational displays that promote public awareness of the plight of the species. Efforts are also being made to educate the public on the shortnose sturgeon. Scientists are working with students and teachers to learn more about the movements, behavior, and threats to sturgeons. An example of this initiative is the SCUTES program‚ÄîStudents Collaborating to Undertake Tracking Efforts for Sturgeon. It provides lesson plans, educational kits, and an opportunity for classrooms to adopt a tagged sturgeon. Original Recovery Plan After listing the Shortnose Sturgeon as an endangered species in 1967, the 1998 Recovery Plan was enacted. The goal was to delist shortnose sturgeon populations throughout their range. The plan listed actions that if followed could restore the populations by the year 2024. Each of the population segments could become a candidate for downlisting when it reached a minimum population size that: 1) is large enough to prevent extinction, and 2) will make the loss of genetic diversity unlikely. This minimum population size for each population segment had not yet been determined. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. (1998) To achieve and preserve minimum population sizes for each population segment, essential habitats were identified and maintained, and mortality, monitored and minimized. This plan has since been outdated and replaced. 5-Year Reviews A Shortnose Sturgeon Status Review Team collected data and presented a ‚ÄúA Biological Assessment of Shortnose Sturgeon‚Äù to the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2010. In their assessment, the team identified aspects of Shortnose sturgeon ecology which requires continued research. Continuing research is needed in areas such as determining population size and structure, modelling larval distribution to identify effects of river manipulation by humans, and enhancing the effectiveness of mass rearing. The team suggested the following research projects to be conducted in order to improve understanding of the shortnose sturgeons‚Äô status. Firstly, continue the survey and tracking of adults to gather additional tissue samples and detect changes in population status (abundance, residency ranges, winter ecology, and spawning success). Secondly, determine status of juveniles (an indication of recruitment) and characterize ecology and habitat use. This review concluded that the shortnose sturgeon still requires conservation efforts to support populations. The species is still at high risk under the IUCN and ESA listings.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum).

Kennedy, as an Associated Press correspondent, had won celebrity, and considerable criticism, in the closing days of World War II by announcing Germany's surrender one day before that announcement was supposed to have been made. A small monument in Monterey memorializes him for having given the world an extra day of peace. In 1967, the newspaper was bought by Block Communications. In 1992 the paper was acquired by the E.W. Scripps Company in exchange for the Pittsburgh Press, which Block merged into its own Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Scripps traded the paper, along with The (San Luis Obispo) Tribune, to Knight Ridder in 1997, in exchange for the Boulder Daily Camera. Knight Ridder was later purchased by the Sacramento-based McClatchy Company in June 2006 in a deal valued at $4.5 billion. The deal was contingent on McClatchy selling off 12 of the 32 newspapers it had just purchased, including The Monterey County Herald . On April 26, 2006, it was announced that MediaNews Group, headed by William Dean Singleton, would purchase four of the \\"orphan 12,\\" including the Herald, the Contra Costa Times and San Jose Mercury News, for $1 billion. In December 2013, MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media merged to create a new company operating under the name of its parent company, Digital First Media. In 2013, the Santa Cruz Sentinel joined the same community newspaper division for Digital First Media as the Monterey Herald. The two newspapers now share a common publisher, advertising director and circulation director. In August 2014, The Monterey Herald moved from its 24-year location in Ryan Ranch to a renovated headquarters on Garden Road in Monterey.

Publication was initiated by the Jewish Publication Society (JPS). In 1908, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) assumed responsibility for compilation and editing while JPS remained the publisher. From 1950 through 1993, the two organizations were co-publishers, and from 1994 to 2008 AJC became the sole publisher. From 2012 to the present, Springer has published the Year Book as an academic publication. The book is published in cooperation with the Berman Jewish DataBank and the Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry. History The American Jewish Year Book is \\"The Annual Record of American Jewish Civilization.\\" The Year Book is a major resource for academic researchers, as well as researchers and practitioners at Jewish institutions and organizations, the media (both Jewish and secular), educated leaders and lay persons, and libraries,s. For decades, the American Jewish Year Book has been an important place for leading academics to publish long review chapters on topics of interest to the North American Jewish community. Previous editors included: Cyrus Adler, Maurice Basseches, Herman Bernstein, Morris Fine, Herbert Friedenwald, H.G. Friedman, Lawrence Grossman, Milton Himmelfarb, Joseph Jacobs, Martha Jelenko, Julius B. Maller, Samson D. Oppenheim, Harry Schneiderman, Ruth R. Seldin, David Singer, Jacob Sloan, Maurice Spector, and Henrietta Szold. Publication of the American Jewish Year Book by the AJC ceased with the 2008 volume, a victim of both the economic slowdown of 2008 and changes in the publishing industry. The American Jewish Year Book started publishing again in 2012, in both hard copy and on the Internet, as a Springer publication. Monetary and institutional support are being provided by the Miller Center for Contemporary Judaic Studies at the University of Miami, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Connecticut, the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Miami, the Center for Judaic Studies and Contemporary Jewish Life at the University of Connecticut, and the Mandell L. \\"Bill\\" and Madeleine Berman Foundation. The new Year Book is edited by Arnold Dashefsky of the University of Connecticut and Ira Sheskin of the University of Miami. Contents  The first two chapters in each volume are major review chapters. These chapters review topics of major concern to the North American Jewish community. Examples include American Jewish Secularism (by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar), an Overview of Canadian Jewry (by Morton Weinfeld, Randall Schnoor, and David Koffman), Jewish Education (by Jonathan Woocher and Meredith Woocher), an Overview of New York Jewry (by Steven Cohen, Jacob Ukeles, and Ron Miller), a Forum on the Pew Survey (with reactions by more than a dozen scholars of American Jewry), Gender in American Jewish Life (by Sylvia Barack Fishman), Adaptations of Jewish Immigrant Groups (by Steven Gold), and Jewish Life on Campus (by Annette Koren, Leonard Saxe, and Eric Fleisch). Two chapters on ‚ÄúNational Affairs‚Äù (by Ethan Felson and Mark Silk) and ‚ÄúJewish Communal Affairs‚Äù (by Larry Grossman) analyze the events of the year for American Jewry. Three chapters present information on the demography and geography of the Jewish population of the United States (by Ira Sheskin and Arnold Dashefsky), Canada (by Charles Shahar), and the World (by Sergio DellaPergola). Data are provided on the Jewish population of urban areas, states and provinces, and countries. A chapter of more than 340 pages provides a listing of Jewish institutions, including Jewish federations, Jewish community centers, Jewish social service agencies, national Jewish organizations, Jewish overnight camps, Jewish museums, Holocaust museums, and Israeli consulates. A chapter on Media contains a listing of national and local Jewish periodicals and broadcast media. A chapter on Academic Resources presents a listing of Judaic Studies Program, Holocaust and Genocide Studies Programs, and Jewish Social Work Programs, followed by a listing of major books and scholarly articles published in the past year on the North American Jewish community as well as a listing of websites and organizations for Jewish community research and a listing of Judaic and Holocaust research libraries. A final chapter on Transitions provides information on major events in the North American Jewish community in the past year (provided by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency), Jewish honorees (both tho awards by Jewish organizations and by other organizations, such Presidential Medals of Freedom and Academy Awards ), and obituaries for North American Jews.

After his ordination Mattithiah went to Rome, apparently on account of the persecution by Hadrian; there he founded a school and a Jewish court which soon became prominent.

Teachings Halakhic sentences by him have been preserved which show his desire to make the Sabbath laws less rigorous insofar as their fulfillment by the sick was concerned. He seems, however, to have devoted himself chiefly to the Aggadah; a number of his homiletic sentences, especially to the Book of Exodus, are extant.

It dealt, according to all accessible evidence, only with the first two books of the Pentateuch.  Contents of the Midrash = Name and scope = Midrash Abkir derived its name from the formula ◊ê◊ë◊õ◊ô◊® = ◊ê◊û◊ü ◊ë◊ô◊û◊ô◊†◊ï ◊õ◊ü ◊ô◊î◊ô ◊®◊¶◊ï◊ü with which all these homilies closed, according to the testimony of R. Eleazar of Worms in a manuscript commentary on the prayer-book, and according to a codex of A. De Rossi. It is possible that these religious discourses were arranged in the order of the sedarim of Genesis and Exodus, the beginnings of the sedarim being Genesis 1:1, 2:4, 3:22, 6:9, 12:1, 17:1, 18:1, 22:1, 27:1, 44:18; Exodus 3:1, 16:4, and 25:1, to which belong the excerpts in Yalkut Shimoni, Genesis 4, 17, 34, 50, 63, 81, 82, 96, 120, 150, and Exodus 169, 258, and 361. If it may be assumed that in these homilies of Midrash Abkir the expositions are not confined to the first verses, the fact that certain passages are not connected with the beginning of any seder need cause no surprise.Jewish Encyclopedia, Midrash Abkir = Angelology = The language of this midrash is pure Hebrew, while its contents and discussions recall the works of the later haggadic period. As in the Pir·∏≥e Rabbi Eli'ezer, angels are frequently mentioned.Compare the excerpts in Yalkut Shimoni 132, 234, 241, and 243 Shem·∏•asai (Samyaza) and Azael, according to the account in the Midrash Abkir, descended to earth to hallow the name of God in a degenerate world, but could not withstand the daughters of man. Shem·∏•asai was entrapped by the beauty of Istahar, who, through the marvelous might of the Divine Name, which she had elicited from him, ascended to heaven. As a reward for her virtue she was placed among the Pleiades, while the angel did penance before the Flood, and in punishment of his seduction of the daughters of men was suspended head downward between heaven and earth. Azael, however, still wanders unreformed among mortals, and through dress and adornment seeks to mislead women.Adolf Jellinek, B. H. 4, pp. 9 et seq. The version of this story in Yalkut Shimoni 44On Gen. 6:2 concludes; \\"Therefore do the Israelites offer as a sacrifice on the Day of Atonement a ram [sic] to the Eternal One that He may forgive the sins of Israel, and a ram [sic] to Azazel that he may bear the sins of Israel, and this is the Azazel that is referred to in the Torah.\\" This passage of the midrash explains the words of Yoma 67b: \\"According to the school of R. Ishmael, Azazel is he who atones for the deed of Usa and Azael.\\" In the editio princeps of the Yalkut ShimoniSalonica, 1526‚Äì27 the source of the legend of the fallen angels (in ¬ß 44) as well as of the legend concerning the temptation of R. Mattithiah b. ·∏§eresh by Satan (in ¬ß 161), who was successfully resisted by the pious hero, is simply the ordinary midrash, not the Midrash Abkir. The latter legend is found also in the Midrash of the Ten CommandmentsJellinek, l.c. 1 79 and in Tan·∏•uma.ed. S. Buber, ·∏§u·∏≥·∏≥at, Addenda, ¬ß 1 In several other excerpts from the Yalkut Shimoni, which, according to later editions, are derived from the Midrash Abkir, the source is indicated in the first edition merely by the word \\"Midrash,\\" as in ¬ß 241, which discusses the legend of Usa, the patron of Egypt; here \\"Midrash\\" apparently means \\"Midrash Wayosha\\".Jellinek, l.c. i. 39 et seq. Yalkut Shimoni 235 (on Ex. 14:24) relates that the Egyptian magicians Jannes and Jambres obtained wings by their art and soared to heaven, but were dashed down into the sea by the angel Michael. It cannot be determined, however, whether this passage belongs to the fragment excerpted from the Midrash Abkir in Yalkut Shimoni 234. Use in later works This midrash was known to the author of Shemot Rabbah, and was used or cited in the following works among others: Lekach ·π¨ob by R. Tobias b. Eliezer, Ha-Ro·∏≥ea·∏• by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, Pa'aneach Raza, the Ketab Tamim by Moses Taku, the Kad ha-Kemach of Bahya ben Asher, a manuscript commentary by a grandson of R. Samuel of Speier, and the Yalkut Re'ubeni. The entire midrash was likewise known to Azariah dei RossiCompare Me'or 'Enayim ed. Wilna, p. 455 and to Abraham ibn Akra. The extracts in Yalkut Shimoni, which had been listed almost completely by Zunz, were collected by S. BuberIn Ha-Sha·∏•ar, 11; reprinted separately, Vienna, 1883 and by Simon Chones.In Rab Pe'alim, pp. 133 et seq. The legend of the two angels was also reprinted by Jellinek.l.c. iv. 127 etseq.

Initially its local organizations were named Lodges (Logias AJEF), but have been renamed as Talleres (workshops) in order to emphasize that A.J.E.F. is not Masonry, but an appendant body. Each Taller is sponsored by a Masonic Lodge, in both economic and moral support. It is similar in focus and function to the Order of DeMolay, albeit with stronger ties to Freemasonry. Although it was originally exclusively for men, there are many women's bodies, according to the rules of the Sponsoring Lodge or of the Grand Lodge. Officially, mixed working is not usual, and the joint activities are supervised by a Master Mason.  Structural organization  Originally there was a body named \\"Consejo Central AJEF\\" (AJEF Central Council) as a superior body that supervised and organized, and it was conformed by active members of the A.J.E.F. In Mexico, there are not many Central Councils, though they still exist in Tamaulipas and Chiapas. Every Chapter depends directly from its Lodge and Grand Lodge dispositions, but in order to maintain communication and fraternal working there are many events promoting fraternal activities. Almost every Grand Lodge in Mexico promotes the A.J.E.F. This is uncommon in the United States and in some other Latin American countries. The members of a Chapter or Lodge are: * Guide (Gu√≠a) * First adviser (Asesor Primero) * Second adviser (Asesor Segundo) * Secretary (Secretario) * Treasurer (Tesorero) * Orator (Orador) * Guardian (Guardi√°n) * Director of Choir (Director de Coro) * Director of Ceremonies (Director de Ceremonias) * Donations Collector (Colector de Obolos) * Steward (Experto) * Flag Bearer (Portabandera) * Standard Bearer (Portaestandarte) * Instruction Master (a Master Mason) (Un Maestro Mas√≥n es el Maestro Instructor)  History  A.J.E.F. was founded in Havana, Cuba on February 9, 1936, by Fernando Su√°rez N√∫√±ez (May 7, 1882-Jan. 24 1946). The first lodge was called \\"Esperanza\\" (Hope). Reaching 5,000 members by 1938, its rapid growth began to foster chapters overseas. In 1939 the first Mexican A.J.E.F. Lodge, named after Benito Ju√°rez, was established by the United Mexican Grand Lodge of Veracruz (Gran Logia \\"Unida Mexicana\\") due to the influence and motivation of Martin Dihigo Llanos. The second one was established at Mexico City, by the Mexican Valley Grand Lodge (Gran Logia \\"Valle de M√©xico\\") and its name was \\"Fernando Su√°rez N√∫√±ez\\".  Mystique and rituals  The original ritual was created by its Cuban founder Fernando Su√°rez N√∫√±ez. In Mexico the Regular Grand Lodges of the United States of Mexico Confederation (Confederaci√≥n de Grandes Logias Regulares de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana) assigned the Mexican Valley Grand Lodge (Gran Logia \\"Valle de M√©xico\\") to adapt the ritual for the Mexican youth; but in 1991 the United Mexican Grand Lodge of Veracruz (Gran Logia Unida Mexicana) created the \\"Vadem√©cum del AJEF\\", the first compilation of ceremonials and the AJEF Theory - symbols and philosophic principles. Because of that it is the basis for the subsequent documents elaborated by other Grand Lodges, as the \\"Prontuario del AJEF\\", created in 1994 by the Grand Lodge Valle de M√©xico. The rituals that constitute the exercise of \\"Ajefismo\\" are aimed at developing moral values and social skills among the initiates. The Letters A.J.E.F. have in themselves a deeper meaning, as these are the letters of the \\"fundamental words\\" Love, Justice, Hope and Fraternity (Amor, Justicia, Esperanza y Fraternidad). The institution's motto, always at the bottom of essays and official papers, is \\"For the nation and humanity\\" (Por la patria y la humanidad). The initiation process varies according to the region even though there is an official written liturgy with such cases noted, as are funerals and weddings; these initiations may vary from being verbatim to the liturgy to identical to those performed in adult Freemasonry. In that same vein it is not uncommon for AJEF essays to be about esoteric themes as well as science, morals or history, and it is not uncommon to find young participants to be well-versed in different areas.

Education He was born in Antwerp, and began his education at the Koninklijk Atheneum (E: Royal Atheneum) of Antwerp, where he was influenced by the Flemish writer and liberal politician Jan van Beers, and he obtained a law degree at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). As a student, he was one of the co-founders of the secular humanist Cercle Universitaire (1887), he wrote for the Journal des Etudiants (1889) and in 1890 he was founder-President of the Cercle Universitaire de Criminologie. Career In 1890, he set up practice as a lawyer in Antwerp and specialized himself in international marine law. As the president of the Conf√©rence du Jeune Barreau (E: League of young lawyers) and as a member of the Vlaamse Conferentie der Balie (E: Flemish bar league), he wanted to promote the use of Dutch in court (which was in French in those days). In 1899, he was one of the co-founders of the Bond der Vlaamsche Rechtsgeleerden (E: League of Flemish lawyers), of which he became President in 1912. In 1906, he put himself candidate as a member of the Belgian parliament, of which he would remain a member up to 1926. He strived for a gradual improvement of the usage of the Dutch language in Flanders, such as with the law Franck-Paul Segers on the usage of Dutch in secondary education in the public schools (1910). Since then he fought on the side of the Roman catholic Frans Van Cauwelaert and the socialist Camille Huysmans (together they were called the three crowing cocks) for the usage of Dutch at the University of Ghent. This brought him on the peak of its popularity in Flanders. In 1911, he was sworn in, as the candidate of the Antwerp liberal party, as a member of the municipal Council of Antwerp. In 1915, he was co-founder and President of the Comit√© voor Hulp en Voeding (E: Committee of help and food) of the province of Antwerp and alderman for the Port of Antwerp. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War I, Franck (under the influence of the Belgian king and the government) acted as the President of a Intercommunale Commissie van Notabelen, the actual head of Antwerp and the neighbouring municipalities. He conducted a careful policy where the language disputes (Dutch versus French) had to rest during the war. He openly condemned the collaboration with the Germans (Activism), and became the personification of the resistance in Flanders.

They can grow to 2‚Äì3 inches long. They are native to North America. Description The banded sunfish is similar to the blackbanded sunfish and has a very compressed and deep body. Its sides are iridescent and dark colored. There are dark bands on its side and nuptial males and females will develop blue specks on their bodies. Its mouth is upturned and its pectoral and tail fins are rounded. It grows to an approximate length of 9.5 cm. Distribution The banded sunfish is found in the Atlantic coastal drainages of North America from southern Maine south to central Florida and along the Gulf slope as far west as the Perdido River drainage in Alabama. Habitat The banded sunfish is found in small ponds and backwaters of creeks to small and large rivers and boggy brooks over sand or mud in sluggish, acidic, heavily vegetated waters. Diet The banded sunfish feeds upon aquatic insects, microcrustacean. Reproduction Spawning occurs from April through July. They can spawn when they become one year old. The male will construct a sand or gravel nest where the eggs are laid but does guard the eggs as the eggs are buoyant and float way from the nest. Status The banded sunfish is currently endangered in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. Globally, however, its population is stable and is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy and etymology The banded sunfish was first formally described as Pomotis obesus in 1854 by the French ichthyologist Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard (1822-1895) with the type locality given as Framingham and in a branch of the Charles River, at Holliston, Massachusetts. The generic name Enneacanthus means \\"nine-spined\\" while the specific name obesus means \\"fat\\".

Palace of the Pac family in Vilnius, now Polish embassy Pac Palace in Dowspuda Pacowie (, , ) was one of the most influential noble families in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the era of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. Numerous high-ranking officials of the Commonwealth came from their ranks. Their coat of arms was Gozdawa. The family reached the height of its influence during the second half of the 17th century. Their lands were located mainly in Hrodna (, ) and Lida (). The family's ancestor Kimantas was mentioned in the privilege of 1388 issued by Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas the Great as Kymunt. The estate of the family in proximity of Grodno was mentioned in the road description, charted by the Teutonic Knights, as Kymundsdorf. Kimantas and his son Dauk≈°a (Dowkszewicz) were among the signatories of the Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401. Dauk≈°a's son Pac is considered the first member of the family; his ancestors took his first name as their family name, beginning with his son Jerzy Pac (d. 1505/6). Their lands were concentrated in the southern Lithuania propria, around the county of Jieznas. The family sponsored the construction of several notable examples of Baroque architecture in Lithuania; the most significant of these, St Peter and St Paul's Church in Vilnius and the Monastery of Pa≈æaislis, were commissioned by family members. In 1753, following a visit to the Pazzi household in Florence, Stefan Pac advanced the theory that the two families were related. The Pacs later dedicated a church to Magdalena de Pazzi. The supposed ancestry was mentioned by 19th century authors, including Balzac. The family's influence was overwhelmed in the late 17th century by that of the Sapiehas. Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac (1624‚Äì1682) was a Grand Hetman of Lithuania and Voivode of Wilno, Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac (1621‚Äì1684), Grand Chancellor of Lithuania, Miko≈Çaj Stefan Pac (?-1684), voivode of Trakai and bishop of Vilnius, and Kazmierz Pac (?-1695), bishop of Samogitia. During their adulthood, in late 17th century, they exerted major influence on the politics of the Grand Duchy. After their childless deaths, the Pac family was weakened, and much of their influence passed to others, primarily the Sapiehas. The last notable member of the Pac family was Ludwik Micha≈Ç Pac (1778‚Äì1835), who fought in the November Uprising.

In adults their disc-like mouths contain poorly developed teeth, useless for attaching to a host. Description The eggs of the American brook lamprey (ABL) are white, sticky, and small, measuring about . When they hatch, the embryos are small as well, measuring less than ; they are white and wormlike. Within a month they take on the larval appearance. Larvae of all lampreys are called ammocoetes and when small ABL ammocoetes have a dark band running longitudinally along the body, a dark head region, and the remainder of the body is clear. As they increase in size the body becomes increasing darker, reaching a dark brown by the time the ammocoetes reach their maximum size of about . The dark band on the body begins to lighten during this is as well and is not distinct in more mature ammocoetes. However, mature ammocoetes will have a dark spot on the caudal fin. There are likely numerous races of ABL which may have location specific coloration. In Ohio, older ammocoetes have a dark yellow band which runs the entire dorsal surface, as well as pigmentation in the caudal fin. During metamorphosis into the adult form, this coloration changes drastically. Adults in the fall and winter are silver, but can become more black or brownish by the spring when breeding begins. Adults have a dark back, pale belly, yellowish fins, a dark blotch at the end of the tail, and their skin is smooth and leathery and without scales. The body usually retains a silvery appearance at maturation. Adults are usually about long, although this can be highly variable. ABL are generally found in clear, cold brooks, and small streams.http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2335e/i2335e.pdf Life cycle Ammocoetes of ABL feed on algae and detritus for 3‚Äì7 years before they metamorphose into sexually mature adult fish. Metamorphosis takes place in the late summer and early fall, with adults ready to spawn at the end of winter when spring temperatures are appropriate for egg development (~15 ¬∞C). The male(s), aided by a female(s), construct small nests by picking up pebbles with its mouth and moving them to form the rims of a shallow depression. Oftentimes adults work in groups, and build the nests communally. During and after construction of the nests, the sticky eggs are deposited in the nest and adhere to the sand and gravel. Adult ABL cannot eat, since they have a nonfunctional intestine, and only live for four to six months. As a result, adult ABL die after spawning.

Gladiateur is called a legend by France Galop and \\"One of the best horses ever to grace the turf in any century\\" by the National Sporting Library of Middleburg, Virginia. Gladiateur was not very successful as a sire but his performance on the track remains one of the most impressive in Thoroughbred horse racing history. Background A large colt, Gladiateur was a horse who raced best at long distances. He was bred by Count Frederic de Lagrange at his Haras de Dangu at Dangu, Eure in the Upper Normandy region of France.Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software He was sired by the French horse Monarque on Miss Gladiator,Gladiateur at horseracinghistory.co.uk, accessed 16 March 2012 a mare by the British horse Gladiator, who had been purchased by French interests at the age of nine and brought to stand at stud in France. Miss Gladiator was also the dam of Villafranca. Racing career Gladiateur's owner sent him to England to be trained by Tom Jennings, Sr. at Newmarket Racecourse. Developing the colt slowly, he did not begin racing until the fall of 1864 and won only one of the three races he entered. At age three, things were very different as Gladiateur was the most dominant horse in European racing while becoming the first foreign horse to win the English Triple Crown. After winning the 1865 2,000 Guineas then the most prestigious race in England, The Derby, Gladiateur was sent to race in Paris. In front of happy fans who dubbed him \\"The Avenger of Waterloo\\", he easily won the Grand Prix de Paris. At age four, Gladiateur continued to dominate, winning numerous important races in England and France including a forty-length victory in the Ascot Gold Cup. Stud record He was retired to stud duty at the end of his four-year-old season having won sixteen of his nineteen races. He first stood at Middle Park Stud in Kent in 1867 and 1868 and then at his owner's Haras de Dangu in France 1869 and 1870. Following the invasion of France by Germany during the Franco-Prussian War, Count Frederic de Lagrange shipped his horses out of the country to the safety of England where they were sold at a Tattersalls auction. Gladiateur was purchased by an English breeder (William Blenkiron) who brought him back to Middle Park Stud but following his new owner's death, in 1873 he was sold to Dunmow Stud Farm in Essex. He was the sire of Fair Maid of Kent, dam of Kentish Fire (IRE) who won the Irish Derby Stakes and Frigate, a Grand National Steeplechase winner. Suffering from a disease of the navicular bone, Gladiateur was euthanized in January 1876. He is buried at Dunmow Stud Farm but his tail is at the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket.

To achieve these objectives in Indonesia, the following changes were implemented: *A national list of essential drugs was established and implemented in all public sector institutions. The list is revised periodically. *A ministerial decree in 1989 required that drugs in public sector institutions be prescribed generically and that Pharmacy and Therapeutics committees be established in all hospitals. *District hospitals and health centers have to procure their drugs based on the essential drugs list. *Most drugs are supplied by three government-owned companies. *Training modules have been developed for drug management and rational drug use and these have been rolled out to relevant personnel. *The central drug laboratory and provincial quality control laboratories have been strengthened. *A major teaching hospital has developed a program on rational drug use, developing a hospital formulary, guidelines for rational diagnosis and treatment guidelines for the rational use of antibiotics. *Generic drugs have been available at affordable costs to low-income groups. Encouraging rational prescribing One of the first challenges is to promote and develop rational prescribing, and a number of international initiatives exist in this area. WHO has actively promoted rational drug use as one of the major elements in its Drug Action Programme. In its publication A Guide to Good Prescribingde Vries TPG, Henning RH, Hogerzeil HV, Fresle DA (1994) Guide to Good Prescribing. WHO/DAP. 11: 1-108 the process is outlined as: *define the patient's problem *specify the therapeutic objectives *verify whether your personal treatment choice is suitable for this patient *start the treatment *give information, instructions and warnings *monitor (stop) the treatment. The emphasis is on developing a logical approach, and it allows for clinicians to develop personal choices in medicines (a personal formulary) which they may use regularly. The program seeks to promote appraisal of evidence in terms of proven efficacy and safety from controlled clinical trial data, and adequate consideration of quality, cost and choice of competitor drugs by choosing the item that has been most thoroughly investigated, has favorable pharmacokinetic properties and is reliably produced locally. The avoidance of combination drugs is also encouraged. The routine and irrational use of injections should also be challenged. One study undertaken in Indonesia found that nearly 50% of infants and children and 75% of the patients aged five years or over visiting government health centers received one or more injections.Management Sciences for Health (1998) Health Center Prescribing and Child Survival in East Java and West Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Injections, as well as being used inappropriately, are often administered by untrained personnel; these include drug sellers who have no understanding of clean or aseptic techniques. Another group active in this area is the International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD). This organization, established in 1989, exists to promote rational drug use in developing countries. As well as producing training programs and publications, the group is undertaking research in a number of member countries, focused primarily on changing behavior to improve drug use. One of the most useful publications from this group is entitled Managing Drug Supply.Management Sciences in Health (1997) Managing Drug Supply: the selection, procurement, distribution, and use of pharmaceuticals. Kumarian Press. Connecticut. It covers most of the drug supply processes and is built up from research and experience in many developing countries. There a number of case studies described, many of which have general application for pharmacists working in developing countries. In all the talk of rational drug use, the impact of the pharmaceutical industry cannot be ignored, with its many incentive schemes for doctors and pharmacy staff who dispense, advise or encourage use of particular products. These issues have been highlighted in a study of pharmaceutical sales representative (medreps) in Mumbai.Kamat VR, Nichter M (1997) Monitoring product movement: an ethnographic study of the pharmaceutical sales representatives in Bombay, India. In: Bennett S, McPake B, Mills A (eds) Private Health Providers in Developing Countries: serving the public interest? Zed Books, London & New Jersey. This was an observational study of medreps' interactions with pharmacies, covering a range of neighborhoods containing a wide mix of social classes. It is estimated that there are approximately 5000 medreps in Mumbai, roughly one for every four doctors in the city. Their salaries vary according to the employing organization, with the multinationals paying the highest salaries. The majority work to performance-related incentives. One medrep stated \\"There are a lot of companies, a lot of competition, a lot of pressure to sell, sell! Medicine in India is all about incentives to doctors to buy your medicines, incentives for us to sell more medicines. Even the patient wants an incentive to buy from this shop or that shop. Everywhere there is a scheme, that's business, that's medicine in India.' The whole system is geared to winning over confidence and getting results in terms of sales; this is often achieved by means of gifts or invitations to symposia to persuade doctors to prescribe. With the launch of new and expensive antibiotics worldwide, the pressure to sell with little regard to the national essential drug lists or rational prescribing. One medrep noted that this was not a business for those overly concerned with morality. Such a statement is a sad reflection on parts of the pharmaceutical industry, which has an important role to play in the development of the health of a nation. It seems likely that short-term gains are made at the expense of increasing problems such as antibiotic resistance. The only alternatives are to ensure practitioners have the skills to appraise medicine promotion activities or to more stringently control pharmaceutical promotional activities. Rational dispensing In situations where medicines are dispensed in small, twisted-up pieces of brown paper, the need for patient instruction takes on a whole new dimension. Medicines should be issued in appropriate containers and labelled. While the patient may be unable to read, the healthcare worker is probably literate. There are many tried-and-tested methods in the literature for using pictures and diagrams to aid patient compliance. Symbols such as a rising or setting sun to depict time of day have been used, particularly for treatments where regular medication is important, such as cases of tuberculosis or leprosy.Georgiev GD, McDougall C (1998) Blister calendar packs - potential for improvement in the supply and utilization of multiple drug therapy in leprosy control programs. International Journal of Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases. 56(4): 603-10. Poverty may force patients to purchase one day's supply of medicines at a time, so it is important to ensure that antibiotics are used rationally and not just for one or two day's treatment. Often, poor patients need help from pharmacists to understand which are the most important medicines and to identify the items, typically vitamins, that can be missed to reduce the cost of the prescription to a more manageable level. The essential drugs concept The essential drugs list concept was developed from a report to the 28th World Health Assembly in 1975 as a scheme to extend the range of necessary drugs to populations who had poor access because of the existing supply structure. The plan was to develop essential drugs lists based on the local health needs of each country and to periodically update these with the advice of experts in public health, medicine, pharmacology, pharmacy and drug management. Resolution number 28.66 at the AssemblyWorld Health Organization (1985) Handbook of Resolutions and Decisions of the World Health Assembly and Executive Board, vol II 1973-1984. World Health Organization. Geneva. requested the WHO Director-General to implement the proposal, which led subsequently to an initial model list of essential drugs (WHO Technical Series no 615, 1977). This model list has undergone regular review at approximately two-yearly intervals and the current 14th list was published in March 2005.World Health Organization (2005) Essential Drugs WHO Model List (revised March 2005). The model list is perceived by the WHO to be an indication of a common core of medicines to cover most common needs. There is a strong emphasis on the need for national policy decisions and local ownership and implementation. In addition, a number of guiding principles for essential drug programs have emerged. *The initial essential drugs list should be seen as a starting point. *Generic names should be used where possible, with a cross- index to proprietary names. *Concise and accurate drug information should accompany the list. *Quality, including drug content stability and bioavailability, should be regularly assessed for essential drug supplies. *Decisions should be made about the level of expertise required for drugs. Some countries make all the drugs on the list available to teaching hospitals and have smaller lists for district hospitals and a very short list for health centers. *Success depends on the efficient supply, storage and distribution at every point. *Research is sometimes required to settle the choice of a particular product in the local situation. =The model list of essential drugs= The model list of essential drugs is divided into 27 main sections, which are listed in English in alphabetical order. Recommendations are for drugs and presentations. For example, paracetamol appears as tablets in strengths of 100 mg to 500 mg, suppositories 100 mg and syrup 125 mg/5ml. Certain drugs are marked with an asterisk (previously a ·üõ), which denotes an example of a therapeutic group, and other drugs in the same group could serve as alternatives. The lists are drawn up by consensus and generally are sensible choices. There are ongoing initiatives to define the evidence that supports the list. This demonstrates the areas where RCTs (randomized controlled trials) or systematic reviews exist and serves to highlight areas either where further research is needed or where similar drugs may exist which have better supporting evidence. In addition to work to strengthen the evidence base, there is a proposal to encourage the development of Cochrane reviews for drugs that do not have systematic review evidence. Application of NNTs (numbers needed to treat) to the underpinning evidence should further strengthen the lists. At present, there is an assumption among doctors in some parts of the world that the essential drugs list is really for the poor of society and is somehow inferior. The use of NNTs around analgesics in the list goes some way to disprove this and these developments may increase the importance of essential drugs lists. Communicating clear messages The impact of pharmaceutical representatives and the power of this approach has led to the concept of academic detailing to provide clear messages. A study by Thaver and HarphamThaver IH, Harpharm T (1997) Private practitioners in the slums of Karachi: professional development and innovative approaches for improving practice. In: Bennett S, McPake B, Mills A (eds) Private Health Providers in Developing Countries: serving the public interest? Zed Books, London & New Jersey. described the work of 25 private practitioners in area around Karachi. The work was based on assessment of prescribing practices, and for each practitioner included 30 prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) or diarrhea in children under 12 years of age. A total of 736 prescriptions were analysed and it was found that an average of four drugs were either prescribed or dispensed for each consultation. An antibiotic was prescribed in 66% of prescriptions, and 14% of prescriptions were for an injection. Antibiotics were requested for 81% of diarrhea cases and 62% of ARI cases. Of the 177 prescriptions for diarrhea, only 29% were for oral rehydration solution. The researchers went on to convert this information into clear messages for academic dealing back to the doctors. The researchers went on to implement the program and assessed the benefits. This was a good piece of work based on developing messages that are supported by evidence. Drug donations It is a natural human reaction to want to help in whatever way possible when face with human disaster, either as a result of some catastrophe or because of extreme poverty. Sympathetic individuals want to take action to help in a situation in which they would otherwise be helpless, and workers in difficult circumstances, only too aware of waste and excess at home, want to make use of otherwise worthless materials. The problem is that these situations do not lend themselves to objectivity. There are numerous accounts of tons of useless drugs being air-freighted into disaster areas. It the requires huge resources to sort out these charitable acts and often the drugs cannot be identified because the labels are not in a familiar language. In many cases, huge quantities have to be destroyed simply because the drugs are out of date, spoiled, unidentifiable, or totally irrelevant to local needs. Generally, had the cost of shipping been donated instead, then many more people would have benefited. In response to this, the WHO has generated guidelines for drug donations from a consensus of major international agencies involved in emergency relief. If these are followed, a significant improvement in terms of patient benefit and use of human resources will result. =WHO guidelines for drug donations 2005= Selection of drugs *Drugs should be based on expressed need, be relevant to disease pattern and be agreed with the recipient. *Medicines should be listed on the country's essential drugs list or WHO model list. *Formulations and presentations should be similar to those used in the recipient country. Quality assurance (QA) and shelf life *Drugs should be from a reliable source and WHO certification for quality of pharmaceuticals should be used. *No returned drugs from patients should be used. *All drugs should have a shelf life of at least 12 months after arrival in the recipient country. Presentation, packing and labelling *All drugs must be labelled in a language that is easily understood in the recipient country and contain details of generic name, batch number, dosage form, strength, quantity, name of manufacturer, storage conditions and expiry date. *Drugs should be presented in reasonable pack sizes (e.g. no sample or patient starter packs). *Material should be sent according to international shipping regulations with detailed packing lists. Any storage conditions must be clearly stated on the containers, which should not weigh more than 50 kg. Drugs should not be mixed with other supplies. Information and management *Recipients should be informed of all drug donations that are being considered or under way. *Declared value should be based on the wholesale price in the recipient country or on the wholesale world market price. *Cost of international and local transport, warehousing, etc., should be paid by the donor agency unless otherwise agreed with the recipient in advance. Evidence-based pharmacy practice While modern practices, including the development of clinical pharmacy, are important, many basic issues await significant change in developing countries. *Medicines can often be found stored together in pharmacological groups rather than in alphabetical order by type. *Fridge space is often inadequate and refrigerators unreliable. *There are different challenges, such as ensuring that termites do not consume the outer packages and labels or that storage is free of other vermin such as rats. *Dispensary packaging and labelling can be woefully inadequate and patients leave with little or no understanding of how to take medicines which may have cost them at least one week's earnings. *Medicines are often out of stock, not just for a few hours but for days or even weeks, particularly at the end of the financial year. *Protocols and standard operating procedures are rarely found. *Even when graduate pharmacists are employed, they often have little opportunity to perform above the level of salesperson, simply issuing medicines and collecting payment. For example, several hospital pharmacies in Mumbai, India, are open 24 hours per day for 365 days per year but only to function as retail outlets selling medicines to outpatients or to relatives of inpatients who then hand over the medicines to the nursing staff for administration. Conclusions Evidence is as important in the developing world as it is in the developed world. Poverty comes in many forms. While the most noticed are famine and poor housing, both potent killers, medical and knowledge poverty are also significant. Evidence- based practice is one of the ways in which these problems can be minimized. Potentially, one of the greatest benefits of the internet is the possibility of ending knowledge poverty and in turn influencing the factors that undermine wellbeing. Essential drugs programs have been a major step in ensuring that the maximum number benefit from effective drug therapy for disease.

Buettner is the founder of the Blue Zones and Blue Zones, LLC. Biography =Early life= Buettner grew up in a family that spent much time in the outdoors, camping, hunting, gardening and bicycling. His parents took their four boys to the Boundary Waters in Minnesota every summer on weeklong canoe trips. After graduating from the College of St. Thomas in 1984, Buettner took a year to explore Spain before taking a job with National Public Radio in Washington, D.C. recruiting celebrity participation in a fund-raising croquet tournament with journalist George Plimpton. =Education= Buettner graduated from the University of St. Thomas in 1982. Soon thereafter he went to work for Washington Post columnist Remar Sutton and Paris Review Editor George Plimpton to organize the National Public Radio‚Äôs Celebrity Croquet Tournament. The three men formed a lifelong friendship. Buettner recalls, \\"George was heavily influenced by the notion that you can do what you love and make a living out of it.

The 1990 \\"Sovietrek\\" followed the 45th parallel around the world, covered 12,888 miles. Buettner recounted the trip in his book Sovietrek, which won a Minnesota Book Award. In 1992, the Buettner brothers team-cycled from Bizerte, Tunisia, to Cape Agulhas, South Africa, \\"Africatrek\\" with cyclist Dr. Chip Thomas. The team covered 11,885 miles over eight months. Buettner‚Äôs book, Africatrek: A Journey by Bicycle through Africa, won the Young Reader Award from Scientific American. Buettner also co-produced an Emmy Award-winning PBS documentary by the same name, that won an Emmy Award. MayaQuest In February 1995, Buettner developed a genre of exploration that enabled online audiences to direct teams of experts to solve mysteries. His MayaQuest [USA Today CITATION] expedition sought to help solve the mystery of the 9th century Maya Collapse. Carrying laptop computers and newly a demilitarized satellite dish the expedition interacted with 40,000 classrooms that helped determine exploration route and findings. Hamline University‚Äôs Center for Global Environmental Education created a framework for schools to use the expedition as a multi- disciplinary teaching themes. Both Africatrek and MayaQuest were adapted into educational computer games by MECC in the late 1990s. =Businesses= In 1995, Buettner founded Earthtreks, Inc. to manage his expeditions. He sold the company to Classroom Connect in 1997 but continued to lead expeditions until 2002. His team retraced Darwin‚Äôs route in the Galapagos and followed Marco Polo‚Äôs trail on the Silk Road, explored the collapse of the Anasazi Civilization and traced the origins of Western Civilization. Buettner realized that adults were also following his expeditions. He approached National Geographic with the idea to research longevity hotspots and was given support to move forward. He then connected with Robert Kane, director of the Center on Aging at the University of Minnesota, who introduced him to top demographers and scientists at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Washington, DC. He was awarded a grant from the National Institute of Aging. Previous research identified the longevity hotspots of Sardinia, Okinawa and Loma Linda. In 2003, Buettner began leading trips to these destinations while collaborating with a variety of experts, including anthropologists, historians, dietitians, and geneticists to reverse engineer longevity, in a sense. His early trips focused on Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; and Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and Loma Linda, California.Potter, Ned. (January 18, 2007). Finding the keys to longevity. ABC News.

In 2006, under aegis of National Geographic, Buettner collaborated with Poulain and Costa Rican demographer Dr. Luis Rosero-Bixby to identify a fourth longevity hotspot in the Nicoya Peninsula. In 2008, again working with Poulain, he found a fifth longevity hotspot on the Greek Island of Ikaria. In April 2008, Buettner released a book on his findings, The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, through National Geographic Books. It became a New York Times Best Seller and resulted in interviews for Buettner on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Dr. Oz Show, and Anderson Cooper 360, among other national media. In September 2009, Buettner gave a TED talk on the topic, titled \\"How to live to be 100+\\", which now has over two million views. In October 2010, he released the book Thrive: Finding Happiness the Blue Zones Way, largely based on his research which took a data-based approach to identify the statistically happiest regions of the happiest countries on Earth. He argues that creating lasting happiness is only achievable through optimizing the social and physical environments. In April 2015, Buettner published The Blue Zones Solution: Eating and Living Like the World's Healthiest People where he listed Ikaria (in Greece), Okinawa (Japan), Saridina (Italy), Loma Linda (California), and Costa Rica as the places with top longevity. It became a New York Times Best Seller.https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers- books/2015-04-26/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/list.html The book was featured on the cover of Parade and Buettner was interviewed extensively on national media, including the Today Show, NBC Nightly News, Fox, NPR, and the Dr. Oz Show.

Background  The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party was an Armenian national movement active in the region. In 1894, Sultan Abdul Hamid II began to target the Armenian people in a precursor of the Hamidian massacres. This persecution strengthened nationalistic sentiment among Armenians. In Sassoun Armenian nationalist ideas were organized by Hunchak activists, such as Mihran Damadian, Hampartsoum Boyadjian and Hrayr Dzhoghk.  Conflict  Medzn Mourad The first notable battle in the Armenian resistance movement took place. The Armenians of Sassoun confronted the Ottoman army and Kurdish irregulars at Sassoun, succumbing to superior numbers. Foreign news agents protested vehemently against the Sassoun event; British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone called Hamid \\"the Great Criminal\\" or \\"the Red Sultan\\". The rest of the Great Powers also protested and demanded the execution of Hamid's promised reforms. An investigation committee composed of French, British, and Russian representatives were sent to the region in order to examine the event.  Aftermath  In May 1895, the aforementioned foreign powers prepared a set of reforms. However, they were never carried out, because they were not actively imposed on Ottoman Turkey. The Russian Empire's policies vis-a-vis the Armenian question had changed. In fact, the Russian foreign minister Alexei Lobanov-Rostovsky supported Ottoman integrity. Moreover, he was so anti- Armenian that he wanted an \\"Armenia without Armenians\\". On the other hand, Britain had gained considerable influence and power in former Ottoman Egypt and Cyprus, and for Gladstone, good relations with the Ottomans were less important than before. Meanwhile, Turkey had found a new European ally, Germany's Bismarck. The Ottoman Empire thus felt free to commit further massacres, in 1896.

Inflation adjusted (by FRED) via the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (CPIAUCSL). Graph retrieved February 8, 2020. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, Title VIII is a US Act of Congress that amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to gradually raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. It was signed into law on May 25, 2007 as part of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The act raised the federal minimum wage in 3 increments: to $5.85 per hour 60 days after enactment (July 24, 2007), to $6.55 per hour a year later (July 24, 2008), and finally to $7.25 per hour two years later (July 24, 2009). In addition, the act provided for the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa to make the transition to the federal minimum wage on alternate timetables. As of 2008, 13 states already had minimum wage rates at or above $7.25 per hour. These states were therefore unaffected by the increase. Legislative history The act was a component of the new Democratic majority's 100-Hour Plan in the United States House of Representatives. It was introduced into the House on January 5, 2007, by George Miller (D-CA) and it was passed by the House on January 10. All 233 House Democrats voted \\"Aye,\\" and 82 Republicans joined them. 116 Republican representatives voted \\"No,\\" and 4 representatives did not vote. President Bush advised that the bill should include tax cuts for small businesses that could be harmed by the wage increase, and on January 24, 2007, a cloture motion in the Senate failed as 43 Republican Senators (all but 5) rejected the bill without the tax cuts, opposing all 47 Democrats who were present for the vote. Once tax cuts were added to the bill, the Senate passed the amended bill 94-3 (3 Republicans opposed and 1 did not vote; 2 Democrats did not vote) on February 1, 2007. The act initially did not amend the Fair Labor Standards Act in regards to American Samoa‚Äîits minimum wage would have continued to be set by a committee appointed by the U.S. Department of Labor until changes were made to the act. After accusations by Republican lawmakers that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was unethical because Del Monte (parent company of StarKist Tuna which owns one of the two tuna canneries in Samoa) is based in her district, she instructed a House committee to have Samoa be included. Samoa's representative Eni Faleomavaega noted that the territory has not been subject to the mainland minimum wage and said, \\"...the global tuna industry is so competitive that it is no longer possible for the federal government to demand mainland minimum wage rates for American Samoa without causing the collapse of our economy...\\".Faleomavaega Comments on Minimum Wage Bill Now Before Congress =Final passage= The minimum wage was passed by the House and the Senate on May 24, 2007 as part of HR 2206, the supplemental aid to the Iraq War. As part of the deal, $257 million worth of tax breaks were given to small business over a 10-year period to offset the wage increase. The bill was thus ultimately enacted as a rider to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. President George W. Bush signed the bill on the next day. =Proposed amendments= * The bill ', To amend Public Law 93‚Äì435 with respect to the Northern Mariana Islands, providing parity with Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa (S. 256; 113th Congress), is a bill that was introduced into the 113th United States Congress. S. 256 would amend the Fair Minimum Wage Act to provide for no Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands minimum wage increases in 2013 and 2015. Omissions The minimum wage increase did not change the tip credit for tipped employees. Originally, it was automatically increased by being pegged to a percentage of the regular minimum wage. However, that changed during the 1990s. The federal tip credit, therefore, remains at $2.13. However, as even tipped employees are subject to the higher of State or Federal wage by law tipped staff effectively benefit from the minimum wage increase just the same.

Martin was the land agent of the Northern Neck Proprietary for his uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693‚Äì1781) and served two terms in the House of Burgesses. Martin was born in Kent in 1731, and was the grandson of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1657‚Äì1710) through his mother, Frances Fairfax Martin. Raised in humble surroundings in England, Martin relocated to Virginia in 1751 to assist his uncle, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax), in administering the Northern Neck Proprietary, which encompassed up to . Martin resided with his uncle on their frontier Greenway Court estate in present-day Clarke County, Virginia. He earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature and loyalty, and through Martin's growing influence Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations to Greenway Court in 1762 and made Martin steward and land agent of the proprietary. Martin took an active role in political and civil affairs within the proprietary's domain. He served as a vestryman for the Anglican Frederick Parish, and upon the creation of Hampshire County in 1754, he presided as the county's first justice and was further appointed the County Lieutenant. He later represented Hampshire County in the House of Burgesses from 1756 to 1758 and serving with George Washington, represented Frederick County from 1758 until 1761. Martin was appointed a trustee of the frontier towns of Winchester, Stephensburg (present-day Stephens City), and Bath (present-day Berkeley Springs). He was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia. Though not in the best of health, Martin was relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources in response to Native American attacks. Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Martin refused reappointment by Governor Patrick Henry as a justice of the Frederick County Commission of Peace. Afterward, Martin retreated from civil service entirely, and retired to Greenway Court. He maintained a low profile during the war, and his uncle Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin's brother Reverend Denny Martin Fairfax inherited the Northern Neck Proprietary, and Martin was given the Greenway Court estate. He took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress and died unmarried in 1798. Martin bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining to his housekeeper Betsy Powers. Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly maintain the proprietary and conveyed the remaining lands in 1797, thus terminating the Fairfax and Martin families' interests in the proprietary before it was formally dissolved in 1806. The city of Martinsburg, West Virginia, was named for Martin by his friend Adam Stephen.  Early life and family  Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron Thomas Bryan Martin was born in Kent, England, in 1731 and was the son of Denny Martin (1695‚Äì1762) of Salts Manor and his wife Frances Fairfax Martin (1703‚Äì1791). His father and mother married in Loose, Kent. Martin's mother was the daughter of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1657‚Äì1710) and his wife Catherine Colepeper Fairfax, and thus a sister of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693‚Äì1781) and Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1707‚Äì1793). His grandmother Catherine Colepeper Fairfax was the daughter of Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and his wife Margaretta van Hesse, who was from a Dutch noble family. Martin was named in honor of his uncle Thomas. He was baptized into the Anglican faith as \\"Thomas Brian\\" in Loose on April 11, 1731. Martin and his siblings were raised amid humble surroundings in England. He had seven siblings, including four brothers and three sisters: * Edward Martin (1723‚Äì1775) * John Martin (1724‚Äì1746) * Reverend Denny Martin (later Fairfax, 1725‚Äì1800) * Frances Martin (1727‚Äì1813) * Sibylla Martin (1729‚Äì1816) * Philip Martin (1733‚Äì1821) * Anna Susanna Martin (1736‚Äì1817)  Northern Neck Proprietary administration  Map of the Northern Neck Proprietary, 1736‚Äì37 Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) owned the Northern Neck Proprietary land grant, which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719. The proprietary constituted up to of Virginia's Northern Neck and a vast area spanning west to the North Branch Potomac River headwaters. The Northern Neck Proprietary had been awarded by the exiled Charles II of England to seven of his supporters in 1649, and again in 1688 by official patent. One of these seven supporters, Lord Colepeper, acquired the right to the entire proprietary in 1681, and his grandson, Lord Fairfax, inherited the land grant upon the death of his mother, Katherine Colepeper. Lord Fairfax dispatched his first cousin William Fairfax (1691‚Äì1757) to replace Robert Carter I as the steward and land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary, a position in which Fairfax served until his death in 1757. In 1750, Martin's uncle Lord Fairfax established himself at his hunting plantation Greenway Court estate near present-day White Post in Clarke County with the intention of administering the proprietary himself. Lord Fairfax had previously reserved this land as his private residence in 1747, then known as \\"the Quarter\\". With his cousin William Fairfax acting as land agent, Lord Fairfax sought additional assistance in managing the proprietary and scrutinized which of his family members from England would be up to the task. Lord Fairfax first considered his brother Robert, then his brother-in-law Denny Martin, and in 1751, he finally decided upon enlisting the assistance of his twenty-year-old nephew and Denny Martin's son, Thomas Bryan Martin. An early 19th-century engraving of the main house at Greenway Court Lord Fairfax sent for Martin, who arrived in Virginia from England aboard the Hatley on May 24, 1751, accompanied by William Fairfax, who had been seeking an appointment to a position in England. Martin and Fairfax arrived in Williamsburg, where they dined with Fairfax's fellow Virginia Governor's Council member John Blair, Sr., and visited the Governor's Palace and the Capitol before beginning their journey toward the Northern Neck on May 31. Following his arrival at the Northern Neck Proprietary, Martin settled at Greenway Court with his uncle that autumn. Due to his humble upbringing, Martin quickly adapted to frontier life at Greenway Court. He soon earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature, his loyalty, and his good eyesight, which greatly assisted his myopic uncle. On May 21, 1752, shortly after Martin had come of age on his twenty-first birthday, Lord Fairfax granted Greenway Court to his nephew, along with of limestone lands on the west bank of the Shenandoah River across from Leeds Manor, which were \\"to be known and called by the name of the Manor of Greenway Court\\" and subject to an annual quit-rent fee of \\"a good buck and doe\\" due on the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel. Greenway Court had taken its name from the Culpeper family's manor in Kent. The proprietary Land Office at Greenway Court, photographed by the Historic American Buildings Survey Desiring a larger role for himself in the proprietary's administration, Martin sought to influence his uncle into reorganizing the management of the proprietary. At Martin's suggestion, Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations northwest from Belvoir to an expressly built land office depository and archive at Greenway Court in 1762. Prior to this move, a small land office had been in operation at Greenway Court. Following William Fairfax's death in 1757, his son George William Fairfax (1729‚Äì1787) had succeeded him as steward and land agent of the proprietary. Martin succeeded Fairfax as the steward and land agent of the proprietary in 1762. Fairfax's replacement by Martin, the transfer of the land office and Martin's increased influence over Lord Fairfax caused bitter feelings from George William Fairfax, as evidenced by his letters during this period. Fairfax and his wife Sally Cary Fairfax returned to England in 1773 prior to the American Revolutionary War and did not return afterward. While residing at Greenway Court, Martin would have preferred more comfortable quarters than the rustic estate, as their living situation there was originally supposed to have been only temporary until the construction of a grander estate. In 1767, Martin wrote that plans for further construction and improvements at Greenway Court \\"remain in status quo and in quo state they are likely to remain, ...we are building castles, tho' not on earth where one is greatly wanted, but castles in the air.\\" Martin's uncle Robert Fairfax remarked on the primitive life at Greenway Court among \\"strange, brutish people... past all conception\\". For the next thirty years, until Lord Fairfax's death in 1781, Martin remained at Greenway Court and shared in the loneliness and solitude of his \\"self-exiled\\" uncle. While established at Greenway Court, Martin engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1768, Martin described tobacco as the crop \\"which is our all\\". Like many other planters and farmers in the Shenandoah Valley, Martin had transitioned to the farming of wheat by 1792, at which time he wrote to his brother in England, \\"Are you all starving that you give such prices for our flour; farming is now my object.\\"  Political and civic affairs  In addition to his management of the proprietary, Martin began taking an active role in political and civil affairs within his uncle's domain. Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752, the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish vestrymen before June 15 of that year. Martin was elected as a vestryman, alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax and Gabriel Jones. Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about expanding and enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish. In 1754, upon the creation of Hampshire County, Martin presided as the inaugural justice of the county's court. Under the act establishing the county, the first county court was to have been held in June 1754; however, the first court was not held until December 1757. The first court to be held was, in addition to Martin, composed of justices James Simpson, William Miller, Solomon Hedges, and Nathaniel Kuykendall with Gabriel Jones serving as the Clerk of Court. In 1755, Martin was further appointed as the County Lieutenant of Hampshire County. Martin was then elected alongside Thomas Walker to the House of Burgesses representing Hampshire County from 1768 to 1758. In 1758, Martin and George Washington challenged the incumbents and ran for election to represent Frederick County in the House of Burgesses against Hugh West and Thomas Swearingen. Martin and Washington received considerable support from Lord Fairfax, and the leading Anglican cleric in Frederick County, William Meldrum. Washington received the most votes with 310, followed by Martin with 240 votes, 199 votes for West, and 45 votes for Swearingen. Martin and Washington served alongside one another representing Frederick County until 1761. Martin chose not to run for reelection and retired from legislative politics in 1761. In September 1758, the Virginia General Assembly appointed Martin as one of the trustees of Winchester. Martin was further appointed as a trustee of the town of Stephensburg (present-day Stephens City). His uncle Lord Fairfax, John Hite, Gabriel Jones, Robert Rutherford, Lewis Stephens, and James Wood were also appointed trustees of the towns alongside Martin. When the town of Bath (present-day Berkeley Springs) received its charter from the Virginia General Assembly in October 1776, Martin was appointed as a trustee alongside Bryan Fairfax, Philip Pendleton, Robert Rutherford, Samuel Washington, Warner Washington, Alexander White, and others. Martin was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia. While Martin was not in the best of health, he could be relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources to act promptly during an emergency, especially in response to attacks by Native Americans. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County. Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor Patrick Henry, along with William Booth and Warner Washington, but all three men declined to serve another term. Martin did not swear into the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime, initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was a futile effort. The committee had also been actively arresting Loyalists, which may have influenced Martin's decision to turn down his reappointment. Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely, and afterward retired to Greenway Court. Prior to his death, Martin became an active Freemason.  American Revolution and Lord Fairfax's death  As a Loyalist, Martin maintained a low profile following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. By 1778, the Virginia General Assembly had abolished quit-rents, but in recognition of Lord Fairfax's loyalty, the Northern Neck Proprietary was made an exception. Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration by the assembly, and despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies, he was accorded all the privileges of a Virginia citizen. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, his will was recorded on March 5, 1782, and conveyed his title to the remnants of his American properties, including the Northern Neck Proprietary, to Martin's elder brother Reverend Denny Martin, who then assumed the surname and coat of arms of Fairfax. Lord Fairfax devised his property and title to Denny Martin on the condition that he apply to the Parliament of Great Britain for an act to authorize him to inherit the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Martin was appointed by his uncle, along with Gabriel Jones and Peter Hog, as an executor of his will and estate. Martin inherited the plantation Lord Fairfax had purchased from John Borden consisting of . Martin was also bequeathed the Greenway Court estate and \\"all the stock of cattle, sheep, hogs, implements of husbandry, household goods and furniture\\" there. Martin and his brothers Denny and Philip also inherited all Lord Fairfax's slaves. Martin's uncle and Lord Fairfax's brother Robert Fairfax appealed his claim to the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron to Parliament, and succeeded as the 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron On account of his residency in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as managers of the proprietary. Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them. The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757. In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784. Because Denny Fairfax was a British subject residing in England, he had no legal rights under American jurisdiction; thus, he and his British relatives were considered \\"alien enemies\\" and his landholdings were confiscated under escheat laws. In 1785, the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records, books, and documents pertaining to the proprietary's lands be confiscated by the state of Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar's Office in Richmond. Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted, and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land. Land values in the Northern Neck continued to increase in value, which Martin noted in a 1790 letter. The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier, which Martin commented: \\"The emigration of inhabitants is... astonishing.\\"  Later life and death  Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress, and fathered a daughter by her. Mrs. Crawford remained Martin's mistress for several years until her death. Their daughter married British captain Francis Geldart; however, she died without issue soon after their marriage, and Martin gave Geldart of Greenway Court and a number of slaves. Following the death of his daughter, Martin employed housekeeper Betsy Powers at Greenway Court. Martin died unmarried in 1798, and his will dated July 24, 1794, was proved on October 1, 1798. In it, he bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining to his housekeeper Betsy Powers. Powers also inherited \\"all houses thereon, household goods (except plate and watch), one half of stock of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs and choice of ten slaves\\". Martin's living sisters Frances, Sybilla, and Anna Susanna Martin received \\"all moneys, and remainder of personal property\\" not bequeathed to Powers. Each of the executors of Martin's will received ten guineas. Martin bequeathed the remainder of his property and the of Greenway Court, should Powers have predeceased him, to his will executors Gabriel Jones, Robert Mackey, and John Sherman Woodcock to divide into parcels and sell, the profits from which were to be given to Martin's sisters. Powers also received a chariot, harness, and in Stafford County near Falmouth. Following Martin's death, Powers married W. Carnagy. Due to his advanced age and his inability to relocate to America, Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly protect and maintain his American possessions and conveyed by deed on August 30, 1797, to James Markham Marshall \\"all and every of those divers tracts, pieces and parcels of land, being part and parcel of the proprietary of the Northern Neck of Va., with all beneficial right and interest of whatsoever nature the same may be\\". This conveyance thus terminated the Fairfax and Martin families' interest in the proprietary. In 1799, the Virginia General Assembly authorized Marshall as the legal titleholder of Fairfax's remaining landholdings. The Northern Neck Proprietary was officially dissolved in 1806 when Virginia again became its legal owner. The legality of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands continued to be contested in state and federal courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.  Legacy  Proprietor Adam Stephen, a close personal friend of Martin, had the town of Martinsburg in Berkeley County formally established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1778. Stephen named the town in honor of his friend Martin.

Following the death of Prince Woldemar on the 20 March 1895 and the ascension of Woldemar's brother Alexander, Adolf was appointed to act as regent of Lippe due to Prince Alexander being unable to rule due to a mental illness. He continued to act as regent until 1897 when he was replaced by Count Ernst of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Marriage Prince Adolf was married on the 19 November 1890 in Berlin to Princess Viktoria of Prussia. She was a daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor, and as such Adolf was a brother-in-law to the last German Emperor, Wilhelm II. The wedding was attended by the Emperor Wilhelm, along with his wife Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein and Victoria's mother, the widowed Empress Victoria. As Princess Victoria's mother was a member of the British royal family, many of her relatives also attended, including Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. After the ceremony, the couple held a banquet, at which Emperor Wilhelm feelingly assured the pair of \\"his protection and friendly care\\".

Founded by Cynthia Kelly in 2002, the Foundation's stated goal is, \\"to provide the public not only a better understanding of the past but also a basis for addressing scientific, technical, political, social and ethical issues of the 21st century.\\" AHF works with Congress, the Department of Energy, the National Park Service, state and local governments, nonprofit organizations and the former Manhattan Project communities to preserve and interpret historic sites and develop useful and accessible educational materials for veterans, teachers, and the general public. In June of 2019, the Atomic Heritage Foundation and the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History signed an agreement that granted stewardship of the Atomic Heritage Foundation website and all of the AHF's physical collections to the museum. The Atomic Heritage Foundation website is now run by the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History. Additionally, the museum now houses the Atomic Heritage Foundation's physical collections which will eventually be integrated into the Nuclear Museum's own collection. Voices of the Manhattan Project In November 2012, the Atomic Heritage Foundation (AHF) and the Los Alamos Historical Museum launched a new website, \\"Voices of the Manhattan Project\\" featuring their oral history collections. Together AHF and the Los Alamos Historical Museum have collected hundreds of oral histories over the years. The interviews offer a variety of perspectives on the project. Some Native Americans discuss the government‚Äôs displacement of the tribes from their ancestral lands in Hanford, Washington. In others, Pueblo Indians in New Mexico talk about the impact of the government project on their ancestral traditions and economy. Veterans recall blowing off steam by hiking and skiing in Los Alamos, dancing and bowling in Oak Ridge, and engaging in a meatball mess hall battle in Hanford. The veterans recalls the top scientists and personnel involved in the project, including J. Robert Oppenheimer, Leslie R. Groves, Enrico Fermi, and Leo Szilard. The site features interviews with a number of well-known Manhattan Project veterans, including General Leslie Groves and Edward Teller. Site preservation The Atomic Heritage Foundation is working in collaboration with the National Parks Conservation Association, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, local communities, and other organizations to urge Congress to establish a Manhattan Project National Historical Park. In March 2013, Senators Maria Cantwell and Lamar Alexander introduced S. 507 to create a park, and Representatives Doc Hastings, Ben Ray Lujan, and Chuck Fleischmann introduced a companion bill in the House, H.R. 1208. The Los Alamos, V-Site was the site of assembly for the Trinity device, the first atomic weapon ever detonated. In October 2006, the AHF co-hosted several days of events to commemorate the successful restoration of the High Bay building. Museum exhibits The Atomic Heritage Foundation has created several museum exhibits. They are: =Race for atomic power exhibit at Idaho Falls= The first nuclear reactor capable of producing usable amounts of electricity was Experimental Breeder Reactor I, which lit up four light bulbs on December 20, 1951. This historical milestone is one of many captured in the Race for Atomic Power exhibit that opened on May 24, 2005 at the EBR-I. Upon entering the EBR-I, visitors can relax in a 1950s living room and watch TV. Clips from the 1950s as well as Nuclear Pioneers, a brief history of the EBR-I produced by the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Throughout the exhibit are kiosks with video recordings of the veterans explaining aspects of the reactor‚Äôs operations. In the control room, Kirby Whitham explains when the misunderstanding of the command, ‚ÄúTake it down,‚Äù resulted in a partial meltdown of the reactor core. Blackboards present the fundamentals of nuclear fission and a cut-away diagram shows the inner workings of the reactor. The exhibit was created under the supervision of the AHF and is now run by the Museum of Idaho. =B Reactor exhibits at Hanford= This exhibit focuses on the Hanford Site and its role in the Manhattan Project. It feature exhibits on the B Reactor ‚Äî the world's first plutonium production reactor ‚Äî and its importance, models of the reactor and surrounding buildings, a documentary film (Hanford's Secret Wartime Mission), and vignettes and education materials on the history of the Hanford site. The exhibit was developed in partnership with the B Reactor Museum Association, the Hanford Reach National Monument Heritage and Visitor Center, and the Columbia River Exposition on History, Science and Technology. Books The Atomic Heritage Foundation has created several books dealing with the Manhattan Project. They are: The Manhattan Project: The Birth of the Atomic Bomb in the Words of Its Creators, Eyewitnesses, and Historians: An anthology that collects the writings and thoughts of the original participants in the Manhattan Project, along with pieces by the most important historians and interpreters of the subject. The Manhattan Project Guidebook Series: A series of four guides to the Manhattan Project in Manhattan, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Washington state. The guidebooks relate the history and significance of the Manhattan Project in these areas. Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project: Edited by Cynthia Kelly, this book provides a spectrum of interpretations of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and scientific achievements. Contributors include the Hon. Senator Jeff Bingaman, authors and historians Richard Rhodes, Martin Sherwin, Kai Bird and Robert S. Norris, and Andy Oppenheimer. Remembering the Manhattan Project: Edited by Cynthia Kelly, part I of this book, comprising papers from the Atomic Heritage Foundation's Symposium on the Manhattan Project in Washington, DC on April 27, 2002, recounts the history of this remarkable effort and reflects upon its legacy. Contributors include Richard Rhodes, Robert S. Norris, Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird, Gregg Herken, James R. Schlesinger, and others. Part II proposes a strategy for preserving the historical properties and artifacts of the Manhattan Project for the public and future generations. Race for Atomic Power: A companion book to the museum exhibit of the same name. Films Hanford's Secret Wartime Mission: This documentary film chronicles the story of the Manhattan Project at Hanford where the world's first plutonium production facilities were built along the Columbia River in eastern Washington state. The undertaking paired the University of Chicago's team of extraordinary physicists led by Enrico Fermi with the DuPont Company's industrial expertise led by Crawford Greenewalt. The film highlights the determination, commitment, and scientific ingenuity of the men and women who took on the seemingly impossible task of producing plutonium in time to contribute to the war effort. A Handful of Soldiers: features three Manhattan Project veterans who describe their experiences at Los Alamos working on the plutonium-based bomb. The twelve-minute film shows the remains of the \\"V Site\\" where the first atomic bomb was assembled. Nuclear Pioneers: The 28-minute documentary film on the Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) tells the story of the first nuclear reactor built by the Atomic Energy Commission. With first-hand accounts from scientists and engineers, the film explores the challenges of creating the world's first reactor to produce usable quantities of electricity and \\"breed\\" more fuel than it consumed. Completed in 1951, the EBR-I paved the way for future generations of \\"peaceful\\" reactors and was named a National Historic Landmark in 1966 by President Johnson. Interviews with Manhattan Project Veterans, Vol. I-III: These films features interviews with seven Manhattan Project veterans. Complete with pictures from the Department of Energy's archives and short biographies of the veterans, the films describe what it was like to work on the top-secret project that changed world history and created a revolution in science and technology. The Race for Atomic Power: This documentary film traces the history of the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho Falls, with interviews of former and current employees of NRTS and Idaho National Laboratory. These vignettes discuss the innovations developed at NRTS during its first 25 years. General Leslie R.

It is not to be confused with East Flint in which it resides. The neighborhood is bounded on the west by University Park and Buick City, the north by the Northeast Side, the east by Thrift City, and the south by East Village. The neighborhood is anchored on the north and south by two large parks, Whaley and Kearsley, and is also the site of Washington and Williams Elementary Schools, and formerly Homedale Elementary. 57-Acre Kearsley Park anchors the southern boundary of Flint's Eastside, and it is considered to be Flint's \\"showpiece\\" park. In recent years, the park has been completely renovated.  Location  The most commonly given boundaries, established by the Olde Eastside Neighbors, are the Flint River to the west, Dort Highway to the east, Whaley Park to the north, and Robert T. Longway to the south. \\"State Streets\\" is drawn from the name of twenty streets that bisect the center of the neighborhood from north to south.  History  Since 1904, the Eastside has been located adjacent to General Motors North Flint facilities, including Buick City. While subdivisions such as Civic Park and The East Village were originally designed as \\"bedroom neighborhoods\\" at some distance from the factories, the Eastside was built as a lower-income community from the beginning. This is demonstrated by the housing stock which consists almost strictly of wood-frame bungalows. Additionally, the neighborhood has been isolated from the rest of the city by the Flint River and, later, I-475 and Delphi East. Even in Flint's halcyon decades of the 1940s and 1950s, the Eastside was not considered a prosperous neighborhood. Problems magnified with the deindustrialization of General Motors beginning in the early 1980s. The Eastside did not suffer from the rapid white-flight experienced across the river. At the same time, a large portion of the original population was displaced by southern migrants, and the neighborhood has gradually diversified.  Present day  While the Eastside is unquestionably Flint's most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood,US Census, 2000; Place Flint, Michigan; Tracks 22, 23, and 26; comparative it has been continually plagued by gang-related violence and racial tension. Today, the Eastside is one of Flint's most troubled neighborhoods in terms of violent crime. Due in large part to these problems, and the affordability of housing stock, the Eastside is one of the few neighborhoods in Flint where the majority of residents are not landowners. Mass property acquisitions have led to the concentration of residences in the hands of a few landlords. This, combined with infrastructural degradation and the decline of Flint as a whole, have reduced property values to new lows. There are some assets in the Eastside working against these prevailing trends. In particular, Kearsley Park has been recently redesigned and renovated and has become a stabilizing influence on the neighborhood. The diversity of the Eastside, essentially unprecedented in Flint, has had its most visible impact on Davison Road, as seen by such businesses as Luigi's Restaurant and the Flint Judo Club.  Significant business closures reflect tough economics, tough neighborhoods  While its boundaries may be the Flint River to the west and Dort Highway to the east, the Eastside has Franklin Ave. as its main north-south artery and Davison Road as its main east-west artery. Along these roads certain well established businesses, with long histories of community involvement, have contributed to the general stability of the area. However, on Davison Road, two such businesses have closed their doors within the last few years. Brown Funeral Home closed in 2007 and Angelos Coney Island - a restaurant famous in Flint, and, in business at that location since 1949 - closed permanently in December 2018. In an interview on Michigan Public Radio the owner of Angelos Coney Island stated that the restaurant had seen declining patronage over the last few years and suggested that he believed this was a consequence of Flint's dwindling population, the city's economic malaise, concerns over water quality, and people simply being afraid to come to the Eastside. While Angelos Coney Island was a legendary eatery in the Flint area, its property had been the site of numerous assaults and murders over the last twenty years.

It documents the taking of the Marshall Islands while also encouraging increased war production. The film opens with the narrator asking \\"What makes a battle?\\" while the camera is focusing on shipments of industrial transports, \\"This is what it takes to make a battle.\\" This statement sets up the dual nature of the entire film. War supplies are pouring in from every part of the country, from every type of American \\"Republican and Democrat, white and colored.\\" Industrial production is the backbone of war, according to the film, if it is destroyed, not made with quality, or not replaced in time, the battle cannot happen. Then the film abruptly changes direction, and presents a summary of the American battle plan for taking the Marshalls, how the outer islands were bombed to fool the enemy, and how a sneak attack was planned against the inner islands. But this couldn't happen until all the supplies were ready. When the invasion does begin there is fierce fighting on the main islands. \\"The German would have surrendered, but not the Jap...Out of a garrison of 6000, 230 surrender.\\" Much time is spent on the Japanese POWs, and the film goes to great lengths to show how well they are treated, especially in comparison to how the Japanese treated their POWs. Emphasis then turns again to materiel. Showing all the destroyed planes, artillery, and ammunition, all needing to be replaced by the American workforce. But at the very end, images of the dead and wounded American soldiers are shown. The narrator assures us they will never be forgotten.

Its purpose was to improve irrigation and navigation along the main Rosetta and Damietta branches of the Nile downstream of the point where they divide north of Cairo, Egypt. At its first operation however, the structure's foundations were found to be of such poor quality that its main irrigation purpose had to be largely abandoned for safety reasons. The barrages have been much maligned as only a romantic river crossing.Samir Raafat, The Delta Barrage, Cairo Times, August 21, 1997 Despite its ignoble beginnings, initial testing and later repairs were undertaken in the 1880s following the British Occupation of Egypt. These repairs and their continued maintenance would largely provide the barrages' original intent. The overall effects were largely unexpected and startling. In addition to a great reduction in costs of lifting water to irrigate fields, and labor savings needed to unclog the canals from deposited silt, the cotton crop was doubled, and the costs needed to raise crops in general was cut in half. These combined factors would stimulate demand for agricultural land which saw a doubling in price and an immediate demand which could not be satisfied. In the 1930s, when the idea for a larger, higher and stronger barrage was put forward, the old barrage was leaking again and the maintenance expenses required were of such magnitude, that the building of a new barrage was determined to be more feasible. Construction of the new Mohammed Ali Barrage lasted from 1936 to 1939. The contract, awarded through public tender, to the British firm of Messrs. McDonald Gibbs & Co. (Engineers) and was inaugurated in December 1939. Due to technological advances its foundation was built in steel piling and concrete cement encrusted several meters below the sandy base. Granite from Aswan was also used for part of the body. The project works were a great success, entailing a work force of twelve thousand and cost 2.75 million pounds. The old Delta Barrage was then abandoned, although it has been retained as a historic monument and is still used as a road bridge.Raye R.

Although there is some degree of comorbidity with binge eating disorder, it differs from binge eating in that the amount of food consumed in the night is not necessarily objectively large nor is a loss of control over food intake required. It was originally described by Albert Stunkard in 1955 and is currently included in the other specified feeding or eating disorder category of the DSM-5.American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author. Research diagnostic criteria have been proposed and include evening hyperphagia (consumption of 25% or more of the total daily calories after the evening meal) and/or nocturnal awakening and ingestion of food two or more times per week. The person must have awareness of the night eating to differentiate it from the parasomnia sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Three of five associated symptoms must also be present: lack of appetite in the morning, urges to eat at night, belief that one must eat in order to fall back to sleep at night, depressed mood, and/or difficulty sleeping. NES affects both men and women, between 1 and 2% of the general population, and approximately 10% of obese individuals. The age of onset is typically in early adulthood (spanning from late teenage years to late twenties) and is often long-lasting, with children rarely reporting NES. People with NES have been shown to have higher scores for depression and low self-esteem, and it has been demonstrated that nocturnal levels of the hormones melatonin and leptin are decreased. The relationship between NES and the parasomnia SRED is in need of further clarification. There is debate as to whether these should be viewed as separate diseases, or part of a continuum. Consuming foods containing serotonin has been suggested to aid in the treatment of NES, but other research indicates that diet by itself cannot appreciably raise serotonin levels in the brain. A few foods (for example, bananas) contain serotonin, but they do not affect brain serotonin levels, and various foods contain tryptophan, but the extent to which they affect brain serotonin levels must be further explored scientifically before conclusions can be drawn, and \\"the idea, common in popular culture, that a high-protein food such as turkey will raise brain tryptophan and serotonin is, unfortunately, false.\\" Presentation =Comorbidities= NES is sometimes comorbid with excess weight; as many as 28% of individuals seeking gastric bypass surgery were found to suffer from NES in one study. However, not all individuals with NES are overweight. Night eating has been associated with diabetic complications. Many people with NES also experience depressed mood and anxiety disorders.

A common example is the idea of social class, a social-scientific category that has entered into wide use in society. Since the 1970s, held to be a distinguishing feature of the social sciences,Richards, H., Understanding the Global Economy (Thousand Oaks: Peace Education Books, 2004), p. 309. the double hermeneutic has become a criterion for demarcating the human/social from the natural sciences.Ginev, D., Hermeneutic Realism: Reality Within Scientific Inquiry (Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, 2016), p. 148.Weinert, F., Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud: Revolutions in the History and Philosophy of Science (Hoboken: Wiley- Blackwell, 2009), p. 228. Overview Anthony Giddens (1982) argues that there is an important difference between the natural and social sciences.Tucker, K. H., Jr., Anthony Giddens and Modern Social Theory (London, Thousand Oaks & New Delhi: Sage Publications, 1998), p. 59. In the natural sciences, scientists try to understand and theorise about the way the natural world is structured. The understanding is one-way; that is, while we need to understand the actions of minerals or chemicals, chemicals and minerals don't seek to develop an understanding of us. He refers to this as the \\"single hermeneutic\\". (Hermeneutic means interpretation or understanding.Zimmermann, J., Hermeneutics: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 21.) By contrast, the social sciences are engaged in the double hermeneutic. The various social sciences study people and society, although the way they do so is different. Some social sciences such as sociology don't just study what people do, they also study how people understand their world, and how that understanding shapes their practice. Because people can think, make choices, and use new information to revise their understandings (and hence their practice), they can use the knowledge and insights of social science to change their practice.Giddens, New Rules of Sociological Method: A Positive Critique of Interpretative Sociologies, 2nd ed. (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993), p. 9. In outlining his notion of the double hermeneutic, Giddens explains that while philosophers and social scientists have often considered the way \\"in which lay concepts obstinately intrude into the technical discourse of social science,\\" ... \\"(f)ew have considered the matter the other way around.\\"Dodig-crnkovic, G., & Burgin, M., eds., Philosophy And Methodology Of Information: The Study of Information in the Transdisciplinary Perspective (Singapore: World Scientific, 2019), p. 221. He explains that \\"the concepts of the social sciences are not produced about an independently constituted subject-matter, which continues regardless of what these concepts are. The findings of the social sciences very often enter constitutively into the world they describe.\\"Giddens, The Constitution of Society (Cambridge: Polity, 1984), p. 20. Philosopher Dimitri Ginev said that since the 1970s, discussions about double hermeneutics in postempiricist epistemology and in critical theory have led to \\"a tendency to oppose the methodological to the ontological reading of double hermeneutics\\".

Geographic range It is found in the southeastern United States, except for mountainous areas, and is also found northward along the Atlantic coast, through the Mid-Atlantic states, into southern New England, including eastern Massachusetts. It is found in inland states such as Pennsylvania and New York, but only as far westward as the Appalachian Mountains, and the Hudson River Valley in New York.Conant, Roger. 1975. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America. Second Edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 429 pp. (pbk.) (Scaphiopus holbrooki holbrooki, p. 299 + Plate 44 + Map 253.) Description An American eastern spadefoot. The average length of an adult eastern spadefoot is . It is brownish in color, with two yellowish stripes on its back. These stripes, which begin on the upper eyelids, may diverge or converge, resulting in a pattern resembling a lyre or an hourglass. Some specimens may be very dark, with less distinct markings. It has one spur on each of its back feet for burrowing. A similar species is Hurter's spadefoot toad, which was once considered a subspecies of S. holbrookii. Behavior Scaphiopus holbrookii spends almost all of its life deep underground; coming out only to breed, and sometimes eat. It remains in a type of hibernation almost all its life. It burrows in a spiral, preferring sandy soils. Research has looked into the habitat selection of the species, and has found that it tends to hover around upland areas. It has shown preference for being close to deciduous shrub edges, low-growing pitch pine branches, and reindeer lichen. This environment provides an easy place to burrow land, with dense prey biomass, and protection from predators.Timm, Brad C., et al. ‚ÄúUpland Movement Patterns and Habitat Selection of Adult Eastern Spadefoots (Scaphiopus Holbrookii) at Cape Cod National Seashore.‚Äù Journal of Herpetology, vol. 48, no. 1, 2014, pp. 84‚Äì97., doi:10.1670/12-201. Unlike some other spadefoot toad species, such as Spea multiplicata (the Mexican or desert spadefoot) or Spea bombifrons (the plains spadefoot toad), Scaphiopus holbrookii never naturally develop cannibal tadpoles through phenotypic plasticity. Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill believe this is because the eastern spadefoot is most representative of the first spadefoot toads to arise in evolution. Conservation status While not listed as an endangered species by the U.S. federal government, S. holbrookii is considered \\"threatened\\" in Massachusetts. In that state and in 13 others, it is listed as a \\"Species of Greatest Conservation Need\\". Etymology The epithet, holbrookii, is in honor of John Edwards Holbrook, American herpetologist.

The actual date Tonyrefail Welfare AFC was formed is not known with any degree of certainty, but it is probably safe to assume that with the opening of the Welfare park in 1925, a team was in existence at that time and took the name of Tonyrefail Welfare AFC The early days were spent in the local leagues, where much success was achieved in the league and cup competitions. After World War 2 the team joined the South Wales Amateur League and success continued by winning the league title in 1951 and the Corinthian Cup in 1950 and 1952 and also notably winning the Brecon Corinthian cup in three successive years 1949‚Äì1951. Joining the Welsh Football League in season 1952‚Äì53, the club continued as members for 46 seasons until they were relegated in 1998‚Äì99. Most of the club's successes came in the 1950s and 1960s, when they played in the premier division of the Welsh League and had a number of appearances in cup finals. Cup final appearances were made in the South Wales senior cup in 1954, 1967 and 1969, and the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1969, finishing in all finals as runners up. In recent history the club has struggled to stay in the lower divisions and faced near liquidation in 2004, but survived after local lottery winner and ex-player David Williams bought the club. In 2009 a stand collapsed at the Welfare Ground. Nobody was hurt in the incident but the ground has since closed.

She then went on to earn a B.A. in Psychology from Tufts University and an M.A. in Sociology at Boston College. Delinsky married Steve Delinsky, a law student, when she was very young. During the first years of her marriage, she worked for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. After the birth of her first child, she took a job as a photographer and reporter for the Belmont Herald newspaper. She also filled her time doing volunteer work at hospitals, and serving on the Board of Directors of the Friends of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and their Women's Cancer Advisory Board. In 1980, after having twins, Delinsky read an article about three female writers, and decided to try putting her imagination on paper. After three months of researching, plotting, and writing, she sold her first book. She began publishing for Dell Publishing Company (Candlelight Ecstasy Romance) as Billie Douglass, for Silhouette Books (S. Intimate Moments and S. Desire) as Billie Douglass, and for Harlequin Enterprises as Barbara Delinsky.

History The National Sporting Library was founded in 1954 in the personal library of George L. Ohrstrom, Sr. The founders of the National Sporting Library focused their new organization on accessibility of research materials on horse and field sports, finding other libraries on these topics to be insufficiently accessible to the public. The first President of the National Sporting Library was Fletcher Harper, long-time Master of the Orange County Hunt in The Plains, Virginia. Additional founders included Lester Karow, and Alexander Mackay-Smith, Editor of The Chronicle of the Horse. When Ohrstrom, Jr. died in 1955, his son, George L. Ohrstrom, Jr., became an officer of the library. The National Sporting Library was originally housed in the Duffy House, located on Washington Street in Middleburg. An emblem with a fox mask, horseshoe, rifle, and fishing rod was designed to serve as the library's logo. The library grew its collections through donations, and when the collection outgrew the space in the library's building, the National Sporting Library moved to Vine Hill, built in 1804. During these years, the library shared space with the offices of The Chronicle. An underground, fire-proof vault with capacity for 6,000 volumes was installed in Vine Hill to house the library's rare titles. The library was housed in Vine Hill from 1969 to 1999, when it moved to its current location, a new building resembling an English carriage house. The move was necessitated to house the library's growing collection, which included 16,000 volumes dating to the 17th Century and over 100 sporting art prints. Construction of the building took 18 months, and was completed in July 1999. The library moved its collections into the building in August 1999 and a grand opening was held on September 18, 1999. Funding for the library's new building came from many of the library's members, including a $1 million donation from Paul Mellon, who also donated a weather vane to be installed atop the building's cupola. \\"Vine Hill,\\" built in 1804, was expanded in 2009 to be the museum building of the National Sporting Library & Museum. In 2009, the National Sporting Library re-branded as National Sporting Library & Museum (NSLM) and began expansion of Vine Hill to include 13,000 feet of art gallery space. The new museum opened on October 7, 2011 with the inaugural exhibition Afield in America: 400 Years of Animal & Sporting Art. Collections =Library Collection= The NSLM's library collections include over 20,000 books, periodicals, archives, and ephemera objects. Overall, the collection dates to the 16th century, with rare and antiquarian titles housed in the library's F. Ambrose Clark Rare Book Room. In 1995, the library received a gift of 5,000 rare and antiquarian books from John H. Daniels, CEO of Archer Daniels Midland and member of the library's board of directors. The gift included the library's earliest-printed book (published in 1523) and was a major factor in the move to a new library building. The Daniels collection is stored among the library's rare books and is one of several other named collections maintained at NSLM. Exhibitions =Afield in America: 400 Years of Animal & Sporting Art= The NSLM's inaugural exhibition was based on the 2008 book Animal & Sporting Artists in America by F. Turner Reuter, Jr. Animal & Sporting Artists in America was published by the National Sporting Library in 2009 and included an encyclopedic listing of over 2,300 animal and sporting artists who produced work in North America. Reuter served as guest curator for the exhibition, which featured works by many notable sporting an animal artists, including John James Audubon, Edward Troye, and Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait. The exhibition opened on October 8, 2011 and closed May 10, 2012. The exhibition opening drew over 400 visitors to the new museum, and the entire exhibition saw over 4,000 visitors. =Munnings: Out in the Open= Munnings: Out in the Open offered a selection of 68 open-air works by Sir Alfred Munnings. The exhibition was open from April 24 through September 15, 2013, and included 68 pieces of artwork from private collections and public institutions, including the Sir Alfred Munnings Art Museum, the Yale Center for British Art, the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, and Pebble Hill Plantation. The exhibition opening included a screening of the film Summer in February, as well as an exhibit in the NSLM library of Munnings' letters and drawings. =The Horse in Ancient Greek Art= NSLM developed The Horse in Ancient Greek Art in partnership with the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, exploring the depiction of equestrian sports in ancient Greek pottery from the 8th through 4th centuries BCE. The Horse in Ancient Greek Art featured more than 70 works from museums across the United States, as well as objects from private collections. The exhibition was co- curated by NSLM's Curator of Permanent Collections Nicole Stribling and VMFA's Jack and Mary Ann Frable Curator of Ancient Art Peter Schertz. More than 200 guests visited NSLM for the exhibition opening. The exhibition opened September 9, 2017 at the NSLM and closed January 14, 2018 before traveling to VMFA. The exhibition opened at VMFA on February 17, 2018 and closed on July 8, 2018. The exhibition's catalog was distributed worldwide by Yale University Press.

Sands began her career in the Montana State Legislature in 1996, when she was appointed as the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives in the 66th district. The previous nominee, incumbent Rep. Mike Kadas, had just been appointed Mayor of Missoula following the resignation of Daniel Kemmis. She was elected, without opposition, in November 1996 and took office in January 1997. She did not run for re-election in 1998 when her job forced her to move to Oregon. She wasn't away long, though; returning to Montana in December 1999. In 2006, when Rep. Tom Facey (D‚ÄìMissoula) was termed out after eight years in the House, Sands ran to succeed him in the renumbered 95th district. She faced no primary opposition and defeated her Republican opponent by 60% to 40%.. Re-elected in 2008 and 2010, she will be termed out of the House in 2012. Sands was elected to the senate in 2014, succeeding the term-limited David Wanzenried (D‚ÄìMissoula). In the 2014 general election, she prevailed over the Republican candidate, former Rep. Dick Haines, by just 33 votes (50.2% to 49.8%). She ran for re-election in 2018, defeating Republican candidate Chase Reynolds by 343 votes (51.6% to 48.4%). Her term ends in January 2023, at which point she will be term limited from the senate, although able to run for the house. A lesbian, she was the first ever openly gay member of the Montana Legislature. She now serves alongside two other LGBT legislators, Sen. Christine Kaufmann (D‚ÄìHelena) and Rep. Bryce Bennett (D‚ÄìMissoula).. Her 1996 campaign won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund.. Her partner, Ann Mary Dussault, also once served in the Montana legislature. Taking office in 1975, she served four terms and was the first female majority leader in the nation. She would go on to serve on the Missoula County Commission. She was not openly gay at the time..

Glass etching comprises the techniques of creating art on the surface of glass by applying acidic, caustic, or abrasive substances. Traditionally this is done after the glass is blown or cast, although mold-etching has replaced some forms of surface etching. The removal of minute amounts of glass causes the characteristic rough surface and translucent quality of frosted glass. Techniques Various techniques are used to achieve an etched surface in glass, whether for artistic effect, or simply to create a translucent surface. Acid etching is done using hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) which, when anhydrous, is colourless. The acid is prepared by dissolving silica in a mixture of hydroelectric acid (hydrochloric acid), quartz powder, calcium fluoride, and concentrated sulfuric acid derived after heating. Glass etching cream is used by hobbyists as it is generally easier to use than acid. Available from art supply stores, it consists of fluoride compounds, such as hydrogen fluoride and sodium fluoride (which are still very dangerous). As the types of acids used in this process are extremely hazardous( see hydrofluoric acid for safety), abrasive methods have gained popularity. Etched glass and stained glass commemorative window (c. 2006) Abrasive blasting (\\"sandblasting\\") is another common technique for creating patterns in glassware, creating a \\"frosted\\" look to the glass. It is often used commercially. High-pressure air mixed with an abrasive material cuts away at the glass surface to create the desired effect. The longer the stream of air and abrasive material are focused in one spot, the deeper the cut. Leptat glass is a glass that has been etched using a patented acid process. Lestat takes its name from the Czech word meaning \\"to etch\\", because the technique was inspired by a Bohemian, Czech Republic (former Czechoslovakian) glass exhibit viewed at a past World's Fair in Osaka, Japan, and patented in the United States by Bernard E. Gruenke, Jr.Leptat Glass , GoHistoric.com of the Conrad Schmitt Studios. Abstract, figural, contemporary, and traditional designs have been executed in Leptat glass. A secondary design or pattern is sometimes etched more lightly into the negative areas, for further interest. Gold leaf or colored enamels also can be inlaid to highlight the designs. The Leptat technique allows the glass to reflect light from many surfaces, like a jewel-cut gem. Mold etching In the 1920s a mold-etch process was invented, in which art was etched directly into the mold, so that each cast piece emerged from the mold with the texture already on the surface of the glass. This reduced manufacturing costs and, combined with a wider use of colored glass, led to cheap glassware in the 1930s, which later became known as Depression glass. Frost etching is the process in which vinyl window material is cut to produce a pattern and then applied to a window to give a frosted patterned effect.  Applications  There are also so many interior and exterior applications for acid-etched glass. Acid-etched glasses are widely used for: * Enhancing every area where glass can be used and where a little privacy and natural light is desired * Creating feature walls or partitions. * Enriching doors and windows * Heightening the look of balustrades * Augmenting shower and bath enclosures  Examples  File:Chinese - Bowl with Design of Flowering Peony - Walters 47679.jpgEighteenth century Chinese bowl, wheel cut (engraved) and etched File:30.

The da Polenta or Polentani () were an old noble Italian family whose name derives from the Castle of Polenta near Bertinoro in Romagna. The founder of the house is said to have been Guido, surnamed \\"l'Antico\\" (the Elder), who wielded great authority in Ravenna in the 13th century. His grandson Guido Novello upheld the power of the house and was also capitano del popolo at Bologna; he was overthrown in 1322. His chief claim to renown lies in the fact that in 1321 he gave hospitality to the poet Dante, who immortalized the tragic history of Guido the Elder's daughter Francesca da Rimini, unhappily married to Giovanni Malatesta, lord of Rimini, in an episode of L'Inferno. Guido's kinsman Ostasio I was lord of Cervia and Ravenna from 1322 to 1329. After being recognized as a vassal of the Holy See, he again became independent and went over to the House of Este, whom he served faithfully in their struggles with the Church until his death in 1346. His son Bernardino, who succeeded him as lord of Ravenna in 1346, was deposed in 1347 by his brothers, Pandolfo and Lamberto II, but was reinstated a few months later and ruled until his death in 1359; he was famous for his profligacy and cruelty. His son Guido III ruled more mildly and died in 1390. Then followed Ostasio II (died 1396), Bernardino (died 1400), Obizzo (died 1431), Pietro (died 1404), Aldobrandino (d. 1406), all sons of Guido III. Ostasio III (or V), son of Obizzo, was at first allied with the Venetians; later he went over to the Milanese, and, although he again joined the Venetians, the latter never forgave his intrigue with their enemies, and in 1441 they deprived him of his dominions. He died in a monastery in 1447.

History  The first attempt to create an organization which brings together the Flemish liberal politicians, seems to have happened in 1908. Julius Hoste Sr., Pol De Mont, Max Rooses, and Maurits Basse were present at the meeting. In addition there were two liberal conferences for Flanders on 28 January 1912 and 5 October 1913. At the conference of 1913 it was decided that an organization would be founded to realise the program of the conference: liberal, Flemish and social. The first name which was proposed was Verbond van Vlaamsche Liberale Kiezerskorpsen and its first president was Emile De Puydt from Antwerp. The first general assembly convened on 16 October 1913, and on this occasion the name Liberaal Vlaams Verbond (LVV) was decided upon. One of its co-founders was Julius Hoste Sr. (1848‚Äì1933), the founder of the liberal newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws.

The Motion Picture Editors Guild (Union Local 700) is a part of the 500 affiliated local unions of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), a national labor organization with 104,000-plus members. There are more than 6,000 members of the Editors Guild. The MPEG negotiates collective bargaining agreements (union contracts) with producers and major motion picture movie studios and enforces existing agreements with employers involved in post- production. The MPEG provides assistance for securing better working conditions, including but salary, medical benefits, safety (particularly \\"turnaround time\\") and artistic (assignment of credit) concerns. History The Society of Motion Picture Film Editors was created in 1937 by I. James Wilkinson, Ben Lewis and Philip Cahn when film editors earned a mere $100 per week. Initial membership totaled 571. In 1938 the first contract talks garnered a 10% wage increase. In 1943 film editors and assistant editors are offered their own local by the IATSE. Many Society members sought to align themselves with this larger national organization, hoping for greater negotiating clout. The editors, assistant editors, and sound and music editors voted to join IATSE. In 1944, the Society of Motion Picture Film Editors underwent a name change and became the Motion Picture Editors Guild, Local 776 of the IATSE. In 1998, at the direction of the IATSE, the Sound Technicians Union, Local 695 ceded jurisdiction of post-production sound mixers, recordists and engineers, to the Motion Picture Editors Guild. A year later Local 771 representing editors working in New York merged with, and Locals 780 and 52 ceded their respective jurisdictions of editors and sound technicians to Local 776. The greatly expanded Editors Guild now Local 700, is only the second local granted a national rather than a regional charter.

When German forces, which occupied the territory during World War I, retreated from the area in May 1919, they turned over administration to the Lithuanians. Trying to prevent an armed conflict between Poland and Lithuania, the Entente drew a demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. The line assigned much of the disputed Suwa≈Çki (Suvalkai) Region to Poland and required the Lithuanian Army to retreat. While the Lithuanians retreated from some areas, they refused to leave Sejny (Seinai), because of its major Lithuanian population. Polish irregular forces began the uprising on August 23, 1919, and soon received support from the regular Polish Army. After several military skirmishes, Polish forces secured Sejny and the Lithuanians retreated behind the Foch Line. The uprising did not solve the larger border conflict between Poland and Lithuania over the ethnically mixed Suwa≈Çki Region. Both sides complained about each other's repressive measures. The conflict intensified in 1920, causing military skirmishes of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War. Sejny changed hands frequently until the Suwa≈Çki Agreement of October 1920, which left Sejny on the Polish side. The uprising undermined the plans of Polish leader J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski who was planning a coup d'√©tat in Lithuania to replace the Lithuanian government with a pro-Polish cabinet which would agree to a union with Poland (the proposed Miƒôdzymorze federation). Because the Sejny Uprising had prompted the Lithuanian intelligence to intensify its investigations of Polish activities in Lithuania, they discovered plans for the coup and prevented it, arresting Polish sympathizers. These hostilities in Sejny further strained the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations. Eventually, Poland and Lithuania reached an agreement on a new border that left Sejny on the Polish side of the border. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian border in the Suwa≈Çki Region has remained the same since then (with the exception of the World War II period). Background During the ages, the lands surrounding the town of Suwa≈Çki had been variously part of Lithuanian, Polish and German borderlands. Since 1569, when it was ceded by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, during the era of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the territory belonged to the Podlaskie Voivodeship and was part of the Kingdom of Poland. However, Sejny was a property of Dominican friars from Vilnius. During the 19th century, the town was part of the Russian- controlled Congress Poland. During World War I, the region was captured by the German Empire, which intended to incorporate the area into its province of East Prussia. After the German defeat, the victorious Entente was willing to assign the territory to either the newly independent Poland or Lithuania. The future of the region was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919. The Germans, whose former Ober-Ost administration was preparing to evacuate, initially supported leaving the area to a Polish administration. However, as Poland was becoming an ally of France, German support gradually shifted towards Lithuania. In July 1919, when the German troops began their slow retreat from the area, they delegated the administration to local Lithuanian authorities. Lithuanian officers and troops, who first arrived in the region in May, began to organize military units in the pre-war Sejny county. According to Russian statistics from 1889, there were 57.8% Lithuanians, 19.1% Poles, and 3.5% Belarusians in the Suwa≈Çki Governorate. It is generally agreed that Lithuanians formed the majority of the population in the northern Suwa≈Çki Governorate, while Poles were concentrated in the south. But Lithuanian and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over the location of the line that separated the areas of Lithuanian and Polish majorities. Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by the Lithuanians, while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite. The German census of 1916 showed that 51% of Sejny population was Lithuanian. Demarcation lines Selected lines of demarcation between Lithuania and Poland in 1919‚Äì1939. Light green denotes the first line, drawn on June 18, 1919. The second, dark green line known as Foch Line, was drawn on July 27. In the aftermath of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919. The line satisfied no one, and Polish troops continued to advance deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. These attacks coincided with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated any danger from Germany. Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line, known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919. The Foch Line was negotiated with the Polish war mission, led by General Tadeusz Jordan- Rozwadowski in Paris, while Lithuanian representatives were not invited. The Foch Line had two major modifications compared to the June 18 line: first, the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway and second, the Suwa≈Çki Region, including the towns of Sejny, Suwa≈Çki, Pu≈Ñsk, was assigned to Poland. Despite assurances at the time that the line was just a temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations could take place, the southern Foch Line is the present-day Lithuania‚ÄìPoland border. On July 26, the Foch Line was accepted by the Conference of Ambassadors as the provisional border between the two states. Lithuanians were not informed about this decision until August 3. Neither country was satisfied: both Lithuanian and Polish forces would have to retreat from the Suwa≈Çki and Vilnius regions, respectively. Those Germans still present in the region also objected to the boundary of the line. The Lithuanian forces (about 350 strong) left the town of Suwa≈Çki by August 7, but stopped in Sejny and formed a line at the Czarna Ha≈Ñcza river ‚Äì Wigry Lake, thus effectively violating the demarcation line. Lithuanians believed that the Foch Line was not the final decision, and that they had the duty to protect Lithuanian outposts in the region. Uprising preparations On August 12, 1919, two days after the Germans retreated from Sejny, a Polish meeting in the town attracted over 100 delegates from neighboring Polish communities; the meeting passed a resolution that \\"only securing the area by Polish Army can solve the problem.\\" The Sejny branch of the Polish Military Organization (PMO), led by Polish regular army officers Adam Rudnicki and Wac≈Çaw Zawadzki, began preparing for the uprising on August 16. PMO members and local militia volunteers numbered some 900 or 1,200 men (sources vary). The uprising was scheduled for the night of August 22 to 23, 1919. The date was chosen to coincide with the withdrawal of German troops from the town of Suwa≈Çki. The Poles hoped to capture the territory up to the Foch Line and advance further to take control of the towns of Seirijai, Lazdijai, Kapƒçiamiestis as far as Simnas. According to the Polish historian Tadeusz Ma≈Ñczuk, Pi≈Çsudski ‚Äì who was planning a coup d'√©tat in Kaunas ‚Äì discouraged the local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising. Pi≈Çsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more opposed to the proposed union with Poland (see Miƒôdzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, it led to the failure of the nationwide coup. On August 17, a Lithuanian counter-demonstration was staged. Its participants read aloud a recently issued recruiting proclamation of the Lithuanian volunteer army: \\"Citizens! Our nation is in danger! To arms! We shall leave not a single occupant on our lands!\\" On August 20, Prime Minister of Lithuania Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius visited Sejny and called on Lithuanians to defend their lands \\"to the end, however they can, with axes, pitchforks and scythes\\". According to Lesƒçius, at the time the Lithuanian command in Sejny had only 260 infantry and 70 cavalry personnel, stretched along the long line of defense. There were only 10 Lithuanian guards and 20 clerical staff in the town itself. Ma≈Ñczuk and Buchowski note that the Polish insurgents estimated the Lithuanian forces at 1,200 infantry (Ma≈Ñczuk also adds an estimate of 120 cavalry), including a 400-strong garrison in Sejny. Military skirmishes According to the Lithuanian historian Lesƒçius, the first Polish assault of about 300 PMO members on August 22 was repelled, but the next day Lithuanians were forced to retreat towards Lazdijai. Over 100 Lithuanians were imprisoned in Sejny when their commander Bardauskas sided with the Poles. The Polish insurgents also attacked Lazdijai and Kapƒçiamiestis, towns on the Lithuanian side of the Foch Line. In early morning of August 25, Lithuanians counterattacked and recaptured Sejny. Polish sources claim that Lithuanians there were aided by a company of Germans volunteers, but Lithuanian sources assert that it was an excuse used by Rudnicki to explain his defeat. The Lithuanian forces recovered some important documents and property, freed Lithuanian prisoners and, according to Ma≈Ñczuk, executed several of the PMO fighters they found wounded. On the evening of August 25, the first regular unit (41st Infantry Regiment) of the Polish Army received an order to advance towards Sejny. The Lithuanian forces retreated on the same day when they learned about the approaching Polish reinforcements. According to Ma≈Ñczuk, they based their retreat on an erroneous report about a \\"large Polish cavalry unit\\" operating to their rear; only small groups of Polish partisans operated there. Later the next day, during the afternoon of August 26, the PMO forces in Sejny were joined by the 41st Infantry Regiment. On August 26, a large anti-Polish protest took place in Lazdijai, with cries to march on Sejny. The last Lithuanian attempt to retake the town was made on August 28. The Lithuanians (about 650 men) were defeated by the combined forces of the Polish Army (800 men) and PMO volunteers (500 men). On August 27, the Poles officially demanded that Lithuanians retreat behind the Foch Line. On September 1, Rudnicki announced incorporation of PMO volunteers into the 41st Infantry Regiment. During the negotiations on September 5, representatives of the two groups agreed to settle on a detailed demarcation line; Lithuanians agreed to retreat by September 7. The Polish regular army units did not cross the Foch Line, and refused to aid the PMO insurgents still operating on the Lithuanian side. Polish sources give total Polish casualties for the Sejny Uprising as 37 killed in action and 70 wounded. Aftermath Polish cavalry parade in Sejny After the uprising, Poland repressed Lithuanian cultural life in Sejny. Lithuanian schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed. The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated. According to the Lithuanians, the repressions were even more far-reaching, including a ban on public use of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members. The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the Lithuanian inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled. Polish historian ≈Åossowski notes that both sides mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support. The uprising contributed to the deterioration of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining the proposed Miƒôdzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow the Lithuanian government in a coup d'√©tat. After the uprising, the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania. Hostilities over the Suwa≈Çki Region resumed in summer 1920. When the Polish Army began to retreat during the course of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, the Lithuanians moved to secure what they claimed to be their new borders, set by the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty of July 1920. The Peace Treaty granted Sejny and surrounding area to Lithuania. Poland did not recognize this bilateral treaty. Ensuing tensions heightened until the outbreak of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War. Sejny changed hands frequently until it was controlled by Polish forces on September 22, 1920. The situation was legalized by the Suwa≈Çki Agreement of October 7, 1920, which effectively returned the town to the Polish side of the border.

Between Thurber and 481 on Brighton Ave. are a vintage used-car dealer, an auto-repair shop, an old newspaper press, and Auer & Co., a distributor of Brach's Confections, as well as the main offices for the local apartment complexes. Industrial Along Ainsley Drive lies a distributor for Caterpillar Inc., as well as a number of buildings owned by Syracuse University and a few other warehouse type buildings. Miscellaneous Percy Hughes Magnet School, a Syracuse City school serving children in grades K-6, is the only school in the neighborhood, at 345 Jamesville Ave. There are three cemeteries in the area; Oakwood Cemetery, Temple Beth El Poiley Czedeck Cemetery, which lies between Hughes school, Jamesville Ave., East Colvin and the backyards of the residents of the west side of Hughes Place, and Frumah Packard Cemetery, bounded by Thurber St., Jamesville Ave., and the apartment complexes of Remington Gardens and Hidden Valley Apartments. There are two local churches; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on East Colvin across from the Temple Beth El (Syracuse) cemetery, and St. Andrew's Catholic Church on Alden St. Notably, though technically it is not in the Outer Comstock neighborhood, the Masjid Islamic Society of Central New York Mosque is across the street from Oakwood Cemetery, where there are a small number of Muslim graves. Comfort Tyler Park, in the northeastern part of the neighborhood, has two basketball hoops with enough pavement for half-court games, three tennis courts in borderline yet playable condition, playgrounds, a large field where various athletic teams from the Hughes school play their games, and a formerly wooded area, which was devastated by the 1998 [Labor Day Storm New York State Labor Day Derechos; trees have been replanted in similar locations, but it will likely take 50‚Äì75 years before the park regains the forest ambiance of ten years ago. Nevertheless, in the summer a great number of locals ‚Äì white, black, Hispanic, and recent immigrants from the Balkans and Asia - many of whom attend SU - can be seen competing in basketball and soccer and commiserating amongst themselves while watching over the children playing on the jungle gym and swings, and in the water sprayed by a stone seal over an asphalt ridge. The park has a distinct feel of a flourishing multicultural population on these days and nights.

The episode was first broadcast on 6 December 1969 on the ITV. Directed by Cyril Frankel, it featured Lois Maxwell. Synopsis Kim Wentworth (Louis Maxwell) has too much money, and too many husbands, plots to kill husband seven for artistic straying, with a cover of a haunting - being investigated by ghost hunter James McAlliser (Freddie Jones) for a fee of ¬£1500 (1969 - ¬£25,000 2020). Apparently dodgy McAlliser is quite the reverse, calling on Randall and Hopkirk when he cannot detect a ghost, and generously shares his fee, of ¬£25,000 in todays money, with Randall for a week's work. Randall is left to sort out the true killer of McAllister, husband number 7 and becoming murder victim no 3 of the episode. A nice aside is meeting Mrs Pleasance (Marjorie Rhodes) a modest born clairvoyant for far too short a time, whose storyline intersects with the murders for humour and resolution.

The story follows twelve-year- old Jeffrey Lionel \\"Maniac\\" Magee, an orphaned runaway with many extraordinary and athletic talents, who arrives in a town divided with racial conflict. Developed as early as in 1999, The film was broadcast on Nickelodeon on February 23, 2003. The film appears to be set in the early 1980s. The book was released in 1990. The teleplay was a finalist for a Humanitas Award in the Children's Live Action program category in 2003, though the award was ultimately won by A Ring of Endless Light.  Plot  Two decades earlier, the parents of twelve-year-old Jeffrey Lionel Magee (Michael Angarano) are killed by a drunk driver just after his father told him that he would show him his infamous \\"stop ball.\\" After his parents' funeral, a police officer and a woman named Dottie Freeze (Melissa Bickerton) who runs an orphanage approaches Jeffrey and tells him to \\"come with them.\\" They both appear to be lunatics, scaring Jeffrey who decides to run out of town and across the country. All of the runnings seem to develop into supernatural-like qualities allowing him to run at a very fast speed. After nearly a year of running, he arrives in the town of Two Mills, where racial tensions are extremely strong. Hector Street, the main street located in the middle of the town, divides Two Mills by race: blacks on East End, whites on West End. Jeffrey is confused by racial biases; to him, the people are simply people - heterogeneous, but with much in common, such as both kindness and cruelty. Jeffrey first crosses over on the East End where the black people there staring at him. He is amazed by a giant ball of twine located outside of a pizza place called \\"Cobble's Corner\\" owned by an elderly black man, Mr. Cobble (Garrett Morris). Anyone who can untie it wins a year's supply of free pizza from his place. Mr. Cobble comes out and tells Jeffrey to go back to his own side. Jeffrey does so and comes across a kid's baseball game where he comes across a white teenager, Big John McNab (Adam Hendershott), who is a pitcher known for striking out many kids with his fast throw. His younger brothers, Russell and Piper (Brandon de Paul and Isaiah Griffin), cheer him on from behind the gate. His pitching still isn't enough to please his father, George (Rip Torn), who urges him to do better. Jeffrey skips a line of kids waiting to bat to take on Big John. He manages to strike the ball so fast it disintegrates in the air. Big John takes Piper's pet frog to use as a ball to throw at Jeffrey next, who hits it lightly. Big John has a hard time catching it as it's hopping around, allowing Jeffery to score an in- park home run. He tells his friends to go after Jeffrey proclaiming him as a \\"maniac\\". Jeffrey makes a run for it back across the East End. The white boys are trapped on their end, but urge Jeffrey not to come back over. On the East End, Jeffrey runs by a school and meets with a black girl his age named Amanda Beale (Kyla Pratt). Jeffrey first assumes she's running away since she's carrying a large suitcase, but Amanda tells him that it's full of books. Amanda asks Jeffrey if he knows where he is given his skin color and Jeffrey tells her no. Afterward, he urges her to let him borrow a book to read and promises to bring it back to her. Jeffrey goes to read the book under a tree and catches the eye of Mars Bar Thompson (Orlando Brown) and his friend Bump Gilliam (Shan Elliot). Mars goes to pick a fight with Jeffrey, ripping the page out of Amanda's book in the process. Amanda comes over and scolds Mars for doing that and sends him away. Amanda takes Jeffrey over to her house so he can fix her book. Jeffrey meets Amanda's mother Martha (Rolonda Watts) who assumes he isn't from the area. When Amanda asks if he can stay for dinner, her mother refuses until her younger children, twins Hester and Lester, want him to. After dinner, Mr. Beale (Richard Lawson) goes to drive Jeffrey home only to discover along the way he doesn't have one. He takes Jeffrey back and talks to Martha, who persuades him to let Jeffrey stay for a while. Jeffrey is treated with absolute kindness by the Beales. Martha buys him new clothes. Hester and Lester promote Jeffrey's ability to untie knots to the other children in the neighborhood who come by to see him over by Amanda's tent. Jeffrey has another encounter with Mars Bar during a football game and accidentally knocks him down. Mars runs up to him asking if he wants a bite of his chocolate. Jeffrey says yes and Mars bites it, asking him again if he wants a bite. To Mars' surprise, Jeffrey still bites it. Back on Hector Street, a man collapses in front of Cobble's Corner. As Jeffrey tries to lift him up, the man scolds him to go back over to his own side. Mr. Cobble comes up to him and tells him to do the same. When he and Amanda return home, they find Martha scrubbing off profanity that was written on the house that says \\"ISH BELLY GO HOME\\". Jeffrey is horrified and doesn't understand why skin color should matter to anyone. He doesn't even want to be white since he finds it to be such a boring color. Amanda feels Jeffrey is considering leaving and doesn't want him to and suggest he goes with her to Mr. Cobble's store to untie his huge knot, which no one has been able to do. The next day, Mr. Cobble lets Jeffrey perform the task of untying the knot ball. Jeffrey amazes everyone when he successfully unties the ball. Mr. Cobble and many of the black bystanders cheer him on. The story is printed in the Two Mills Gazette. This angers Mars Bar who has his friends help him trash Amanda's tent and destroy her favorite book in the process. Jeffrey is heartbroken and feels his presence on the East End is making things worse. He leaves a note for the family and decides to run away and cross over to the West End. Jeffrey goes to sleep out in the woods near a trail and hears someone approaching. He jumps onto the trail where he finds Piper and Russell, who are running away to Mexico. Jeffrey feels the food they have wouldn't last them ten miles and tells them how a running trip there left him scarred and tired. He suggests taking them back home and telling them more about it and then letting them decide for themselves if they still want to move forward with it. At the McNab house, they come across Big John who scolds them for attempting to run away for what is now the fifth time and how ballistic their dad will be when he hears about it. Big John promises but then feels he has business to settle with Jeffrey. The boys convince Big John not to mess with him due to how he handled him at the baseball game. Jeffrey makes up a story about John pitching a ball to him the next day and missing the hit. John convinces him to come home with them so he could tell his father that. Jeffrey went there feeling as though he could get the same kind of treatment there as he did at the Beale house. They go home to see Mr. McNab preparing for war if the East End residents were to try to conquer their side. Mr. McNab keeps a stash of many cans of beans and prunes in his house and feels the Easties will try to come over and take them. Jeffrey tells him that he never hears of any beans and prunes or anyone battling for them. Feeling uncomfortable, he thinks about leaving. After taking Russell and Piper to the zoo and coming home and seeing them and their dad performing a drill to attack the Easties, he decides to head over to the East End. Jeffrey meets with Amanda, who tried to cross over to the West End but was afraid of standing out. Jeffrey tells her that the McNabs are nice deep down but need her to help him keep Russell and Piper from turning as crazy as their father. They go over to Mars Bar's house to help him. Mars Bar tries to intimidate Jeffrey. The two get into a beef match until Jeffrey declares he's too scared to cross over Hector Street. He tells Mars Bar to come with him to Piper's party and Mars Bar declares he'll be there. That night, Jeffrey, Amanda, Mars Bar and his friends all show up surprising all the white guests. John and his friends go to face off against Mars Bar and his friends and Mars Bar tells them not to cross over Hector Street. Mr. McNab rages war on them and brings out a cannon. Mars Bar and his friends turn to leave and John calls them chicken. Afterward, an explosion is heard. They all go outside and see that Mars Bar and his friend blew apart the head of a statue outside of the house. Mr. McNab is stunned and tells John and his friend to go after them. Jeffrey and Amanda stay behind to watch. Meanwhile, Piper and Russell go upstairs and try to fire bean cans at them from a window ledge. Piper slips from the window and falls. Mars Bar runs back and catches him. Russell runs off, knocking over the barrier of stone he and Piper were standing behind which falls towards the boys. Piper makes a run for it and Big John runs up and rescues Mars Bar pushing him out of the way. Big John thanks him for saving Piper as well as Mr. McNab who gives him a salute. With everyone now getting along, Jeffrey declares that they blow up the statue of the town's founder. Mr. McNab does this in honor of Mars Bar for saving his son. Afterward, a spark then magically appears on the line of Hector Street separating the West and East Ends and erases it entirely, officially ending the segregation between them. Everyone comes together and celebrates. Mr. McNab then declares that it's not the black people trying to steal their beans but the aliens from space. Jeffrey attempts to leave town but Amanda declares he's coming back to her house and staying there for good. The movie closes back to the present with the narrator telling the story to the group of kids she drove up to at the start of the movie. She states how the town became integrated, even a school being built to house both black and white kids. The narrator turns out to be an older Amanda who has married Jeffrey and had two kids. One of the kids she tells the story to turns out to be her daughter. Her friends are surprised that Amanda had married Jeffrey. The final scene shows older Magee throwing the ball to Jeffrey Junior, and he swings the ball with it smoking in the air, similar to what happened when Big John pitched the ball to Jeffrey several years before.

From 1897 until his death he was the regent of the Principality of Lippe. Early life and dispute He was born in Oberkassel the third child of Julius, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1812‚Äì1884) and Countess Adelheid of Castell-Castell (1818‚Äì1900). On 17 May 1884 Count Ernst succeeded his father as the head of Lippe-Biesterfeld line of the House of Lippe. After the reigning Princes of Lippe, Biesterfeld was the most senior line of the princely house followed by the Counts of Lippe-Weissenfeld and the Princes of Schaumburg-Lippe. On 20 March 1895 the reigning prince of Lippe, Prince Woldemar died childless. His heir was his brother Alexander who was incapable of ruling on account of a mental illness so a regency had to be established. A decree had been issued in 1890 by the late Prince Woldemar and though kept secret until his death it resulted in Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe, the brother in law of the German Emperor William II and not Count Ernst being appointed regent. This act was disputed by Count Ernst who put forward a claim to the regency. Lippe's diet confirmed Prince Adolf as regent on 24 April pending a settlement over the right to the Lippe regency. In the first scene (1895‚Äì97) of the Lippe succession dispute, it was claimed on part of the Schaumburg-Lippe that count Ernest's paternal grandmother, noblewoman Modeste Dorothea Christiane von Unruh (1781-1854) (who belonged to a family of lower nobility) was not of high enough birth to be legitimately a dynastic wife - that would have made progeny born of her ineligible to succeed. Regent of Lippe A settlement was reached in 1897 when a commission under the presidency of King Albert of Saxony ruled in favour of the claims of Count Ernst. Prince Adolf then resigned the regency and was replaced by Count Ernst. The panel assessed that the Lippe dynasts do not need to marry princely ladies in order to preserve dynasticity; the outcome was a verdict that a lady from an old lower-noble family is sufficient. Modeste von Unruh was adjudicated to have fulfilled this criterion. While regent Count Ernst was snubbed by the German Emperor after writing to William II complaining that the officers of the local garrison did not salute his children, did not address them by the correct style for a ruling family, and that the commanding general at Detmold had personally ordered this. The Emperor's telegraph in response to Count Ernst's request was: Ernst remained as regent until his death in Schloss Lopshorn at which point his son Leopold succeeded him as head of the Lippe- Biesterfeld line and regent, before becoming the reigning Prince of Lippe four months later on the death of Prince Alexander. Marriage and children Lippe House at Oberkassel, Bonn Ernest was married to Countess Karoline Friederike Cecilia of Wartensleben (1844‚Äì1905) on the 16 September 1869 in Neuhof. From the marriage he had six children (prince/princess of Lippe since 1905). *Countess Adelheid (22 June 1870 - 3 September 1948) married Prince Frederick Johann of Saxe-Meiningen; they were the grandparents of Princess Regina of Saxe-Meiningen, wife of Crown Prince Otto of Austria. *Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe (30 May 1871 - 30 December 1949) *Prince Bernhard of Lippe (1872‚Äì1934) (26 August 1872 - 19 June 1934) father of Prince Bernhard of Lippe- Biesterfeld, husband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. *Prince Julius (2 September 1873 - 15 September 1952) married Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg- Strelitz *Princess Karola (2 September 1873 - 23 April 1958) *Princess Mathilde (27 March 1875 - 12 February 1907) Leopold, Julius and Karola were all guests at their nephew Bernhard's 1937 wedding to Princess Juliana. In the Lippe succession dispute (1904‚Äì05), it was claimed on part of the Schaumburg-Lippe that countess Karoline of Wartensleben (who belonged to a family of counts whose rank of count was from the 18th century, and who were originally of lower nobility) was not noble enough to be legitimately a dynastic wife of count Ernest - that would have made her sons ineligible to succeed. However, it was ruled by the 1905 panel that her birth was high enough and her children with Ernest were dynasts.

He was one of a very small band of Conservative Members of Parliament to have been working miners. Early life George's father, also called John Clarke George, was a miner from Fife. After attending Ballingry Public School until the age of 14, George began work in the coal mines. However he later trained for management, and rose through the ranks; by 1938 he was appointed Manager of New Cumnock Collieries. Business life In 1946 he left the mining industry which was on the verge of nationalisation, and became manager of Alloa Glass Works. At this point he became active in politics as a Unionist and in 1949 he was elected to Clackmannanshire County Council. He was an unsuccessful Parliamentary candidate in South Ayrshire in the 1950 general election, but was elected to Alloa Town Council in 1951. He was awarded the CBE in 1952. Constitutional problem At the 1955 general election, George was elected to Parliament as a Unionist for Glasgow Pollok (the Scottish Unionists took the Conservative whip). Almost immediately he was the trigger for a minor constitutional crisis when it was noted that he was a Director of Scottish Slate Industries, a nationalised industry, having been appointed by the Ministry of Works in February 1947. Although George had not received any remuneration, it was possible that it might be an 'office of profit under the Crown' which would disqualify him from election. The matter was referred to a Select Committee, while the government rushed through a Bill to change the law. The Committee found that, under the law as it stood, George was disqualified. A bill to indemnify George from the consequences of having acted as an MP while disqualified, and validate his election, was also passed. Parliamentary career George often spoke about the mining industry in Parliament. In 1957 he opposed the decontrol of rents which had been brought in by the Conservative government. However, this did not harm his career and in October 1959 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Power with responsibility for the coal industry, a job he held until June 1962. In 1963 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and appointed Chairman of the Unionist Party in Scotland. He stood down from Parliament at the 1964 general election, and retired from his party posts in 1965, returning to business as Chairman of Scottish Rexco Ltd and Preswick Precision Products Ltd.

Plot In ancient Carthage, the Lady Cressida tells a story from her youth, when she travelled in the TARDIS: a story of a visit to the frozen London of February 1814, where she, the First Doctor and Steven encountered Jane Austen and the egg of the phoenix. Synopsis In the catacombs below the temple of Astarte in Carthage, Cressida (formerly known as Vicki) tells a story to a listener who hungers for warmth. Vicki recalls a journey in which the TARDIS landed on the frozen River Thames, during the frost fair of 1814. The frost fair contains many entertainments and wonders, but none as astonishing and chilling as the egg of the phoenix, brought from Tunis. Both Vicki and Georgiana (wife of Sir Joseph Mallard, Deputy Warden of the Royal Mint) are captivated by the cold fire associated with the phoenix's egg, which is stolen during an altercation in the fair. The travellers meet the novelist Jane Austen, and accompany her to a dinner party at Sir Joseph's home. However, the dinner party is interrupted by the growing cold and the dramatic disappearance of Georgiana. Georgiana has become enthralled by the phoenix, which is absorbing all the heat in the city ‚Äì including the heat of human bodies. While Steven and the Doctor pursue a red herring, Vicki and Miss Austen discover the location of the egg ‚Äì St. Cuthbert's Church, where the entire congregation is frozen. The phoenix's mind-controlled agents ‚Äì including Georgiana ‚Äì take it from the church to the Royal Mint, where it hopes to hatch in the smelting furnaces. The Doctor offers to take the phoenix to an uninhabited planet close to a white-hot sun, but it refuses, not wishing to be alone. The Doctor, Vicki, Steven and Miss Austen quench the furnace, killing the phoenix ‚Äì except for one cinder, which flies into Vicki's eye. There it remained for years. Vicki parted company with the Doctor and Steven, and married the Trojan prince Troilus, joining Aeneas on his travels and eventually settling in Carthage. There, one day, missing her former life and feeling alone, Vicki cried and found the cinder, still living and able to communicate. She kept the cinder burning in an old oil lamp, and it is the cinder to whom she is relating her story. Vicki has kept it alive because it is the only being besides her which remembers the Doctor, and other times. Someday, centuries later, it will become the egg, and after Carthage has become Tunis the egg will be taken to London: and the cycle will continue.

Admissions The school is a fully selective non-fee paying grammar school with admission via an entrance exam. Its previous status as a foundation school allowed for a degree of independence from the local education authority, until in 2011, under the government's education reforms, it attained Academy status. History The school was founded as Altrincham County High School for Boys (ACHS) in 1912 as a result of the Balfour Education Act, to provide secondary education (partly fee- paying) for an area which stretched from Sale to Knutsford. It opened with 57 pupils and 3 staff (Headmaster, Deputy and one secretary), housed in the red brick building which still forms the central block of the school today. The south wing and the assembly hall were added in 1938 and the science block, gymnasium and workshops in 1964. In 1974, the school passed from the control of Cheshire County Council to the newly formed Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council. It remained under Trafford's control until 1996 when it became a grant-maintained school. In 1999, it evolved into a foundation school, when grant-maintained school status was abolished. In September 2003, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) awarded the school specialist school status as a Language College. Recent additions include new blocks for art and design, new ICT suites, the new Stamford Hall canteen, a food technology room, and The Grammar gym. In October 2013, a new physics centre was opened by the physicist Brian Cox, housing six laboratories, a staff room and a large preparation room. As of July 2020 the school is currently constructing a large extension set to contain several more classrooms, a new library and toilets. It is to be completed in September 2020 and will house 60 more pupils each year.

Construction, opening and ownership The station was built by the Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway and opened on 13 April 1846. The Manchester & Leeds Railway took over the running on 9 July 1847, on which day the latter company changed its name to the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway (LYR). The LYR operated the station for the next 75 years before it was absorbed into the London & North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and the joint company became a major constituent of the London Midland & Scottish Railway in 1923.  Location and facilities  The station was situated immediately west of where the line crossed Berry Brow in Clayton Bridge near Clayton Vale in Clayton, Manchester. The main station buildings were situated on the Manchester-bound platform, south of the two- track line. A timber-built passenger waiting room was provided on the northerly eastbound platform. The signal box, situated on the northern side of the line, just east of Berry Brow, was also used to manually operate the level crossing gates. It was fitted with a larger 22 lever LYR frame in 1893. Remotely operated automatic lifting barriers, monitored by CCTV, were installed at the road crossing in 1973 and this resulted in closure of the signal box on 16 December 1973. 1911 map showing the location of Clayton Bridge station between Park and Droylsden stations.  Train services  During summer 1922, the station was served on weekdays by 21 trains from to Manchester (Victoria) station (a few originating at ), and one from Stockport (Edgeley) to Manchester (Exchange) Station. By 1956, the station was served by 17 stopping trains to Manchester on weekdays, with the third class ordinary single fare then being 8d (3p).  Closure  Clayton Bridge station became a victim of the Beeching Axe, closing on 7 October 1968. Nothing now remains of the station buildings, platform or signal box. The level crossing barriers are now remotely operated.

A relational database requires the implementation of a base relation (or base table) to resolve many-to-many relationships. A base relation representing this kind of entity is called, informally, an associative table. Chen notation) As mentioned above, associative entities are implemented in a database structure using associative tables, which are tables that can contain references to columns from the same or different database tables within the same database. Concept of a mapping table An associative (or junction) table maps two or more tables together by referencing the primary keys of each data table. In effect, it contains a number of foreign keys, each in a many-to-one relationship from the junction table to the individual data tables. The PK of the associative table is typically composed of the FK columns themselves. Associative tables are colloquially known under many names, including association table, bridge table, cross-reference table, crosswalk, intermediary table, intersection table, join table, junction table, link table, linking table, many-to-many resolver, map table, mapping table, pairing table, pivot table (as used incorrectly in Laravel - not to be confused with the correct use of pivot table in spreadsheets), or transition table. Using associative tables An example of the practical use of an associative table would be to assign permissions to users. There can be multiple users, and each user can be assigned zero or more permissions. Individual permissions may be granted to one or more users. CREATE TABLE Users ( UserLogin varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY, UserPassword varchar(50) NOT NULL, UserName varchar(50) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Permissions ( PermissionKey varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY, PermissionDescription varchar(500) NOT NULL ); \\\\ This is the junction table.

It comprises a posh residential area with various educational institutes, parks and markets. The famous Satyana Road passes through Batala Colony which is the second biggest jewellery market of the city.  Location  Batala Colony is located between People's Colony no. 1 & People's Colony no. 2 and the Main Bluebeard road connecting both of them is passing dividing Batala Colony into 2 parts. Thus its location got a very important role in southern Faisalabad. # Peoples Colony No 1 is located in the North-East # Sohail abad and Sharif pura are located in the North-West # Gulbhar Colony and Garden Colony are located in the South-East # Peoples Colony No 2 is located in the South-West History Before settlement the area was originally used as orange plantations. Batala Colony was established in the early 1950s by the Gurdaspur Mohajereen Society. It was originally gated and the standard plot sizes were 8 kanal along Satyana Road, 4 kanal, 2 kanal and 1 kanal along the main road and 15 and 7.7 marla on the inner residential roads. The plots were allotted originally and the buyers had the option of paying in quarterly installments as well. The green belt which runs in the middle of the main road was walled and gated originally with swings and slides. It was tree lined and was at the same level as the main road however in 1998 the road was rebuilt at a higher level. Originally the area was intended for residential purposes. Although the colony was built at around the same time as Gulberg and Jinnah Colony, the rate of development was slow as the area was further away from already established pre-partition areas. By the 1970s majority of the plots had been constructed upon. There was a dispute with vegetable and meat vendors at the same who had illegally occupied the green belt from Satyana Road to Hameed Chowk. The vendors were subsequently removed. By the late 1990s the area remained mainly residential with a few schools and colleges along the main road. The price along the main road was about 1.5 lakhs per marla at that time. Mass commercialization took place in the mid 2000s. This was influenced by a number of factors including the increased demand for land for traders who had moved to the area after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. The price of the land increased exponentially during this period and plazas, CNG stations and more educational institutes were built as a result. To provide parking for these, the green belt in the center of the main road was also developed although the green belt after Hameed Chowk is still to be developed.

He batted left- handed and threw right-handed. He was considered a good-fielding second baseman but a weak hitter, finishing with a career batting average of .250 and 16 home runs. Doyle enjoyed his best season in 1975, when after being traded from the Angels to the Red Sox in June, he batted .310 in 89 games for the Red Sox, including a league-best 22 game hit streak. He was the starting second baseman for the Red Sox in the 1975 American League Championship Series and World Series. Doyle has the distinction of having the only hit in three one- hitters in his career, getting the only hit, a lead-off single in the first inning, against Nolan Ryan of the New York Mets on April 18, 1970, and hitting a two-run home run in a game versus the Cincinnati Reds pitched by Gary Nolan on May 24, 1971. Then, on July 18, 1972, against the San Diego Padres, Doyle broke up Steve Arlin's bid for a no-hitter by singling with two out in the ninth inning.Arlin misses no-hitter by a strike as ball bounces over Roberts' head Padres manager Don Zimmer pulled in his third baseman to guard against the possible bunt. Doyle then placed a ball over the third baseman's head and Arlin's date with destiny was over. No pitcher has ever tossed a no-hitter in a Padre uniform; to date, this is the closest any has come to pitching one. Doyle's major league career is perhaps best known for his role in the famous Game Six of the 1975 World Series versus the Cincinnati Reds, which featured Carlton Fisk's dramatic twelfth-inning home run that has become one of baseball's most iconic highlights. Doyle was involved in a ninth-inning play that baseball fans still discuss. The score was tied 6-6 and the bases were loaded with no outs and Doyle on third base when Fred Lynn lifted a fly ball to short left field. After Reds left fielder George Foster made the catch, Doyle tagged up and attempted to score the winning run. He was thrown out at home plate, which inadvertently helped set the stage for Fisk's subsequent game-winning home run. After the game, Red Sox third-base coach Don Zimmer told the press, \\"I was yelling 'no, no, no' and with the crowd noise, he (Doyle) thought I was saying 'go, go, go.'\\" Society for American Baseball Research: Denny Doyle In a World Series that included five future Hall of Fame players, Doyle was the only player on either team to hit safely in all seven games.

The station was purchased in July 2011 from Jeanne Mosley, Sandra Howell and general manager Ken Roberts. KBEC has the distinction of being the longest family-owned station in Texas. It has been family-owned since 1955 when it was founded by Faye and Richard Tuck. The Tuck family came to Waxahachie in 1952 to pursue dream of purchasing a radio station. History KBEC was the third‚Äîand successful‚Äîattempt to build a station on 1390 in Ellis County. The first was KELL, owned by the Ellis County Broadcasting Company, which received a construction permit in 1949; in early 1950, the Federal Communications Commission denied an extension of its permit because the owners had indicated they wanted to build the station and sell it immediately. In 1952, Cen-Tex Broadcasting received a construction permit for KWHA, which never came to air. Ellis County Broadcasting Service, owned by W. Richard Tuck, James B. Branch and Roy M. Fish, received the construction permit for KBEC in September 1954 and signed the station on in 1955 (with Tuck buying out the remaining partners in 1956). The jazz standard format was in place from 1955 to 1978; the station then switched to a short-lived Spanish format, reverting to big band music with standards added back in. In 1988, KBEC made its change to classic country and has since then maintained the format to this day. In 2011, the format began emphasizing more Texas artists and adopted the programming theme of \\"Made in Texas, Played in Texas and Born in Texas\\". In May 2011 the station was sold to Troubadour Communications. This was a private stock transfer of assets including a building, 13.98 acres of land housing the station towers and transmitter, as well as personal property and building contents.

The Companion Chronicles \\"talking books\\" are each narrated by one of the Doctor's companions and feature a second, guest-star voice along with music and sound effects. Plot Long ago, Zoe Heriot shared an adventure with a man called the Doctor ‚Äî but she remembers him leaving afterwards. Why, then, does she have detailed dreams of travelling with him in the TARDIS? Why does she fear the Daleks, if she never met them? Can someone with an eidetic memory truly forget the past? Synopsis Zoe Heriot, who remembers only her first adventure with the Doctor and Jamie, is having detailed nightmares. She relates one of them to a psychiatric counsellor. Her dream begins with the Doctor telepathically showing her his most recent encounter with the Daleks; the experience frightens Zoe, but the Doctor assures her that the Daleks have met their \\"final end\\". The TARDIS arrives on the asteroid Livonia, where plans are underway for peace talks between the human-descended Zantha Empire and Tibari Republic (whose citizens are of piscine descent). A renegade Tibari scientist, Atrekar, kidnaps the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie; he has identified the Doctor and Zoe's intelligence, and decides to use them in his mind projector machine. The projector, which uses Dalek technology, creates a duplicate of Zoe, controlled by her intelligence via quantum entanglement, but subject to Atrekar's telepathic command. Atrekar has allied himself with the Daleks, and plans to use Zoe to assassinate the Tibari President and thwart the peace talks. The Daleks, for their part, are planning to use Atrekar's mind projector to conquer the galaxy. Zoe's quantum duplicate is transported to the Tibari President's spaceship, where she is taken to meet the President, Ram Vendl. Atrekar delays the assassination, hoping for maximum impact. Vendl befriends Zoe, but keeps her in detention for security. Meanwhile, in Atrekar's facility, the Daleks take over. They decide to test Atrekar's mind projector, using the Doctor as a test subject. A duplicate of the Doctor is transported to the Tibari ship, but Atrekar cannot control him. When Atrekar attempts to activate Zoe as an assassin, the Doctor prevents her from killing Vendl. Frustrated, the Daleks use the mind projector on themselves, and Dalek duplicates arrive on the ship. However, Atrekar has realized that the Daleks do not plan to keep their agreement with him, and uses his telepathy to take over one of the Daleks. He turns the Daleks' own worst fears against them, and they are destroyed. Jamie activates a switch which restores the Doctor and Zoe to their own bodies. The Doctor destroys the mind projector, and the peace talks proceed as scheduled. After recounting the story to her counsellor, Zoe adds a footnote to her dream diary: she thought she heard the Doctor's voice telling her that the Daleks really had met their final end. \\"But then, he would say that, wouldn't he?\\", she muses.

The term first appeared in his November 2005 National Geographic magazine cover story, \\"The Secrets of a Long Life\\". Five \\"Blue Zones\\" have been posited: Okinawa (Japan); Sardinia (Italy); Nicoya (Costa Rica); Icaria (Greece); and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California, based on evidence showing why these populations live healthier and longer lives than others. The concept grew out of demographic work done by Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain outlined in the Journal of Experimental Gerontology, who identified Sardinia's Nuoro province as the region with the highest concentration of male centenarians. As the two men zeroed in on the cluster of villages with the highest longevity, they drew concentric blue circles on the map and began referring to the area inside the circle as the \\"Blue Zone\\". Together with demographers Pes and Poulain, Buettner broadened the term, applying it to validated longevity areas of Okinawa, Japan and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California. Buettner and Poulain, under the aegis of National Geographic, then identified and validated longevity hotspots in Nicoya, Costa Rica and Icaria, Greece. Buettner mentions in his book that people are doing the right things for long enough, and avoiding the wrong things,\\" there are four main things that people in those zones do in order to live healthier and longer lives, and they consist of moving regularly, which does not comprise of exercise alone, but doing daily energy burst habits throughout the day. The second aspect is living with purpose, having a reason to get up every day, and living with perspective. The third aspect of blue zone populations is the social support they receive from friends and family allowing them to move through life outcomes more smoothly. Fourth but not least is the concept that most still do not understand, which is making the \\"healthy choice the easy choice\\", and not just an option. Living by these four concepts brings longevity and mental and physical problems to one's life and society.  Blue Zones  Sardinian man The five regions that are identified in the book The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest are: *Sardinia, Italy (particularly Ogliastra, Barbagia of Ollolai, and Barbagia of Seulo): One team of demographers found a hot spot of longevity in mountain villages where a substantial proportion of men reach 100. In particular, a village called Seulo, located in the Barbagia of Seulo, holds the record of 20 centenarians from 1996 to 2016, that confirms it is \\"the place where people live the longest in the world\\". *The islands of Okinawa, Japan: Another team examined a group that is among the longest-lived on Earth. *Loma Linda, California: Researchers studied a group of Seventh-day Adventists who rank among North America's longest-lived people. See CNN excerpt on YouTube. *Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: The peninsula was the subject of research on a Quest Network expedition which began on January 29, 2007. *Icaria, Greece: An April 2009 study on the island of Icaria uncovered the location with the highest percentage of 90-year-olds on the planet, where nearly 1 out of 3 people make it to their 90s. Furthermore, Icarians \\"have about 20 percent lower rates of cancer, 50 percent lower rates of heart disease and almost no dementia.\\"The Island Where People Live Longer , NPR: Weekend Edition Saturday, May 2, 2009. Residents of these places produce a high rate of centenarians, suffer a fraction of the diseases that commonly kill people in other parts of the developed world, and enjoy more years of good health.Buettner, Dan: \\"The Secrets of Long Life.\\", page 9.

Though not a lifestyle choice, they live as isolated populations with related gene pool. *Family ‚Äì put ahead of other concerns *Less smoking *Semi- vegetarianism ‚Äì the majority of food consumed is derived from plants *Constant moderate physical activity ‚Äì an inseparable part of life *Social engagement ‚Äì people of all ages are socially active and integrated into their communities *Legumes ‚Äì commonly consumed In his book, Buettner provides a list of nine lessons, covering the lifestyle of people who reside in blue zones: # Moderate, regular physical activity. # Life purpose. # Stress reduction. # Moderate caloric intake. # Plant-based diet. # Moderate alcohol intake, especially wine. # Engagement in spirituality or religion. # Engagement in family life. # Engagement in social life.  Research  Based on research results in the fields of biogerontology, epigenetics and naturopathy, the term Blue Zones is also used for areas whose native flora grows under special conditions and can effectively counteract the aging process. Such mostly high- altitude areas are located in Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet or China. The Swiss research group Bluezones in cooperation with the Forschungsgruppe Haslberger of the University of Vienna focuses on secondary plant substances from such areas, which could have a use in the area of anti-aging, neurodegenerative diseases and geriatric diseases. In 1998, the Swiss group dealt with the eating habits of the population of Yuzurihara, where the inhabitants grew very old with the best quality of life. Longevity regions are also being studied in China. Another research group of the University of California in collaboration with the University of Rome La Sapienza is investigating temporal bluezones in Italy outside Sardinia. Criticism A 2019 preprint study found that the introduction of birth certificates reduces the number of claimed super- centenarians by up to 85%, suggesting that the apparent number of supercentenarians in Blue Zones may owe more to poor record-keeping, and fraud, than to longevity. A study of claimed longevity in Okinawa was unable to verify whether or not people there were as old as they claimed because many records did not survive WWII. More recent data has shown that life expectancy in Okinawa is no longer exceptional when compared to the rest of Japan: \\"male longevity is now ranked 26th among the 47 prefectures of Japan.

Biography Born in Frankfurt am Main in 1712, he was one of the outstanding students of the Shev Yaakov, Rabbi Jacob Cohen in Frankfurt. He served as Dayan of Frankfurt during the entire time that the Pnei Yehoshua, Rabbi Yehoshua Falk was Rabbi of Frankfurt (1741-1756). In 1759 he succeeded his father-in-law Rabbi Nathan Otiz as Rabbi of Bamberg. There during the Third Silesian War; part of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), where Austria under the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria tried for the second time in vain to get back Silesia from Prussia; the Prussians under King Frederick the Great ravaged and plundered the region. In 1763 during the turmoil, Rabbi Tebele lost many of his writings including his writings on the tractate Niddah, which he greatly bemoaned. In 1767 he was appointed as Rabbi of Mainz where he led a Yeshiva. He died there in 1782 (Shmini Atzeres 5543 on the Hebrew calendar). Pupils Among his early pupils is Rabbi Levi Pante and Rabbi Eliezer Lazi, who studied with him in Bamberg, and among his later pupils was the Chasam Sofer. He also left two sons; Rabbi Mechel Scheuer, Rabbi of Worms and Rabbi Abraham Naftali Hertz Scheuer, who later served as Rabbi of Mainz.

It also includes a stone honoring George Washington as the town's founder. George Washington (August 15, 1817 - August 26, 1905) was the founder of the town of Centralia, Washington.Kit Oldham, George and Mary Jane Washington founded the town of Centerville (now Centralia) on January 8, 1875, HistoryLink, February 23, 2003. Accessed online 12 March 2008. He is remembered as a leading African American pioneer of the Pacific Northwest.Biographical Sketches of Black Pioneers and Settlers of the Pacific Northwest, End of the Oregon Trail, Oregon Trail History Library . Accessed online 12 March 2008. Born in within 10 miles of Winchester, Frederick County, Virginia, the son of a former slave and a woman of English descent, Washington was raised by a white couple named Anna and James Cochran. When he was four, the Cochrans moved west to Delaware County, Ohio. This region contained several stops on the underground railroad. Then they left to Missouri. Washington became a skilled rifleman and taught himself to read. He was given full rights as a citizen, except for the right to vote, after the Cochrans petitioned the state of Missouri. Fearing he might lose his freedom after the passage of the Compromise of 1850, Washington moved the Cochrans and himself over the Oregon Trail. Arriving in the Oregon Territory, they found he could not establish a claim for any land due to the exclusion laws in passed by the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1849. Upon arrival because of these exclusion laws the Washington and his family were forced to settle nearby in Milwaukie. Washington started working as a logger, cutting timber for $90 a month plus board. About 3 months after arrival in Milwaukie, Washington became very ill. The ailment was unknown but he was in serious condition. The closest hospital at this time in pioneer country was the Columbia Barracks military fort (later Fort Vancouver) on the north side of the Columbia River. When the Cochrans took him there for treatment, they were told it was just for soldiers. Although, when the doctor came and saw Washington's condition he had a change of heart. He performed surgery on Washington ultimately saving his life, but in the process poisoned him with calomel. The poison caused him to loose all of his hair permanently. Later in pictures we will see him wear wigs. He stayed in recovery in the Columbia Barracks for 3-4 months. When he became well they moved back to the Milwaukie Area where eventually Washington settled his parents into a cabin on close in Cowlitz Landing. Washington then left looking to settle his own land in the Olympia, Steilacoom and Seattle region of the territory. Although the law stood between Washington making a claim. He had the support of other settlers in the area who were against his exclusion. More than 100 pioneers petitioned on his behalf to let him stay on the land of the Oregon Territory. Although the petition was heard in court, the amendment to let Blacks stay in the Oregon territory failed. Luckily, the petition to allow Washington to stay was barely passed with a 17-6 vote. This decision would prove to be only a gesture because on March 2nd, 1853 the Washington Territory which George Washington eventually would make his claim on, was made official and had no laws of exclusion. He then left and settled near the confluence of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck rivers, and the Cochrans claimed the land for the family in 1852. When Washington Territory was split from the Oregon Territory in 1853, the new territory's statutes did not preclude African Americans from owning land, and the Cochrans sold their land to him for $6000. George cared for his adoptive parents the rest of their lives, and later married newly divorced Mary Jane Cain Cooness, helping raise her son, Stacey. Anticipating the arrival of the Northern Pacific railroad in 1872, Washington saw visions of a town on the southeast corner of his land. Saying that it is the center point between Kalama and Tacoma and so forth named it the city of Centerville. He named the streets after biblical references and setting aside land for a park (now the site of the Carnegie Library) and churches of many denominations. The town was incorporated as Centralia, Washington, in 1886 after it was discovered that another town in the territory already bore the name Centerville. This made Washington the only black person to found a town in the Pacific Northwest. Washington was the proponent of steady growth using fair business practices. Some saying that he talked so square and straight forward that buyers would become suspicious. Despite facing some racial prejudice at the hands of newcomers (many of whom migrated from the segregated post-Civil War south), George Washington supported many of the townspeople through the Panic of 1893, when the Northern Pacific went bankrupt and the town nearly collapsed. The town thrived in the boom started by the Alaska Gold Rush in 1898, and by the time he died in 1905 at the age of 88, Centralia had grown to a town of around 5,000 residents, who turned out en masse to honor him at his funeral. He is buried in the town's Washington Lawn Cemetery. The town has a number of memorials to its founder, including a large stone monument telling his life story in the city's central plaza (a park donated by George and Mary Jane Washington, and known as George Washington Park). During a year-long celebration of his 200th birthday, volunteers built a bronze statue of George and Mary Jane Washington that was placed in George Washington Park in August 2018.

The origins of multitouch began at CERN, MIT, University of Toronto, Carnegie Mellon University and Bell Labs in the 1970s. CERN started using multi-touch screens as early as 1976 for the controls of the Super Proton Synchrotron. Apple popularized the term \\"multi-touch\\" in 2007. Plural- point awareness may be used to implement additional functionality, such as pinch to zoom or to activate certain subroutines attached to predefined gestures. Several uses of the term multi-touch resulted from the quick developments in this field, and many companies using the term to market older technology which is called gesture-enhanced single-touch or several other terms by other companies and researchers. Several other similar or related terms attempt to differentiate between whether a device can exactly determine or only approximate the location of different points of contact to further differentiate between the various technological capabilities, but they are often used as synonyms in marketing. Multi-touch is commonly implemented using capacitive sensing technology in mobile devices and smart devices. A capacitive touchscreen typically consists of a capacitive touch sensor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) controller and digital signal processor (DSP) fabricated from CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology. Capacitive multi-touch displays were popularized by Apple's iPhone in 2007. A more recent alternative approach is optical touch technology, based on image sensor technology. Definition In computing, multi-touch is technology which enables a trackpad or touchscreen to recognize more than one or more than two points of contact with the surface. Apple popularized the term \\"multi-touch\\" in 2007 with which it implemented additional functionality, such as pinch to zoom or to activate certain subroutines attached to predefined gestures. The two different uses of the term resulted from the quick developments in this field, and many companies using the term to market older technology which is called gesture-enhanced single-touch or several other terms by other companies and researchers. Several other similar or related terms attempt to differentiate between whether a device can exactly determine or only approximate the location of different points of contact to further differentiate between the various technological capabilities, but they are often used as synonyms in marketing. History  =1960‚Äì2000= The use of touchscreen technology predates both multi-touch technology and the personal computer. Early synthesizer and electronic instrument builders like Hugh Le Caine and Robert Moog experimented with using touch-sensitive capacitance sensors to control the sounds made by their instruments.Buxton, Bill. \\"Multitouch Overview\\" IBM began building the first touch screens in the late 1960s. In 1972, Control Data released the PLATO IV computer, an infrared terminal used for educational purposes, which employed single-touch points in a 16√ó16 array user interface. These early touchscreens only registered one point of touch at a time. On-screen keyboards (a well-known feature today) were thus awkward to use, because key-rollover and holding down a shift key while typing another were not possible. Exceptions to these were a \\"cross- wire\\" multi-touch reconfigurable touchscreen keyboard/display developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the early 1970s and the 16 button capacitive multi-touch screen developed at CERN in 1972 for the controls of the Super Proton Synchrotron that were under construction. The prototypes of the x-y mutual capacitance multi-touch screens (left) developed at CERN During the year 1976, a new x-y capacative screen, based on the capacitance touch screens developed in 1972 by Danish electronics engineer Bent Stumpe, was developed at CERN. This technology, allowing an exact location of the different touch points, was used to develop a new type of human machine interface (HMI) for the control room of the Super Proton Synchrotron particle accelerator. In a handwritten note dated 11 March 1972, Stumpe presented his proposed solution ‚Äì a capacitive touch screen with a fixed number of programmable buttons presented on a display. The screen was to consist of a set of capacitors etched into a film of copper on a sheet of glass, each capacitor being constructed so that a nearby flat conductor, such as the surface of a finger, would increase the capacitance by a significant amount. The capacitors were to consist of fine lines etched in copper on a sheet of glass ‚Äì fine enough (80 Œºm) and sufficiently far apart (80 Œºm) to be invisible. In the final device, a simple lacquer coating prevented the fingers from actually touching the capacitors. In the same year, MIT described a keyboard with variable graphics capable of multi-touch detection. In the early 1980s, The University of Toronto's Input Research Group were among the earliest to explore the software side of multi-touch input systems.Mehta, Nimish (1982), A Flexible Machine Interface, M.A.Sc. Thesis, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Toronto supervised by Professor K.C. Smith. A 1982 system at the University of Toronto used a frosted-glass panel with a camera placed behind the glass. When a finger or several fingers pressed on the glass, the camera would detect the action as one or more black spots on an otherwise white background, allowing it to be registered as an input. Since the size of a dot was dependent on pressure (how hard the person was pressing on the glass), the system was somewhat pressure-sensitive as well. Of note, this system was input only and not able to display graphics. In 1983, Bell Labs at Murray Hill published a comprehensive discussion of touch- screen based interfaces, though it makes no mention of multiple fingers. In the same year, the video-based Video Place/Video Desk system of Myron Krueger was influential in development of multi-touch gestures such as pinch-to-zoom, though this system had no touch interaction itself.Krueger, Myron, W., Gionfriddo, Thomas., &Hinrichsen;, Katrin (1985). VIDEOPLACE - An Artificial Reality, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI‚Äô85), 35‚Äì40. By 1984, both Bell Labs and Carnegie Mellon University had working multi-touch-screen prototypes ‚Äì both input and graphics ‚Äì that could respond interactively in response to multiple finger inputs.Dannenberg, R.B., McAvinney, P. and Thomas, M.T. Carnegie-Mellon University Studio Report. In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference (Paris, France, October 19‚Äì23, 1984). ICMI. pp. 281-286.McAvinney, P. The Sensor Frame - A Gesture-Based Device for the Manipulation of Graphic Objects. Carnegie Mellon University, 1986. The Bell Labs system was based on capacitive coupling of fingers, whereas the CMU system was optical. In 1985, the canonical multitouch pinch-to-zoom gesture was demonstrated, with coordinated graphics, on CMU's system. In October 1985, Steve Jobs signed a non-disclosure agreement to tour CMU's Sensor Frame multi-touch lab. In 1990, Sears et al. published a review of academic research on single and multi-touch touchscreen human‚Äìcomputer interaction of the time, describing single touch gestures such as rotating knobs, swiping the screen to activate a switch (or a U-shaped gesture for a toggle switch), and touchscreen keyboards (including a study that showed that users could type at 25 words per minute for a touchscreen keyboard compared with 58 words per minute for a standard keyboard, with multi-touch hypothesized to improve data entry rate); multi- touch gestures such as selecting a range of a line, connecting objects, and a \\"tap-click\\" gesture to select while maintaining location with another finger are also described.Sears, A., Plaisant, C., Shneiderman, B. (June 1990) A new era for high-precision touchscreens. Advances in Human-Computer Interaction, vol. 3, Hartson, R. & Hix, D. Eds., Ablex (1992) 1-33 HCIL-90-01, CS-TR-2487, CAR-TR-506. In 1991, Pierre Wellner advanced the topic publishing about his multi-touch \\"Digital Desk\\", which supported multi-finger and pinching motions.Wellner, Pierre. 1991. The Digital Desk. Pierre Wellner's papers via DBLP Various companies expanded upon these inventions in the beginning of the twenty-first century. =2000 ‚Äì present day= Between 1999 and 2005, the company Fingerworks developed various multi-touch technologies, including Touchstream keyboards and the iGesture Pad. in the early 2000s Alan Hedge, professor of human factors and ergonomics at Cornell University published several studies about this technology.Westerman, W., Elias J.G. and A.Hedge (2001) Multi-touch: a new tactile 2-d gesture interface for human-computer interaction Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 45th Annual Meeting, Vol. 1, 632-636.Shanis, J. and Hedge, A.

Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 49th Annual Meeting, Orlando, Sept. 26-30, HFES, Santa Monica, 646-650. In 2005, Apple acquired Fingerworks and its multi-touch technology. In 2004, french start-up JazzMutant developed the Lemur Input Device, a music controller that became in 2005 the first commercial product to feature a proprietary transparent multi-touch screen, allowing direct, ten-finger manipulation on the display. In January 2007, multi-touch technology became mainstream with the iPhone, and in its iPhone announcement Apple even stated it \\"invented multi touch\\", however both the function and the term predate the announcement or patent requests, except for the area of capacitive mobile screens, which did not exist before Fingerworks/Apple's technology (Fingerworks filed patents in 2001‚Äì2005, subsequent multi-touch refinements were patented by Apple). However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark office declared that the \\"pinch-to-zoom\\" functionality was predicted by U.S. Patent # 7,844,915 relating to gestures on touch screens, filed by Bran Ferren and Daniel Hillis in 2005, as was inertial scrolling, thus invalidated a key claims of Apple's patent. In 2001, Microsoft's table-top touch platform, Microsoft PixelSense (formerly Surface) started development, which interacts with both the user's touch and their electronic devices and became commercial on May 29, 2007. Similarly, in 2001, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) began development of a multi- touch, multi-user system called DiamondTouch. In 2008, the Diamondtouch became a commercial product and is also based on capacitance, but able to differentiate between multiple simultaneous users or rather, the chairs in which each user is seated or the floorpad on which the user is standing. In 2007, NORTD labs Open Source system offered its CUBIT (multi-touch). Small- scale touch devices rapidly became commonplace in 2008. The number of touch screen telephones was expected to increase from 200,000 shipped in 2006 to 21 million in 2012.Wong, May. 2008. Touch-screen phones poised for growth https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2007-06-21-1895245927_x.htm. Retrieved April 2008. In May 2015, Apple was granted a patent for a \\"fusion keyboard\\", which turns individual physical keys into multi-touch buttons. Brands and manufacturers A virtual keyboard before iOS 7 on an iPad Apple has retailed and distributed numerous products using multi-touch technology, most prominently including its iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet. Additionally, Apple also holds several patents related to the implementation of multi-touch in user interfaces, however the legitimacy of some patents has been disputed. Apple additionally attempted to register \\"Multi-touch\\" as a trademark in the United Stateshowever its request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office because it considered the term generic. Multi-touch sensing and processing occurs via an ASIC sensor that is attached to the touch surface. Usually, separate companies make the ASIC and screen that combine into a touch screen; conversely, a trackpad's surface and ASIC are usually manufactured by the same company. There have been large companies in recent years that have expanded into the growing multi-touch industry, with systems designed for everything from the casual user to multinational organizations. It is now common for laptop manufacturers to include multi-touch trackpads on their laptops, and tablet computers respond to touch input rather than traditional stylus input and it is supported by many recent operating systems. A few companies are focusing on large-scale surface computing rather than personal electronics, either large multi-touch tables or wall surfaces. These systems are generally used by government organizations, museums, and companies as a means of information or exhibit display. Large scale multi-touch surfaces are manufactured by Finnish company MultiTaction on their 55\\" MT Cells (55\\" screens) who also have office locations in London, California and Singapore. MultiTaction also build unique collaboration software especially designed for multi-touch screens such as MT Canvus and MT Showcase. Implementations Multi-touch has been implemented in several different ways, depending on the size and type of interface. The most popular form are mobile devices, tablets, touchtables and walls. Both touchtables and touch walls project an image through acrylic or glass, and then back-light the image with LEDs. Touch surfaces can also be made pressure-sensitive by the addition of a pressure- sensitive coating that flexes differently depending on how firmly it is pressed, altering the reflection.Scientific American. 2008. \\"How It Works: Multitouch Surfaces Explained\\". Retrieved January 9, 2010. Handheld technologies use a panel that carries an electrical charge. When a finger touches the screen, the touch disrupts the panel's electrical field. The disruption is registered as a computer event (gesture) and may be sent to the software, which may then initiate a response to the gesture event.Brandon, John. 2009. \\"How the iPhone Works In the past few years, several companies have released products that use multi-touch.

Popular culture =Before 2007= Years before it was a viable consumer product, popular culture portrayed potential uses of multi-touch technology in the future, including in several installments of the Star Trek franchise. In the 1982 Disney sci-fi film Tron a device similar to the Microsoft Surface was shown. It took up an executive's entire desk and was used to communicate with the Master Control computer. In the 2002 film Minority Report, Tom Cruise uses a set of gloves that resemble a multi-touch interface to browse through information.Minority Report Touch Interface for Real. Gizmodo.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-09. In the 2005 film The Island, another form of a multi-touch computer was seen where the professor, played by Sean Bean, has a multi-touch desktop to organize files, based on an early version of Microsoft Surface (not be confused with the tablet computers which now bear that name). In 2007, the television series CSI: Miami introduced both surface and wall multi-touch displays in its sixth season. =After 2007= Multi-touch technology can be seen in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace, where MI6 uses a touch interface to browse information about the criminal Dominic Greene.2009\\\\. \\" Quantum of Solace Multitouch UI\\" In the 2008 film The Day the Earth Stood Still, Microsoft's Surface was used . The television series NCIS: Los Angeles, which premiered 2009, makes use of multi-touch surfaces and wall panels as an initiative to go digital. In a 2008, an episode of the television series The Simpsons, Lisa Simpson travels to the underwater headquarters of Mapple to visit Steve Mobbs, who is shown to be performing multiple multi-touch hand gestures on a large touch wall. In the 2009, the film District 9 the interface used to control the alien ship features similar technology. 10/GUI 10/GUI is a proposed new user interface paradigm. Created in 2009 by R. Clayton Miller, it combines multi- touch input with a new windowing manager. It splits the touch surface away from the screen, so that user fatigue is reduced and the users' hands don't obstruct the display. Instead of placing windows all over the screen, the windowing manager, Con10uum, uses a linear paradigm, with multi-touch used to navigate between and arrange the windows. An area at the right side of the touch screen brings up a global context menu, and a similar strip at the left side brings up application-specific menus. An open source community preview of the Con10uum window manager was made available in November, 2009.

William VI (c. 1173 ‚Äì 17 September 1225) was the tenth Marquis of Montferrat from 1203 and titular King of Thessalonica from 1207. Biography =Youth= Boniface I's eldest son, and his only son by his first wife, Helena del Bosco, William stood originally to inherit all his father's possessions. He participated in diverse campaigns with his father, including the Battle of Montiglio, in which the men of Asti were defeated in 1191. Between 1193 and 1199, he appeared in many of his father's public acts. On 12 June 1199, he was put in charge of Acqui Terme with twenty knights to combat the Alessandrini, and, on 27 October, he was present near Saluggia for the signing of a pact with the commune of Vercelli. =War with Asti= Boniface I joined the Fourth Crusade as a Christian leader in 1201. In accordance with promises made to Asti and Alessandria, he officially abdicated the marquisate to William before he left. Immediately, William turned towards Asti, then protected by Milan. The Astigiani had a history of rebellion and were growing in power. In August, with his father beside him, he formed an alliance with Alba and Alessandria, another rebellious commune, against Asti. His allies proved of little worth as he had to make many concessions to them and was still defeated in the field. In April 1206, he opened negotiations with Asti. The peace treaty was embarrassing for Montferrat, but it was accepted by all three allies. William promised to get his father's ratification, but his father was killed fighting against the Bulgarians unaware of any peace back home. =War against the Ghibellines= Traditionally, the Aleramici adhered to the Ghibelline faction, which supported the Hohenstaufen and their Italian schemes. William, however, lent his support to Otto of Brunswick, the Guelph claimant to the imperial title. Though William expected to see the power of an emperor levelled against his foes, the only aid he received from Otto was directed against small local potentates which posed little real threat. The only great success of the alliance was the sack of Cuneo. At the Diet of Lodi, William abandoned Otto finally in favour of Frederick II, the Hohenstaufen claimant. On 15 July 1212, he was in Genoa with the other Ghibelline lords to receive Frederick. William led the young emperor from the city to the road which led to Germany. In 1215, William participated in the Second Lateran Council, there arguing the cause of Frederick against Otto. He travelled many subsequent times into Germany to speak to Frederick and during these absences, his enemies plotted against him. In their attempts to seize his lands, however, they were largely unsuccessful. During his times in Italy, William remained at war with Asti and Alessandria, but without result. =Claims in Greece= Following his father's death in 1207, his conquests in Greece, formed into the Kingdom of Thessalonica, passed into the hands of William's half-brother Demetrius. The succession was opposed by the Lombard nobles of the kingdom, led by the regent Oberto II of Biandrate, who preferred the crown to pass to William. William himself was reluctant to claim the throne, and with the support of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders, the rebellion of the Lombard barons was overcome, and Demetrius was crowned king. During the exhausting years battling rebels and Guelphs, William at last resolved to travel to Greece to defend the conquests of his father. To this end he was urged by the churchmen of his realm and also by the troubadour Elias Cairel. When he finally decided to take the cross, aware of the insignificance of his contribution to the total effort, he decided to head by way of Egypt, at the suggestion of Pope Honorius III. But the arrival of Demetrius, fleeing the onslaught of the Greeks under Theodore Komnenos Doukas and the hostility of the Lombard barons, led by Biandrate, convinced him to go to Greece. Several times he prepared to head out, but each time was detained by the threats of his enemies in Piedmont or by economic restraints which compelled him to mortgage his marquisate to Frederick II. Finally, he cowed some cities into giving him aid in men. Nevertheless, he was present at Capua, Ferentino, and Sora with Frederick II in February 1223. Delayed again and again, he drank a toast at Brindisi to his setting off in 1224, but he fell ill at the last minute. His fleet remained in port until the spring of 1225, when, under urging from Honorius, it finally cast off. The delays had been fatal and William himself died at Almyros on September 17. The rest of his army was hit by a dysentery epidemic and melted away. Marriages and children On 9 August 1202 William married Berta (1182‚Äì1224), daughter of the Marquis Bonifacio di Clavesana, Count of Cortemiglia. They had at least three children: * Boniface II, Marquis of Montferrat (born ca 1203, date of death unknown). * Beatrice (ca 1210‚Äì1274), Lady of Saint-Bonnet in her own right. She married three times:  On 15 November 1219, Guigues VI of Viennois  In 1252, Guy II, Lord of Bauge  Pierre de la Roue * Alix (ca. 1215‚Äì1232), married in May 1229 Henry I of Lusignan, King of Cyprus. *Oddone di Monferrato (died 1251), who became Bishop of Porto, and Cardinal in 1227, may have been a son of William VI; whether he was legitimate or not is uncertain.

It was founded in 1865 by Louis Ganter, and as of 2016 is run by Katharina Ganter- Fraschetti and Detlef Frankenberger. The brewery was founded in a three-story renaissance building which had previously belonged to Erasmus of Rotterdam, and in 1854 had become the Ringwald Brewery. Ten years later, the brewery moved to its current site on the outskirts of the town. The company fared badly throughout the start of the twentieth century, due to its position at the very centre of the crises of the First and Second World Wars. The historical building in the city centre was destroyed during Operation Tigerfish on 27 November, 1944, followed by further bombings of brewery facilities on 2 and 3 December 1944.Uebersch√§r, Gerd R.: Freiburg im Luftkrieg 1939‚Äì1945, Freiburg/Munich 1990 , p. 287 A successful reconstruction in the second half of the century led to the takeover of the L√∂wenbrauerei of Freiburg in 1979, and a partnership with the Inselbrauerei Feierling. The brewery now produces a 4.9% vol. Ganter pilsner, a \\"Freiburger\\" pilsner, a 5.2% special export beer, a light and dark 5.4% wheat beers and an alcohol- free beer. Also produced a strong Bock beer, Wodan. At 7.5% vol., this was first brewed in 1898 as a nourishing brew for long hungry winters. Alcohol- free drinks are now produced by the associated OGA (Oberrheinische Industrie- und Handelsgesellschaft, Ganter'sche Aktiengesellschaft), which was established in 1922 to make liqueur. A particularly successful orange-lemonade drink allowed the expansion into other fruit juices and lemonades. The grounds of the brewery played host to a concert by Diana Ross in 2005 (as part of the firm's 140th anniversary celebrations), and in 2006 the inner courtyard was used by Simply Red and Dieter Thomas Kuhn.

It was re-privatized and listed on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1998, before being acquired by French banking group BNP Paribas in 2006. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro began Argentine operations in 1960, ultimately opening 91 branches, before selling its operation there to HSBC Bank Argentina in 2006. Scandals The bank was involved in a major political scandal (dubbed Iraqgate by the media) when it was revealed in 1989 that the Atlanta, Georgia branch of the bank was making unauthorized loans of more than US$4.5 billion to Iraq. Many of the loans that the branch made were guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation program. The loans were originally intended to finance agricultural exports to Iraq, but were diverted by Iraq to buy weapons. The branch manager, Christopher Drogoul, indicated that the bank's headquarters office was aware of these loans, but senior bank official denied this. Drogoul pleaded guilty to three felony charges and served 33 months in federal prison.

Summary Suryakant Gadodia is married to Savitri and has four daughters - Saraswati, Gauri, Durga, and Lakshmi. He is adamant for a son to continue the family dynasty and inherit the wealth. Savitri‚Äôs body cannot bear another pregnancy as it becomes weak due to the consistent births year on year so Suryakant marries Menaka, who gives birth to Yuvraj. Suryakant abandons and neglects his daughters and first wife whilst spoiling Yuvraj, who grows up insolent and arrogant. Menaka wishes to have sole rights to the household and wealth and wants to get rid of the daughters as soon as possible by getting them married. She arranges Bhavishya Kapadia, an abusive man, to marry Saraswati. Her childhood lover Kshitij saves her when her husband tries to set her alive, and after a long trial, the sisters win the case. Saraswati becomes pregnant after avenging and revealing Bhavishya‚Äôs truth who is imprisoned, and then marries Kshitij. The youngest, lively Lakshmi is to wed Satyakam, who also helps find clues against Bhavishya, but he dies, leaving her in a state of shock. She later meets Karan, who has come to the Gadodias to avenge his mother, who was actually harassed by Menaka's brother Rasik. She marries him, where after she realises his real intentions of revenge, but insists her dad‚Äôs innocence to no avail. Karan completes his revenge, leaving Suryakant in mental shock who disappears by falling down a mountain. The family believes he is dead. Laxmi begins to hate Karan at this point as he did not pay need to her when she begged him not to avenge her father. Realising his mistakes, Karan sets on a conquest to find Suryakant alive. He then re-marries Lakshmi after she forgives him, but soon dies thereafter due to acknowledging an ancient family secret which, when exposed, bring shockwaves to the Gadodia family. Soon this secret is revealed, disclosing the fact that Menaka deceived the family and gave birth to a daughter instead of a son years before. To the family‚Äôs realisation, they seek their long lost daughter only to find she has been sold to a cat-house in Mumbai and is one of the most sought for prostitute at that place. Jhumki soon begins mingling with the family after defaming them, facing her own hurdles in love and marriage due to her past. Her first encounter is unsuccessful, but she soon meets Nikhil. Yuvraj by now is trapped by another prostitute Kajri, who he disguises as a traditional woman Pavitra to fool his family and marries. He is greedy and rebukes his mother. The sisters find his secret out, and Suryakant disowns Yuvraj. After accepting Yuvraj into the family once again, Yuvraj devices a plan with Kajri to take all the family wealth which becomes a reality. The property is all on his name where he throws everyone out of Gadodia ‚Äòniwas‚Äô and peacefully lives there with Kajri and the cat-house owner Rasili bai. The daughters give back the rightful property to their father. Eventually, Suryakant pays the price for Yuvraj‚Äôs mistakes through his demise. Kajri begins to blackmail Yuvraj, at one point, and controls all the family wealth whilst enslaving the family. As the show ends, Gauri is married to Akash Shah, and Durga marries Bhavishya's lookalike Ranbir Dhawaan, and Saraswati reluctantly accepts the alliance. Laxmi be-weds a mentally disturbed man with a brutal history of violence who soon is cured in Australia. Jhumki who changed her name to Jhanvi marries Nikhil and moves to her husband‚Äôs home only to face more patriarchal trouble and female oppression at her in-laws, which is eventually overcome with the daughters proving they are equal to men.

He is also a film producer. He is the author of Frozen Assets (), and was formerly the publisher of International Figure Skating Magazine from its inception in 1993 until 2004, when his company, Ashton International Media, Inc., lost control of the magazine in a hostile takeover. In 2001, Out Magazine named Lund to the OUT 100 list of greatest success stories for that year.OUT 100  The 100 Men and Women who Rocked 2007 Lund has also made numerous media appearances as an analyst on figure skating, particularly during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal, where he was an analyst for CNN. He served as a judge on the television show Skating with Celebrities in early 2006. After losing control of International Figure Skating, Lund, who is openly gay, founded another magazine, SCENE, aimed at the gay community. Lund appeared on Nancy Kerrigan's World of Skating in an episode that aired January 14, 2007 titled \\"Countdown to Nationals & Road to Glory\\". His commentary in this episode concerning US men's figure skater Johnny Weir was criticized by several bloggers in the gay community.e.g. On March 18, 2008 writer Alan Schwarz used some of Lund's quotes from the broadcast in a New York Times article titled Figure Skating Rivalry Pits Athleticism Against Artistry. In 2007, Lund appeared as Commander Steven Conner in Star Trek: Odyssey in their pilot episode \\"Iliad\\" and produced the science fiction short film First World based on his feature-length script. The script was nominated for screenplay awards at the California Independent Film Festival, Fantastic Planet Film Festival and The Movie Deal.

Their authenticity has been the subject of some dispute, and scholarly consensus has shifted back and forth over time. They were \\"generally accepted as genuine until modern times\\";Plato's Epistles by Glenn Morrow, 1962, p. 5 but by the close of the nineteenth century, many philologists (such as Richard Bentley, Christoph Meiners, and Friedrich Ast) believed that none of the letters were actually written by Plato. Now every letter except the First has some defenders of its authenticity. The Twelfth is also widely regarded as a forgery, and the Fifth and Ninth have fewer supporters than the others.Platon, \\"Lettres\\", ed. by Luc Brisson, Flammarion, 2004, p. 70. The Epistles focus mostly on Plato's time in Syracuse and his influence on the political figures Dion and Dionysius. They are generally biographical rather than philosophical, although several, notably the Seventh Letter, gesture at the doctrines of Plato's philosophy. Only two, the Second and Seventh, directly reference Plato's teacher Socrates, the major figure within his philosophical dialogues. Authenticity The two letters that are most commonly claimed to have actually been written by Plato are the Seventh and the Eighth, on the supposition that these were open letters and therefore less likely to be the result of invention or forgery. This is not so much because of a presumption in favor of an open letter's authenticity as because of a presumption against that of a private letter: the preservation of the former is unsurprising, while the preservation, dissemination, and eventual publication of the latter requires some sort of explanation.Bury, Introduction to the Epistles, 390‚Äì2. Nevertheless, even the Seventh Letter has recently been argued to be spurious by prominent scholars, such as Malcolm Schofield,Malcolm Schofield, \\"Plato & Practical Politics\\", in Greek & Roman Political Thought, ed. Schofield & C. Rowe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 299‚Äì302. Myles Burnyeat,Myles Burnyeat, \\"The Second Prose Tragedy: a Literary Analysis of the pseudo-Platonic Epistle VII,\\" unpublished manuscript, cited in Malcolm Schofield, Plato (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 44n19. and Julia Annas.Julia Annas, \\"Classical Greek Philosophy,\\" in The Oxford History of Greece and the Hellenistic World, ed. Boardman, Griffin and Murray (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 285. George Boas argues that all of the Epistles, including the Seventh, are spurious,George Boas, \\"Fact and Legend in the Biography of Plato\\", 453‚Äì457. a conclusion accepted also, and more recently, by Terence Irwin.Terence Irwin, \\"The Intellectual Background,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Plato, ed. R. Kraut (Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1992), 78-79n4. On the other hand, Grote, Raeder, Novotny, Harward, and Bluck reject only the First; and Bentley accepted all of them. The other letters enjoy varying levels of acceptance among scholars. The Sixth, Third, and Eleventh have the greatest support of the remaining letters, followed by the Fourth, Tenth, Thirteenth, and Second Letter; fewer scholars consider the Fifth, Ninth, and Twelfth to be genuine, while almost none dispute that the First is spurious. > \\"If the Epistles are genuine‚Äîand some of the greatest scholars and > historians hold they are‚Äîwe know more of the life of Plato than of any other > ancient philosopher.' Even apart from the Epistles we know a good deal. > Besides what we may infer from the dialogues, we have one or two statements > resting on the authority of Hermodoros, who was a member of the Academy in > Plato‚Äôs time, and these give us certain fixed points to start from.

I do not think either that he was Dion or meant to pass for > Dion.\\" Structure of the Epistles The numbering of each letter is due solely to their placement in traditional manuscripts, and does not appear to follow any discernible principle.Bury, Introduction to the Epistles, 385 L. A. Post, in his edition of the Thirteen Epistles of Plato, presented them in the order in which he thought they were written: Thirteenth, Second, Eleventh, Tenth, Fourth, Third, Seventh, Eighth, and Sixth (the four letters universally recognized as spurious are placed following these nine).Post, Thirteen Epistles of Plato The addressees of the Epistles fall into three main categories. Four are addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse (i, ii, iii, xiii), four to Dionysius' uncle Dion and his associates (iv, vii, viii, x), and five to various others (the Fifth to Perdiccas III of Macedon; the Sixth to Hermias of Atarneus, Erastus, and Coriscus; the Tenth to Aristodorus; the Eleventh to Laodamas; and the Ninth and Twelfth to Archytas). =First Letter= The First Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse, and is almost certainly a forgery. In it, Plato supposedly complains of his rude dismissal by Dionysius and predicts an evil end for him. It is interesting mainly for the number of quotations from the tragic poets which it preserves. =Second Letter= The Second Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse in response to a supposed complaint he lodged against Plato and his associates that they were slandering him. The letter disclaims any responsibility for these slanders and further denies that they are even occurring. It then counsels Dionysius that a concern for his reputation after his death should incline him to repair his relationship with Plato, since the interactions of political men with the wise is a topic of constant discussion. From this subject, the letter turns to a deliberately enigmatic discussion of \\"the First,\\" in which Plato warns Dionysius to never write these doctrines down and to burn this letter upon committing its contents to memory. The Second Letter is the source of the oft- cited remark that \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new (Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåœÇ Œ∫Œ±ŒØ ŒΩŒ≠ŒøœÇ).\\"Plato, Second Letter, 314c. R. G. Bury argues that the Second Letter is almost certainly inauthentic, based primarily upon conflicts between it and Plato's Seventh Letter and Bury's own conclusion is that its tone and content are decidedly un-Platonic.Bury, Epistle II, 398. He considers it to be by the same author as the Sixth Letter.Bury, Epistle VI, 454‚Äì5. =Third Letter= The Third Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse, complaining of two slanders aimed at Plato, viz. that he had prevented Dionysius II from transforming his tyranny into a monarchy and that Plato was to blame for all the maladministration in Syracuse. The letter responds by recounting Plato's activities in Syracuse, and has the flavor of an open letter. Bury suggests that the Third Letter, if authentic, was probably written after Plato's third visit to Syracuse in 360 BC, and probably after Dion's seizure of power in 357 BC. He finds the tone to be anachronistic, however, remarks that the parallels to both the Apology of Socrates and the Seventh Letter argue against its authenticity.Bury, Epistle III, 422‚Äì3 =Fourth Letter= The Fourth Letter is addressed to Dion, the uncle and (by this time) ouster of Dionysius II of Syracuse. It encourages Dion in his political efforts, but admonishes him not to forget about the importance of virtue. Bury finds the mixture of flattery and reproof in the letter to be at odds with Plato's friendlier relationship with Dion, even granting that it may be an open letter, and notes conflicts with the Seventh Letter that militate against its authenticity.Bury, Epistle IV, 440‚Äì1 =Fifth Letter= The Fifth Letter is addressed to Perdiccas III of Macedon, and counsels him to listen to the advice of one Euphraeus. It then proceeds to defend Plato's abstinence from politics. Most scholars doubt its authenticity. =Sixth Letter= The Sixth Letter is addressed to Hermias, tyrant of Atarneus, and to Erastus and Coriscus, two pupils of Plato residing in Scepsis (a town near Atarneus), advising them to become friends. The letter claims that Plato never met Hermias, contrary to the account given of the latter's life by Strabo; contains a number of parallels to the Second Letter concerning the value of combining wisdom with power, the utility of referring disputes to its author, and the importance of reading and re-reading it; and concludes that all three addresses should publicly swear an oath to strange deities, and to do so half-jestingly. For these reasons, Bury concludes that Sixth Letter is inauthentic and shares its author with the Second Letter. =Seventh Letter= The Seventh Letter is addressed to the associates and companions of Dion, most likely after his assassination in 353 BC. It is the longest of the Epistles and considered to be the most important. It is most likely an open letter, and contains a defense of Plato's political activities in Syracuse as well as a long digression concerning the nature of philosophy, the theory of the forms, and the problems inherent to teaching. It also espouses the so-called \\"unwritten doctrine\\" of Plato which urges that nothing of importance should be committed to writing. =Eighth Letter= The Eighth Letter is addressed to the associates and companions of Dion, and was probably written some months after the Seventh Letter but before Dion's assassin, Callippus, had been driven out by Hipparinus. It counsels compromise between the parties of Dion and Dionysius the Younger, the former favoring democracy, the latter, tyranny. The compromise would be a monarchy limited by laws. =Ninth Letter= The Ninth Letter is addressed to Archytas. Bury describes it as \\"a colourless and commonplace effusion which we would not willingly ascribe to Plato, and which no correspondent of his would be likely to preserve.\\"Bury, Epistle IX, 591. Despite the fact that Cicero attests to its having been written by Plato,Cicero, De Finibus, Bonorum et Malorum, ii. 14; De Officiis, i. 7. most scholars consider it a literary forgery. =Tenth Letter= The Tenth Letter is addressed to an otherwise unknown Aristodorus, who is praised for having remained loyal to Dion, presumably during the latter's exile. The treatment of philosophy in simply moral terms, without any reference to intellectual qualities, is foreign enough to Plato's treatment for Bury to declare the letter a forgery.Bury, Epistle X, 597. In any event, it consists of a bare three sentences, covering nine lines in the Stephanus pagination. =Eleventh Letter= The Eleventh Letter is addressed to one Laodamas, who apparently requested assistance in drawing up laws for a new colony. It refers to someone named Socrates, though the reference in the letter to the advanced age of Plato means that it cannot be the Socrates who is famous from the dialogues. Bury would allow the authenticity of the letter, were it not for the fact that it claims that this Socrates cannot travel on account of having been enervated by a case of strangury.Bury, Epistle XI, 601. =Twelfth Letter= The Twelfth Letter is addressed to Archytas. * It is only slightly longer than the Tenth Letter (four sentences, covering 12 lines in the Stephanus pagination), and considered to be spurious. It thanks Archytas for sending Plato some treatises, which it then goes on to praise effusively. Diogenes La√´rtius preserves this letter in his Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, as well as the letter from Archytas which presumably occasioned the Twelfth Letter;Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, Life of Archytus, iv this letter points to the treatises having been those of Ocellos of Lucania, a Pythagorean. Because the writings which are attributed to Ocellos are forgeries from the First Century BC, the Twelfth Letter is probably also a forgery, and by the same forger, intended to stamp the treatises with Plato's authority.Bury, Epistle XII, 607. =Thirteenth Letter= The Thirteenth Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse, and appears to be private in character. The portrait of Plato offered here is in sharp contrast to that the disinterested and somewhat aloof philosopher of the Seventh Letter, leading Bury to doubt its authenticity.Bury, Epistle XIII, 610‚Äì3.

The order was initially created to satirize the pompous and pretentious Military Order of the Dragon. Descendants of those eligible for membership are themselves eligible, regardless of military service. the annual dues were US$50. Background The organization was founded in 1900 by U.S. officers stationed in the Philippines during the Philippine Insurrection that occurred after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The idea for a lampoon was conceived by several Army officers one night at the Army-Navy Club in Manila. This organization was founded to counter and satirize the Military Order of the Dragon, founded by other American officers who served in the short-lived Boxer uprising in China. Only the Carabao survives today. The carabao referred to in the organization's name is a domesticated water buffalo used as a beast of labor in the Philippines. The group's membership is referred to as \\"the herd\\" and individual members are called \\"bulls.\\" At each annual Wallow, the incoming Grand Paramount Carabao promises to \\"keep the herd well-wetted down.\\" The Military Order of the Carabao is one of several military orders in the United States composed of commissioned officers and their descendants. Other military orders include the Society of the Cincinnati, the Aztec Club of 1847, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Military Order of the Stars and Bars, the Military Order of the Dragon, the Naval Order of the United States, the Military Order of Foreign Wars, the Order of Lafayette and the Military Order of the World Wars. Carabao Wallow The organization sponsors an annual social event called the Carabao Wallow, a black-tie, military-dress affair attended by members of the U.S. military, the U.S. government, and corporations associated with the military, such as defense contractors. Members perform semi-professional musical skits at the Wallow that often poke fun at national and international issues as well as current events. It is not uncommon for the Carabao players to spoof the high- ranking guests seated at the Head Table. The group's anthem, sung at the Wallow, is \\"The Soldier's Song,‚Äù which refers to ‚Äúbolos‚Äù (machetes used by Filipino insurgents) and ‚Äúladrones‚Äù (thieves) :In the days of dopey dreams‚Äîhappy, peaceful Philippines, :When the bolomen were busy all night long. :When ladrones would steal and lie, and Americanos die, :Then you heard the soldiers sing this evening song: :Damn, damn, damn the insurrectos! :Cross-eyed kakiac ladrones! :Underneath the starry flag, civilize 'em with a Krag, :And return us to our own beloved homes.

The Ancient footprints of Acahualinca (; ) exist in Managua, Nicaragua near the southern shore of Lake Managua. The region was once called \\"El Cauce\\". The tracks are fossil Late Holocene human footprints left behind in volcanic ash and mud, which solidified about 2,120¬±120 years ago, shortly after the group of up to 15 people passed by. It is sometimes reported that the people were running to escape from a volcanic explosion, but the distance between the footprints indicates a walking gait. Fossilized footprints of several animals are also present, but the fact that they intersect the human footprints shows they were not traveling with the people. Scientific analysis of the footprints In 1874, construction workers discovered the footprints. The United States medical doctor and archaeological collector, Earl Flint, brought the footprints to the attention of the international science community and media in 1884. The Carnegie Institution of Washington began the first scientific analysis and excavations of the area in 1941 and 1942. They also constructed a museum and a building to protect the footprints. Work was continued by Joaqu√≠n Matill√≥, Allan L. Bryan and Jorge Espinosa in the 1960s and 1970s. Allan L. Bryan, from the University of Alberta, used radiocarbon dating to determine the age of soil humates, from a buried soil directly underlying the footprints, to 5,945¬±145 radiocarbon years Before Present. Based upon this date, he estimated that the footprints dated to about 5,000 Before Present. But, later dating of the volcanic deposits in which they occur, known as the Masaya Triple Layer, demonstrated that the fossil tracks are only about 2,120 ¬± 120 years old. In 1978, the Nicaraguan researcher Jorge Espinosa continued the excavation near the termination of the original excavation. He uncovered more footprints at a depth of 4 meters. The track is believed to continue further. Specimens of these footprints can be viewed at both the Peabody Museum of Archaeology at Harvard University and the United States National Museum.  Acahualinca Museum  The \\"Museo Sitio Huellas de Acahualinca\\" is located at west of Managua, in the eponymous Acahualinca town. The museum was founded in 1953 by Nicaraguan scientist Leonor Mart√≠nez, later in 1989, was rescued, restored and fitted out with the support of \\"ASDI\\" and the Historical Museum of Sweden.

Maitland was the eighth surviving son of Charles Maitland, 6th Earl of Lauderdale, and his wife Lady Elizabeth Ogilvy, daughter of James Ogilvy, 4th Earl of Findlater. He was a Captain in the Royal Marines in 1757 and served in the Seven Years' War, losing his right arm in action.Scott Martin, Bernard F. Harris Jr ‚Äò‚ÄôSavannah 1779: The British turn south‚Äô‚Äô Bloomsbury Publishing, 24 Aug 2017 page 15 When peace came in 1763 he went onto half-pay. In 1768 Maitland stood for Parliament at Haddington Burghs when there was a double return, but decided not to contest the matter. He was appointed Clerk of the Pipe in Scottish Exchequer in 1769. He returned to the active list in 1770 and became a major in 1775. Meanwhile he was returned at the 1774 general election as Member of Parliament for Haddington Burghs. Little is known of his parliamentary career and from 1777 he was away serving in America. In May 1778 Maitland was commanding marines against vessels in the Delaware during the American Revolutionary War and became Lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Battalion, 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders in October 1778. He fought at the Battle of Stono Ferry, where he commanded the British redoubt, and helped lift the Siege of Savannah. He died of malaria on 22 October 1779 shortly after the siege was lifted. For over a century, he was interred in a tomb in Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery, alongside his rival Nathanael Greene. In 1981, Dr. Preston Russell gained permission from the city to enter the tomb. He took Maitland's bones back to his native Scotland.\\"Hungry for History?

Early career The son of the Chairman of Martins Bank, Holland-Martin was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He followed his father's profession but in 1939 was commissioned in the Royal Fusiliers (Territorial Army). Invalided out of the Army, Holland-Martin was appointed Military Secretary to the Governor-General of New Zealand, Cyril Newall from 1942 to 1944. He briefly held the same post in relation to the Governor of Kenya in 1945. Post-war After the war, Holland-Martin was appointed a Director of Martins Bank. He also became involved in politics and was made Joint Honorary Treasurer of the Conservative Party from 1947; two years later he married Lady Anne Cavendish MBE, daughter of the Duke of Devonshire. Parliament At the 1951 general election, Holland-Martin was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Ludlow. His experience in financial matters was often in evidence in House of Commons debates, although he was generally low profile. He remained involved in business throughout his time in Parliament. Disqualification question In 1955 he was caught up in a minor constitutional crisis over his local Directorship of the Bank of New Zealand. With the Bank's shares vested in the Crown, the Directorship was technically an 'office of profit under the crown' and as such a disqualification from the House of Commons. Holland-Martin immediately resigned his office while the law was changed and an Act of Parliament was passed to indemnify him from the consequences of having acted as a Member of Parliament while disqualified. Death Later in the 1950s Holland-Martin became involved in many African-related mining and exploration companies. While on a visit to Southern Rhodesia in January 1960, he suffered a heart attack and was confined to bed at Government House; he was returned to Britain but died at his home in Colwall, Herefordshire in April, aged 49.

After a year of rehearsal, the band entered at Jim Dotson's studio, South Coast Recording Studio (Jim is currently the owner of Muskrat Ranch, LLC in Orlando, Florida) to record the Rabid Decay demo in 1992. Morgion recorded two tracks for a 7-inch release, Travesty, which was released on the independent record label Catatonic in 1993. In 1994, guitarist Bobby Thomas and keyboardist Ed Parker joined the band. With this formation Morgion found its identity it so longed for, \\"building on existing fundamentals by incorporating intricate melodies and atmospherics\\" Morgion recorded nearly an hour of material at Jim Barnes' Audio Productions in July 1994, and from these sessions the \\"Among Majestic Ruin\\" EP and two Celtic Frost cover songs for \\"In Memory of Celtic Frost\\" were born.

The song was released as a single and reached number two in 1967 on the UK Singles Chart, and number four in Ireland. It achieved its own place in pop history by being the first record to be played on BBC Radio 1 when the station was launched on 30 September 1967. (Technically, both George Martin's specially commissioned \\"Theme One\\" and Johnny Dankworth's \\"Beefeaters\\" were the first tracks to be heard on the station. \\"Beefeaters\\" was Tony Blackburn's theme tune for Daily Disc Delivery and so it was heard before \\"Flowers in the Rain\\".Another school of thought cites Julie Andrews' \\"The Sound of Music\\" as the first track since this was played at 5:30am when the new Radio One frequency opened up with a shared programme, heard simultaneously on Radio Two, hosted by Paul Hollingdale (The Weekly News, Issue 7,946, 29 September 2007)) \\"Flowers in the Rain\\" was the last single by The Move to have Carl Wayne on lead vocals before Roy Wood took over as the band's lead vocalist for \\"Fire Brigade\\". The distinctive instrumental arrangement, including oboe, clarinet, cor anglais and French horn, was suggested by assistant producer Tony Visconti. Promotional stunt In a promotional stunt for the record ‚Äî typical of the band's manager Tony Secunda ‚Äî a postcard was released with a cartoon of a naked Harold Wilson, linking him to his secretary Marcia Williams. Wilson sued, and the High Court ordered that all royalties from the song were donated to a charity of Wilson's choice. This legal arrangement remains in force to this day and is thought to have cost the group millions of pounds over the years. During the single's chart success, most of the money went to the Spastics Society and Stoke Mandeville Hospital. In the 1990s, The Observer newspaper reported the royalties had exceeded ¬£200,000 and found that The Harold Wilson Charitable Trust had extended the range of beneficiaries to include, among others, the Oxford Operatic Society, Bolton Lads Club and the Jewish National Fund for Israel.

Life Nemazee was born in Washington, D.C. on January 27, 1950 and attended Landon School, graduating in 1968. He received his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with Honors from Harvard University in 1972. Nemazee has not returned to Iran since the Iranian revolution. Most of his family's property was seized by the new Iranian government. On August 25, 2009 Nemazee was arrested for fraudulently applying for a loan of over $74 million from Citigroup. The maximum penalty for the offense is 30 years in prison. He was subsequently accused of fraudulently obtaining $292 million of loans from three banks and of using the proceeds to both support his lifestyle and make political contributionshttp://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/.../hassan-nemazee- indictment.php?... Nemazee is the brother of Susie Nemazee, the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington DC, Sir Peter Westmacott. Nemazee is the Chairman of Nemazee Capital. Based upon the allegations of fraud contained in Mr. Nemazee's indictment, it is difficult to determine what legitimate business, if any, was ever conducted by Nemazee Capital. Business interests Nemazee Capital was established in 1987 and was purported, on its website, to have, either directly or through associated entities, invested in the following sectors: health care, media, oil and gas, insurance, investment banking, asset management, newspapers, real estate development, technology, and communications. Nemazee claims to have created Nemazee Holdings in the early 1970s and entered the financial services industry by partnering directly with AIG; at the time, according to information supplied by Nemazee, it was unique for the insurance giant to enter into such a relationship. Around this same time Nemazee claims to have created a joint venture for the establishment of a bank with Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, predecessor to JP Morgan & Co. Nemazee Capital evolved out of Nemazee Holdings and originally focused on real estate development.Please note: The majority of information contained in this entry, especially concerning Mr. Nemazee's alleged business achievements and interests cannot be verified and must be evaluated in light of his recent arrest for fraud and grand larceny. Political involvement Nemazee was, prior to his arrest, also known as one of the top political bundlers in the United States. President Clinton nominated Nemazee to be Ambassador to Argentina on January 6, 1999, but the nomination was returned without action on August 5, 1999. During the 2004 United States presidential election, Nemazee was a supporter of John Kerry and a major contributor to his campaign. He was the New York Finance Chair for the Kerry campaign, and later the national finance chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.Marketplace: Hedge funds leaning blue With Nemazee as the national finance chair, Chuck Schumer's DSCC in 2006 raised $115 million, outpacing the NRSC by substantial sums, and helping the Democratic Party take control of the Senate.

He received his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Wittenberg in 1706, and his medical degree from the University of Leipzig in 1710. Afterwards, he embarked on a scientific trip through Germany, Holland and England. In Amsterdam he met with Frederik Ruysch (1638-1731).Abraham Vater @ Who Named It He later gained his habilitation in Wittenberg, becoming an associate professor in 1719, a full professor of anatomy in 1732 and a professor of therapy in 1746. Vater is primarily known for his work in anatomy, but he also published works in the fields of chemistry, botany, pharmacology and gynaecology. He was the first to describe the hepatopancreatic ampulla, which is the juncture of the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, and is now referred to as the ampulla of Vater. Plaque commemorating Vater at Schlo√üstra√üe 14-15, in Wittenberg In 1719, Vater was the first to notice oval-shaped organs of concentric layers of connective tissue wrapped around nerve endings in the skin. They were between 1‚Äì4 mm long, and he called the structures papillae nervae. Apparently his research was forgotten, because in 1831 they were rediscovered by anatomist Filippo Pacini (1812‚Äì1883) when performing a dissection of a hand. Pacini was the first to describe their functionality as mechanoreceptors that are sensitive to vibration and pressure changes, and thus the structures were to become known as Pacinian corpuscles. Today, the term \\"Vater-Pacini corpuscles\\" is sometimes used to credit the discoveries of both men.Vater-Pacini corpuscles @ Who Named It These organs are one of several types of mechanoreceptors in the body, some others being Meissner corpuscles (tactile and touch receptors), Ruffini corpuscles (respond to skin stretch and torque), and Krause corpuscles.

It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organisation and faith. The synod is chaired by the Patriarch of Alexandria and the members are the church's metropolitan archbishops, metropolitan bishops, diocesan bishops, patriarchal exarchs, missionary Bishops, auxiliary bishops, suffragan bishops, assistant bishops, chorbishops and the patriarchal vicars of the Church of Alexandria. Seniority According to Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria traditions, the Pope, being the Bishop of Alexandria and being the senior and elder bishop and the metropolitan archbishop of the province and primate of all Egypt, is the head of the Holy Synod as a first among equals. The most senior position after the Pope was that of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Pentapolis, but since it ceased to be a major archiepiscopal metropolis in the days of Pope John VI it has been held as a titular see attached to another metropolis. There is a special status of seniority of honor and precedence for the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy and Great City of Our Lord, Jerusalem, Holy Zion, Archbishop of the Holy Archdiocese of Jerusalem, All Palestine, Philadelphia of Jordan and All the Near East. This great archdiocesan Metropolis is technically outside the Egyptian Province and is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the Pope of Alexandria, but is one of the possessions of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was created by Pope Cyril III (1235-1243) in the thirteenth Century, which, at that time, had caused a dispute between the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.History of the Coptic Church, Iris Habib Elmasry This was a very rare incident between the two sister churches as in general their relationship is one of the strongest between any two sister churches.History of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Abouna Menassa Elkomos Youhanna 1923 According to the Alexandrine tradition, the rank of metropolitan bishop is granted by the Pope to the diocesan bishops under his jurisdiction on a personal status (In Personam) and not due to the size or importance of the bishop's eparchy; however, the rank of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to those whose Archdioceses have historical importance and had or have more than one Suffragan Diocese within their territorial jurisdictions. The Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem is the only Coptic Orthodox Hierarch who is consecrated as a Metropolitan Archbishop without being consecrated first as a bishop and later elevated to Metropolitan Archbishop, as is the norm in all episcopal consecration according to the tradition of the Church of Alexandria; it is done concurrently on the same occasion. This has been the case since Cyril III consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop Basilius as the first Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem and All the Near East. Usually the chosen Hieromonk is consecrated first as a Diocesan Bishop, then with time, he could be awarded the higher dignity of Metropolitan Bishop. Sometimes the nominated Diocesan Bishop is already an Assistant Bishop, Auxiliary Bishop or General Bishop, in which case he is only enthroned as the bishop of that Diocese. Currently, and because the seniority of the members of the Holy Synod is decided according to the seniority of the consecretion/elevation date of the ecclesiastical ranks: First come the Metropolitan Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops, followed by the Diocesan Bishops then the Bishops Exarchs of the Throne, then the Suffragan Bishops, then the Auxiliary Bishops, then the General Bishops and finally the Chorbishops but also according to the date of consecration within each rank. Accordingly, the most senior position after the Pope is the oldest consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop, who was Metropolitan Pachomios, the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of Damanhur (Hermopolis Parva) and Beheira (Consecrated in 1990). In spite of the ancient Alexandrine tradition, the most senior Hierarch, after the Senior Hierarch of Pentapolis, is the Hierarch of the Metropolis of (Lycopolis), (Hieracon) and (Apollonopolis Parva), which is Asyut; but since the great and ancient Titular Metropolis of Pentapolis in (Cyrenaica), that comprises the Holy Suffragan Dioceses of (Cyrene), (Appollonia), (Ptolemais), (Berenice) and (Arsinoe), is currently a Titular title, incorporated within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of Beheira (Hermopolis Parva), (Buto), (Naucratis), Mariout (Mareotis), Marsa Matruh (Paraetonium), (Apis); who is also the Titular Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient and Holy Titular Archdiocese of Libya, comprising the Titular Suffragan Dioceses of (Livis, Marmarica, Darnis, Neapolis and Tripolitania); of the Ancient and Holy (Exarchate of Africa) in Tunisia, comprising the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of (Mauretania Tingitana) and (Mauretania Caesariensis) and of the Ancient and Holy Titular Metropolis of (Numedia) in Algeria and Morocco that includes the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of (Leptis Parva) and of (Hadramentum). Accordingly, that honor goes to the Hierarch of the Metropolis of (Lycopolis), (Hieracon) and (Apollonopolis Parva) apart from the fact of the current adoption of the seniority of the date of consecration of the later Hierarch. The most senior bishop in consecration will become the Locum tenens in case of the death of the Pope and until the election of the new Pope, and he will be the one who enthrones the newly elected Pope along with all the Hierarchs, who are members of the Holy Synod. This seniority ranking system does not diminish the importance and the greatness of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem and All the Near East, since its inclusion under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Church of Alexandria in early medieval times. The archiepiscopal status of this great Metropolis is also granted due to the Holy Apostolic Throne that it represents, being the Apostolic and Patriarchal Throne of Jerusalem, although its Metropolitan Archbishop does not claim that title and is under the jurisdiction of the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria.

Bishop Sarabamoun on March 8, 2020) Definition of Hierarchical titles according to the Alexandrine Tradition =Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria= Pontiff and Supreme Hierarch of the Holy Orthodox & Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is considered First among equals (primus inter pares) on his Apostolic Throne. He presides over the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and over all Patriarchal Institutions. He is also the Head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria. He consecrates, crowns and enthrones Patriarchs and Catholicoi (within his Dominion/Jurisdiction in Africa). He consecrates and crowns Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops, and delegates several Metropolitans and Bishops to enthrone them. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons, all minor Orders, all ranks of Monastics, elevates Bishops to the Metropolitan, the Archiepiscopal or the Patriarchal Dignity. He consecrates the Holy Myron. He also bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of asceticism in Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank. He anoints, crowns and enthrones Orthodox Emperors and Empresses, Orthodox Kings and Queens. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments. He has the First and the Highest Rank of the Episcopal Dignity of the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is the Primate of the second highest Apostolic Throne, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Nicea (325 AD), after Imperial Rome. The Throne of Alexandria later became third in rank, after the Imperial Cities of Rome and Constantinople, New Rome, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (381AD). =Metropolitans Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops= Administrative Title of the Episcopal Rank for a large Diocese or Eparchy, bestowed upon a Diocesan Bishop by the Patriarch, in recognition for his long service in his Diocese/Eparchy. It can also be granted due to the extended size of a Diocese or an Eparchy (by becoming an Archdiocese or an Archeparchy,) thus forming or is considered as an Ecclesiastical province, which requires its Prelate to be elevated to the Metropolitan /Archiepiscopal Dignity. The higher Title of Metropolitan Bishop/Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Bishop of the Metropolis. He may oversee several Suffragan Bishops (to each his own Diocese) within his province, Auxiliary Bishops (Assistant to the Hierarch) and/or Chori- Episcopoi, under his jurisdiction. The title of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Hierarch of the Metropolis that has a historical dignity within the Throne, and whose Bishop ought to have the honorary dignity of a Metropolitan Archbishop, like Metropolitan Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem, All Palestine and Philadelphia of Jordan and Patriarchal Exarch of all the Near East and the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of Pentapolis in (Cyrenaica), comprising the Suffragan Dioceses of: (Cyrene), (Appollonia),(Ptolemais), (Berenice) and (Arsinoe), who is also the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of Libya, comprising the Suffragan Dioceses of: (Livis, Marmarica, Darnis and Tripolitania). He is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City, the Metropolis and is called Archbishop in all the other Suffragan Dioceses, whose Suffragan Bishops are under his jurisdiction. Whereas, the Metropolitan Bishop is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City with its jurisdictions, which as a whole is considered a Metropolis, according to the jurisdictional subdivision of the Church, and he may have Assistant Bishops or Auxiliary Bishops under his jurisdiction, but does not have Suffragan Dioceses, headed by Suffragan Bishops, under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes in his Diocese or Eparchy. He bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments in his Diocese or Eparchy. He exercises the same authority in his Metropolis and its jurisdiction as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch. In the case of the departure of the Patriarch, the Senior Metropolitan in ordination, acts as Locum Tenens of the Throne, until the election of the new Patriarch, whom he will enthrone, along with the entire body of the Hierarchy of the Throne. During that time, no ordination of new Hierarchs, no consecration of the Holy Myron, no new Patriarchal decrees or alteration of previous Patriarchal or Holy Synod decrees can be made. He is Second in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity. =Diocesan or Eparchial Bishop= Hierarch chosen to oversee a Diocese or an Eparchy, whether this Diocese or Eparchy is a subdivision of the Patriarchate or a subdivision of a greater Province, ruled by a Metropolitan Archbishop (which, in this case these are called Suffragan Bishops.) He is the Shepherd of his flock. He has the right to consecrate parishes, altars, baptisteries and all ecclesiastical foundations. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy. He bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be consecrated to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates, within his Diocese or Eparchy, all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments. He exercises the same authority in his Diocese as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch. He is Third in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity. =General Bishop/Exarch of the Throne= Hierarch who does not have a jurisdiction over a particular Diocese and who is given a temporary Patriarchal assignment to shepherd or supervise either a particular district/portion of the Patriarchal Diocese or on \\"at large\\" designation as a delegate assistant to the Hierarch. He can also be serving within the Patriarchal Diocese/Jurisdiction, shepherding multiple congregations. He can also supervise an area or a region that has not yet been designated or established as a Diocese, thus acting as an Exarch of the Throne. In this case, he is considered as a Patriarchal Vicar if assigned within Egypt (the Mother Church) or as a Patriarchal Exarch of the Throne if assigned outside Egypt for certain duration. He also can be the administrator of a Bishopric (i.e. the Youth, Social & Ecumenical Services, Scientific Research & Higher Coptic Studies Bishoprics), which are patriarchal organizations headed by a General Bishop concerned with social, educational and spiritual care of the members of the patriarchate at large or of a Patriarchal Institution (the Patriarchal Print Shop, or the Patriarchal Secretariat). In this capacity, he is the Administrator of this particular Bishopric or Patriarchal Institution. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes with Patriarchal permission within the province, which are directly under the Patriarchal jurisdiction, whether within Egypt or outside Egypt, when delegated . He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal delegation. He reports directly to the Patriarch. He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch, and in this case he is given the title of Bishop Abbot, and ceases to be a General Bishop or Exarch of the Throne. The Title of General Bishop is not in conformity with the Holy and Apostolic Canon Laws of the Orthodox Church. On the other hand, an Exarch was and still is a permissible form of Patriarchal delegation or representation. =Auxiliary Bishop/Assistant Bishop/Suffragan Bishop= A Suffragan Hierarch who has been delegated by the Patriarch or a Metropolitan Archbishop to serve a district or part of the Patriarchal or Metropolitan Archdiocese or jurisdiction, or a suffragan diocese to the Metropolitan Archdiocese; if suffragan diocese is in question based on a quasi-permanent, occasional or as a temporal helper, then it is within Patriarchal diocesan jurisdiction, although in this case, he would be called Assistant Bishop. He shepherds the congregation of that particular diocese (if suffragan) or district (if within the patriarchal diocese), reporting directly to the Metropolitan Archbishop or the Pope of Alexandria respectively. He can also be assigned as an assistant by the Pope of Alexandria to help a Metropolitan Bishop in his Metropolitanate, which is not divided into smaller subdivisions of suffragan dioceses, and based upon the Metropolitan Bishop's or the Metropolitan Archbishop's request, if the latter requires an assistant. In this case, he is called an Assistant Bishop, he reports to the Diocesan Hierarch, i.e. the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop. He does not, however, inherit (takeover) the Metropolis after the departure of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop. In the case that this Bishop is chosen as a \\"Coadjutor Bishop\\" to a particular Metropolis/Archdiocese or a Suffragan Diocese of the Metropolis in the capacity of Coadjutor Bishop, in assistance to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, thus being second in command; then he has the right of succession when the latter reposes in the Lord. However, this form of governance is not favored and seldom applied nowadays in the Alexandrine tradition. If the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of a large Metropolis or Archdiocese is in need of one or more general helper in all kinds of services and to delegate to serve or shepherd all over the jurisdiction of the aforementioned Hierarch, then the chosen Bishop/s is/are called Auxiliary Bishop/s to the Hierarch in these capacities. The idea of having more than one Bishop shepherding a particular Diocese/Metropolitanate/Archdiocese is against the Canon Laws of the Church. This, however has been, recently, adapted and ratified by local Synodical Decrees, on the basis that the Auxiliary Bishop is assigned to a Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop within his Province, for a specific district or region (being too small to be considered as a suffragan diocese), as a means for better serving the congregation of a large Diocese. In this case, the large Diocese is considered as a Province. These Auxiliary Bishops are considered to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province as the Bishops of the Patriarchate are to the Patriarch within his Patriarchate. If the Metropolis or the Archdiocese has one or more suffragan diocese within its jurisdiction, then the appointment of Suffragan Bishops is a canonically accepted measure to extend the proper episcopal shepherding to this/these suffragan diocese(s). These appointments are reasoned in the following cases: *The Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, being the Hierarch of a large region or jurisdiction, which includes many cities and their suburbs, that could be divided into more than one diocese within the Metropolis and since he reserves the right to be the Diocesan Bishop, meaning the (Shepherd) of the main city (the Metropolis) of his Archeparchial Province, he appoints Suffragan Bishops for these dioceses. *Due to the age or physical health of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, an Auxiliary Bishop is then appointed to serve a part of the Metropolis /Archdiocese or an Assistant Bishop is appointed as a general assistant to the ruling Hierarch. The Auxiliary Bishop/Suffragan Bishop/Assistant Bishop assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his District, Diocese or Eparchy. He assists the Patriarch, and all the Metropolitans and all the Bishops in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal, Archiepiscopal or Metropolitan delegation. He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop. =Titular Bishop= A Hierarch, who is given the title for a defunct Diocese, in commemoration of its historical status. In the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, it has been the custom to give this title to a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop who already shepherds an active Archdiocese or Diocese. It would be considered a part of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; rather than having a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop overseeing a defunct Diocese, with no real congregation of its own (i.e. Pentapolis and Nubia). He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy. (Being already a Diocesan Metropolitan or Bishop as mentioned above). He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as any regular Bishop or Metropolitan (since in this case, he is in fact a Diocesan Bishop/Metropolitan). He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch, and in this case, he can keep his title of Titular Bishop, side by side with his title of Bishop Abbot. =Chorbishop (Chori- Episcopus)= An episcopal rank given for a Hierarch of a small town or village, under the jurisdiction of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop. He has the same ecclesiastical authority as that of the other Hierarchs. The exception is that he is to ordain Priests or Deacons and all Minor Orders, to consecrate holy vessels, altars, baptisteries or Churches only in his village or town and only with the authorization of the Patriarch, if assigned within the Patriarchal Diocese, or that of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop of the Metropolis/Diocese, in which his town or village is. This special Patriarchal, Metropolitan or Episcopal permission is essential for the above-mentioned ordinations and consecrations. He cannot do the above-mentioned consecration outside his assigned jurisdiction, or even within the main Diocesan cities of the province he serves in. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops by Episcopal permission of the ruling hierarch of the Provincial Diocese or Eparchy, in which he is serving. He also has no jurisdiction over the Priests or Archpriests of the Major or Capital Cities within the Province where his town or village is located. He has the same Episcopal Authority & Dignity as the Diocesan Bishop, including the above-mentioned authorities with permission. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.

An alcoholic, he confessed to his crimes while jailed for public intoxication in order to lift the burden of his conscience, stating he committed his murders in an equal state of intoxication. He was sentenced to death by the state of New Jersey after a quick legal process and spent a year on death row before he was executed in the electric chair at Trenton State Prison.  Early life  Peter Kudzinowski was born on August 13, 1903, in Dickson City, Pennsylvania, to Polish immigrant parents Paul and Veronica. He is frequently and incorrectly referred to as Polish-born. He was the youngest of four boys and grew up in the Scranton area. Kudzinowski suffered a skull fracture in the sixth grade after diving into a shallow pool. This had a noticeable effect on his behavior and he refused to go to school anymore. He subsequently worked a stint in the Lackawanna Coal Mine and later held a job in the Lackawanna Railroad yards in Secaucus.  Murders  = Harry Quinn = After Kudzinowski was jailed for seven-year-old Joseph Storelli's murder in 1928, he also confessed to two other murders. Kudzinowski murdered 20-year- old Harry Quinn in Scranton on March 8, 1924. The two were friends and were traveling to Spring Brook Township, where Quinn was looking to land a job with the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. Kudzinowski had introduced himself as \\"Ray Rogers\\" and \\"Roy Lambert\\" to some of Quinn's family members on what turned out to be the last day they would hear anything from Quinn. After the two of them had gotten into an altercation over a bottle of whiskey, Kudzinowski crushed Quinn's head with a rock. Kudzinowski's older brother later recalled that Peter came to visit him, told him he had been in a scrape, and needed money to leave town, without mentioning what had actually happened. Not having heard from Quinn in a few years, his family members presumed he had abandoned them and had been looking to get in touch with him through newspaper advertisements. = Julia Mlodzianowski = Kudzinowski also admitted to murdering Julia Mlodzianowski, a five-year-old girl from Jersey City, who was at a school picnic at Lake Hopatcong on August 19, 1928, although after he was captured, he told reporters he \\"had doubts\\" that he had actually murdered her. = Joseph Storelli = Kudzinowski met seven-year-old Joseph Storelli in a \\"half drunk\\" state late afternoon on November 17, 1928, on First Avenue in East Village, New York. Kudzinowski accosted two other children at the same location, but they ran away. Kudzinowski lured the boy away with the promise of a box of candy and a visit to a motion picture show. He then took him by the Port Authority Trans-Hudson train to Journal Square in Jersey City and finally walked him to the New Jersey Meadowlands near Secaucus. When Joseph tried to get away, Kudzinowski knocked him down and hit him several times. Worrying that the boy's cries would attract passing cars, Kudzinowski slashed his throat, covered the body with the boy's overcoat, and left him.  Capture  Kudzinowski was jailed in Detroit for public intoxication. He confessed to Storelli's murder to his jailer, who laughed at him. Kudzinowski was released after sobering up. On December 3, 1928, Kudzinowski drunkenly staggered up to a police traffic booth and told the officer there that he was wanted by the police. Upon being asked whether he meant for murder, he replied \\"You'll find out.\\" In jail again, Kudzinowski was interviewed by Detroit detectives who obtained the rough edges of his confession. He was primarily motivated to confess by the weight of his conscience, stating \\"I'm willing to pay the penalty, and the sooner it's over, the better. I had to confess. It was troubling me.\\" He was quickly transported to Jersey City to stand trial. The state brought in a medical expert, who characterized Kudzinowski as possessing a psychopathic personality. The defense brought its own experts who analyzed the X-rays made after the diving accident in his youth. He was found guilty of first-degree murder on January 17, 1929. When asked if he had anything to say before the sentence was passed, Kudzinowski remained silent. He was sentenced to die in the electric chair at Trenton State Prison in the week of February 24. Kudzinowski stated he was ready to die and felt he would probably commit more murders if he were ever set free again. = Execution = His father, Paul, had suffered a complete breakdown upon learning of his son's deeds, with his health reportedly declining very rapidly and \\"aging in years.\\" Paul Kudzinowski died on June 23, while Kudzinowski was held on death row. He lost an appeal on October 14. A final appeal to Governor Morgan Foster Larson of New Jersey to have his death sentence commuted to life in prison on grounds of insanity was denied on December 17. Kudzinowski appeared unfazed by his conviction, but on the night of his execution by electric chair on December 21, he appeared nervous and was unable to repeat the prayers uttered by his priest immediately before death.  Aftermath  Storelli's father later took his family back to Italy, leaving behind only Joseph's older brother, who ended up serving a year in prison and who was at one point arrested for robbing a high-stakes card game. He was eventually shot and killed by police during a routine inspection. Kudzinowski was considered a suspect in the disappearance of Billy Gaffney, who vanished in 1927. Albert Fish would later claim to have murdered Gaffney. Kudzinowski and Fish committed their crimes in the same time span and geographic area, and both killed children. He was also a suspect in the murder of Irving Pickelny, who disappeared from Brooklyn in February 1927.

Plot In 1965, Boston teenager Michael Dunn (Andrew McCarthy) and his young sister Boo (Jennifer Dundas) have been sent to Brooklyn to live with their Irish-Catholic grandparents following the deaths of their parents. Michael Dunn is enrolled at St. Basil's, a strict all-boys Roman Catholic school. His grandmother is determined to see him fulfill his parents' dream of him joining the priesthood. Dunn befriends Caesar (Malcolm Danare), a heavy, bespectacled student who enjoys reading. Caesar helps Dunn catch up with the rest of the class, but because of their association, foul-mouthed bully and underachiever Ed Rooney (Kevin Dillon) pranks Dunn outside of the soda fountain across the street from school. After Rooney pulls a prank on Caesar, a teacher, Brother Constance (Jay Patterson), attempts to get Dunn to identify the prankster by striking Dunn's open palms with a paddle. Fed up with Dunn's refusal to rat out the perpetrator, Constance shoves him to the floor. Dunn lunges towards Rooney and the pair are separated. Dunn and Rooney are sent to the office of the headmaster, Brother Thadeus (Donald Sutherland). Rooney, impressed by Dunn's refusal to snitch, attempts to patch things up between them, but Dunn wants nothing to do with him. After school, Rooney tells Dunn that if they do not become friends, he will have to continue in his harassment in order to save face. Reluctantly, Dunn befriends Rooney and his friends Williams (Stephen Geoffreys) and Corbett (Patrick Dempsey). Dunn also befriends Danni (Mary Stuart Masterson), a teenaged girl who runs the soda fountain across from the school and cares for her mentally infirm father (Jimmy Ray Weeks). Danni's fountain shop is raided numerous times by the Brothers, who wish to catch St. Basil's students misbehaving. The raids leave the shop in a shambles. After one raid, Dunn helps Danni clean things up, sparking a romance. At the sacrament of confession, Caesar enters the confessional, but Father Abruzzi (Wallace Shawn) becomes preoccupied with another student's misbehavior. Rooney enters the priest's booth and hears Caesar's confession, giving him the penance of befriending Rooney and making sure he gets passing grades. As a result, Caesar tutors and befriends Rooney. The relationship between Dunn and Danni further develops, culminating in a passionate kiss. One day, during one of the Brothers' routine raids, Danni takes a stand and locks them out. The Brothers leave, but later contact social services. A few days later, Dunn and his friends see police cars and a few of the Brothers surrounding the soda fountain door as Danni's father is led out in handcuffs. Dunn rushes in and finds that social workers are preparing to take Danni away. A shaken Dunn takes Danni in his arms. Weeping, she wants him to promise that he won't be sad over her departure. An angry Rooney develops another prank with the help of Caesar, Williams and Corbett. The boys sneak onto school grounds and decapitate the statue of St. Basil. During an assembly the next day, Rooney presents Dunn with a duffel bag containing the missing head. Brother Constance shows up, knowing that he has found the vandals. The boys are taken into the gym, where Constance hits Corbett and Williams with a leather strap in an attempt to extract a confession. Caesar presents Constance with a doctor's note, presumably to exempt him from corporal punishment. Constance drags the cowering Caesar to the floor, beating him with the strap. Dunn shoves Constance to the floor and then flees, with the Brother and the other boys following him. The chase ends in the auditorium during the assembly. Constance backhands Dunn and calls him a bastard. Dunn delivers an uppercut to Constance, knocking him to the floor and causing pandemonium as the student body rises to its feet and cheers. Thadeus suspends all five boys for two weeks. He then presents Constance, whom he says started the altercation, with an order that he be transferred to another assignment where he will not work with children. The five boys walk out of the school downtrodden, but then joyfully realize that they will not have to attend school for two weeks.

An NYU teacher showed the script, first called Catholic Boys, to producer Dan Wigutow, who tried unsuccessfully to interest production companies in it. Purpura dropped out of NYU and was fired from his job at a lithography shop for union organizing. He was denied unemployment benefits because his nighttime screenwriting was considered potentially lucrative employment, so he filed for bankruptcy, borrowed money and headed for India.Film Clips: Getting Through 'OZ' with Help of his Friends Film Clips: A Little Help Mathews, Jack. Los Angeles Times 21 June 1985: f1.MGM/UA: TWO GUYS WORKING OUT A SCRIPT: London, Michael. Los Angeles Times 8 Feb 1985: 1. The script was read by producer Mark Carliner, who wanted to finance further work on it. Wigutow had to contact Purpura in India via telegram. The writer began doing further drafts. Carliner then met Michael Dinner, a former recording artist who had just made a film at the American Film Institute, a version of Nathaniel West's Miss Lonelyhearts which had aired on American Playhouse. Carliner gave Dinner $10,000 to enable him to travel with Miss Lonelyhearts to the Cannes Film Festival, figuring it was \\"bread cast upon the water\\". Dinner became attached to direct Catholic Boys. On the plane to Cannes, Dinner met Maurice Singer, chief of the new theatrical film division of Home Box Office. By the time the plane landed in Europe, Singer had agreed to finance Catholic Boys. Tri-Star came on to distribute. Dinner said \\"When you're a new director you hear from a lot of people that you're a genius but it doesn't mean very much.

The film was in production when she was cast and Masterson would rehearse on weekends with Dinner and McCarthy.THE ECHOES OF TEEN-AGE FILM STARS: [Home Edition] Champlin, Charles. Los Angeles Times 28 Feb 1985: 4. =Filming= Filming took nine weeks. The Church of St. Michael (built 1921) and the (now closed) St. Michael's Parish School were used as the fictional St. Basil's Church and St. Basil's School, run by the factual Order of St. Basil. Filming used external and internal shots of this church and school, and around the neighborhood. An auditorium scene was filmed using students from Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx. John Heard later claimed an incident on the film led to him being unofficially blacklisted for a time. > One afternoon when I was sitting there talking to another actor.

To make the film more upbeat, there were changes made to a plot involving a disenchanted teacher, and the addition of a spoken epilogue. Reception The film was not a commercial success. McCarthy later called it \\"a very lovely movie that twelve people saw.\\" and describing it as \\"my favorite and/or the best movie I did in that whole era of those movies.\\" It was thought the marketing may have misled audiences about the film, indicating it was more of a typical teen film. \\"I'm a first-time director, and all I can do is stamp my foot, so to speak,\\" said Michael Dinner. \\"Besides, in terms of offending anyone, I'm more worried about Elvis fans.\\" (The film contains an unflattering excerpt from Blue Hawaii.)Hollywood keeping space stories down to earth Maslin, Janet.

Description Coarse bubble diffusers produce 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6.4 to 13 mm) bubbles which rise rapidly from the floor of a wastewater treatment plant or sewage treatment plant tank. They are typically used in grit chambers, equalization basins, chlorine contact tanks, and aerobic digesters, and sometimes also in aeration tanks. Generally they are better at vertically \\"pumping\\" water than at mass transfer of oxygen. Coarse bubble diffusers typically provide half the mass transfer of oxygen as compared to fine bubble diffusers, given the same air volume.  Application  Often in non-Newtonian or pseudoplastic fluids, such as a digester with high solids concentration, it does make sense to use coarse bubble diffusers rather than fine bubble diffusers, due to the larger bubbles' ability to shear through more viscous wastewater. However, over the past two decades, coarse bubble diffusers have been used less frequently, primarily due to the ever increasing cost of energy and the availability of more reliable, highly efficient fine bubble diffusers. Manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings. Specifically, in aeration tanks, a system that utilizes coarse bubble diffusers requires 30 to 40 percent more process air than a fine bubble diffused air system to provide the same level of treatment. The exception would be in secondary treatment (or side processing) phases. In these processing tanks, floc particles, sediment and carbonate buildup tend to plug or clog the small air release openings on the fine bubble diffusers. Because of their small air openings, fine bubble diffusers cease to have an advantage. Currently, coarse bubble diffusers are the mainstay solution. These diffusers are typically made in the shape of a perforated rectangular pipe called a wide band, or a cap of in diameter with an elastomeric membrane. Other varieties of coarse bubble diffusers exist, though it is generally accepted that all of them perform similarly with respect to mass oxygen transfer. When comparing disc-shaped diffusers, the majority fail to withstand specific challenges, beyond 1 or 2 years, which include: clogging, blowing off and cracking. Any coarse bubble diffuser that eliminates these problems would deliver a huge cost-savings, not only in product replacement, but in system downtime to facilitate their exchange. This is a motivating factor considered by budget-sensitive operators at municipal waste water treatment processing plants.

The members of The Guggenheim Grotto are Kevin May from Ballinrobe, and Mick Lynch from Westport. Guggenheim Grotto has a unique sound, characterized by an emphasis on piano instrumentals supporting their harmonies. Partridge of the Hartford Courant described their style as \\"folk-influenced indie-pop\\" and said it fit well with other music popular on college and public radio, such as Rufus Wainwright, Crowded House, and Kings of Convenience. The music varies from rock, to pop, folk, and even soul. Their influences include Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits, although that is not immediately apparent from their sound. History The Saint in Asbury Park, NJ, USA on July 6, 2012. Kevin May, Shane Power and Mick Lynch all participated in the Dublin music scene that produced musicians like Glen Hansard. May and Lynch have been playing as a duo since 2003. In 2004 they approached Power, a musician and producer with a successful studio, about editing their self-recorded A Lifetime in Heat EP. Power was impressed with their work, and later joined the group as their drummer and also produced their next album. All three play multiple instruments. The Guggenheim Grotto was well received when they came to the United States in 2006. In 2006, and again in 2009, the band performed at SXSW. The band‚Äôs debut album ...Waltzing Alone was self-released to immediate critical acclaim in Ireland on 9 September 2005, and their first promotional single Told You So rapidly climbed to No. 12 on the Irish National Airplay Chart. They released ...Waltzing Alone in the U.S. on New York-based new model indie label United For Opportunity on 26 September 2006, and in November of that year embarked on their first U.S. national tour. The band has since completed four U.S. tours. Early in 2007, The Guggenheim Grotto's A Lifetime In Heat won The 6th Annual Independent Music Award for Best Folk/Singer- Songwriter Song.Independent Music Awards - 6th Annual Winners Songs from their first album have been used in major network prime-time TV shows like One Tree Hill and Brothers And Sisters, and the album received positive reviews from U.S. national publications like Paste Magazine, as well as regional press like The Boston Globe and The Washington Post. The band's second album, Happy the Man, was released digitally for a limited time in the U.S. and Ireland on 7 October 2008. Former member Shane Power's studio experience has been credited with giving the album its more expansive, experimental sound. On Happy The Guggenheim Grotto's sound is more akin to Simon & Garfunkel, The Beatles, and Leonard Cohen. Intricate acoustic guitar work is the centerpiece for most tracks. The sound is more like Crowded House than Jack Johnson, with electronic influences reminiscent of Radiohead. The album reached No. 1 on the U.S. iTunes Folk Chart. The CD was released to stores 27 January 2009, and the band toured nationally to support it. The Universe Is Laughing, which Lynch and May recorded themselves, was released in 2010. As of early 2012, the duo was working on a new album that will have a bigger, more band-oriented sound than Universe, with money they raised from fans through the website PledgeMusic.com. In September 2013, the band announced that they had signed to Ingrid Michaelson's record label Cabin 24 and Secret Road Music Services and changed their name to Storyman (band).

Life Fleay, the son of a linen draper, graduated from King's College London (1849) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1853), where he received mathematical training that was key to his later achievements. He was ordained in the Church of England (1856), and for twenty years pursued a career in education, as a teacher and headmaster. (Fleay left the Church in 1884.) He was a founder member of the Aristotelian Society in 1880. He was an important and active figure in the foundation of the New Shakspere Society in 1873. At the Society's inaugural meeting on Friday 13 March 1874, Edwin Abbott Abbott read Part 1 of Fleay's seminal paper On Metrical Tests as Applied to Dramatic Poetry. Fleay's essay was a crucial early attempt to move away from impressionistic and qualitative approaches to the study of English Renaissance texts, and toward a more quantitative and fact-based approach. Fleay concentrated on rhymed versus unrhymed verse, and regular iambic pentameter lines versus lines with a \\"feminine ending,\\" an extra unstressed final syllable. While not the first researcher to take a quantitative approach,Halliday, p. 515. Fleay produced a more organized result, with tables of metrical characteristics in the verse of Shakespeare and other English Renaissance dramatists. \\"This labour-intensive method of analysis was peculiarly suited to the scientific and positivistic tenor of the times....\\"Grady, p. 46. Fleay wrote voluminously throughout his long career; as his best, he marshalled extensive fields of data and made the information available to readers. His Chronicle History of the London Stage (1890) is organized on the model of Jaques' \\"Seven Ages of Man\\" speech from As You Like It, II, vii, dividing its subject into: *\\"Infancy or Dawn,\\" 1559-85; *\\"Childhood or Sunrise,\\" 1586-92; *\\"Youth or Morning,\\" 1593-1602; *\\"Manhood or Noon,\\" 1603-13; *\\"Middle Age or Afternoon,\\" 1613-25; *\\"Old Age or Sunset,\\" 1625-37; and *\\"Decrepitude,\\" 1637-42, followed by*\\"Death,\\" 1642. Yet the deficiencies of his work were noted by contemporary critics as well as by subsequent generations of scholars. His efforts to quantify his research could not fully counter his tendency to be subjective and impressionistic, and at worst rather eccentric. His judgments and methods have not stood the test of time. (Fleay was a \\"disintegrator\\"he tended to attribute what he didn't like in Shakespeare's canon to other playwrights.Grady, pp. 47 ff. He assigned Titus Andronicus to Christopher Marlowe; Richard III and Romeo and Juliet were, he thought, originally composed by George Peele and later revised by Shakespeare.) Perhaps due to the enormous effort involved in creating his tables of verse-test data, Fleay had a tendency to make mistakes and get things wrong. The work of Fleay and other members of the New Shakspere Society was ridiculed by Algernon Charles Swinburne in 1880: \\"...the double-ending test, the triple-ending test, the heavy-monosyllabic-eleventh-syllable-of-the- double-ending test....\\"Murphy, pp. 210-11. In his later years, Fleay largely abandoned studies in English literature and devoted himself to Egyptology and Assyriology. His work in those fields was not free of his characteristic flaws, and had little impact.

It is widely considered to have emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, becoming increasingly popular in subsequent decades. Originally minimalistic style of electronic music developed into psychedelic and prog rock aspects, techno and electronic dance music. Notable artists include Kraftwerk, Can, Tangerine Dream and Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft. German electronic music contributed to a global transition of electronic music from underground art to an international phenomenon, with festivals such as Love Parade, Winterworld and MayDay gaining prominence alongside raves and clubs. Characteristics = Musical Elements = Electronic music is itself a broad term, characterised only by the specific use of electronic or digital musical instruments. German electronic music hence lacks distinctive musical characteristics other than varying usage of circuitry-based technology. Generally, polyphonic synthesisers, electronic drums, turntables and drum machines were frequent. The musical elements of German electronic music are very specific to the style and artist. Krautrock, a genre of electronic rock, involved experimental mixes of psychedelic and progressive rock with ambient music, electronic sounds, minimalist avant-garde musique concrete and jazz. Kraftwerk, a famous German electronic band, utilised metronomic melodies, while Faust, another musical group, maintained minimalism by using one or two chords or riffs played at high volumes. In contrast, electroclash fused musical elements of electro, techno, new wave, punk, synth-pop and performance art to form their sounds. = Local Scenes = German electronic music was characterised originally by illegal underground scenes of raves and parties. Immediately following the fall of the Berlin wall, industrial ruins and unconventional venues became unregulated centres of raw techno music. Taking DJs from Detroit techno and Chicago acid house while emulating the free- spirited party cultures of Ibiza and Manchester‚Äôs Hacienda Club, German electronic music was characterised by a culture of youth, nightlife and freedom. As German electronic music developed, it maintained this intrinsic characteristic, developing techno and electronic dance music into international phenomenon, with festivals such as Love Parade, Winterworld and MayDay gaining prominence. History = Origins = The foundations for electronic music were formed in 1948-53. German, French and American figures, including Busoni, Schoenberg, Varese and Cage, formulated new compositional procedures utilising developments in science. Electronic music was driven by composers striving to directly manipulate sound; experimenting with electronic circuitry, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Post-WW2 electronic music began developing rapidly, starting in Cologne 1952-3. Goeyvaerts and Stockhausen experimented with the earliest sound-compositions using sine tones. Drawing from the tape music of Ussachevksy and Luening and first sound experiments by Meyer-Eppler, Stockhausen‚Äôs Electronic Study 1 was the first composition to use synthetic sounds from sine tones. In May 1953, Stockhausen, Eimert and Beyer showcased the first compositions of ‚ÄòElectronic Music‚Äô at the Cologne International Festival of Contemporary Music. They utilised a melochord, trautonium, ring modulators, octave and radio filters and tape recorders. In 1955, Eimert and Stockhausen edited the first volume, Elektronische Musique, and articles on electronic music, Texte I and II. Throughout the 1950s, tape music primarily utilised, but this quickly developed into electronic amplification instead of magnetic recordings by the 1960s. = Late 1960s, 70s = From 1967 to 1976, German artists experimented and drove the frontier of electronic music. Despite being isolated and largely working independently, they were driven by a common principle of seceding away from American and British rock, pop, and soul archetypes as well as embracing absolute political and emotional self-expression through electronically manipulated sounds. Amon D√º√ºl, Tangerine Dream and Guru Guru were three pivotal German bands at the avant-garde of electronic music. Amon D√º√ºl‚Äôs albums, including Psychedelic Underground (1969), Collapsing Singv√∂gel R√ºckw√§rts & Co (1969), Phallus Dei (1969), Yeti (1970) and Tanz Der Lemminge (1971), showcased anarchic fusions of rock with psychedelic, electronic and even folk sounds. Tangerine Dream‚Äôs experimentation with trance electronic music formulated their famous ‚Äòclassic‚Äô synth-trio phase with their 1974 hit Phaedra. NEU!‚Äôs fusion of rock and electronica with repetitive ‚Äòmotorik‚Äô beats and Harmonica‚Äôs seemingly randomly-generated amalgamation of guitar, electronic and synth-pop emerged in the early 70s. Arguably most significantly however was the prominence of Kraftwerk electronic group. Following the use of Echoplex flute eddites and primitive electronica in their albums, Kraftwerk (1970), Kraftwerk 2 (1972) and Ralf Und Florian (1973), their 1974 hit, Autobahn, drove German electronic music to worldwide prominence, reaching the Top 30 in the US and Top 10 in Britain. Similarly, Can, originating from Cologne in 1968, derived rhythmic bases similarly to James Brown‚Äôs funk and strange electronic mixing to drive post-rock electronic musicality. = 1980s, 90s = Throughout the 1980s, German electronic music evolved into techno, drawing from Detroit, Chicago and Frankfurt influences. In the mid 1980s as Gorbachev, leader of USSR, implemented open-minded policies of perestroika and glasnost, East Berlin churches began to be used as alternative venues for concerts. For example, West German punk band, Die Toten Hosen, performed illegally in 1983 and 1988 in East Berlin churches. In July 1989 the first Love Parade festival was held, a celebration of electronic music. With the fall of the Berlin wall in 1991, illegal parties of techno and dance music thrived in abandoned areas along where the wall had been. This quickly transformed Berlin into a techno capital where budding and prominent DJs, artists and youth congregated from Germany and internationally, cementing nightlife culture of raves and dance. = 21st Century = Love Parade in Dortmund, 2008 With the onset of globalisation, German, French and American musical influences contributed into developing a world-wide popularity for EDM, a broad term covering musical genres stemming from electroclash to techno. Germany‚Äôs electronic music contributed to this global transition of electronic music from underground art to an international phenomenon, with festivals such as Love Parade, Winterworld and MayDay gaining prominence alongside raves and clubs. German electro artists and DJs continue to gain mass popularity, including Zedd, Robin Schulz, Paul van Dyk and Crazy Frog. Paul van Dyke, raised in East Germany, was majorly involved in the Berlin techno scene and is considered one of the best DJs internationally. In 2018, the New York Times described Berlin as \\"arguably the world capital of underground electronic music\\". Styles Originating in Germany Electroclash is a style of music fusing 1980s electro and new wave synthpop with 1990s techno and electronic dance alongside elements of funk and punk. Also known as retro electro, tech pop and synthcore, electroclash primarily utilised keyboards, groove boxes, turntables and computers to produce grooving minimal tracks. More than the music, electroclash encompassed a musical culture of confident presentation: individualistic personalities and sexual freedom. Emerging in the later 1990s, with Berlin becoming an international hotspot, electroclash faded as a distinctive style as it fused into tech house music. Trance is a form of electronic dance music, characterised by a high rate of beats per minute (120-160), melodic progressive synths and repetitive rhythms. Typical song structure involves mixed layers developing into a build-up, a climax and then a release. Originating in the early 1990s, German minimalist artists, Klaus Schluze and Sven Vath, are often acknowledged as the fathers of trance music. Schranz is a style of fast and loopy techno electronic music characterised by harsh abrasive machine-like sounds. Emerging in the 1990s, Chris Liebing was at the helm of its development. Krautrock is a distinct style of progressive rock and electronic music emerging from Germany in the 1960s and 70s. Reacting against commercial and mainstream Anglo-American rock, Krautrock was cemented in a cultural foundation of taking control of their collective destiny away from the memory of Nazi dictatorship. Bands, Faust, Guru Guru, Can and Neu!, parodied traditional rock tropes and experimented with electronic collages, tape manipulations, monotonous rhythms and mystical atmospheres to create avant-garde music. Krautrock enjoyed significant popularity in 1973 as bands including Krafterwerk and Amon Duul II toured outside Germany. Other styles related to German electronic music include Digital Hardcore, Minimal, Berlin School of electronic music and D√ºsseldorf School of electronic music.  Cultural Significance  Berlin Wall (June 1989) The underground subculture of German electronic music is argued to be where the first social reunification took place. Dance entrepreneurs in Sch√∂neberg and Kreuzberg organised ‚ÄòHouse‚Äô parties, with DJ Westbam and Dr. Motte putting on acid house in the club ‚ÄòUFO‚Äô and co-founding the electronic festival, Love Parade, in 1989. Following the fall of the Berlin wall and the ensuing transitory period of legal uncertainty, growth in the network of illegal techno parties in the East exploded. From unused factories, derelict bunkers, empty sections adjacent to the Wall‚Äôs remains, youth fused with techno music to form what is argued the first form of social reunification in Germany. These basement places, like Tekknozid and UFO, developed into legendary clubs, including Tresor and E-Werk. Without a curfew, Berlin‚Äôs clubs and bars did not close. Queer culture thrived at venues like Metropol and tourists from Europe and internationally flew in, known as ‚ÄòEasy Jet ravers‚Äô, to participate in Berlin‚Äôs explosive rave culture of techno, drugs, fashion and excess. Furthermore, German electronic music contributed into the 21st century‚Äôs globalised trend of electronic dance music and fusion into modern pop. In the 1990s, increasing commercialisation and the unifying tendencies of globalisation and local ‚Äòislands‚Äô of cultural creativity, of which Berlin was key, helped form the explosive popularity of modern popular electronic music. German electronic music contributed to a global transition of electronic music from underground art to an international phenomenon, with festivals such as Love Parade, Winterworld and MayDay gaining prominence alongside raves and clubs.  German Electronic Artists  Funker Vogt is a German electronic- industrial musical group founded in 1995 with an aggressive style. Their debut album was Thanks for Nothing (1996). Wumpscut is a German Dark electro- industrial group. Formed by Rudy Ratzinger in 1991, they debuted with their album Defcon and remained active until 2017. Wolfsheim, 1992 Project Pitchfork was a Hamburg-based German Dark Wave electronic artist, inspired by New Wave artists, pop-oriented groups like SPK, and the New Wave movement of arts including Jean Michael Jean and Vangelis. They debuted with their album K.N.K.A in 1990. Wolfsheim was a German synthpop and darkwave band formed in 1987 in Hamburg, consisting of Heppner and Reinhardt, who split up in 2009 due to personal reasons. Their first album, Ken Manage, was released in 1988. Kraftwerk was a highly influential electronic pop quartet who formed the foundations for synthesiser music in the 70s and 80s. Achieving international commercial fame and success, their songs, ‚ÄòThe Autobahn‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Model‚Äô, retains a niche cultural following even today.  Festivals & Events  Love Parade was central to international electronic music throughout the 1990s and 2000s. First organised in 1989, it involved vans playing techno music for 300 fans. However, after achieving corporate sponsorship and MTV Europe coverage, by 1997 it had 750,000-1,500,000 attendees. Love Parade came to an end in 2010 following a stampede that killed 21 and injured more than 500 people. WinterWorld is an electronic music festival held in Karlsruhe, Germany. Into its 17th year, WinterWorld plays techno, house, drum and base, and EDM, featuring famous electronic artists such as Chris Liebing, Pendulum and Charlotte De Witte. MayDay is another famed electronic music festival in Germany. Debuting on 1991, electronic artists such as Amelie Lens and Claptone are scheduled to play in 2021.

Biography Abbey was born in Seattle, Washington in 1932 to Sam and Brenta Abbey. His father was born in London but had emigrated to Canada, returning to Europe to serve in the First World War. After being injured in France, Sam returned to London to recuperate where he met Bridget, later changing her name to Brenta, who had moved to the capital from the village of Laugharne in Wales. Sam and Bridget married and their first child, a boy, was born in Wales before the couple moved to Canada before settling in Seattle. Abbey attended Lincoln High School there. He received his bachelor's degree in general science from the United States Naval Academy in (Annapolis, Maryland) in 1954; and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in 1959. A pilot in the U.S. Air Force, Abbey had more than 4,000 hours in various types of aircraft before being detailed to NASA. While in the Air Force, he served in the Air Force Research and Development Command and was involved in the early Air Force manned space activities, including the Dyna- Soar Program. Abbey joined NASA in 1964 as an Air Force captain assigned to the Apollo program. In December 1967 he left the Air Force and was named technical assistant to the Johnson Space Center director. In January 1976, he was named director of flight operations, where he was responsible for operational planning and for the overall direction and management of flight crew and flight control activities for all human spaceflight missions. In 1983, he became director of the Flight Crew Operations Directorate, where he continued to be responsible for all space shuttle flight crews and JSC aircraft operations. Abbey would select the crews that flew during the early years of the space shuttle. As director of flight operations, he put America‚Äôs first woman in space when he assigned Sally Ride to the crew of 1983‚Ä≤s STS-7. Abbey was appointed deputy associate administrator for space flight at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. in March 1988. In July 1990, he was selected as deputy for operations and senior NASA representative to the Synthesis Group, charged with defining strategies for returning to the Moon and landing on Mars. In July 1991, Abbey was appointed senior director for civil space policy for the National Space Council in the Executive Office of the President. President George H. W. Bush reestablished, by executive order, the National Space Council, led by Vice President Dan Quayle. Part of its job was to find a direction for America‚Äôs space initiatives in a time when the nation would no longer be engaged in a technology race with the Soviet Union. The Council began to see several unique opportunities for engaging the former Soviet Union in a space station program. In 1992, he was named special assistant to the NASA administrator. In 1994 Abbey was named deputy director of the Johnson Space Center and was subsequently selected as the JSC director in 1996. As director of Johnson Space Center until 2001, he served as an integral part of the NASA Shuttle-Mir Program and provided crucial oversight, management, and guidance in the first phase of the International Space Station. Abbey was opposed to the proposed Space Station Freedom because of the large cost and impracticality of the station. A small team of administrators and scientists including Abbey, John Young, Thomas P. Stafford and Max Faget were called to devise a cheaper alternative to Freedom. This team proposed a new modular space station in April 1993. He helped later enlist partner nations to share the adventure ‚Äî and the costs ‚Äî of implementing those plans for a permanent outpost in Earth orbit. Honors In 2002, Abbey was selected as a distinguished alumnus of the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology. His honors and awards include the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, three NASA Distinguished Service Medals and the 1970 Presidential Medal of Freedom, presented by President Richard M. Nixon for his distinguished civilian service in peacetime. In addition, he was the recipient of the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement's National Space Trophy in 1997. In 1998 he was awarded the Robert R. Gilruth Award in recognition of his accomplishments and dedication to human spaceflight. In 2007 a special category was included for the Sir Arthur Clarke Award which was presented by and named after Abbey.

The book has gained extra significance as many readers find it similar to the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, as the first book of that series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997, three years after this book was published. (They both mention a platform on Kings Cross Station, in London, that leads to a different world.) As journalist Amanda Craig has written, \\"Ibbotson would seem to have at least as good a case for claiming plagiarism as the American author currently suing J. K. Rowling, but unlike her, Ibbotson says she would 'like to shake her by the hand. I think we all borrow from each other as writers.'\\" Summary Platform 13 of King's Cross Station in London has been closed for years. Changes to the platform always result in failure for mysterious reasons. The reason is that the platform hides a gump, described as an \\"opening that opens once every nine years for nine days\\". The gump leads to the Island, a wonderful mythical paradise filled with both normal and magical creatures such as giants, mermaids, water nymphs, wizards, witches, hags and merrows, people who married mermaids/mermen. Shortly before the gump opens, the Queen gives birth to a baby boy. The three nurses for the baby Prince are overcome with their homesickness for the land where they grew up and wish to visit London when the gump reopens. They are given permission to do so and bring the Prince with them. On the ninth day, however, the three nurses go to a fish and chip shop but decide not to take the baby inside. Instead, one of the nurses sits outside with the baby while her two sisters buy fish and chips for three. In the garage nearby a woman called Mrs. Trottle, who is desperate for a child, is sitting in her car. Lily the nurse falls asleep on the bench and Mrs. Trottle steals the baby prince and drives away with the baby, having placed a china doll in the place of the prince. Nanny Brown, who was Mrs. Trottle's nurse as a child, is horrified by the kidnapping. Mrs. Trottle threatens to call the police if Nanny dares to tell anyone and decides to name the baby \\"Raymond\\". She goes away to Switzerland for a year and pretends she has had the baby there. She is a preposterously rich woman who does not work; she claims her husband's income is five hundred thousand pounds a year. Back in the tunnel, the three nurses only discover that the prince is gone when it is too late and the gump has closed again. The King and Queen are heartbroken and for the next nine years the Island is in deepest mourning. To rescue the prince, the king and queen organise a group who will venture into London the next time the gump opens. The group consists of a giant, Hans (who was made invisible so he wouldn't stand out), a \\"slightly batty\\" fey, Gurkintrude, a wizard, Cornelius, better known as Cor, and a young hag named Odge, who joined because she was the same age as the prince would be and felt a sense of kinship to him as a result. She also brought a present. Odge is a young hag who feels she is a disappointment to her parents and therefore wants to do something big in life to make up for it. Her sisters are all impressive have who have stripy feet, fingernails so long they can dig the garden with them, black hairs like piano wires coming out of their ears, and blue teeth. Odge is the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, which is supposed to be special, but when Odge was born she is almost a perfectly ordinary person. Disappointed, Odge's mother did not name her any fearsome name, but Odge, because it rhymes with Splodge, (after Odge's aunt said she looked like \\"a small pink splodge\\") and hoped that Odge would improve as she got older. Odge does have a one blue tooth, but it is a molar and right at the back of her mouth, and she has a very, very small bump on one foot which she thought was an extra toe for a while, but wasn't. Odge feels that her parents, especially her mother, can never get over just how different Odge is from all her sisters, especially her oldest sister, Fredegonda, who is the fiercest and hairiest of all her sisters. When the gump opens, the rescuers are directed to the Trottle house by the ghosts that live in Platform 13. There they see Raymond Trottle, who has grown up to be fat, lazy, and very spoiled. He seems to rely on his telly, his computer games and his remote control cars. They also meet the household servant, a boy named Ben who was raised by Nanny Brown. Ben is the exact opposite of Raymond and immediately feels comfortable with the group and befriends Odge. The group begins to observe Raymond and after some time arranges for him to meet them in the park where they arrange for various magical creatures to perform a show for him. Though Raymond is unimpressed by the magical performance, he is delighted to discover that he is really a prince and agrees to return to the Island. Odge tries to convince Ben to come to the Island as well, but he refuses as Nanny is very ill and in the hospital. Raymond mysteriously vanishes the next day however, and the group discovers that he told Mrs. Trottle of the plan. Believing that strangers intended to kidnap her child, she took him into hiding at a fancy hotel with several bodyguards. The group hatch a plan to take Raymond back, but everything falls apart when Ben is knocked out and nearly killed by one of the bodyguards. Given the choice of taking Raymond or rescuing Ben, the group chooses to save Ben. Raymond is abducted later by a swarm of harpies that the king and queen send and is successfully brought to the Island. Meanwhile, Nanny Brown has died and left behind a letter, in which she reveals Ben's true identity as the stolen baby, with Raymond actually having been born to Mrs. Trottle in Switzerland. Ben arrives through the gump with Odge shortly after Raymond and is instantly recognized by his parents and hailed as a prince. Raymond is hastily sent back through the gump and returned home.

The Wey and Arun Canal passes to the East and South of the village. This Civil Parish is at the centre of an excellent network of bridleways and footpaths crossing the Low Weald and joining with those in adjacent Counties. Overview The 2001 census recorded a population of 1341 people living in 660 households. 536 people were economically active. Between that census and 2011 approximately 55 more dwellings have been built, probably adding net more than 100 people. At March 1, 2011 the electoral register showed 1200 electors. The 2011 Census gave a population of 1,480. A considerable number of the economically active residents of Loxwood are self-employed. Most people who commute regularly to a principal place of work do so to the Gatwick Diamond area (loosely an area between Redhill in the north and Crawley to the south), to Horsham, to Guildford or Woking, or to London, and tele-commuting is growing in popularity. There is a primary school, village hall, with outdoor children's playing facilities, a sports centre, an Anglican church, a Chapel, two pubs The Onslow Arms and the \\"Sir Roger Tichborne\\" at Alfold Bars, a small number of shops with a sub-Post Office in the Loxwood Village Stores, John Murray and Son's, an award-winning butcher, game dealer and supplier of cheeses, cooked meats and other delicacies about a butcher's cold and cutting room supplying local pubs and restaurants and clubs, Forget-Me-Not - a florist and gift shop, Just Hair - a hairdressing business, Kennard's garage in Loxwood village, and a small car showroom and workshop at Alfold Bars. Additionally Loxwood has an NHS medical practice with some 4 GPs, several practice Nurses, a Dispensary (rural practices), and a visiting Physiotherapist all supported by an active \\"Friends of Loxwood Medical Practice\\". Two further physiotherapist services are available in Loxwood, one based at the Loxwood Sports Association, the other on private premises. The village was once one of the settlements greatly influenced by a small Christian sect, the Society of Dependants, also known as Cokelers who left London in the mid-1800s. They built their first chapel in the village. The sect evolved to run a Combination Store in the village, the building for which houses villages shops today. Lawrence Durrell, author of The Alexandria Quartet, lived here from 1933 to 1934, in a cottage called Chestnut Mead.Amateurs in Eden, Joanna Hodgkin, Virago 2012 Durrell, along with his first wife Nancy and another young couple, George and Pam Wilkinson, left Fitzrovia to live in the English countryside. It was here that Durrell, then in his early twenties, wrote what became his first published novel, Pied Piper of Lovers.MacNiven, Ian, Lawrence Durrell, A Biography (Faber & Faber 1998), Pudding Island chapter Schools Loxwood Primary School was reported to have 155 children on the school roll in 2001. Typically 30% to 50% of these children are not from Loxwood itself, but from surrounding villages; this has been attributed to the closing of smaller adjacent, village schools. A \\"pre- School\\" is adjacent to the school, supported financially and in other ways by a Parents group who have run a Beer Festival for several years. Sport and leisure Loxwood has a Non-League football club Loxwood F.C. who play at the recreation ground on Plaistow Road, and have been playing since 1920.

Upon Peirce's arrival at Johns Hopkins University in 1879, he founded a new Metaphysical Club there. The name of the club was chosen \\"half-ironically, half-defiantly,\\" according to Peirce, as the group rejected the radical foundationalist European metaphysics in favor of a moderate foundationalism, pursued critical thinking of a pragmatist and positivist nature.Menand, Louis. The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America (2001), New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, (hardcover), (paperback) p. 226, 274. In fact, it was within these philosophical discussions that pragmatism is said to have been born.Peirce, C. S. (1929), \\"The Founding of Pragmatism\\", The Hound and Horn: A Harvard Miscellany v. II, n. 3, April‚ÄìJune, pp. 282‚Äì5 (see 283‚Äì4).

Other members of the club included Chauncey Wright, John Fiske, Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Nicholas St. John Green, and Joseph Bangs Warner.Menand (2001), p. 201. The Metaphysical Club is never mentioned by any person within the club other than Peirce. The only other known person to have mentioned the club was Henry James, the great novelist and brother of William James. Louis Menand's The Metaphysical Club The Metaphysical Club is a 2002 Pulitzer-Prize-winning book by Louis Menand about Holmes, James, and Peirce. While it ventures into many different directions, covering topics in American history, notable pioneers of American higher education and philosophy, it mainly concerns the erosion of metaphysics and its eventual replacement by pragmatism as a dominant force in shaping American philosophy and its conception of ideas. The title of the book stems from the club formed by Holmes, James and Peirce. It was founded and dissolved in 1872, and has no direct connection with the New Thought movement. The book is split up into five sections. Four of those sections are biographical sketches of Holmes, James, Peirce, and John Dewey (although Dewey was not a part of the club, he is considered one of the central American pragmatists). Within these sketches, Menand also discusses various other thinkers including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Chauncey Wright, Louis Agassiz, and others.

The AM (10,000 watts at 850 kHz) and FM (35,000 watts at 96.1 MHz) radio stations were sold to an independent broadcaster, Ted Oberfelter, who changed the call letters to WKIX and WKIX-FM to avoid the association with the newspaper. =WKIX, Channel 85= In 1958, Hugh Holder, a former CBS announcer, bought the radio stations. Holder changed the format from easy listening to top 40 , serving the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill market. Known as \\"WKIX, Channel 85\\", \\"The Giant of the South\\", and \\"The Mighty 850\\", the station was one of the most successful popular music outlets in the US from the late 1950s through the 1970s. It was home to many well-known personalities in North Carolina radio including Tom Scott, Jack Kane, Rich Reim, Mike Reineri (later at WJJD, Chicago), Bob DeBardelaben (later at WRAL-TV), Al Smith, Tommy Woods, Bob Kelly, Bob Jones, Mark Starr, Steve Roddy, the legendary Jimmy Capps (with his syndicated late-night show, \\"Our Best to You\\"); Dale Van Horn, Pat Patterson, Ron McKay, Mike Mitchell, Mark Mitchell, Bob Bolton, James K.

Chief Engineer, Larry Gardner (who later became CE of WCKY in Cincinnati) was responsible for many technical innovations that provided the distinctive WKIX sound. Following the Holder years, WKIX and WKIX-FM were owned by Belk Broadcasting, Southern Broadcasting, and Mann Media. Previously, the FM signal had mostly duplicated WKIX's programming, getting a boost from the rising popularity of FM and also providing improved full-time coverage of the entire Raleigh-Durham market. As FM became more dominant, the WKIX-FM call sign was changed to WYYD, power was increased to 100,000 watts, and the station was programmed separately as easy- listening. In the 1970s, the station had a strong news department, with such icons as: Bill Leslie (now at WRAL-TV and is also an accomplished musician), Mike Blackmon (who went on to WPTF), Scott White, Steven Reid, Max Powell, Edward Faircloth, Raymond Caulder, Bill McQuage; Joe Goodpasture, John Tesh (who went on to co-host Entertainment Tonight and now writes and produces music), Steve Shumake, J.

When ESPN insisted that The Buzz carry its shows instead of local programming, The Buzz changed to Fox Sports Radio effective August 1, 2005.Lorenzo Perez, \\"'The Buzz' Ditches ESPN,\\" The News & Observer, August 3, 2005. Unlike sister station WDNC which relied more on network programming from ESPN, WRBZ's lineup consisted almost entirely of locally produced sports talk local programming from morning hosts Adam Gold, Joe Ovies and Tony Rigsbee; David Glenn; and Morgan Patrick (the Sports Pig). Jim Rome's weekday afternoon show and network programming from Fox Sports Radio on weekend afternoons and daily overnights rounded out the lineup. Sunday mornings [1993-2008] the station aired another local show, Computers 2K Now w/ Amnon Nissan. Until October 2008, WRBZ aired The Herd with Colin Cowherd, from ESPN; both WDNC and WRBZ dropped ESPN programming because the network wanted a stronger commitment than McClatchey was willing to provide.Roger Van Der Horst, \\"Imus Returning to Triangle Radio,\\" The News & Observer, October 15, 2008. The Don Imus morning show aired on WRBZ from the time the station switched to sports until the Rutgers University controversy that caused CBS to drop his show.Danny Hooley, \\"Buzz Fills Imus Slot,\\" The News & Observer, May 15, 2007. Don Curtis of Curtis Media had planned to buy WRBZ from Alchemy Communications early in 2005 but was prevented by FCC rules from owning any more stations. His son-in-law Billy McClatchey bought the station instead.David Ranii, \\"Radio Station Still Being Sold, but to Someone Else,\\" The News & Observer, Tuesday, January 11, 2005. WRBZ celebrated 10 years in the sports radio format on April 10, 2008, with a special guest hosting appearance by The Fabulous Sports Babe, who has largely been in retirement since 2001. On August 10, 2009, Curtis Media Group announced an intent to purchase WRBZ from McClatchey Broadcasting, with plans to convert the sports-talk station to a music format. Gold and Ovies moved to former sister station WDNC to host a local morning program, while David Glenn hosts an afternoon show on WCMC-FM. WRBZ was the second flagship station of the Carolina Hurricanes. When the team moved there from Hartford, Connecticut, in 1997, WPTF was the first flagship station. WRBZ later carried Duke University football and basketball games, Carolina Panthers football games, select East Carolina University football games, the Roy Williams and Butch Davis shows, and several other seasonal play by play games. =Oldies and WPTF brand extension= Early in 2010, WRBZ switched to oldies from the late 1950s and the '60s, with a few '70s songs. The playlist started with 3,000 songs but was expected to be reduced. The target audience was 55 to 70. The station reclaimed its former WKIX callsign soon afterward. WKIX had a very broad-based playlist incorporating some adult standards and classic country material into an oldies playlist spanning the early 1950s to early 1980s. WKIX ended its oldies format (except for some weekend programming) on March 13, 2012 and reverted to a talk format, branded as TalkRadio 850 WPTF. The brand extension reflected its status as a complement to sister station WPTF's increased emphasis on news programming. The station's call letters were changed to WPTK on March 16. Much of WPTK's programming moved from WPTF and WZTK (the latter of which changed format); some programming was shared with Piedmont Triad sister station WSJS. On June 8, 2012, WBT in Charlotte announced that Brad Krantz and Britt Whitmire would be taking over the afternoon slot; their show moved from WZTK to WPTK and WSJS and would end June 19. On August 27, 2015, WPTK changed their format from talk to oldies under the moniker \\"Just Right Radio\\". The format focuses on a wider variety of songs from the 1960s through the '80s, with evenings devoted to love songs and ballads. The station also began broadcasting on FM translators W284CD 104.7 FM Youngsville and W284CP 104.7 FM Raleigh. In addition, the station moved its broadcasts of ECU football and coaches show to sister station WFNL. On March 10, 2020 WPTK applied to the FCC for a construction permit to move its transmitter site to their sister station‚Äôs tower (WPTF) and lower their station class from B to D, due to the move.

Life  Fortner was born in Leipzig. From his parents ‚Äì both singers ‚Äì Fortner very early on had intense contact with music. In 1927 he began his studies at the Leipzig Conservatory (organ with Karl Straube, composition with Hermann Graubner) and at University, (philosophy with Hans Driesch, musicology with Theodor Kroyer, and German studies with Hermann August Korff) . While still a student, two of his early compositions were publicly performed: Die vier marianischen Antiphonen at the Lower Rhineland Festival in D√ºsseldorf in 1928, and his First String Quartet in K√∂nigsberg in 1930 . In 1931 he completed his studies with the State Exam for a high teaching office, after he accepted a lectureship in music theory at the Hochschule f√ºr Kirchenmusik Heidelberg. There his music was attacked as Cultural Bolshevism. In 1935 and 1936 Fortner created the Heidelberg Chamber Orchestra with which he supported New Music and undertook expanded concert journeys for \\"armed forces support\\", from Scandinavia to the Netherlands to Greece. In the same year he also took over the directorship of the orchestra of the Hitler Youth of Heidelberg, a string orchestra, formed from juvenile laymen, whose directorship changed in 1939 again. 1940 he was drafted into the army as a medical soldier. After the end of the war, Fortner underwent Denazification due to the Bandwagon effect and was found not affected by professional disqualification. Fortner moved to the Heidelberg Kohlhof and there a group of very young students formed around him, who showed interest in the modern music of 1933. In 1946 he joined the circle of the Darmstadt Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik, and taught within that framework. In 1954 he became a professor for composition at the North-West German Music Academy in Detmold, then from 1957 up to his retirement in 1973 taught in Freiburg. After the death of Karl Amadeus Hartmann, in 1964 he took up the leadership of the Musica Viva concerts, which he directed until 1978 . Together with eleven other composer-friends (Conrad Beck, Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Alberto Ginastera, Crist√≥bal Halffter, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Klaus Huber, and Witold Lutos≈Çawski), he was asked by Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Swiss composer and art patron Paul Sacher, to write a composition for cello solo using the notes of his name (eS, A, C, H, E, Re). Wolfgang Fortner created the theme and three variations Zum spielen f√ºr den 70. Geburtstag, Thema und Variationen f√ºr Violoncello Solo. These compositions were partially presented in Zurich on 2 May 1976. Wolfgang Fortner died in Heidelberg in 1987, aged 79.

Further development was passed on to Westland, who further modified the aircraft to produce the Walrus, with a 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion II engine replacing the Liberty engine of the DH.9A and Tadpole. Like the DH.9A, the Walrus was a single-engined, two-bay biplane. It was fitted with an extra cockpit for the observer/radio operator behind the gunner's cockpit, while the observer also had a prone position for observing in a ventral pannier.

Education Born in Gillingham, Kent, Forster attended South Wilts Grammar School for Girls, Salisbury, and Bedford College, University of London, where she was President of the Union Society and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. She joined Imperial Chemical Industries at Billingham after working for them during a university vacation, but was swiftly moved from the laboratories to management. ICI management In 1960 she was made an assistant to Richard Beeching, the technical director who ran the company's Development Department. She recalled that at one point the Department had the idea of filling a railway carriage with all their latest products and taking it around the country to demonstrate to customers; when Beeching asked where to get such a carriage, she did not know. The next day she heard of Beeching's appointment to the British Transport Commission overlooking British Rail. In the mid-1960s she worked on licensing plastics produced at the ICI plant in Welwyn Garden City. She also served on Hampstead Borough Council as a Conservative from 1962 to 1965. Management consultancy Forster left ICI in 1966, determined to use her experience to read for the Bar and become a patent attorney. To pay her way she worked as a business consultant, but when she secured a particularly big job in January 1968, she found she had no time to continue her studies and became a full-time consultant. By 1970, being self-employed was becoming impractical so she established Industrial Aids Limited as a consultancy business. The business grew rapidly and allowed her to indulge her hobby of yacht racing. European Parliament She became more involved in politics as a member of the Bow Group council. At the 1979 European Parliament election she was elected as Member of the European Parliament for Birmingham South, a marginal constituency which had been expected to go to the Labour Party. Her instinctive support for free trade came under pressure when she saw that only state subsidies would maintain competition involving private companies competing against nationalised steel companies. Airline inquiry In 1981 she married Michael Jones, but retained her maiden name in her political life. She made a study of the operation of Chambers of Commerce in the United Kingdom and other EEC member states, which was published in 1983. That year she was rapporteur on an inquiry into air traffic; her report which recommended a removal of the cartels which set air fares, and a system of rapid resolution of disputes between airlines, was rejected by a majority in the European Parliament which sought to preserve the existing system. Forster was defeated after boundary changes in Birmingham East at the 1984 European Parliament election. She returned to business and became a member of the Council of the Management Consultancies Association. References *The Times, 28 October 1972 *Who Was Who.

Gurler, along with his brother Henry, founded a successful dairy, Gurler Brothers Creamery, where they were regional leaders in the field of milk production. After the brothers split in 1895, Gurler and his son Charles established a large network of creameries in Illinois and Iowa. Gurler served as president of the Illinois State Dairy Association and produced over of butter in his creameries. Biography George Hopkins Gurler was born in Chesterfield, New Hampshire on March 29, 1844. He moved with his family to Keene in 1847 and then to DeKalb, Illinois in 1856. He attended public schools in DeKalb. During the Civil War, Gurler enlisted in the 15th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Upon his return after the war, he worked in his brother's store, Flinn & Gurler. Within a year, he bought out the senior partner. The business became known as Gurler Brothers until Henry B.

Its studios are located in Raleigh, and the transmitter is co-located at the WPTF transmitter site in Cary. WPLW's programming is also carried on two translator stations in Raleigh, W225DF (92.9 FM) and W262CZ (100.3 FM). From mid-November through December, Star 92.9 plays Christmas music for the holiday season. History WLLE (\\"Wonderful Willie\\") played James Brown, Little Richard, The O'Jays, and Earth Wind & Fire, and it could be heard as far away as Walkertown and Wallace-Rose Hill. Its DJs included Oscar \\"Daddy O on the Radio\\" Alexander, Sweet Bob Rogers, Chester ‚ÄúCD‚Äù Davis, J. Willie Moore, Big Bill Haywood, Prince Ike Behind the Mike, Jimmy Johnson of JJ‚Äôs House Party, and Brother James Thomas. Ray \\"Dr. Jocko\\" Henderson, who later became well known in Detroit, was popular with both black and white listeners in the 1960s. He is credited with helping Raleigh get through difficult times during integration of the schools and the death of Martin Luther King Jr. His style came from Douglas \\"Jocko\\" Henderson of Philadelphia and Durham's Dr. Jive of WSRC. WLLE was the first radio station in the state to interview Coretta Scott King and the first black radio station to interview a grand dragon of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Wallace LaCrosse Hankin bought WLLE in 1966.\\"Death Notices\\", News & Observer, December 14, 2002. WLLE became the station for Raleigh's black community, and it was the second most popular AM station. In the early 1990s, \\"Let's Talk\\", hosted by Frank Roberts, aired five nights each week and dealt with the problems of blacks.Billy Warden, \\"Lending a Voice to Black Concerns\\", News & Observer, November 18, 1991.Mark Curnutte, \\"Never a Stranger to Controversy: Frank Roberts Welcomes Hot Topics on His Talk Show\\", News & Observer, August 30, 1992. In 1997, WLLE was purchased by Mortenson Broadcasting of Kentucky, who changed its call letters to WRDT and began airing religious talk.David Menconi, \\"ZZU Gospel Format Right Outta the Can\\", News & Observer, October 27, 1997. Two years later, the station was picked up by Curtis Media and the call letters were changed once again to WDTF, continuing on with the religious talk format and adding inspirational music to the mix. In 2003, the station changed its format to current general talk and call letters to WDNZ to match its one- time simulcast partner, Durham-based WDNC. The station continued to air much of the same programs as WDNC, save for mornings and sports broadcasts featuring the Carolina Mudcats, even though both stations had aired Charlotte Bobcats games briefly. All that changed in late 2005 when WDNC broke off the simulcast to become an all-sports station with an entirely separate staff, LMAed by McClatchey Broadcasting, owners of WRBZ, 850 AM. The general talk format continued on WDNZ after that point, with the calls changing to WDOX in September 2006. The call letters were a reference to its moniker \\"Home of the Docs\\", as it aired programming featuring Dr. Laura Schlessinger and Dr. Joy Browne. In addition, WDOX was also home to local and regional programming such as State Government Radio and Triangle In-Touch. On weekends, the station offered \\"Million Dollar Music\\", featuring musical favorites dating back to the 1950s that were no longer played on most oldies formats. The music segments were hosted by longtime Triangle area radio personalities Pat Patterson and Maury O'Dell. In May 2010, the station changed its call letters to WQDR and its format to classic country to go along with sister station WQDR-FM, which plays contemporary and hit country music. WQDR went off the air beginning April 16, 2011, when its transmitter off South Saunders Street near downtown Raleigh was badly damaged by a tornado. WFNL's logo for its \\"Funny 570\\" format.Following numerous delays in securing a new transmitter site, the station eventually returned to the airwaves on February 22, 2012, transmitting from one of the towers of sister station's WPTF transmitter site in Cary. At that time, the station began to air an all-comedy format under the moniker \\"Funny 570\\", and its call letters were changed to WFNL, which stood for We're Fun 'N' Laughs. The station initially served as the Triangle affiliate for Premiere Radio Networks' 24/7 Comedy radio network, until it was discontinued on August 3, 2014. At that point WFNL switched to the \\"Today's Comedy\\" network feed. Beginning with the 2015 season, WFNL broadcast East Carolina University Pirates football games and the weekly coaches show. The station inherited this package from sister station WPTK, which had recently changed formats. In May 2017, WFNL ended its comedy programming, and began simulcasting full-time the News/Talk programming of co-owned WPTF in Raleigh. On November 15, 2017, the station returned to the call letters WQDR and a classic country format, \\"Just Right Country\\", featuring songs \\"from the sixties to the nineties and beyond\\". On June 4, 2019, WQDR flipped to hot adult contemporary, branded as \\"Star 92.9\\" (in reference to FM translator W225DF that was acquired the previous month, and began simulcasting the new format upon launch). Also timed with the new format, the station took call sign WPLW from its sister hit music station, now WPLW-FM. Star 92.9 is the Triangle affiliate of The Bob and Sheri Show. 57WLLE.net In September 2018, Gary Antwon Williams, a former WLLE employee, started the Internet radio service 57WLLE.net, with soul and R&B; from the 70s, 80s and 90s, recalling the WLLE of the past. Plans call for community affairs programming.

It is located on approximately of land in Hermann Park, at 6000 Hermann Park Drive, Houston, Texas 77030. The theater offers a wide range of professional entertainment, including classical music, jazz, ballet, Shakespeare, musical theater, and classic films, with free performances running from March through November, where the general public can relax in a covered seating area or enjoy a pre-performance picnic on an amphitheatre-style hillside. The theatre building Seating is provided for 1,705 patrons, with 20 wheel-chair spaces, plus an sloping lawn that accommodates about 4,500 more. The theater building itself consists of a 64' x 41' stage; 54 line sets for hanging lights, curtains, and scenery; an orchestra pit which can be raised and lowered; dressing rooms; offices; a full complement of theatrical equipment; and a 110-ton air conditioning system for cooling the performance area. In its 2010 season, the Miller Outdoor Theatre provided entertainment for more than 430,000 people at 141 performances and events. History In 1922, the original theater was designed by William Ward Watkin as an amphitheater surrounded by twenty Corinthian-style limestone columns and built by Tom Tellepsen. The theatre‚Äôs dedication plaque reads: :To the Arts of Music, Poetry, Drama and Oratory, by which the striving spirit of man seeks to interpret the words of god. This theatre of the City of Houston is permanently dedicated. \\"Miller‚Äôs Hill\\" was created in 1948 with dirt from the excavations of Fannin Street. In 1968, the city built a new theatre with bonds approved by public vote. The new theatre building, designed by Eugene Werlin and Associates, won several awards: the American Iron and Steel Institute‚Äôs Biannual Award (1969), the American Institute of Steel Construction‚Äôs Award of Excellence, and the James E. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation Award. The 1968 Miller Theatre building was then refurbished starting in 1996, jointly funded by the city of Houston and Friends of Hermann Park. The roof and siding were replaced, and additional restrooms and office areas were installed. In addition, a small stage was added to the east end of the facility, playing to a newly incorporated open plaza area. The renovations were completed in 1998. Today, the venue is managed by the Houston First Corporation.

Lloyd was a career soldier in Third Grenadier Guards and played for the Third Grenadier Guards football team winning the first of his four footballing medals in the 1896‚Äì97 season when the Guards won the London League championship. Described as \\"dominant in the air in any position\\", he scored frequently with his head. In his second season as a player, he joined Brentford and won the London Senior Cup, scoring twice in the 5‚Äì1 final victory over Ilford. He played for Thames Ironworks during the 1898‚Äì99 season, the club's only season in the Southern League Division Two. This season the management committee for the club agreed to accept professionalism within the club believing professional players would attract a larger crowd and greater revenue. Lloyd was such a player joining 18 new players for the season, the majority of whom were professionals, signed against the anti-professionalism stance of the club's benefactor, Arnold Hills who was preoccupied in dealing with the aftermath of the HMS Albion launching disaster. Lloyd played the first two League games as a full-back, but soon moved into attack and scored a hat-trick on his debut as a centre-forward, against St Albans. Thames Ironworks won the Southern League Division Two, giving Lloyd his third medal. A prolific goal-scorer, he scored six goals in 11 appearances in the Thames and Medway Combination, and 14 goals in 13 appearances in the Southern League, including the Irons' goal in the test match against Sheppey United at the end of the season. In the end, that result didn't matter as Division One was enlarged for the 1899‚Äì1900 season. He ended the 1898-99 season as top scorer for Thames Ironworks, but moved on before the new season. Lloyd joined Fulham in 1899 and in two seasons scored 24 goals in 43 matches. He was their top scorer for the 1899‚Äì1900 season. He managed to fill most positions during his time at the club, even once playing in goal, against Maidenhead in April 1901. Following the outbreak of the Boer War, Lloyd returned to the army in 1900 and saw active service in South Africa. He returned to Fulham for the 1902‚Äì03 season and played as a defender. In November 1902, Lloyd was suspended for 28 days after punching Jimmy Murray during the club's FA Cup game against Watford. He managed 12 goals in 31 appearances in his first season and he again won the Southern League Division Two, his fourth medal. The following season Fulham filled their side with fully professional players. Lloyd continued to play but made just three FA Cup appearances, scoring two goals. In August 1904 he signed for amateur club, Willesden.

First published in 1748, it was at first regarded as a simple identity connecting a finite sum with a finite continued fraction in such a way that the extension to the infinite case was immediately apparent. Today it is more fully appreciated as a useful tool in analytic attacks on the general convergence problem for infinite continued fractions with complex elements.  The original formula  Euler derived the formula as connecting a finite sum of products with a finite continued fraction. : a_0 + a_0a_1 + a_0a_1a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_0a_1a_2\\\\cdots a_n = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{1 + a_1 - \\\\cfrac{a_2}{1 + a_2 - \\\\cfrac{\\\\ddots}{\\\\ddots \\\\cfrac{a_{n-1}}{1 + a_{n-1} - \\\\cfrac{a_n}{1 + a_n}}}}}}\\\\, The identity is easily established by induction on n, and is therefore applicable in the limit: if the expression on the left is extended to represent a convergent infinite series, the expression on the right can also be extended to represent a convergent infinite continued fraction. This is written more compactly using generalized continued fraction notation: : a_0 + a_0 a_1 + a_0 a_1 a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_0 a_1 a_2 \\\\cdots a_n = \\\\frac{a_0}{1 +} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_1}{1 + a_1 +} \\\\, \\\\cfrac{-a_2}{1 + a_2 +} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_n}{1 + a_n}.  Euler's formula  If ri are complex numbers and x is defined by : x = 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty r_1r_2\\\\cdots r_i = 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left( \\\\prod_{j=1}^i r_j \\\\right)\\\\,, then this equality can be proved by induction : x = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 - \\\\cfrac{r_1}{1 + r_1 - \\\\cfrac{r_2}{1 + r_2 - \\\\cfrac{r_3}{1 + r_3 - \\\\ddots}}}}\\\\, . Here equality is to be understood as equivalence, in the sense that the n'th convergent of each continued fraction is equal to the n'th partial sum of the series shown above. So if the series shown is convergent - or uniformly convergent, when the ri's are functions of some complex variable z - then the continued fractions also converge, or converge uniformly. Proof by Induction Theorem: Let n be a natural number. For n+1 complex values a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{n}, : \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\prod_{j=0}^k a_j = \\\\frac{a_0}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_1}{1+a_1+} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_n}{1+a_n} and for n complex values b_1, \\\\ldots, b_{n}, \\\\frac{-b_1}{1+b_1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-b_2}{1+b_2+} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-b_n}{1+b_n} e -1. Proof: We perform a double induction. For n=1, we have : \\\\frac{a_0}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_1}{1+a_1} = \\\\frac{a_0}{1+\\\\frac{-a_1}{1+a_1}} = \\\\frac{a_0(1+a_1)}{1} = a_0 + a_0 a_1 = \\\\sum_{k=0}^1 \\\\prod_{j=0}^k a_j and : \\\\frac{-b_1}{1+b_1} e -1. Now suppose both statements are true for some n \\\\ge 1. We have \\\\frac{-b_1}{1+b_1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-b_2}{1+b_2+} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-b_{n+1}}{1+b_{n+1}} = \\\\frac{-b_1}{1+b_1+x} where x = \\\\frac{-b_2}{1+b_2+} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-b_{n+1}}{1+b_{n+1}} e -1 by applying the induction hypothesis to b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{n+1}. But \\\\frac{-b_1}{1+b_1+x} = -1 implies b_1 = 1+b_1+x implies x = -1, contradiction. Hence :\\\\frac{-b_1}{1+b_1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-b_2}{1+b_2+} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-b_{n+1}}{1+b_{n+1}} e -1, completing that induction. Note that for x e -1, : \\\\frac{1}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a}{1+a+x} = \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac{a}{1+a+x}} = \\\\frac{1+a+x}{1+x} = 1 + \\\\frac{a}{1+x}; if x=-1-a, then both sides are zero. Using a=a_1 and x = \\\\frac{-a_2}{1+a_2+} \\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_{n+1}}{1+a_{n+1}} e -1, and applying the induction hypothesis to the values a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{n+1}, : \\\\begin{align} a_0 + & a_0a_1 + a_0a_1a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_0a_1a_2a_3 \\\\cdots a_{n+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a_0 + a_0(a_1 + a_1a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_1a_2a_3 \\\\cdots a_{n+1}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a_0 + a_0 \\\\big( \\\\frac{a_1}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_2}{1+a_2+} \\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_{n+1}}{1+a_{n+1}} \\\\big)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a_0 \\\\big(1 + \\\\frac{a_1}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_2}{1+a_2+} \\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_{n+1}}{1+a_{n+1}} \\\\big)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a_0 \\\\big(\\\\frac{1}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_1}{1+a_1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_2}{1+a_2+} \\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_{n+1}}{1+a_{n+1}} \\\\big)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{a_0}{1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_1}{1+a_1+} \\\\, \\\\frac{-a_2}{1+a_2+} \\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\frac{-a_{n+1}}{1+a_{n+1}}, \\\\end{align} completing the other induction. As an example, the expression a_0 + a_0a_1 + a_0a_1a_2 + a_0a_1a_2a_3 can be rearranged into a continued fraction. : \\\\begin{align} a_0 + a_0a_1 + a_0a_1a_2 + a_0a_1a_2a_3 & = a_0(a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{\\\\cfrac{1}{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{\\\\cfrac{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1}{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1} - \\\\cfrac{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1)}{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1}} = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1)}{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{\\\\cfrac{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1) + 1}{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1}}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{\\\\cfrac{a_1(a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1)}{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1} + \\\\cfrac{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1}{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1} - \\\\cfrac{a_2(a_3 + 1)}{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1}}} = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{1 + a_1 - \\\\cfrac{a_2(a_3 + 1)}{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1}}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{1 + a_1 - \\\\cfrac{a_2}{\\\\cfrac{a_2(a_3 + 1) + 1}{a_3 + 1}}}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{1 + a_1 - \\\\cfrac{a_2}{\\\\cfrac{a_2(a_3 + 1)}{a_3 + 1} + \\\\cfrac{a_3 + 1}{a_3 + 1} - \\\\cfrac{a_3}{a_3 + 1}}}} = \\\\cfrac{a_0}{1 - \\\\cfrac{a_1}{1 + a_1 - \\\\cfrac{a_2}{1 + a_2 - \\\\cfrac{a_3}{1 + a_3}}}} \\\\end{align} This can be applied to a sequence of any length, and will therefore also apply in the infinite case.

He was born Roch-Louis de Saint-Ours in the town of Quebec in 1753. He became a major in the militia in 1774 and took part in the defence of Fort St John's (later Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) against the Americans. He was taken prisoner, returned to Quebec in 1777 and became a lieutenant in the Canadian volunteers. He was named aide-de-camp to Governor Sir Guy Carleton and also served as aide-de-camp for Prince William Henry, who later became William IV, during his visit to the province in 1787. In 1792, he inherited parts of the seigneuries of Saint-Ours, L'Assomption, and Deschaillons; he eventually acquired all of the seigneury of Saint-Ours. Around 1792, he married Josette Murray, whose great-uncle was former governor James Murray. He became a captain in the regular army in 1795, later retiring on half pay. Saint-Ours was named to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada in 1808 and remained a member until his death. He served as colonel in the militia during the War of 1812. He died at Saint-Ours in 1834. His brother Paul-Roch also served as a member of the legislative council. His daughter Josette married Pierre-Dominique Debartzch, who later served on the legislative council. His son Fran√ßois-Roch became a member of the legislative assembly. His niece Josephte-Catherine married Jacques Dorion, a doctor and later a member of the assembly.

The theme was written by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, and has since been arranged and performed several times by artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Holly Gornik, and Brynjar Hoff, among others. The theme has been called \\"unforgettable\\" and a \\"celebrated oboe melody\\". Vocalist Sarah Brightman convinced Morricone to allow her to set lyrics to the theme to create her own song, \\"Nella Fantasia\\". In 2010, Morricone encouraged soprano Hayley Westenra to write English lyrics for \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" in her album Paradiso. Film soundtrack The soundtrack for the film was very well received amongst critics, being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and earning Morricone the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. In the film, the theme is most prominently used when the protagonist, the Jesuit Father Gabriel, walks up to a waterfall and starts playing his oboe, aiming to befriend the natives with his music so he can carry his missionary work in the New World. The Guaran√≠ tribesmen, who have been stalking him from a distance, approach Gabriel for the first time, puzzled by the sounds of the unknown instrument. The chief of the tribe, however, is displeased by this, and breaks Gabriel's oboe. This marks the beginning of the relationship between Father Gabriel and the Guaran√≠ natives. Several orchestras have performed \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\", often under the direction of Morricone himself. The most famous renditions of the piece, other than in the movie, are probably those found in the Morricone Conducts Morricone series of concerts during the mid-2000s. SATB choral arrangement Extending the simple lyrics of the Christmas carol adaptation of Christina Rossetti's poem \\"Love Came Down at Christmas\\", Tom Fettke's SATB (soprano-alto-tenor-bass) arrangement incorporates Morricone's wind treatment as the voice of the eponymous Archangel in his piece titled The Annunciation.

Its common names include four- spotted moth and field bindweed moth. It is the only member of the genus Tyta, which forms a hitherto monotypic tribe Tytini in the Catocalinae subfamily. The species was first described by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schifferm√ºller in 1775. The genus was erected by Gustaf Johan Billberg in 1820 and the tribe was described by Herbert Beck in 1996. Caterpillar This moth is native to much of the Palearctic - most of Europe east to the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and from Siberia to China and south to North Africa. The adult moth is about eleven millimeters long and dark brown with one large white spot on each of its four wings. Technical description and variation Its forewings are purplish fuscous, becoming paler, and more brownish, towards the termen, and sometimes at the extreme base; the lines black, fine; the inner oblique, thrice waved; the outer excurved above middle, incurved below; subterminal line pale, preceded by a darker shade; fringe white with a dark patch below middle; an abbreviated white band from costa to vein 3 beyond cell, sometimes tinged with tannish peach; hindwing with a white median band of varying width; in ab. angustifascia ab. nov. this band is greatly restricted and sometimes interrupted; the examples in which the white costal blotch of forewing is tinged with flesh colour constitute the ab. ochracea Tutt. The larva are grey, sometimes reddish grey and darker at the sides; hues pale with dark edges somewhat interrupted; spiracular line dark brown, pale edge; beneath; subspiracular reddish brown; face ochreous grey with rows of small dark dots. The first two pairs of prolegs are shorter than usual.Warren. W. in Seitz, A. Ed., 1914 Die Gro√üschmetterlinge der Erde, Verlag Alfred Kernen, Stuttgart Band 3: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen eulenartigen Nachtfalter, 1914 Biology Two adult generations emerge each year, one in late spring and one in summer. In warm areas there is often a third generation. The female lays about 400 to 500 eggs. The larva is a brown caterpillar. The larva is the destructive stage. It eats leaves and flowers, especially new buds. This is the desired effect of this moth when it is used as an agent of biological pest control against field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis). It was first introduced into the United States in the 1980s to attack this agricultural weed, which is its main food plant.  References  * Coombs, E. M., et al., Eds. (2004).

The settlement lies southeast of Swindon town, close to junction 15 of the M4 motorway, which is approximately away via the B4192. The parish has been an area of settlement since the earliest times. The ancient Ridgeway traverses the parish just north of the village and the Iron Age hill-fort known as Liddington Castle overlooks the present-day village. Liddington is recorded in the late Saxon period, around 940 AD. The Domesday Book of 1086 refers to the settlement as Ledentone. Records indicate that Liddington was a fairly prosperous parish in the 14th century. The population of the parish peaked at 454 in 1841 and then gradually declined.  'Starfish' decoy control bunker  Liddington Hill is the site of a control bunker for a World War II 'Starfish' bombing decoy site. This would have been used to control fires, which would have acted as a decoy to enemy planes targeting the town of Swindon to the north. The bunker had a hatch in its concrete roof and consisted of two rooms off a central passage; the room on the right housed generators, while the control room was on the left.

The state highway runs as a north-south highway between junctions with MD 32 in Sykesville. MD 851 is the old alignment of MD 32 through Sykesville, which was paved by 1910. The state highway was designated when the MD 32 bypass of Sykesville opened in 1963. MD 851 was relocated at its northern end in 2006. Route description View north along MD 851 in Sykesville MD 851 begins at an intersection with MD 32 (Sykesville Road) in Howard County south of Sykesville. The state highway heads north as two-lane undivided West Friendship Road along the edge of Hugg-Thomas Wildlife Management Area into the narrow valley of the Patapsco River. MD 851 traverses the river and crosses CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision at grade as the highway enters the town of Sykesville in Carroll County, where the highway's name changes to Main Street. The state highway passes through the Sykesville Historic District. At the northern end of the town center, MD 851 turns northeast onto Springfield Avenue while Spout Hill Road continues straight toward Springfield Presbyterian Church. The state highway passes Millard Cooper Park, a park and ride lot, and Third Avenue before reaching its northern terminus at MD 32 (Sykesville Road). The roadway continues east as Springfield Avenue into the Springfield Hospital Center, which includes the preserved Warfield Complex. History Sign for MD 851 on MD 32 south of Sykesville MD 851 forms much of the old alignment of MD 32 through Sykesville. Sykesville Road was already paved for on either side of Sykesville when the highway was designated part of the original state road between West Friendship and Westminster by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. MD 851 was assigned to MD 32's old alignment through Sykesville shortly after the MD 32 bypass of Sykesville opened following the completion of the bypass's original aluminum girder bridge across the Patapsco River in 1963; this bridge was replaced in 2004. MD 851 originally continued north from Third Avenue to meet MD 32 at a tangent on the north side of the town. MD 851 was relocated north of Third Avenue in 2006 to create a perpendicular intersection with MD 32, which was also relocated as part of the project, and to provide a better connection from both state highways to Springfield Hospital Center. MD 851 temporarily extended east of MD 32 through a roundabout to a dead end in 2006; the portion of highway east of MD 32 was transferred to the town of Sykesville in 2007. Junction list Auxiliary routes MD 851 has six existing auxiliary routes and at least one former auxiliary route. These highways are sections of old alignment of MD 32 between West Friendship and Eldersburg. MD 851A and MD 851B are in Carroll County; MD 851C was also in Carroll County. MD 851D, MD 851F, MD 851H, and MD 851J are in Howard County. *MD 851A is the designation for the unnamed spur of old alignment from MD 32 to a dead end parallel to the southbound side of MD 32 on the southern edge of Eldersburg. *MD 851B is the designation for the unnamed section of old alignment between two dead ends around Church Street on the southbound side of MD 32 in Flohrville south of Eldersburg. *MD 851C was the designation for an unnamed spur from Third Street to a dead end near MD 851's northern terminus in Sykesville. MD 851C was transferred to municipal maintenance in 2006. *MD 851D is the designation for the unnamed section of old alignment between two dead ends on the northbound side of MD 32 just north of MD 32's interchange with Interstate 70. MD 851D is connected to MD 32 by Livestock Road. *MD 851F is the designation for Deer Hill Road, which runs from MD 32 to a dead end on the northbound side of MD 32 just south of MD 851's southern terminus near Sykesville. *MD 851H is the designation for the unnamed spur from a dead end to MD 32 on the northbound side of MD 32 north of West Friendship. MD 851H is also connected to MD 32 near its southern end by MD 32B. *MD 851J is the designation for Butterfly Court, which runs from MD 99 (Old Frederick Road) north to a dead end on the northbound side of MD 32 north of West Friendship. MD 851J originally extended a further south to a dead end on the southern side of MD 99. The southern section was removed from the state highway system in 2003; the West Friendship Volunteer Fire Department now sits south of MD 99.

Hacikyan, Nourhan Ouzounian, Edward S. Franchuk, Gabriel Basmajian, The Heritage of Armenian Literature, Vol.1, (Wayne State University Press, 2000), 259. Overview The Nvarsak Treaty was concluded after Persian king Peroz I was killed by the Hepthalites amid the 30-year Armenian guerrilla efforts. An account also cited that the Battle of Avarayr and the Armenian resistance to paganism contributed to the agreement. This treaty ensured religious freedom and autonomy for Armenians.Razmik Panossian, The Armenians: From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars, (Columbia University Press, 2006), 48. The conditions of the treaty were as follows: *1. All existing fire-altars in Armenia should be destroyed and no new ones should be constructed.The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians, R.N. Frye, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol.3, Ed. Yarshater, 149. *2. Christians in Armenia should have freedom of worship and conversions to Zoroastrianism should be stopped.The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians, R.N. Frye, 149. *3. Land should not be allotted to people who convert to Zoroastrianism *4. The Persian King should, in person, administer Armenia and through the aid of Governors or deputies.The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians, R.N. Frye, 149. Following the treaty, Vahan Mamikonian was appointed governor of the Persian province of Armenia. The treaty, however, was breached when, in 572, the Persian king, Chosroes I, built a Zoroastrian fire-temple in Armenia. It was part of the conflict between Persia and Byzantium, with the former demanding that Armenians abjure their faith. The move incited a new Armenian rebellion.

He was the Robert Fluhrer Professor of Civil War Studies and Director of the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College. Born and raised in Hungary, he participated as a teenager in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the Soviet Union before escaping to America, where he received his higher education and became a scholar of Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War. He is the author, co-author, or editor of 16 books about Lincoln or the War. Boritt received the National Humanities Medal in 2008 from President George W. Bush. Early life Boritt was born to a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary at the start of World War II. The Nazis forced his family to live in a single room in a hospital on the ghetto's edge, where he played on bloodstained floors. As his father helped lead resistance against the Nazis, his grandfather's family was deported from the countryside and murdered in Auschwitz. By the end of the war, Budapest was in ruins and Hungary in Stalin's grip. In the years that followed, Boritt's mother died, his father and brother were imprisoned, and he was sent to an orphanage. In 1956 sixteen- year-old Boritt joined the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. He remembers the initial euphoria: \\"We thought it was a whole new world. Anything was possible.\\" Days later, 3,000 Soviet tanks crushed those possibilities, and Boritt and his sister Judith headed for the Austrian border. In darkness, they hiked through wooded hills before coming to a no-man's-land guarded by watchtowers with machine guns. Freedom lay on the other side. Together, they started running. Escape to America After months at an Austrian refugee camp, Boritt came to the U.S. with just one dollar in his pocket, arriving in the \\"dirtiest city\\" he had ever seen: New York City. Told that the real America is \\"out west,\\" Boritt headed to South Dakota. Wanting to learn English, he picked up a free booklet of Abraham Lincoln's writings. Captivated by Lincoln's mastery of the language and his rise from poverty to the presidency, Boritt began studying American history and earned his bachelor of arts degree from Yankton College in 1962 and a master's degree from the University of South Dakota in 1963, followed by a Ph.D. from Boston University in 1968. As an immigrant, he felt obliged to go to Vietnam, where he taught soldiers about the American Civil War. In 1978 after deciding to pursue the study of Lincoln from the economic angle, he published his first book Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream, which placed what Boritt called \\"the right to rise\\" at the center of Lincoln's outlook. One of a handful of books on Lincoln published in the 1970s, a 1995 survey of leading experts by Civil War Times lists it as one of the 10 most important books ever written about Lincoln. Gettysburg College After teaching at the University of Michigan, in 1981 Boritt came to Gettysburg College, founding the Civil War Institute, where the school created for him the nation's first fully funded chair for the study of the Civil War. He helped create the $50,000 Lincoln Prize, widely considered the most coveted award for the study of American history.The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. For Historians. Fellowships and Prizes He also helped create the Gilder Lehrman Institute, which is focused on improving the teaching of history in schools.The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History . Home Modern accomplishments Boritt served on the boards of the Gettysburg National Battlefield Museum Foundation and the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, appointed by Congress. His latest book The Gettysburg Gospel: The Lincoln Speech Nobody Knows (2006) was featured on the cover of U.S. News and World Report and called \\"fascinating\\" by the New York Times. In September 2008 Boritt gave a tour of the Gettysburg battlefield to President George W. Bush, Laura Bush and a group including White House Advisor Karl Rove, Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, and Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings. On November 17, 2008 President George W. Bush awarded Boritt the National Humanities Medal from the National Endowment for the Humanities \\"for a distinguished career of scholarship on Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War era. His life's work and his life's story stand as testaments to our nation's precious legacy of liberty.\\"2008 National Humanities Medalists , National Endowment for the Humanities, 2008, Accessed February 4, 2009. His life story is the subject of a feature-length documentary film titled Budapest to Gettysburg (2007), directed by his son Jake Boritt. In 2009 he retired. Gabor Boritt was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State‚Äôs highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2009 as a Bicentennial Laureate. Boritt and his wife Liz live in an 18th-century farmhouse on the edge of the Gettysburg battlefield which they restored with their own hands. It served as both a stop on the Underground Railroad and as a Confederate hospital. Together they have raised three sons: Beowulf Boritt is a set designer (and streaming video ad star) in New York City, Jake Boritt is a filmmaker who lives in Harlem, and Daniel Boritt is a biologist specializing in birds who lives in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Some use the term self-referentially without malice or as a source of pride, often referring simply to \\"someone who is interested in a subject (usually intellectual or complex) for its own sake\\". Nonetheless, it remains a pejorative, widely used in an abusive manner especially against children and teens who may be more focused on studies, while less popular, fashionable, or socially inclined. The term geek is often used interchangeably with the term nerd, but geek has always had more negative connotations, perhaps due to its earlier association with carnival performers. Etymology The word comes from English dialect geek or geck (meaning a \\"fool\\" or \\"freak\\"; from Middle Low German Geck). Geck is a standard term in modern German and means \\"fool\\" or \\"fop\\". The root also survives in the Dutch and Afrikaans adjective gek (\\"crazy\\"), as well as some German dialects, like the Alsatian word Gickeleshut (\\"jester's hat\\"; used during carnival). In 18th century Austria, Gecken were freaks on display in some circuses. In 19th century North America, the term geek referred to a performer in a geek show in a circus, traveling carnival or travelling funfair sideshows (see also freak show). The 1976 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary included only the definition regarding geek shows. This variation of the term was used to comic effect in 1970s TV shows such as Sanford & Son, and Starsky and Hutch. In the Bounty Hunter episode of 1976 of Starsky and Hutch, stating that \\"a geek is a freak in a circus side show, who is kept in a pit and they throw snakes and chicken heads at, and he runs around crazy and gobbles them up\\", and \\"in 1932 the geeks formed their own union\\". In that episode, Starsky and Huggy Bear say they read this in an unreliable book. In it, there is a man shooting the head off a bumblebee in flight, and Big Foot, alluding to the apocryphal nature of who is a geek. Professional wrestling manager \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie recorded a song in the 1970s called \\"Pencil-Necked Geek\\". Definitions The 1975 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary, published a decade before the Digital revolution, gave only one definition: \\"Geek [noun, slang]. A carnival performer whose act usually consists of biting the head off a live chicken or snake.\\" The tech revolution found new uses for this word, but it still often conveys a derogatory sting. In 2017, Dictionary.com gave five definitions, the fourth of which is \\"a carnival performer who performs sensationally morbid or disgusting acts, as biting off the head of a live chicken.\\" The term nerd has a similar, practically synonymous meaning as geek, but many choose to identify different connotations among these two terms, although the differences are disputed. In a 2007 interview on The Colbert Report, Richard Clarke said the difference between nerds and geeks is \\"geeks get it done\\" or \\"ggid\\".The Colbert Report 17th of January video interview Richard Clarke Julie Smith defined a geek as \\"a bright young man turned inward, poorly socialized, who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors, who thought of that secret, dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspace‚Äîsomewhere exciting, a place more real than his own life, a land he could conquer, not a drab teenager's room in his parents' house.\\" Impact œÄ (pi) extends from the logo of a Mazda3, parked at University of California, Irvine. Technologically oriented geeks, in particular, now exert a powerful influence over the global economy and society. Whereas previous generations of geeks tended to operate in research departments, laboratories and support functions, now they increasingly occupy senior corporate positions, and wield considerable commercial and political influence. When U.S. President Barack Obama met with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of the world's largest technology firms at a private dinner in Woodside, California on February 17, 2011, New York magazine ran a story titled \\"The world's most powerful man meets President Obama\\". At the time, Zuckerberg's company had grown to over one billion users. According to Mark Roeder the rise of the geek represents a new phase of human evolution. In his book, Unnatural Selection: Why The Geeks Will Inherit The Earth he suggests that \\"the high-tech environment of the Anthropocene favours people with geek-like traits, many of whom are on the autism spectrum, ADHD, or dyslexia. Previously, such people may have been at a disadvantage, but now their unique cognitive traits enable some of them to resonate with the new technological zeitgeist and become very successful.\\" The Economist magazine observed, on June 2, 2012, \\"Those square pegs (geeks) may not have an easy time in school. They may be mocked by jocks and ignored at parties. But these days no serious organisation can prosper without them.\\"In praise of misfits. Economist. June 2, 2012. http://www.economist.com/node/21556230 Geek chic \\"Geek chic\\" refers to a minor fashion trend that arose in the mid 2000s (decade) in which young people adopted \\"geeky\\" fashions, such as oversized black horn-rimmed glasses, suspenders/braces, and highwater trousers. The glasses quickly became the defining aspect of the trend, with the media identifying various celebrities as \\"trying geek\\" or \\"going geek\\" for wearing such glasses, such as David Beckham and Justin Timberlake. Meanwhile, in the sports world, many NBA players wore \\"geek glasses\\" during post-game interviews, drawing comparisons to Steve Urkel. The term \\"geek chic\\" was appropriated by some self-identified \\"geeks\\" to refer to a new, socially acceptable role in a technologically advanced society.

Consisting of one previously published story, \\"The Pebbles of Sai-No-Kawara\\", and one new story, \\"Blanket Man\\", the chapbook was printed in 2006, but the publisher did not release the book because of production difficulties with the accompanying wooden and resin box. Of the edition of 200 copies, the publisher sent a number of copies to the author. There are no plans to further distribute the book. From 2001 to 2007, Williamson was the lead singer and guitarist for the Irish duo Fire in the Glen, in which he was partnered with fiddler and bodhranist Tom Knapp. A lifelong member of the Actors' Equity Association, Williamson eventually resumed his acting career, and has performed in plays and musicals at Lancaster's Fulton Opera House and Theater of the Seventh Sister. Williamson portrayed college professor Frederick Miller in the 2006 Fulton Opera House staged reading of \\"Any Day Now\\" by David Rush, and Jane Holahan of the Lancaster New Era commented: \\"These actors were terrific.

He played as a striker, and most notably won the 1998 Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue with French team Paris Saint-Germain. He played six games and scored a single goal for the France national football team, also representing his nation at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Career Born in Sainte-Foy-l√®s-Lyon, Rh√¥ne, Florian Maurice started playing youth football with local top-flight team Olympique Lyonnais in 1986. A great hope in French football, Maurice was touted as the new Jean-Pierre Papin. Guirec Gombert, Florian Maurice: une reconversion r√©ussie, le Figaro, 30 June 2008. He was included in Lyonnais' senior squad for the Ligue 1 championship in the 1991‚Äì92 season, but did not make his Ligue 1 debut until August 1992. His national breakthrough came during the 1994‚Äì95 season, when he scored 15 league goals. In the 1995‚Äì96 season, he scored 18 league goals for Lyonnais and took part in both the 1996 European Under-21 Championship and 1996 Summer Olympics tournaments.http://www.leballonrond.fr/player.php?id=3446 He made his debut for the French national team in August 1996, under national manager Aim√© Jacquet. However, Maurice's progress was halted during the 1996‚Äì97 season, when he suffered a ruptured achilles tendon and went through several months of recovery. In the summer 1997, he moved from Lyonnais to league rivals Paris Saint-Germain in a transfer deal worth FF 41 million. He was a part of the Paris SG team which won both the 1998 Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue trophies. He played a single season at Paris SG, scoring seven league goals, before he moved on to Olympique de Marseille in the summer 1998. In his first season at Marseille, Maurice recovered his goal scoring ability, and netted 14 league goals. Marseille reached the final of the international 1999 UEFA Cup tournament, but lost 0‚Äì3 to Parma AC from Italy. The following two years at Marseille, Maurice suffered several minor injuries, and could not establish himself in the Marseille starting line-up. He played his last match for the French national team in November 1999, scoring his only national team goal in a 3‚Äì0 win against Croatia, before being dropped by new national team manager Roger Lemerre. He moved abroad in the summer 2001, to play for Celta de Vigo in Spain. After a single, unsuccessful year at the club, he returned to France to play for Ligue 1 club SC Bastia. He had moderate success at Bastia, but when his contract expired in the summer 2004, only newly promoted team FC Istres were in need of his services. He failed to score any goals for the relegation battling Istres team, and left the club in January 2005. He moved to Ligue 2 club LB Ch√¢teauroux, where he played until he retired in September 2005. He is now recruitment manager for the Olympique Lyonnais.

Licensed to Raleigh, North Carolina, the station serves the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. The station call letters date back to the former longtime owner of the station, Durham Life Insurance Company, whose motto was \\"We Protect The Family.\\" Durham Life owned the station from 1927-1992. Its studios are located on Highwoods Boulevard in Raleigh, and the transmitter tower is in Cary, North Carolina. The station is currently owned by Curtis Media Group. Programs on WPTF include local news blocks in morning drive, noon and afternoons, national talk shows like consumer and family finances expert Clark Howard, and the overnight political show Red Eye Radio. In addition, the station also hosts local talk shows including Tom Kearney.http://www.wptf.com/programming.asp, Retrieved on March 16, 2012.Danny Hooley, \\"WPTF-AM's Boston Diagnosed with Leukemia,\\" The News and Observer, October 12, 2006. When owned by Durham Life Broadcasting (a wholly owned subsidiary of Durham Life Insurance), the station was associated with and operated alongside other DLB properties; WQDR-FM from 1949-1992 and WPTF-TV, the longtime NBC affiliate in the Triangle, from 1977-1992. The TV station is now known as WRDC, \\"MyRDC,\\" an affiliate of MyNetworkTV, and owned by Sinclair Broadcasting.http://www.tv-signoffs.com/NC_raleigh.htm , Retrieved on 2008/04/22. WPTF is one of two AM radio stations in North Carolina which operate fulltime with 50,000 watts, along with WBT in Charlotte. Both these stations operate with a non-directional daytime signal, and a directional signal at night that protects other stations on their frequency. (As a Class A station WBT has more protection from other stations than WPTF, which is classified as Class B.) WPTF's daytime signal provides a grade B signal westward to Charlotte, eastward to Wilmington, and northward to the Roanoke, Virginia suburbs. Its nighttime directional signal is primarily designed to protect the dominant Class A station on 680, KNBR San Francisco. Its nighttime coverage also must avoid interfering with several 50,000-watt stations to the north, also on 680 kHz, including WRKO in Boston and CFTR in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. During the night the station's signal reaches Charleston, South Carolina with good quality, and can be picked up well south into the Bahamas and other parts of the Caribbean and Venezuela. However, the nighttime coverage is spotty in parts of Virginia. Therefore, WPTF's nighttime signal is stronger to the south as a result. Early history WPTF was originally called WFBQ, and was the second radio station in Raleigh (N. C. State had the first, WLAC, but it did not last), going on the air September 22, 1924 at 1190 AM, broadcasting at 50 watts. The station was owned and operated by the Wynne Radio Company, owned by William A. Wynne, and the offices and broadcasting facilities were located in the Boone Building next to the Wake County Courthouse. After a year of successful operation, the station had its call letters changed to WRCO, for Wynne Radio Company. On August 19, 1926 the station was authorized to increase its power to 100 watts. Being a more powerful station, they moved their operations to the Sir Walter Hotel. The following year the power was increased to 250 watts. They signed on the air each morning at sunrise and signed off the air at sunset each day. Early in 1927 the station requested a power increase to 500 watts. In June of that year they received word that their request would not be granted, however, they were given authority to move to 1380 kHz, along with unlimited time on the air. Also in 1927, The Durham Life Insurance Company purchased WRCO outright from the Wynne Company and the station's call letters were changed to WPTF. The new owners received permission to increase their power to 500 watts and to move to 720 kHz. New equipment was purchased and the operations were moved to the basement of the old Durham Life building. Things moved rather rapidly for the new owners. On November 16, 1927, WPTF moved to 550 kHz, remaining there until November 1, 1928, when it changed to 680. In 1928, the station was granted another increase in power, this time to 1,000 watts, but was required to sign off at sunset. In the early 1930s, WPTF was a pioneer in educational radio, similar to educational TV many years later. Students in area schools that had radio were able to listen to a daily broadcast, with topics that included \\"Citizenship\\", \\"Science\\", \\"Social Studies\\" and \\"Art, Music and Literature\\". Although many attempts were made over the next several years, it was not until 1933 that the station increased its power to 5,000 watts. With this authority, WPTF purchased new equipment and moved to Cary, North Carolina, on US Highway 1. In June 1940, WPTF was given authority to operate unlimited hours and a month later was granted a construction permit to install new transmitter equipment and increase its power to 50,000 watts. Almost a year later on a late spring evening, listeners heard these words from the announcer on duty: \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, there will be a few moments of silence while engineers switch from WPTF's 5,000 watts transmitter unit and begin operation for the first time with its new 50,000 watts transmitter.\\" Thus, on May 24, 1941, WPTF began a new era in broadcasting. As of 1948, WPTF was an affiliate of NBC Radio. WPTF added an FM station that year, signing on at 94.5 in 1949 using the tallest of the AM station's three towers off N.C. Highway 54, near the present-day Interstate 40. (As seen from image above.) WPTF-FM later moved to 94.7 and today is Country music station WQDR-FM, still co-owned by Curtis Media. At the time, both stations operated from 410 South Salisbury street in Downtown Raleigh. The tower used by WPTF-FM when it signed on is currently used by WKIX-FM. Bart Ritner went to work at WPTF in 1966, staying for 39 years. He hosted the morning show \\"Ask Your Neighbor\\", with people giving advice or recipes. His most popular show was \\"Open Line\\", an hour-long call- in-show started in 1966 and expanded to two hours in 1973. Don Curtis, whose company later bought the station called the show \\"one of the nation's first daily two-way talk programs\\". By the 1970s, the AM station offered a \\"full service format with news, talk, and adult contemporary music,\\" and the FM was playing classical music before switching to album rock and the call letters WQDR-FM in 1973. Ritner moved to news in 1980. He was the only reporter at a 1982 hostage incident at Central Prison, helping to negotiate and end the standoff. Ritner returned to \\"Open Line\\" in 1986 and moved it from evenings to afternoons. Bob Kwesell, whose conservative views offended a number of listeners but attracted many newcomer and increased advertising, was dropped on November 17, 1986. WPTF-TV, a nine-year-old station previously called WRDU- TV when Durham Life bought it, joined the two radio stations at their Highwoods Boulevard studios on the north end of Raleigh. In 1991, Durham Life sold its broadcasting stations. Don Curtis, who bought all of WQDR, had a \\"controlling interest\\" in WPTF. Recent developments WPTF had served as the flagship station for the NC State Wolfpack sports network for more than 40 years until Wolfpack Sports Marketing announced it had signed a ten-year deal to move its flagship to Capitol Broadcasting Company's WRAL- FM.http://www.gopack.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9200&ATCLID;=876362, Retrieved on 2008/04/22. NC State athletic officials cited their desire to be on an FM signal with a multi-year contract and the ability to collect more local advertising revenue, conditions that Curtis Media was unwilling to provide. Some Wolfpack fans around the East Coast were unhappy with the move because it cut the audience of Wolfpack sports, especially at night, because of the reduced power.http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/639158.html , Retrieved on 2008/04/22. After the September 2008 death of Jack Boston, Scott Fitzgerald took over North Carolina Morning News. As of September 15, 2008, WPTF began streaming the popular syndicated host Rush Limbaugh as well as the rest of their local and syndicated line up. Parent Company Curtis Media announced in August 2009 the acquisition of The North Carolina News Network from Capitol Broadcasting Company of Raleigh.http://www.curtismedia.com/special/ncnn.pdf On November 2, 2009, Curtis Media President Phil Zachary said Limbaugh would be leaving WPTF December 31, 2009, after more than 20 years. The show moved to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia's) new FM talk radio station, 106.1 WRDU (now WTKK), which competes now is now with WPTF. The loss of long-time staples Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity has proved challenging for WPTF. Following the move of the conservative programs to the new FM Talk Radio station, WPTF's ratings were significantly impacted. After having been among Raleigh's most popular stations, these days the station's ratings are considerably lower. In December 2009, Brian Freeman, program director of sister station WSJS in Winston-Salem, North Carolina took over the same duties at WPTF and became the host of North Carolina's Morning News. Starting with the 2011 Daytona 500, WPTF began airing NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Nationwide Series racing. Previous WPTF logo, used until 2009 WPTF's format was, in effect, split on March 13, 2012, when much of its talk programming moved to sister station WPTK, which was branded as TalkRadio 850 WPTF. WPTF then shifted most of its daytime programming to all-news, retaining the NewsRadio 680 WPTF identity. The station continued to air The Dave Ramsey Show in the late morning hours until it was picked up by WTKK on June 15, 2013; other talk shows still comprise WPTF's nighttime and weekend schedule. WPTF's local coverage is supplemented by the CBS Radio Network, AP Radio, and the co-owned North Carolina News Network. In August 2015, WPTF dropped the split programming from 850 AM. Tony Riggsbee, who retired from WPTF in 2004, had returned to the station on a part-time basis a few months prior. He currently helms WPTF's Saturday Morning News prior to \\"Eye on Health\\" and long-time staple \\"The WPTF Weekend Gardner\\" hosted by Mike Raley and Ann Clapp. Hurricane coverage WPTF has historically provided hurricane coverage to residents of the Carolinas. WPTF first provided reports of Hurricane Hazel and has covered most major storms ever since. Because of WPTF's directional nighttime signal, the station assisted the residents of Charleston, South Carolina after Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989. Most of coastal South Carolina, including the city of Charleston was without power, so local radio stations were knocked off the air. WPTF broadcast emergency information and even won several awards from the state of South Carolina for their assistance. In 1996, WPTF provided coverage of Hurricane Fran even though the station was without power for nearly a week. The station and transmitter site ran on generator power, allowing residents in the Triangle and beyond to call in for storm and damage information and find out where to get needed supplies, such as ice, water, and food.

Examples of gun hybrids include knife/pistols and pistol/sword combinations. History According to the book Weaponry: An Illustrated History, by Chuck Wills, between the late 16th century and the advances in repeating firearms in the mid 19th century, blades or clubs were often fitted onto guns, because only one shot could be fired from the gun. Without an alternative weapon attachment, they became useless at close range. Some of the first included the German axe-pistol, made in the central European region of Silesia. This weapon combined a flintlock pistol with a battleaxe. Later, a pistol-sword combination formed in the mid 18th century, which was apparently used mainly by marines and naval officers in boarding engagements at sea. Additionally, Dumonthier & Sons produced several knife pistol combinations. Pocket knives with zip guns inside were made by Unwin & Rodgers, and an Indian gunsmith fitted a percussion cap gun to a mace in the 19th century. Even some shields were fitted with barrels, sometimes designed to look like a spike, and other times placed in cleverly concealed holes.

It is further claimed that if radioactive isotopes such as uranium are present, the cell enables the hydrogen nuclei to fuse with these isotopes, transforming them into stable elements and thus neutralizing the radioactivity; and this would be achieved without releasing any radiation to the environment and without expending any energy. A televised demonstration on June 11, 1997, on Good Morning America was not conclusive because there was no measurement of the radioactivity of the beads after the test, thus it cannot be discarded that the beads had simply absorbed the uranium ions and become radioactive themselves. In 2002, the neutralization of radioactive isotopes has only been achieved through intense neutron bombardment in a nuclear reactor or large scale high energy particle accelerator, and at a large expense of energy. When asked about reliability in 1998, Gabe Collins, a chemical engineer at CETI, stated: \\"When they don't work, it's mostly due to contamination. If you get any sodium in the system it kills the reaction ‚Äì and since sodium is one of the more abundant elements, it's hard to keep it out.\\" Patterson has carefully distanced himself from the work of Fleischmann and Pons and from the label of \\"cold fusion\\", due to the negative connotations associated to them since 1989.Bart Simon (2002) Undead Science pp. 160‚Äì164, Park, Robert L. (2002) Voodoo Science p. 12, 115 Ultimately, this effort was unsuccessful, and not only did it inherit the label of pathological science, but it managed to make cold fusion look a little more pathological in the public eye.Bart Simon (2002) Undead Science p. 163-164 Some cold fusion proponents view the cell as a confirmation of their work, while critics see it as \\"the fringe of the fringe of cold fusion research\\", since it attempts to commercialize cold fusion on top of making bad science.Bart Simon (2002) Undead Science p. 164 In 2002, John R. Huizenga, professor of nuclear chemistry at the University of Rochester, who was head of a government panel convened in 1989 to investigate the cold fusion claims of Fleischmann and Pons, and who wrote a book about the controversy, said \\"I would be willing to bet there's nothing to it\\", when asked about the Patterson Power Cell. In 2006, Hideo Kozima, professor emeritus of physics at Shizuoka University, has suggested that the byproducts are consistent with cold fusion.Kozima, Hideo (2006). The Science of the Cold Fusion Phenomenon. Elsevier, p. 148. , Replications George H. Miley is a professor of nuclear engineering and a cold fusion researcher who claims to have replicated the Patterson Power Cell. During the 2011 World Green Energy Symposium, Miley stated that his device continuously produces several hundred watts of power.Xiaoling Yang, George H. Miley, Heinz Hora. \\"Condensed Matter Cluster Reactions in LENR Power Cells for a Radical New Type of Space Power Source\\" . American Institute of Physics Conference Proceedings, March 16, 2009, vol. 1103, pp. 450‚Äì458. The conference was \\"2011 World Green Energy Symposium\\". October 19‚Äì21, 2011 Earlier results by Miley have not convinced mainstream researchers, who believe that they can be explained by contamination or by misinterpretation of data. On the television show Good Morning America, Quintin Bowles, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City, claimed in 1996 to have successfully replicated the Patterson power cell. In the book Voodoo Science, Bowles is quoted as having stated: \\"It works, we just don't know how it works\\". A replication has been attempted at Earthtech, using a CETI supplied kit. They were not able to replicate the excess heat. They looked for cold fusion products, but only found traces of contamination in the electrolyte.

SWHR is the thought leader in research on biological differences in disease and is dedicated to transforming women‚Äôs health through science, advocacy, and education. Founded in 1990 by Florence Haseltine, PhD, MD, SWHR aims to bring national attention to the need for the appropriate inclusion of women and minorities in major medical research studies and the need for more information about diseases and conditions affecting women exclusively, predominantly, or differently than men. It also promotes the analysis of research data for sex and ethnic differences; and informs women, healthcare providers, and policy makers about contemporary women‚Äôs health issues through media outreach, briefings, conferences, and special events. As a result of SWHR‚Äôs work, women and minorities are now included in medical research and clinical trials; scientists are researching the ways in which health conditions and diseases affect men and women differently and why. Through SWHR's use of evidence-based research and multi- pronged policy and public education efforts, as well as the involvement of health care providers and policy makers dedicated to improving women‚Äôs health, sex differences is now a national priority. History SWHR was founded by Florence Haseltine as the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research in 1990. When Dr. Haseltine began working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), she was told that her \\"role was to champion the field of obstetrics and gynecology,\\" which at the time were under-represented in research. In 1985, NIH lacked sufficient in-house expertise and funding for academic scientists. When her friend, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, developed ovarian cancer, Dr. Haseltine seized the opportunity to promote the need for more research into conditions affecting women. In the spring of 1989, Dr. Haseltine gathered friends and colleagues from medical and scientific organizations across the country to address this critical issue. They congregated at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and agreed on the need not only for more gynecological research at NIH but also for research regarding women‚Äôs health in general. This meeting gave rise to SWHR. In 1990, due to biases in biomedical research, the health of American women was at risk. SWHR‚Äôs first Board of Directors made it their priority to confront this injustice. They worked with the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, its Executive Director - Leslie Primer, and Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) to persuade the General Accounting Office (GAO; now the Government Accountability Office) to address the issue. They recommended that GAO evaluate NIH‚Äôs policies and practices regarding the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials. SWHR ensured that its dedicated leadership included a diverse group of health care providers and others concerned with research and health care equity, to provide a range of perspectives. Included in the initial gathering at ACOG and later on the first SWHR Board were physicians and researchers specializing in cardiology, mental health, and obstetrics-gynecology, as well as nurses, lawyers, and public policy advocates involved and interested in women‚Äôs health. In 1993, SWHR opened its official headquarters in Washington, D.C. and hired its first professional staff. Phyllis Greenberger, MSW, was selected as the first Executive Director. The audit was successfully released at an NIH re-authorization hearing in June 1990. It concluded that the NIH policy of 1986, which encouraged the inclusion of women in clinical trials, had been poorly communicated and misunderstood within NIH and the research community at large. Additionally, it was applied inconsistently across Institutes and was only applied to extramural research (research conducted outside NIH). The GAO report concluded that there was \\"‚Ä¶no readily accessible source of data on the demographics of NIH study populations.\\" This made it impossible to determine if NIH was enforcing its own recommendations. Activities SWHR maintains three programmatic areas to accomplish its mission: *Scientific Programs *Advocacy *Education Goals In 2015, the Society for Women's Health Research is looking ahead to challenges facing the country with healthcare and health reforms. SWHR will continue to identify the gaps in health care and research that still exist, target those differences and close the gaps. SWHR strives to ensure that women‚Äôs health remains a high priority on the national agenda and that biological differences become more widely recognized as vital to health care treatment options. Both the size of staff and roster of volunteer leaders have grown over time to assist in these efforts. Medical nursing, and scientific experts from a wide range of disciplines have participated in SWHR‚Äôs efforts. SWHR staff relies on current and past members of SWHR Networks, expert resources, contributing authors of the Savvy Woman Patient, presenters from past SWHR conferences, as well as its scientific advisory board and Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) members for the medical and technical knowledge that undergirds all its science programs, educational outreach, and advocacy efforts. SWHR will continue to partner with the widest possible range of healthcare providers, policy makers, and scientists to gather evidence-based information and then communicate it as appropriate to Congress, the scientific research community, health care providers, health advocacy groups and the public. =Science= SWHR works with researchers and clinicians to advance the field of sexual biology. SWHR hosts scientific roundtables to encourage dialogue and research on biological differences. SWHR established a series of networks working to foster interdisciplinary basic and clinical research on biological differences: *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on Cardiovascular Disease. *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on the Link Between Domestic Violence and Chronic Disease. *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on Metabolism. *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on Musculoskeletal Health. *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on Sex, Gender, Drugs and the Brain. *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on Sleep. *Susan G. Komen Network for the Study of Exercise and Breast Cancer. *SWHR Interdisciplinary Network on Urological Health in Women In 2006, the \\"Society for Women‚Äôs Health Research Medtronic Prize for Scientific Contributions to Women‚Äôs Health,\\" the annual $75,000 prize which recognizes a woman scientist or engineer for her contributions to women‚Äôs health and encourages women to research issues uniquely related to women‚Äôs health. SWHR created the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD), a scientific membership society to enhance the knowledge of sex/gender differences by facilitating interdisciplinary communication and collaboration among scientists and clinicians of diverse backgrounds. SWHR administers the RAISE Project, which focuses on increase the status of professional women through enhanced recognition of their achievements in science, technology, engineering, medicine and mathematics. . In addition to Interdisciplinary Networks, SWHR supports roundtables, workshops, advisory meetings, and pilot research projects on: *Autoimmune diseases *Alzheimer's disease *Clinical trials *Domestic violence *Hormone therapy *Mental health *Mobile health *Oral care *Pain *Sexual health *Veteran's health =Advocacy= As the thought- leader in biological differences research, SWHR is often called upon to offer expert testimony before Congress and to provide guidance on legislative and regulatory matters on women‚Äôs health. =Education= SWHR runs numerous campaigns, conferences, and media briefings to educate the public on women‚Äôs health issues. SWHR also publishes a monthly e-newsletter and monthly news service article to keep the public informed about news relevant to women‚Äôs health and biological differences. SWHR‚Äôs website features information on conditions that affect women predominantly or differently than men. They promote the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials by educating the public on how to participate and what to expect if they do join a trial. In January 2006, SWHR published its first book for consumers, The Savvy Woman Patient: How and Why Sex Differences Impact Your Health. This consumer guide informs women about health conditions and treatments that are unique to women and focuses on how women‚Äôs health differs from men‚Äôs. In 2014, SWHR released a national survey of 3,500 women to better understand women‚Äôs habits and perceptions around breast cancer screening and mammograms, including the motivating factors, obstacles and barriers, emotional impact, and expectations for future testing. =The Raise Project = The RAISE Project brings together awards from all different areas of STEM & medicine. It is the only project that lists over 1950 awards as well the winners and breaks down the distribution between men and women. Over 46,000 different recipients have been identified. Some individuals are cited over 30 different times. The RAISE Projecthttp://raiseproject.org data is gathered by systematically searching the websites for posted awards. Data is collected began in 2005 and shows award listings of scientific societies and relevant professional organizations starting from 1981. The data is \\"scraped\\" from the site, entered into a content management system, parsed into awardees, award, year of award, awarding body, and the sex of the recipient. It is not always possible to determine whether someone is male or female by name alone, so it is fortunate for data collection that photographs are usually posted on the website. This has made identification of the sex much easier. Ethnic diversity is not identified. Data collection began in 2006. Subsequently, information about awardees starting in 1981 was added. Data for the number of women and men in specific fields is obtained from publications of the National Science Foundation for STEM and the Association of American Medical Colleges. =Publications = SWHR helped to launch the OSSD Journal of Sex Differences in 2010 and has contributed to the Journal of Women's Health.

He was son of Eduard Friedberg ( -1937) and Elisa Landau (1844-1926) from Bingen. The Friedberg were wine merchants in Bingen since 1700. Friedberg studied piano with James Kwast and with Clara Schumann at the Hoch Conservatory, Frankfurt. He became a teacher there (1893‚Äì1904) and later at the Cologne Conservatory (1904‚Äì1914). From 1923 until his retirement in 1946, Carl Friedberg was principal piano teacher at the New York Institute of Musical Art (the institution which become the Juilliard School of Music from 1926). His pupils include Gertrude Lightstone Mittelmann, William Browning,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-11-12/news/9711120070_1_mr- browning-works-by-american-composers-chicago-musical-college Malcolm Frager, Edith Weiss-Mann, Bruce Hungerford, Nina Simone, William Masselos, and Elly Ney. Friedberg's career as a performer spanned over 60 years in both Europe and America. He made his official debut in 1892 with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Mahler. This performance received a positive review from Edward Hanslick.Master Pianist: The Career and Teaching of Carl Friedberg by Julia Smith, (New York: Philosophical Library, 1963) In 1893 he had given an all-Brahms recital in the presence of the composer, who highly admired his playing and who later coached him in private on the performance of the majority of his piano works. As a chamber musician he replaced Artur Schnabel in the Schnabel-Flesch-Becker Trio in 1920 and played in that ensemble until 1932. Friedberg gave many recitals with Fritz Kreisler throughout America and in 1937 formed his own trio with Daniel Karpilowsky and Felix Salmond. Though widely known to disdain the sound of the recorded piano, Friedberg did, at age 81 (1953) record a single commercial LP for Zodiac Records (LPZ-1001), released in two editions (limited early release with pink cover and full, later release with piano graphic) Zodiac LPZ-1001 Unreleased takes from this recording session were released 30 years later on IPAM1102 and 1103. Although Friedberg's repertory was wide, he became associated with the music of Beethoven, and especially of Schumann and Brahms. In 1955, at age 82, he planned a concert tour in Europe. He took an ocean liner to Italy, but contracted pneumonia on board. He went to Meran (Merano) for a cure, but died and is buried there.

The film is shot in black and white by Robby M√ºller with several long scenes without dialogue. The film's theme foreshadows Wenders' later film Paris, Texas.Allison Anders, Alice in the Cities: A Girl‚Äôs Story,\\" The Criterion Collection, URL accessed 7 June 2016.  Plot  West German writer Philip Winter has missed his publisher's deadline for writing an article about the United States. Attempting to book a flight from New York City back to West Germany, he meets a German woman, Lisa, and her young daughter, Alice, who are also trying to return home. After Lisa leaves Alice temporarily in Philip's care, she disappears to deal with a relationship she has recently terminated. Philip and Alice take a flight to Amsterdam on the expectation that they will meet Lisa there, only to find she never arrived at the airport. When Alice is unwilling to stay in the Amsterdam airport alone while Philip leaves, the two decide to return to West Germany where Philip can deliver Alice to her grandmother's home. Unfortunately, Alice can't remember her grandmother's name or address, except that she may live in Wuppertal, the only clue being a photograph of her grandmother's front door with no house number and no one in the shot. After searching through Wuppertal, Alice admits her grandmother doesn't live there, and that she only wanted them both to stay in Amsterdam. Enraged, Philip turns Alice over to the police, but Alice escapes and returns to him with a new lead that her grandmother lives in Ruhr. The two begin to bond as they travel through Ruhr, and the search comes to an end when the police spot them and inform Philip that Lisa has been found.  Cast  * R√ºdiger Vogler as Philip Winter * Yella Rottl√§nder as Alice * Lisa Kreuzer as Lisa, Alice's mother * Edda K√∂chl as Angela, friend in New York * Ernest Boehm as Publisher * Sam Presti as Car dealer * Lois Moran as Airport attendant * Didi Petrikat as Friend in Frankfurt * Hans Hirschm√ºller as Police officer * Sibylle Baier as The Woman * Chuck Berry (uncredited) as himself * Wim Wenders (uncredited) as the Man by Jukebox Production According to Wenders, Alice in the Cities, his fourth feature-length film, came at a major turning point when he was deciding whether to remain a filmmaker. He felt that his first two features were too heavily indebted to John Cassavetes and Alfred Hitchcock, while his third was an ill-advised adaptation of The Scarlet Letter. Alice in the Cities was a conscious attempt to make something only he could do.Post-screening Q&A; at the Museum of Modern Art Tuesday March 3, 2015 The scenario of a young girl and a writer thrown together was inspired by his long-time collaborator Peter Handke's experience as a single parent.King of the Road by Chris Petit in the Guardian Saturday January 5, 2008 The influence of Handke's 1972 novel Short Letter, Long Farewell, also featuring an alienated German-speaker travelling across the United States, can be inferred from the film's use of clips from John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln, itself heavily referenced in the novel. The film can be seen as a response to Handke's novel. While Wenders was preparing Alice in the Cities, a friend took him to see Peter Bogdanovich's new film, Paper Moon. To his horror, the film appeared to be very similar to the one he was making, prompting him to call his production office and break the news that he was canceling the project, believing the film that they were going to shoot \\"had already been made\\". Soon after, Wenders went to Samuel Fuller, who had invited him to come visit after a prior encounter in Germany. Wenders mentioned to Fuller that he had just cancelled a project, and upon finding out that Wenders had already secured the financing for the film, he convinced Wenders that it was a mistake. After a few hours of discussion, Wenders realized he could still proceed, albeit with some extensive rewrites to differentiate Alice in the Cities from Paper Moon, and he called his production office to tell them that the film was back on. Wenders and Robby M√ºller had hoped to shoot in 35 mm with the Arri BL, which had just come out at the time, but it was too difficult to find one, a common problem with newly issued cameras. Combined with their budgetary limitations, they were left with no other option than to switch to 16 mm. They filmed with a 1.66:1 wide-screen format, a common European format at the time, and drew it on the viewfinder. According to Wenders and M√ºller, that was the format they preferred, but due to television broadcast demands, they had to provide a 4:3 full frame format of the film, even though they never composed for it. This would create some problems in later years before everything was rectified with a definitive restoration in 2014.Wenders' restoration notes from Wim Wenders Stiftung The film was shot close to chronological order beginning in North Carolina, proceeding to New York, then continuing in Amsterdam and finishing in Germany, all throughout the summer of 1973. As the film progressed, the production grew more confident about improvising each scene. Some parts, like certain hotel scenes and almost anything filmed in a car, closely followed the script due to logistical reasons, but by the end of the film, Wenders said they virtually ignored the script altogether. Licensing became an issue when Wenders tried to include footage he had shot of Chuck Berry in Frankfurt (presumably in late July 1973). The footage was important as it included a performance of Berry's classic song, \\"Memphis, Tennessee\\", where the singer is trying to re-connect with his daughter. According to Wenders, it was also an additional inspiration for the film, but Berry's camp demanded a clearance fee that they could not afford to pay. Instead, Wenders approached D.A. Pennebaker, who had footage of Berry singing the song from the concert that yielded Sweet Toronto. This became a viable workaround, for licensing Pennebaker's footage (which they had to decolorize for the film) was substantially cheaper than clearing their own with Berry's camp. =Music= The film was scored by the German band Can. When interviewed about the experience, Can's Irmin Schmidt stated that it was recorded by Schmidt, Michael Karoli and Jaki Liebezeit, and that they were not able to see the movie before recording the music. Instead, they went through a collaborative approach with Wenders, who was very short of time. It was all done in one day. Reception In 1974, Nora Sayre and Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times wrote that Alice in the Cities is \\"a film with a great deal to say about Europe and America, about the exhaustion of dreams and the homogenization of nations, about roots and the awareness of time, about sterility and creativity, about vicarious and real adventure and, eventually, about the possibilities of the future.\\" The film also won the Best Film award at the German Film Critics Association Awards.\\"German Film Week\\", Goethe- Institut, URL accessed 10 July 2016. Later, in 1988, Jonathan Rosenbaum hailed Alice in the Cities as one of Wenders' strongest works, calling it a pungent hybrid of European and American elements \\"with its effective broodings over American and German landscapes and their ambiguous photographic representations.\\" In 2008, Philip French of The Observer called Rottl√§nder's performance as Alice \\"unforgettable\\". He went on to say that the film would not be able to be made today \\"partly because of the invention of the mobile phone, partly because of our obsessive fear of anything that might be interpreted as paedophilia.\\" In 2016, US director Allison Anders described Alice in the Cities as \\"one of my very favorite films, and a guiding light,\\" and praised Alice as \\"one of the screen‚Äôs most multifaceted child characters, and one of the most empowered female characters in cinema to this day.\\" The A.V.

Duvall was first elected as the Assemblyman for California's 72nd District in 2006, and was re-elected in 2008. During his time in the Assembly, he served as the vice chairman of the Utilities & Commerce Committee. Prior to his service in the Assembly, he served on the Yorba Linda City Council from 2000‚Äì2006, was a mayor of Yorba Linda, and owned an insurance agency. In July 2009, Duvall was caught on tape bragging to a fellow committee member about extramarital sex with two women, one of them a lobbyist. Los Angeles local television first aired the tape on September 8, 2009, and Duvall resigned the next day. Personal life and early career Duvall lives in Yorba Linda with his wife Susan Duvall, and has two adult children. Susan is a local small business owner. While in the Assembly, Duvall would spend most weekdays in Sacramento, and fly back to southern California on weekends. Duvall served on the Yorba Linda City Council from 2000 to 2006 and was elected mayor twice during that period. Chapman University awarded Duvall the Ethics in America Award in 2000 for his \\"demonstration of the highest standards of ethical integrity\\" while a member of the Chamber team. He also owned an insurance agency. In January 2005, he was appointed to the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) and served on the Foothill/Eastern Corridor Joint Powers Authority, on the Orange County Sanitation District, as a Director of the Ground Water Replenishment System, and as a Member of the Santa Ana River Flood Protection Agency. Prior to being elected to the City Council, Duvall served as President of the Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce, as chairman of the Yorba Linda General Plan Steering Committee, and as co-chair of \\"Safe Streets Are for Everyone.\\" In 2006, Duvall sought to allow Orange County government officials to force the California Department of Transportation to fix broken roads and other problems in the county, which he alleged the department ignored. State Assembly Duvall was first elected as the Assemblyman for California's 72nd District in 2006, and was re-elected in 2008. The district includes much of inland Orange County, including the cities of Fullerton and Anaheim. During his time in the Assembly, he served as the vice chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, which monitored the operations of the California Department of Transportation, Department of Motor Vehicles, and California Highway Patrol. Later, he was assigned to the Assembly Insurance Committee, the Education Finance Subcommittee, and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee that oversaw the Legislative Analyst's Office. In 2009, Duvall was appointed vice chair of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, which reviews legislation of public utilities. Legislation Duvall authored included Assembly Bill 2110, which would require people to pass a vessel operator exam or class before getting a license to operate boats or other watercraft. He also authored a bill to allow public schools in the state to spend otherwise categorical funding more flexibly. =Political positions= The conservative Capitol Resource Institute gave him a 100% rating, calling him \\"a consistent trooper for the conservative causes\\" who \\"voted time and time again to protect and preserve family values in California\\". According to a voter guide that The Orange County Register published for the 2006 State Assembly Republican primary for the 72nd district, Duvall supported limiting government expenditures and housing regulations, the latter of which he believed caused higher housing costs. Regarding developments, he believed in balancing preserving and setting aside open space. An opponent of illegal immigration, he supported tougher border security and enforcement of immigration law. In 2008, Duvall supported Proposition 8, which reversed the California Supreme Court decision recognizing same-sex marriage in the state. = Extramarital affairs and resignation = During a lull in a July 8, 2009 appropriations committee meeting, Duvall had a conversation with fellow Republican committee member and Assemblyman Jeff Miller, wherein he described two different affairs he was currently engaged in with two women, one of them being a lobbyist. Duvall's microphone was \\"live,\\" and his graphic descriptions, although whispered, were recorded. The story was first reported on September 8, 2009 by KCAL 9 News, which aired footage of the conversation. The same evening, the OC Weekly published an in-depth piece covering Duvall's affairs, including some of the more graphic parts of the conversation which KCAL was unable to air. One of the affairs raised ethical questions, as it was with a lobbyist for Sempra Energy and Duvall was Vice Chairman of the Assembly's Utility and Commerce Committee. Duvall resigned during the noon hour on September 9, less than 15 hours after the story broke. On November 2, the FBI announced it had conducted an investigation of Duvall's actions, and that he would not face federal charges. In response, Sempra Energy reinstated lobbyist Heidi Barsuglia, the woman with whom Duvall allegedly had an affair. Barsuglia released a statement saying: \\"This experience has been a professional and personal nightmare. I did nothing whatsoever illegal or unethical with former Assemblyman Duvall or anyone else.\\" She stated that she was considering legal action against Duvall.

Description Chinese patent medicines generally consist of extracted condensed pills called teapills, and are usually small, spherical, and black. They are called teapills because the herbs are cooked into an herbal tea to make the pills. Honey or water pills made from ground raw herbs are also a popular format in China, and they tend to be larger and are slightly to significantly softer than teapills. Modern teapills are created from herbs extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius; 212 degrees Fahrenheit) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed and a small amount of raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then cut into tiny pieces by a machine, and a small amount of excipients are added for a smoother and a more consistent exterior. The products are then made as pills. Honey pills and water pills have been made since ancient times by combining several dried herbs and other ingredients, which are grounded into powder, mixed with a binder and traditionally formed into pills by hand. Modern honey or water pills are formed into pills by machine. The binder is traditionally honey for honey pills. For water pills the binder may simply be water, or may include another binder, such as molasses. Modern manufacturers still produce many patent formulas as honey or water pills, such as Wuji Baifeng Wan, a popular honey pill formula to \\"nourish qi and blood\\", to strengthen the body. Patents may come in other forms such as dripping pills, liquids, syrups, powders, granules, instant teas, and capsules. Companies make Chinese patent medicines both within and outside China. Like other patent medicines, they are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, \\"patent\\" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name have the same proportions of ingredients, and are manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia's monograph on that particular formula, which is mandated by Chinese law. Each monograph details the exact herbal ingredients that make up the patent formula, usually accompanied by the specific tests that should be used for correct herb identification, such as thin layer chromatography (TLC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the percentage of each ingredient, and specific cautions and contraindications. The monograph also details the manufacturing methods that must be followed, how to process and cook the herbs, often including specific requirements for finished product testing including authenticating and assessing the potency of the formula with active ingredient markers where known, as well as testing for dissolution time and content uniformity. All good manufacturing practice (GMP) certified factories must also test for heavy metal levels and microbials for all patent medicines they produce.State Pharmacopoeia Commission of the PRC (2005). \\"Pharmacopoeia of The People's Republic of China (Volume I)\\". Chemical Industry Press. However, many patents do not list all ingredients, presumably to protect the secrecy of the formula. An example of this is Yunnan Baiyao, a popular formula used to stop bleeding, whose ingredients have never been revealed. This is an acceptable practice in China, where no other protection exists to protect family or \\"secret\\" Chinese herbal formulas. In western countries, there is considerable variation of ingredients and in the proportions of ingredients in products sharing the same name. This is because the Chinese government allows foreign companies to apply for modifications of patent formulas to be sold outside of China. For example, Hebei brand Lifei pills contain Kadsura (feng sha teng) and Morus (sang ye), whereas Plum Flower brand Li Fei Pian contains Schizandra (we wei zi) and Gecko (ge jie) instead. Another example is Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan. The Lanzou brand uses Citrus (ju hong). The Lanzhou Foci Min Shan brand and the Plum Flower brand do not, but use Ginger (sheng jiang). Herbal formulas Chinese classic herbal formulas form the basis of Chinese patent medicine. These are the basic herbal formulas that students of traditional Chinese medicine learn. Many of these formulas are quite old. For example, \\"Liu Wei Di Huang Wan\\" (ÂÖ≠Âë≥Âú∞ÈªÑ‰∏∏ li√π w√®i d√¨ hu√°ng w√°n) was developed by Qian Yi (Èí±‰πô Qi√°n Y«ê) (c. 1032‚Äì1113 CE). It was published in the \\"Xiao'er Yao Zheng Zhi Jue\\" (also known as \\"Key to Therapeutics of Children's Diseases\\" Â∞èÂÑøËçØËØÅÁõ¥ËØÄ xi«éo√©r y√†o zh√®ng zh√≠ ju√©) in 1119 by Qian Yi's student. Although Liu Wei Di Huang Wan can be prepared as a raw herb decoction (or herbal tea), it was originally created to be made into honey pills. The last word in Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, \\"Wan\\" (‰∏∏) means \\"pill\\". Criticisms =Heavy metal contamination= Some Chinese patent medicines were tested and found to contain high to dangerous levels of heavy metals.Adulteration and Contaminants in Chinese Patent Medicines The most common heavy metals found were mercury, lead, and arsenic. These ingredients can cause serious medical problems. =Pharmaceutical adulterants= Some Chinese patent medicines were found to contain pharmaceutical drugs such as decongestants, analgesics or antihistamines. The most common Chinese patent medicines found to carry pharmaceutical drugs were for the treatment of asthma, pain, and arthritis. Many contaminants and drug adulterants named in the context of herbal medicine is intentionally added and declared on product labels. The mercury salt cinnabar (), the arsenic salt realgar () and the strychnine containing Strychnos nux-vomica () are used traditionally and kept in China despite the known harm and little proven benefit. In the case of drugs, the entry for \\"Vitamin C/Lonicera/Forsythia tablet\\" () in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP) calls for 105 mg of paracetamol and 1.05 mg of chlorpheniramine maleate each pill. Such a combination is common for Chinese cold medicine. In a more hidden case, the herb Ephedra naturally contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and is required by the ChP to have more than 0.8% of the two decongestants (as hydrochloride salts) in its dry weight.Chinese Pharmacopoeia. 2015. . 1:50,137,320,336,1570. =Prohibited ingredients= Some Chinese patent medicines contain ingredients which are banned in other countries. The two most common prohibited herbs are Ma Huang (È∫ªÈªÑ m√° hu√°ng) (Ephedra) and Ban Xia (ÂçäÂ§è b√†n xi√†) (Pinellia). On 30 December 2003, the FDA in the US announced a ban (effective 12 April 2004), on these herbs from all dietary supplements.http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/ephedra/february2004/ Sales of Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids (Ephedra) Prohibited] Traditional Chinese herbal remedies are exempt from this law. Regulation =In Taiwan= In modern-day Taiwan, regulations to address the criticisms are introduced due to Chinese patent medicines being prescription drugs since the 1970s and a part of the public health system since 1995. Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopeia () provides information on acceptable herbs in Taiwan. Heavy metal contamination and pesticide residue All Chinese patent medicine products sold in aTaiwan must pass a heavy metal limitation test and pesticide residue test according to Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopeia. There are several manufacturers in Taiwan certified ISO 17025 Lab, for example: Sun-Ten (), Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Chinese: ËéäÊùæÊ¶Æ) Pharmaceutical adulterants According to Taiwanese government law, products licenses will be suspended if there exists pharmaceutical adulterants. Furthermore, it could cause GMP certificate to be cancelled. In Taiwan, those main manufacturer in order to export products abroad, few of them has passed PIC/S GMP audition. For example: Sun-Ten (), Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Chinese: ËéäÊùæÊ¶Æ). = In China = As with more traditional formulae, standards for Chinese patent medicine are found in Volume 1 of Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Some of the resultant medications require a prescription to purchase, while others are considered over-the-counter drugs. Heavy metal limits are present for a few herbs, although they tend to be laxer than those defined for foods. As listed above, intentionally added heavy metals and drug adulterants are found in many products. References *Fratkin, Jake (2001). Chinese Herbal Patent Medicines.

FYE programs often foster the participation of students in co-curricular events such as common reads, concerts, art exhibits, and guest lectures. Depending on the school, the course can last anywhere from two weeks to a full school year. Some larger universities, such as the University at Albany, SUNY, through their Project Renaissance Program,\\"Project Renaissance Program,\\" SUNY Albany website. create a \\"small college\\" feel by allowing freshmen to do their first-year courses in one section of the university. While the origins of the program remain unclear, many people attribute the start of the First-Year Seminar to the University of South Carolina, which houses the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition and holds a series of workshops for colleges and universities to better their own first-year programs.  History  Originally, Boston College was where the first Freshman Orientation class was offered in the year 1888. Reed College, based in Portland, Oregon, was the first institution to offer a course for credit when, in 1911, they offered a course that was divided into men-only and women-only sections that met for 2 hours per week for the year. In May 1970, University of South Carolina President Thomas Jones faced campus unrest and violence. In the aftermath he vowed to create a new course designed to \\"bond students to the institution and transform the way that undergraduate students were taught.\\"\\"Our History,\\" University of South Carolina National Resource Center for The First-Year Experience and Students in Transition website. Accessed June 2, 2015. In 1972, Carolina introduced \\"University 101\\", designed to \\"improve the educational experiences of first-year college students.\\" Carolina's program became a model for colleges and universities across the country, and in 1982, representatives from 175 schools came to Carolina to meet about the first-year experience. In 1983, Carolina's University 101 faculty director, John N. Gardner, organized the first Annual Conference on the Freshman Year Experience. In 1986, Carolina partnered with the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic to produce the first International Conference on the First-Year Experience. Also in 1986, Carolina established the National Resource Center; as it broadened its focus it underwent a number of name changes, settling on the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition in 1998. As the Center states on its website:  Typical structure  Many of the colleges and universities that use the program require that all incoming freshmen take the freshman seminar; other schools have the program as optional, but recommended. Most first-year seminars are a semester long and start at student orientation. From orientation, students enroll in the course, which gives them a variety of college experiences, from tours of the campus to a breakdown of how to study for tests. Many schools even offer students help with purchasing books from the school's bookstore. For instance, as part of Mitchell College's First-Year Experience (FYE) program for transitioning into college, first-year students are assigned to Freshman Interest Groups (FIGs) in their first semester according to a common academic interest or major. These groups explore the topics and issues related to their chosen path. Those who arrive at Mitchell undecided about their academic route are also grouped together to allow for a broader survey of options. Students are encouraged to communicate their unique perspective and make connections through co-curricular activities. Colby College's outdoor orientation COOT (Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips) program is designed to ease new students' transition into college and introduce them to Maine's cultural and natural resources. COOT features an on-campus orientation and a variety of trips, including hiking trips at Acadia National Park and Mount Katahdin canoe trips on the Kennebec and Moose Rivers, and other trips around the state. There are over 60 different trips, designed to appeal to incoming students with a variety of interests and fitness levels, and more \\"front country\\" trips have been added in recent years, including service- and arts-oriented options such as an organic farm stay and a challenge course.\\"Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips,\\" Colby College website. Accessed June 2, 2015. COOT leaders are chosen from upperclass students who apply for these positions, and are expected to help the students both during and after the trip with the adjustment to campus life. In 1991, Norman Adler initiated the Penn Reading Project at the University of Pennsylvania, an integrative introduction to liberal learning for college freshmen newly arriving on campus. Subsequently, Freshman Reading Projects have been adopted widely as part of the first-year experience at many college campuses.\\"PRP Archive,\\" University of Pennsylvania website. Accessed June 2, 2015.  Program credits  As a standard for most first-year seminars, many colleges give students one to two credits for completing the program, such as UC Irvine.\\"Freshman Seminar Program,\\" UC Irvine website. Accessed May 28, 2015. Many schools, such as the State University of New York at Old Westbury in Old Westbury, New York, merge the program into a second course which helps to satisfy New York's general education requirement. In addition, the school recently introduced its Civic Engagement program, which is designed to allow students to participate in community service as a part of its First-Year Experience program.  Workshops and training  The University of South Carolina hosts a seminar every year in which the many colleges and universities which have the First-Year Program get together to improve their own programs, and to offer suggestions to their colleagues on how they might also improve. The workshop is usually a week long and attendance is voluntary.\\"University 101 Programs,\\" University of South Carolina website. Accessed May 28, 2015.  Effectiveness  The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's First-Year Experience program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101). The program aims to assist students in discovering their purpose, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with a plan for their future. The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six appreciative advising stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program.Hutson, B.L; Atwood, J.A. (November 2006). \\"Outcome evaluation to support freshman orientation program.\\" For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first-semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first-semester GPA of 2.72. J.N. Gardner, member of The Journal of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers and author of The freshman-year experience, emphasized the importance of having courses that focus on the first few weeks of college. During this time is most likely when students will make the decision to drop out, due to the increase of feeling personal independence and habit-forming, as well as forming relationships that they will continue throughout their college careers. Gardner also suggested that things such as curriculum modifications, academic advisement, faculty led freshman-level courses instead of graduate student-led, living/learning environments, peer counseling, and special freshmen administrative units improve the student's freshman year.

Plot summary The novel is set at the start of the twentieth century and deals with the orphaned boy √Ålfgr√≠mur, his adoptive grandparents, and the small, tolerant community of misfits and eccentrics they gather around them at Brekkukot, their cottage in Reykjav√≠k. As √Ålfgr√≠mur begins to encounter the minor politicians, businessmen and social-climbers of the growing town of Reykjav√≠k he starts to question his future as a fisherman's grandson, and is increasingly fascinated by Gar√∞ar H√≥lm, the celebrated Icelandic \\"world singer\\" whose sporadic returns to Iceland encourage √Ålfgr√≠mur to pursue his own personal goals of self-expression. He discovers the true value of his boyhood experiences only as he sets out on a path that will take him away from them forever.  Trivia  The boy's name, √Ålfgr√≠mur, is explained in the book as a compound of √Ålf (elf) and gr√≠mur (a poetic word for 'night') meaning 'he who spends the night with the elves'. The original name of the book in Icelandic is Brekkukotsann√°ll (Annals of Brekkukot). The book also had an admirable young lady named Bl√¶r, which is why Bj√∂rk Ei√∞sd√≥ttir chose this name for her daughter born in 1997, although it was officially a masculine name.

It is sometimes considered one of the earliest deconstructivist buildings, although Gehry denies this. The Gehry Residence is located in Santa Monica, California. In 1977, Frank and Berta Gehry bought a pink bungalow that was originally built in 1920. Gehry wanted to explore with the materials he was already using ‚Äî metal, plywood, chain link fencing, and wood framing. In 1978, he chose to wrap the outside of the house with a new exterior while still leaving the old exterior visible. He hardly touched the rear and south facades and to the other sides of the house he wedged in tilted glass cubes. Then, in the fall of 1991, he chose to remodel due to the needs of a growing family that by then included two teenage boys. Many of Gehry's neighbors were not happy at the unusual building being built in their neighborhood. As of 2016, the house is still owned by Frank Gehry.

As a councilwoman, she made statements that her priorities included neighborhood improvement, public safety, attracting jobs and businesses to the cities‚Äô central corridors, job training programs for adults, after-school programs for youth and expanding senior programs. Richardson established the Sixth District Master Plan, a strategic guideline for development in the area. Other significant accomplishments during her council tenure include securing the first funding for alley maintenance by the city of Long Beach, initiating the planning process for a Senior Transportation Program in the Central Area of Long Beach. While serving on the city council, Richardson joined the staff of Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante and served as his Southern California director for five years.

She was asked by anti-war groups to support a Long Beach City Council resolution declaring the city's opposition to the Iraq War. She did not support this resolution, but cosponsored a resolution declaring support for local members of the National Guard. Once hostilities began, she stated that it was important to support the troops. She argued that once Saddam Hussein was caught and executed, American troops should have come home.

As part of the bill, telecommunications companies that have allegedly acted illegally in allowing the Bush Administration to spy on customers will be protected from prosecution. The administration's surveillance of U.S. citizens and residents is part of the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. Political campaigns Richardson defeated State Senator Jenny Oropeza and 9 other Democrats in the June 26 primary election to win her party's nomination, the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. On August 21, Richardson won more than 65% of the vote in a four-way race against the nominees of the Republican Party, Green Party, and Libertarian Party. She easily won a full term in 2008, and was reelected in 2010, in both cases against only nominal Republican opposition Redistricting for the 2012 elections significantly altered California's congressional map. Richardson had previously represented portions of inland Los Angeles and inland Long Beach, all of Carson, Compton and Signal Hill, as well as parts of other municipalities. However, her old district was split almost in half, with the bulk of her territory becoming the 44th District. While Richardson's home in Long Beach was drawn into the new 47th District, she moved her residence into the 44th district because its demographics were more similar to the old 37th; like the 44th, it is majority black and Latino. Fellow Democrat Janice Hahn, who had previously represented the neighboring 36th District, had her home drawn into the 44th as well. The California Democratic Party endorsed Hahn for the seat. In the all-party primary, Hahn defeated Richardson with 60 percent of the vote to Richardson's 39 percent‚Äîwhich was all the more remarkable since, on paper, the district's demographics were more favorable to Richardson. On November 6, 2012, Hahn easily beat Richardson by 20 percentage points. Controversies Richardson was accused of receiving preferential treatment by a bank when it rescinded an erroneous foreclosure of her house, but was cleared of wrongdoing by the House Ethics Committee, in accordance with the recommendations of the Office of Congressional Ethics. Upon the death of Juanita Millender-McDonald, her predecessor in the 37th Congressional District, Richardson seems to have put all of her funds into winning the resulting special election, and as a result stopped paying her mortgages. Following the special election, she made agreements with Washington Mutual to catch up payments on her 3 properties, but the bank violated this agreement with regard to the Sacramento property when it foreclosed on the house. The bank then rescinded the foreclosure, causing the controversy. After her election to the California Assembly, Richardson purchased a home in Sacramento with no money down Richardson borrowed the $15,000 for the closing costs from the seller. and a subprime mortgage. According to county records, Richardson received a default notice and Notice of Trustee's Sale in late 2007. In December 2007, Richardson was behind in payments by more than $18,000.Capitol Weekly: The Newspaper of California State Government and Politics According to the couple that sold the home to Richardson, Richardson was not maintaining the home. Sharon Helmar has stated: \\"The neighbors are extremely unhappy with her. She didn't mow the lawn or take out the garbage while she was there. We lived there for a long time, 30 years, and we had to hide our heads whenever we came back to the neighborhood.\\" The real estate broker who bought Richardson's Sacramento house at the foreclosure sale accused her of receiving preferential treatment because her lender had issued a notice to rescind the sale. James York, owner of Red Rock Mortgage, said he would file a lawsuit against Richardson and her lender, Washington Mutual, but settled out of court with the terms not disclosed. Richardson had not been making payments on the property for nearly a year, and had also gone into default on her two other houses in Long Beach and San Pedro. Richardson, D-Long Beach, has said that the auction should never have been held, because she had worked out a loan modification agreement with her lender beforehand and had begun making payments. The House Ethics Committee, following the recommendations of the Ethics Office, found no wrongdoing other than by Richardson's Mortgage Broker, who was referred to the Justice Department for mortgage fraud, which was widespread at the time the mortgage was made. Mistaken foreclosures despite paid-up recovery agreements, such as the one that happened to Richardson, were also becoming rampant during this period. Richardson also initially did not disclose a loan from a strip club owner when on the City Council, public records show. Richardson was speaker of the House pro tempore during the November 29, 2010 lame-duck session of Congress. She initially refused to recognize, then relented to allow committee ranking member Steve Buyer to talk despite the failure of the committee chairman to appear. She was seen discussing with the House parliamentarian and aides how to handle the failure of the committee chairman to appear to present his bill under rules and procedures that minorities in both parties have often denounced when out of power in the House, as Boyer did when recognized in this instance. On November 3, 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that Richardson would face an ethics inquiry related to possible illegal use of staffers. On November 4, 2011, Richardson claimed that the House Ethics Committee, composed of five members from the Democratic Party and five members from Republican Party, singled her out for investigation because she is African-American. The Ethics Committee leaders did announce that the vote to establish a four-member investigative subcommittee was unanimous. =Decisions of House committee and full House= On August 1, 2012, the House Ethics Committee issued its report about accusations of improper use of staff. It found that Richardson had broken federal law, violated House rules and obstructed the Committee's own investigation. She was found guilty on seven counts of violating House rules by improperly pressuring her staff to campaign for her, destroying evidence and tampering with witness testimony. Richardson was ordered to pay a fine of $10,000 within four months and promised to require staffers who work on her campaign to sign a waiver stating that they haven‚Äôt been pressured to do so. The committee also called on the full House to reprimand Richardson. The following day, the full House duly voted to accept the Committee report and reprimand Richardson.John H.

Swann (born 1952) is a professor of social and personality psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. He is primarily known for his work on identity, self and self-esteem, but has also done research on relationships, social cognition, group processes, accuracy in person perception and interpersonal expectancy effects. He received his Ph.D. in 1978 from the University of Minnesota and undergraduate degree from Gettysburg College. Research =Self-verification theory= Swann devised self- verification theory, which focuses on people‚Äôs desire to be known and understood by others. Once people develop firmly held beliefs about themselves, the theory suggests that they will come to prefer that others see them as they see themselves‚Äîeven if their self-views are negative. Swann and his colleagues have found this tendency in many experiments. For example, married people with negative self-views are more committed to the relationship and less likely to divorce if their spouse views them negatively. Recent research has applied this theory to understanding phenomena ranging from reactions to procedural justice in organizations, the productivity of members of work groups and teams, and extreme group behavior, such as fighting for one's group. There is a tension between self-enhancement (the drive for a positive self-image) and self-verification, which reinforces even the negative aspects of a self-image. Swann and colleagues have found that emotional reactions favor enhancement, while more thoughtful processes favor verification. They also found that people are more likely to seek enhancement early on in a relationship, but verification as the relationship develops. =Identity negotiation= More recently Swann has contributed to identity negotiation theory. Identity negotiation refers to the processes whereby people in relationships reach agreements regarding \\"who is who.\\" Once reached, these agreements govern what people expect of one another and the way they relate to one another. As such, identity negotiation processes provide the interpersonal \\"glue\\" that holds relationships together. Identity negotiation theory has been used to examine how people work or study together in groups, especially the role of diversity. = Identity fusion = Identity fusion is a visceral sense of ‚Äúoneness‚Äù with a group and its individual members that motivates personally costly, pro-group behaviors. Past approaches, most notably social identity theory, have assumed that when people align with groups they are bound to the group by collective ties to the group category. Fusion theory emphasizes the ways in which alignment to groups can be based on fit with the personal self and attachment to other group members. Strongly fused persons are especially inclined to endorse pro-group action when either the personal or the social self is salient, when physiological arousal is high, or when they perceive that group members share essential qualities (e.g., genes, core values) with one another. Moreover, feelings of personal agency, perceptions of family-like ties to other group members, and a sense of group-related invulnerability mediate the link between identity fusion and pro-group behaviors. All of these effects emerge while controlling for identification, which predicted extreme sacrifice for the group weakly if at all. Moreover, identity fusion is associated with actual extreme behaviors, such as willingness to volunteer for front-line duty among Libyans during the 2011 revolution. By specifying some of the key antecedents of extreme pro- group behavior as well as the role of the personal self and relational, family like ties in such behavior, the identity-fusion approach fills an important explanatory gap left largely unaddressed by earlier perspectives on group processes. SESP Swann was the 2010 President of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.

The UAW reached similar deals with the other members of the Big Three automakers, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. The UAW agreed to a long-term contract, which protected automakers from annual strikes, and it gave up the right to bargain over some issues in exchange for extensive health, unemployment, and pension benefits; expanded vacation time; and cost- of-living adjustments to wages. The contract shaped labor-management relations in the auto industry for decades, and it was used as a model for labor- corporation agreements in a variety of other industries.seekingmichigan.org -Retrieved 2012-07-04  Prior negotiations  Upon the conclusions of World War II, both the automakers and autoworkers were free to address grievances that had accumulated during the war. The two sides would enter multiple contract negotiations in the decades following the end of the war. Reuther‚Äôs Treaty of Detroit was a notable achievement for the UAW that followed three rounds of negotiations since 1945. The first negotiation after the war began with a strike of 320,000 GM workers on November 21st, 1945, with Reuther demanding a 30% wage increase and a pledge from GM not to raise car prices. The strike lasted 113 days and was ultimately undermined by settlements reached with Ford and Chrysler, who agreed to wage increases from 18 to 18.5 cents. The United Electrical Workers (UE), representing 30,000 GM employees, the United Steel Workers, and the rubber workers also settled for 18.5 cents, forcing the UAW to follow suit. Despite the failure of the strike, Reuther had been seen as an aggressive leader throughout and he capitalized on the image to attain the presidency of UAW. The 1946 strike, which became known as the First Round, was followed by a Second Round of negotiations in 1947. The 1947 contract with General Motors included a major change, the cost-of-living allowance (COLA). The first scheme of its kind in a mass-production industry, COLA pegged a workers wage to the cost-of-living index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The third round was negotiated by Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer of the union and achieved a thirteen-cent-an-hour increase in wages from the Chrysler Corporation. Reuther began the Fourth Round in January 1949, which would result in his Treaty of Detroit. Goals After World War II, health and welfare had become critical issues in labor contracts across industries, and Reuther chose pensions and company-funded medical care as the focus of his bargaining in 1949. Since inflation in the postwar economy had reduced the significance of the $32 a month benefit from Social Security, the issue of pensions had become more important than ever. Historically, retirement security was an individual responsibility. In particular, since the recipient of a pension was, by definition, no longer an employee, companies had argued that a pension could not be their responsibility. Reuther believed that retirement did not end a worker‚Äôs association with a union, and workers deserved a lifelong pension. Reuther was adamant that the pension plans be fully funded, actuarially sound (the amount set needed to be set to the life expectancies of the pensioners), and noncontributory, with the full cost borne by the company. The automakers were principally concerned with negotiating a longer contract to protect the manufacturers from annual strikes, avoid the costs of undergoing negotiations each year, and give control over long-term scheduling of production, model changes, and tool and plant investment. Negotiations with Ford and Chrysler Under Reuther, the UAW had adopted a strategy of collective bargaining in which the UAW negotiated with and threatened to strike only one of the Big Three automakers. Once concessions had been earned at one, in the next round of negotiations, the other two were likely to match terms of the first. Reuther called this strategy \\"getting a foot in the door.\\" In 1949, Reuther chose Ford as his first target. In 1947, Ford had offered its workers a choice between a contributory pension plan and wage increases. While the UAW took wage increases at the time, Reuther suspected that Ford might be most amenable to a pension plan. New management and an aging workforce at Ford also suggested that the UAW would have the best chances of success with Ford. In September 1949, to avoid a strike, Ford agreed to pay $20 million a year to pay the entire cost of pensions. Workers with 30 years' service would receive $100 a month. Ford agreed that the pension plan would be both fully funded and actuarially sound. After its success with Ford, the UAW moved on to Chrysler. While Chrysler was willing to match the $100-a-month pension plan, it refused to fund it fully. Not willing to yield on this point, Reuther initiated a strike that would last 104 days. It was during this strike that Reuther coined the phrase \\"too old to work and too young to die,\\" referring to financially unsupported retirees. Chrysler gave in after nearly three months and $1 billion lost in sales. Agreement with GM Seeking to avoid the cost Chrysler had paid, GM negotiated a contract with the UAW a few weeks after Chrysler in 1950. The contract included a fully funded, actuarially sound pension plan of $125 a month, including Social Security. The contract continued COLA and raised the annual improvement factor to 4 cents an hour. Also, GM agreed to cover one half of the cost for workers and their families. The UAW, in return, agreed to a five- year term of the contract. Fortune named the contract the \\"Treaty of Detroit\\" and noted Reuther‚Äôs impressive negotiating abilities. Ford and Chrysler soon negotiated contracts along the same lines as the Treaty. Impact The Treaty affected the lives of many laborers and influenced labor contracts and law making in the following decades. The \\"Treaty\\" made pensions and healthcare a permanent part of labor contracts. In 1974, funding was made a requirement for all plans. The Treaty, along with other gains made by the union over the next decade moved autoworkers in America into the middle class, with wages since the war nearly doubling and home ownership becoming common among laborers.

Murrill was known to travel extensively to describe the mycota of Europe and the Americas. He traveled along the East Coast, Pacific Coast, Mexico and the Caribbean. Although Murrill was a very influential person at the NYBG, having worked his way up to become assistant director in 1908, his rather eccentric personality caused problems with his job. He went on annual collecting trips to Mexico, the Caribbean, Europe, and South America, sometimes, without informing any of his colleagues prior.

Family Life  Murrill married Edna Lee Lutrell on September 1, 1897. The two had an only on child during their marriage, a boy born in 1899, who died in his infancy. This death would contribute to problems further on in their marriage, ultimately resulting in divorce in 1924.  A Life Changing Event  For eight months in 1924, Murrill went on another trip to Europe but seemed to disappear; no one was even sure if he was still alive. The Garden filled his position; it was later discovered that Murrill had a kidney condition and was actually in a rural French hospital during these eight months, unable to send word back to his wife or the NYBG. When he finally returned to New York, Murrill was extremely upset to learn that he had no job. The NYBG, in compensation, gave him a position that was much reduced in both pay and prestige. During this time, he was hospitalized intermittently for ‚Äúnervous instabilities and physical exhaustion‚Äù. His wife, feeling neglected, divorced him during this time. Heartbroken and professionally dissatisfied, he then returned to his home state of Virginia to live in a log cabin, financially and mentally troubled. Little was known about Murrill‚Äôs whereabouts until, in 1926, George F Weber, a mycologist and plant pathologist from University of Florida, was visiting a Gainesville resort called the Tin Can Tourist Camp along with his wife. In the recreation hall, they came across an unkempt and haggard, yet ‚Äútall, robust, dignified, pleasant stranger providing a piano concert for the transient tourists‚Äù. Weber soon recognized the stranger as none other than Murrill. It came to light later that Murrill had been frequently visiting Florida over the past years during the winter to collect mushrooms. The following spring, while collecting in Florida, Murrill was afflicted with another kidney flare up. He spent the rest of the spring, and into the summer, recovering in the University of Florida Infirmary. Having recovered, Murrill found that it was now the peak of the Florida mushroom season, and asked Weber for some collecting supplies, a desk, and a microscope. Weber set Murrill up with a permanent desk and research space in the only spot he could find‚Äîa landing on a stairway near the University Herbarium. Weber also arranged for a remaining $600 in publication royalties to be sent to Murill and managed to get a small stipend for him. Murrill permanently relocated to Florida from Virginia, building a small house, and spending the last 34 years of his life there. Murrill began collecting all over the campus and surrounding areas for the next 34 years of his life, describing many new species of fungi, of which 700 type-collections are deposited in the University of Florida Institute for Food and Agricultural Science‚Äôs Fungal Herbarium (FLAS). Murrill became a familiar figure around the Gainesville campus, known by many simply as ‚Äúthe Mushroom Man‚Äù. During the mushroom season, he would spend the morning gathering fungi in and around the campus, then return to his desk to describe and curate the collections. He would rarely return home during this time, but would work late into the evening, then fall asleep on a couch in the student union. The next morning the incoming students would rouse him and often treat him to breakfast. While active in the community around Gainesville, in both scientific and cultural activities, for the next few decades, he eventually slowed although his enthusiasm never diminished. While reporting to the University Infirmary for an illness, he collapsed as the doctor was examining him. While Murrill was in his final days, he said that he did not want to die because there was too much interesting work yet to be done, yet he knew very well that the time had come. William Alphonso Murrill died at the age of 88 on December 25, 1957, and along with him, the last surviving member of the early American Mycological Society.  Education  Murrill obtained his Ph.D. at Cornell University in 1897, working under the supervision of G.F. Atkinson, a leading authority on the taxonomy of Basidiomycetes. He started working as assistant curator at New York Botanical Garden herbarium and library in 1904, eventually becoming a curator (1919‚Äì1924). He also worked at the University of Florida.At the University of Florida  Publications  Murrill had 510 publications, including mycological and botanical papers and notes, general notes, miscellaneous reports, reviews, biographies, and popular articles on natural history.Weber G.

Its goal is to increase code legibility by creating a domain-specific language (DSL). The term was coined in 2005 by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler. Implementation A fluent interface is normally implemented by using method chaining to implement method cascading (in languages that do not natively support cascading), concretely by having each method return \`this\` (\`self\`). Stated more abstractly, a fluent interface relays the instruction context of a subsequent call in method chaining, where generally the context is * Defined through the return value of a called method * Self-referential, where the new context is equivalent to the last context * Terminated through the return of a void context Note that a \\"fluent interface\\" means more than just method cascading via chaining; it entails designing an interface that reads like a DSL, using other techniques like \\"nested functions and object scoping\\". History The term \\"fluent interface\\" was coined in late 2005, though this overall style of interface dates to the invention of method cascading in Smalltalk in the 1970s, and numerous examples in the 1980s. A common example is the iostream library in C++, which uses the \`<<\` or \`>>\` operators for the message passing, sending multiple data to the same object and allowing \\"manipulators\\" for other method calls. Other early examples include the Garnet system (from 1988 in Lisp) and the Amulet system (from 1994 in C++) which used this style for object creation and property assignment. Examples =C#= C# uses fluent programming extensively in LINQ to build queries using \\"standard query operators\\". The implementation is based on extension methods. var translations = new Dictionary { {\\"cat\\", \\"chat\\"}, {\\"dog\\", \\"chien\\"}, {\\"fish\\", \\"poisson\\"}, {\\"bird\\", \\"oiseau\\"} }; // Find translations for English words containing the letter \\"a\\", // sorted by length and displayed in uppercase IEnumerable query = translations .Where (t => t.Key.Contains(\\"a\\")) .OrderBy (t => t.Value.Length) .Select (t => t.Value.ToUpper()); // The same query constructed progressively: var filtered = translations.Where (t => t.Key.Contains(\\"a\\")); var sorted = filtered.OrderBy (t => t.Value.Length); var finalQuery = sorted.Select (t => t.Value.ToUpper()); Fluent interface can also be used to chain a set of method, which operates/shares the same object. Instead of creating a customer class, we can create a data context which can be decorated with fluent interface as follows. // Defines the data context class Context { public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public string Sex { get; set; } public string Address { get; set; } } class Customer { private Context _context = new Context(); // Initializes the context // set the value for properties public Customer FirstName(string firstName) { _context.FirstName = firstName; return this; } public Customer LastName(string lastName) { _context.LastName = lastName; return this; } public Customer Sex(string sex) { _context.Sex = sex; return this; } public Customer Address(string address) { _context.Address = address; return this; } // Prints the data to console public void Print() { Console.WriteLine(\\"First name: {0} Last name: {1} Sex: {2} Address: {3}\\", _context.FirstName, _context.LastName, _context.Sex, _context.Address); } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { // Object creation Customer c1 = new Customer(); // Using the method chaining to assign & print data with a single line c1.FirstName(\\"vinod\\").LastName(\\"srivastav\\").Sex(\\"male\\").Address(\\"bangalore\\").Print(); } } =C++= A common use of the fluent interface in C++ is the standard iostream, which chains overloaded operators. The following is an example of providing a fluent interface wrapper on top of a more traditional interface in C++: // Basic definition class GlutApp { private: int w_, h_, x_, y_, argc_, display_mode_; char argv_; char *title_; public: GlutApp(int argc, char argv) { argc_ = argc; argv_ = argv; } void setDisplayMode(int mode) { display_mode_ = mode; } int getDisplayMode() { return display_mode_; } void setWindowSize(int w, int h) { w_ = w; h_ = h; } void setWindowPosition(int x, int y) { x_ = x; y_ = y; } void setTitle(const char *title) { title_ = title; } void create(){;} }; // Basic usage int main(int argc, char argv) { GlutApp app(argc, argv); app.setDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLEGLUT_RGBAGLUT_ALPHAGLUT_DEPTH); // Set framebuffer params app.setWindowSize(500, 500); // Set window params app.setWindowPosition(200, 200); app.setTitle(\\"My OpenGL/GLUT App\\"); app.create(); } // Fluent wrapper class FluentGlutApp : private GlutApp { public: FluentGlutApp(int argc, char argv) : GlutApp(argc, argv) {} // Inherit parent constructor FluentGlutApp &withDoubleBuffer;() { setDisplayMode(getDisplayMode()  GLUT_DOUBLE); return *this; } FluentGlutApp &withRGBA;() { setDisplayMode(getDisplayMode()  GLUT_RGBA); return *this; } FluentGlutApp &withAlpha;() { setDisplayMode(getDisplayMode()  GLUT_ALPHA); return *this; } FluentGlutApp &withDepth;() { setDisplayMode(getDisplayMode()  GLUT_DEPTH); return *this; } FluentGlutApp &across;(int w, int h) { setWindowSize(w, h); return *this; } FluentGlutApp &at;(int x, int y) { setWindowPosition(x, y); return *this; } FluentGlutApp &named;(const char *title) { setTitle(title); return *this; } // It doesn't make sense to chain after create(), so don't return *this void create() { GlutApp::create(); } }; // Fluent usage int main(int argc, char argv) { FluentGlutApp(argc, argv) .withDoubleBuffer().withRGBA().withAlpha().withDepth() .at(200, 200).across(500, 500) .named(\\"My OpenGL/GLUT App\\") .create(); } =Java= The jOOQ library models SQL as a fluent API in Java. An example of a fluent test expectation in the jMock testing framework is:Martin Fowler, \\"FluentInterface\\", 20 December 2005 mock.expects(once()).method(\\"m\\").with( or(stringContains(\\"hello\\"), stringContains(\\"howdy\\")) ); Author author = AUTHOR.as(\\"author\\"); create.selectFrom(author) .where(exists(selectOne() .from(BOOK) .where(BOOK.STATUS.eq(BOOK_STATUS.SOLD_OUT)) .and(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID.eq(author.ID)))); The fluflu annotation processor enables the creation of a fluent API using Java annotations. The JaQue library enables Java 8 Lambdas to be represented as objects in the form of expression trees at runtime, making it possible to create type-safe fluent interfaces, i.e., instead of: Customer obj = ... obj.property(\\"name\\").eq(\\"John\\") One can write: method(customer -> customer.getName()  \\"John\\") Also, the mock object testing library EasyMock makes extensive use of this style of interface to provide an expressive programming interface. Collection mockCollection = EasyMock.createMock(Collection.class); EasyMock .expect(mockCollection.remove(null)) .andThrow(new NullPointerException()) .atLeastOnce(); In the Java Swing API, the LayoutManager interface defines how Container objects can have controlled Component placement. One of the more powerful \`LayoutManager\` implementations is the GridBagLayout class which requires the use of the \`GridBagConstraints\` class to specify how layout control occurs. A typical example of the use of this class is something like the following. GridBagLayout gl = new GridBagLayout(); JPanel p = new JPanel(); p.setLayout( gl ); JLabel l = new JLabel(\\"Name:\\"); JTextField nm = new JTextField(10); GridBagConstraints gc = new GridBagConstraints(); gc.gridx = 0; gc.gridy = 0; gc.fill = GridBagConstraints.NONE; p.add( l, gc ); gc.gridx = 1; gc.fill = GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL; gc.weightx = 1; p.add( nm, gc ); This creates a lot of code and makes it difficult to see what exactly is happening here. The \`Packer\` class provides a fluent mechanism, so you would instead write: JPanel p = new JPanel(); Packer pk = new Packer( p ); JLabel l = new JLabel(\\"Name:\\"); JTextField nm = new JTextField(10); pk.pack( l ).gridx(0).gridy(0); pk.pack( nm ).gridx(1).gridy(0).fillx(); There are many places where fluent APIs can simplify how software is written and help create an API language that helps users be much more productive and comfortable with the API because the return value of a method always provides a context for further actions in that context. =JavaScript= There are many examples of JavaScript libraries that use some variant of this: jQuery probably being the most well known. Typically, fluent builders are used to implement \\"database queries\\", for example in https://github.com/Medium/dynamite : // getting an item from a table client.getItem('user-table') .setHashKey('userId', 'userA') .setRangeKey('column', '@') .execute() .then(function(data) { // data.result: the resulting object }) A simple way to do this in JavaScript is using prototype inheritance and \`this\`. // example from https://schier.co/blog/2013/11/14/method-chaining-in-javascript.html class Kitten { constructor() { this.name = 'Garfield'; this.color = 'orange'; } setName(name) { this.name = name; return this; } setColor(color) { this.color = color; return this; } save() { console.log( \`saving \${this.name}, the \${this.color} kitten\` ); return this; } } // use it new Kitten() .setName('Salem') .setColor('black') .save(); =Scala= Scala supports a fluent syntax for both method calls and class mixins, using traits and the \`with\` keyword. For example: class Color { def rgb(): Tuple3[Decimal] } object Black extends Color { override def rgb(): Tuple3[Decimal] = (\\"0\\", \\"0\\", \\"0\\"); } trait GUIWindow { // Rendering methods that return this for fluent drawing def set_pen_color(color: Color): this.type def move_to(pos: Position): this.type def line_to(pos: Position, end_pos: Position): this.type def render(): this.type = this // Don't draw anything, just return this, for child implementations to use fluently def top_left(): Position def bottom_left(): Position def top_right(): Position def bottom_right(): Position } trait WindowBorder extends GUIWindow { def render(): GUIWindow = { super.render() .move_to(top_left()) .set_pen_color(Black) .line_to(top_right()) .line_to(bottom_right()) .line_to(bottom_left()) .line_to(top_left()) } } class SwingWindow extends GUIWindow { ... } val appWin = new SwingWindow() with WindowBorder appWin.render() =Raku= In Raku, there are many approaches, but one of the simplest is to declare attributes as read/write and use the \`given\` keyword. The type annotations are optional, but the native gradual typing makes it much safer to write directly to public attributes. class Employee { subset Salary of Real where * > 0; subset NonEmptyString of Str where * ~~ /\\\\S/; # at least one non-space character has NonEmptyString $.name is rw; has NonEmptyString $.surname is rw; has Salary $.salary is rw; method gist { return qq:to[END]; Name: $.name Surname: $.surname Salary: $.salary END } } my $employee = Employee.new(); given $employee { .name = 'Sally'; .surname = 'Ride'; .salary = 200; } say $employee; # Output: # Name: Sally # Surname: Ride # Salary: 200 =PHP= In PHP, one can return the current object by using the \`$this\` special variable which represent the instance. Hence \`return $this;\` will make the method return the instance. The example below defines a class \`Employee\` and three methods to set its name, surname and salary. Each return the instance of the \`Employee\` class allowing to chain methods. class Employee { private string $name; private string $surName; private string $salary; public function setName(string $name) { $this->name = $name; return $this; } public function setSurname(string $surname) { $this->surName = $surname; return $this; } public function setSalary(string $salary) { $this->salary = $salary; return $this; } public function __toString() { $employeeInfo = 'Name: ' . $this->name . PHP_EOL; $employeeInfo .= 'Surname: ' . $this->surName . PHP_EOL; $employeeInfo .= 'Salary: ' . $this->salary . PHP_EOL; return $employeeInfo; } } # Create a new instance of the Employee class, Tom Smith, with a salary of 100: $employee = (new Employee()) ->setName('Tom') ->setSurname('Smith') ->setSalary('100'); # Display the value of the Employee instance: echo $employee; # Display: # Name: Tom # Surname: Smith # Salary: 100 =Python= In Python, returning \`self\` in the instance method is one way to implement the fluent pattern. It is however discouraged by the language‚Äôs creator, Guido van Rossum, and therefore considered unpythonic (not idiomatic). class Poem(object): def __init__(self, title: str) -> None: self.title = title def indent(self, spaces: int): \\"\\"\\"Indent the poem with the specified number of spaces.\\"\\"\\" self.title = \\" \\" * spaces + self.title return self def suffix(self, author: string): \\"\\"\\"Suffix the poem with the author name.\\"\\"\\" self.title = f\\"{self.title} - {author}\\" return self >>> Poem(\\"Road Not Travelled\\").indent(4).suffix(\\"Robert Frost\\").title ' Road Not Travelled - Robert Frost' =Swift= In Swift 3.0+ returning \`self\` in the functions is one way to implement the fluent pattern. class Person { var firstname: String = \\"\\" var lastname: String = \\"\\" var favoriteQuote: String = \\"\\" @discardableResult func set(firstname: String) -> Self { self.firstname = firstname return self } @discardableResult func set(lastname: String) -> Self { self.lastname = lastname return self } @discardableResult func set(favoriteQuote: String) -> Self { self.favoriteQuote = favoriteQuote return self } } let person = Person() .set(firstname: \\"John\\") .set(lastname: \\"Doe\\") .set(favoriteQuote: \\"I like turtles\\") Immutability It's possible to create immutable fluent interfaces that utilise copy-on-write semantics. In this variation of the pattern, instead of modifying internal properties and returning a reference to the same object, the object is instead cloned, with properties changed on the cloned object, and that object returned. The benefit of this approach is that the interface can be used to create configurations of objects that can fork off from a particular point; Allowing two or more objects to share a certain amount of state, and be used further without interfering with each other. =JavaScript example= Using copy-on-write semantics, the JavaScript example from above becomes: class Kitten { constructor() { this.name = 'Garfield'; this.color = 'orange'; } setName(name) { const copy = new Kitten(); copy.color = this.color; copy.name = name; return copy; } setColor(color) { const copy = new Kitten(); copy.name = this.name; copy.color = color; return copy; } // ... } // use it const kitten1 = new Kitten() .setName('Salem'); const kitten2 = kitten1 .setColor('black'); console.log(kitten1, kitten2); // -> Kitten({ name: 'Salem', color: 'orange' }), Kitten({ name: 'Salem', color: 'black' }) Problems = Errors can not be captured at compile time = In typed languages, using a constructor requiring all parameters will fail at compilation time while the fluent approach will only be able to generate runtime errors, missing all the type-safety checks of modern compilers. It also contradicts the \\"fail-fast\\" approach for error protection. =Debugging and error reporting= Single-line chained statements may be more difficult to debug as debuggers may not be able to set breakpoints within the chain. Stepping through a single-line statement in a debugger may also be less convenient. java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(10).rewind().limit(100); Another issue is that it may not be clear which of the method calls caused an exception, in particular if there are multiple calls to the same method. These issues can be overcome by breaking the statement into multiple lines which preserves readability while allowing the user to set breakpoints within the chain and to easily step through the code line by line: java.nio.ByteBuffer .allocate(10) .rewind() .limit(100); However, some debuggers always show the first line in the exception backtrace, although the exception has been thrown on any line. =Logging= One more issue is with adding log statements. ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(10).rewind().limit(100); E.g. to log the state of \`buffer\` after \`rewind()\` method call, it is necessary to break the fluent calls: ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(10).rewind(); log.debug(\\"First byte after rewind is \\" + buffer.get(0)); buffer.limit(100); This can be worked around in languages that support extension methods by defining a new extension to wrap the desired logging functionality, for example in C# (using the same Java ByteBuffer example as above) static class ByteBufferExtensions { public static ByteBuffer Log(this ByteBuffer buffer, Log log, Action getMessage) { string message = getMessage(buffer); log.debug(message); return buffer; } } // Usage: ByteBuffer .Allocate(10) .Rewind() .Log( log, b => \\"First byte after rewind is \\" + b.Get(0) ) .Limit(100); = Subclasses = Subclasses in strongly typed languages (C++, Java, C#, etc.) often have to override all methods from their superclass that participate in a fluent interface in order to change their return type. For example: class A { public A doThis() { ... } } class B extends A{ public B doThis() { super.doThis(); return this; } // Must change return type to B. public B doThat() { ... } } ... A a = new B().doThat().doThis(); // This would work even without overriding A.doThis(). B b = new B().doThis().doThat(); // This would fail if A.doThis() wasn't overridden. Languages that are capable of expressing F-bound polymorphism can use it to avoid this difficulty. For example: abstract class AbstractA> { @SuppressWarnings(\\"unchecked\\") public T doThis() { ...; return (T)this; } } class A extends AbstractA {} class B extends AbstractA { public B doThat() { ...; return this; } } ... B b = new B().doThis().doThat(); // Works! A a = new A().doThis(); // Also works. Note that in order to be able to create instances of the parent class, we had to split it into two classes ‚Äî \`AbstractA\` and \`A\`, the latter with no content (it would only contain constructors if those were needed). The approach can easily be extended if we want to have sub-subclasses (etc.) too: abstract class AbstractB> extends AbstractA { @SuppressWarnings(\\"unchecked\\") public T doThat() { ...; return (T)this; } } class B extends AbstractB {} abstract class AbstractC > extends AbstractB { @SuppressWarnings(\\"unchecked\\") public T foo() { ...; return (T)this; } } class C extends AbstractC {} ... C c = new C().doThis().doThat().foo(); // Works! B b = new B().doThis().doThat(); // Still works. In a dependently typed language, e.g. Scala, methods can also be explicitly defined as always returning \`this\` and thus can be defined only once for subclasses to take advantage of the fluent interface: class A { def doThis(): this.type = { ... } // returns this, and always this. } class B extends A{ // No override needed! def doThat(): this.type = { ... } } ... val a: A = new B().doThat().doThis(); // Chaining works in both directions. val b: B = new B().doThis().doThat(); // And, both method chains result in a B!

Up until his death, he chartered out his boat Cricket II for those seeking the thrill of big game fishing. He started out as a shark hunter but then later became a shark conservationist. Mundus' early techniques, which included killing whales merely for chum and harpooning sharks (practices which are outlawed today), earned him criticism even at the time. In the last few years of his life Mundus had campaigned for shark fishermen to catch and release their prey, even going as far as to publish a conservation book titled White Shark Sam Meets The Monster Man. Mundus died on September 10, 2008, in Honolulu due to complications from a heart attack he suffered on September 6, the day he returned home to Hawaii after spending the summer in Montauk. According to his obituary he had spent the last night in Montauk aboard the Cricket II which had made him famous and had his heart attack in the Hawaii airport immediately after returning. Early life Mundus, was born in Long Branch, New Jersey and moved to Brooklyn when he was young. In 1945, he began a charter fishing operation in Brielle, New Jersey, with the Cricket. In 1947, he had the Cricket II custom-built. The Pelican Mundus moved to Montauk in 1951 saying he wanted to start charters for bluefish. In his first year at Montauk he played an important role in the rescue and retrieval of the Pelican, an overloaded party boat in which 45 of 64 on board perished after capsizing in a squall, including its captain Eddie Carroll. He was among the second wave of searchers, and helped tow the hull of the Pelican to port with ten dead bodies still trapped inside. The disaster was the worst in Montauk recreational history and led to numerous laws regulating the industry. Monster Fish Mundus soon discovered that bluefish were not plentiful in Montauk waters, but sharks were. \\\\- Great White Hunter by John Capone - Dan's Papers - August 2004 Mundus started what he called \\"Monster Fishing\\" with boats leaving the port at Lake Montauk. Mundus with his colorful character became immediately popular. He further helped his reputation by catching a 4,500 pound great white shark by harpoon (the weight was estimated without the shark having been weighed). In 1986 he and Donnie Braddick caught a 3,427-pound great white about 28 miles off Montauk, and only 18 miles from Block Island,Downie, Robert M. Block Island History of Photography 1870-1960s, page 242, Volume 2, 2008 which still holds the record, not only for the largest shark, but for the largest fish of any kind ever caught by rod and reel. The capture of the shark was controversial at the time, with some saying the shark was feeding on a whale when caught (which would have negated the so-called \\"official record\\"). The International Game Fishing Association ruled that the catch was legitimate based on photographs. In 1991 the U.S. Coast Guard said that Mundus' license had expired and he had to reapply. He initially attempted to sell the Cricket II and moved to Hawaii. The sale did not go through although the boat would be operated by others. He officially retired as a charter captain in 1997. In the years before his death he would come back to Montauk for its shark tournaments and would ride along on higher priced Cricket II excursions. He died in Hawaii shortly after returning from Montauk. Colourful character Mundus' reputation was enhanced by his eccentric personality and ostentatious displays of the killed sharks (something he would say later he regretted). \\"He always said the charter business was 90 percent show and 10 percent go,\\" said Chris Miller, a Montauk resident who had seen him on the docks. He coloured his big toenails red and green for port and starboard. He wore a hoop earring and an Australian slouch hat and a shark tooth necklace. In 2005, he appeared in a Shark Week documentary, Shark Hunter: Chasing the Great White, which was narrated by actor Roy Scheider, who played Martin Brody in Jaws and Jaws II. The special told of Mundus' early career, how he became the inspiration for Quint, his world record capture, and how he turned from shark hunter to shark conservationist. Mundus also joined Chris Fallows and other shark conservationists in viewing great whites in their natural habitat. In one such viewing of the breaching great whites (made famous in the Air Jaws series of specials), during which Fallows brought out a seal decoy he had humorously named \\"Frank\\" after Mundus (a hat like the ones Mundus usually wore was even added to it) and they used it to fool them into breaching. He said that the name of his boat was inspired by the fact that his profile resembled that of Jiminy Cricket. Inspiration for Quint in Jaws Mundus is often said to be the inspiration for charter captain Quint in the book and film Jaws. The novel's author, Peter Benchley denied that Mundus was the inspiration and Mundus was notably not credited as a source in the movie. Nevertheless, at least one Montauk resident has said that Mundus was definitely the inspiration for the character. John Ebel, a mate on the Cricket II said that Benchley had privately acknowledged that Mundus was the inspiration but had publicly denied the association for legal reasons. They note the following: *Mundus and Benchley had gone on shark hunting expeditions out of Montauk prior to the 1974 novel and were filmed together aboard the Cricket II in a 1974 episode of American Sportsman. *In the book the fictional Jaws community of Amity Island is described as being between Bridgehampton, New York and East Hampton, New York, the latter the location of Montauk. *Quint's boat was said to be berthed at a place called \\"Promised Land.\\" Mundus' boat at one time was docked at the fish factory called Promised Land in Napeague, New York immediately west of Montauk. *Joe Gaviola, a Montauk businessman, was quoted as saying, \\"He is Quint. If you read the book, he was everything Frank was. Benchley spent weeks fishing with him. Give me a break. He is Quint.\\" *Both Frank and Quint possessed a hatred for the two-way radio. In comparisons to his character in Jaws, his website quotes him: What did you think about the movie Jaws? : It was the funniest and the stupidest movie I've ever seen because too many stupid things happened in it. For instance, no shark can pull a boat backwards at a fast speed with a light line and stern cleats that are only held in there by two bolts. And I've never boiled shark jaws. If you do, you'll only end up with a bunch of teeth at the bottom of your bucket because the jaw cartilage melts. Is it true that the shark hunter \\"Quint\\" in Jaws is based on you? In what ways does he resemble you? :Yes, he was. He knew how to handle the people the same way I did. He also used similar shark fishing techniques based on my methods. The only difference was that I used hand held harpoons after field- testing harpoon guns and discovering that they didn't work: the dart would pull out after hitting the fish.

She received her B.A. in Political Science, with honors, from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. She and her husband have two children.  State Assembly  Krusick was first elected in 1983, to represent the 17th Assembly District. Prior to the 2011 Redistricting Act, the district covered the southwest side of Milwaukee and most of Greenfield. The district now includes West Milwaukee, and parts of Milwaukee's south side, West Allis and Greenfield, but only about one-third of Krusick's old district. Krusick was a member of the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business and the Assembly Committee on Aging and Long- Term Care.

She was one of two veteran Milwaukee-area Democratic incumbents (the other being Jason Fields) to be unseated in that August primary by challengers who argued that the incumbent was too conservative to represent the district properly.Marley, Patrick and Alison Bauter. \\"Longtime state legislators Fields, Krusick lose in primaries\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel August 14, 2012Henzl, Ann-Elise. \\"Daniel Riemer Ousts Longtime Representative Peggy Krusick\\" WUWM News August 15, 2012  Write-in campaign by Krusick  In September 2012 it was reported that Krusick was considering running a write-in campaign against Riemer in the November general election, and it was confirmed that she had contacted staff of the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board about the mechanics of such an effort, but had not yet filed registration documents for such a run.Bice, Daniel. \\"Krusick considers write-in campaign\\" No Quarter Blog, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel September 14, 2012 On October 2, it was officially confirmed that she was running as a registered write-in candidate (under Wisconsin law, write-in candidates must register with the state to have their votes be individually counted, rather than lumped in with other write-in votes).

It was the third part of Wenders' \\"Road Movie trilogy\\" which included Alice in the Cities (1974) and The Wrong Move (1975). It was the unanimous winner of the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film is about a projection-equipment repair mechanic named Bruno Winter (R√ºdiger Vogler), who meets the depressed Robert Lander (Hanns Zischler), who has just been through a break-up with his wife, after he drives his car into a river in a half-hearted suicide attempt. Bruno allows Robert to ride with him while his clothes dry, rarely speaking while Bruno drives along the Western side of the East German border in a repair truck, visiting worn-out movie theaters. While out on the road, Bruno and Robert encounter several people in various states of despair, including a man whose wife has committed suicide by driving her car into a tree. Robert also drops in on his elderly father to berate him for disrespecting Robert's mother. After Bruno and Robert have a minor brawl after a conversation about Robert and his wife, Robert finally leaves Bruno, though Bruno later spots him riding a train. Bruno continues his visits to theatres, including one that no longer screens films because the owner regards modern films as exploitative.

Reception  In Germany, the Lexicon of International Film wrote that \\"Wim Wenders' film combines the captivating clarity and epic serenity of a classic Bildungsroman with the mythic qualities of American genre film‚Ä¶Directed in a craftmansly, impeccable style, space itself allows for the unfolding of characters, thoughts and landscapes.\\" Wolf Donner of Die Zeit said that \\"Motions, sequences of confusingly beautiful and suggestive shots, highly poetic compositions and technical perfection make up the particular charm of this three-hour-long black-and-white film. [...] Scenes shot in a nocturnal mist, in the half-glow of the evening and morning, a profound depth of field, a variety of lenses, iridescent effects in the interaction of filters, natural and artificial light, long shots where entire landscapes seem illuminated: these formal qualities always simultaneously bring out the dual meaning of this itinerancy, the nowhereness of this trip, the between-space outside of ordinary reference to reality. The artisanly virtuosity of \\"Kings of the Road\\" will get cinephiles hooked.\\"Wolf Donner in Die Zeit March 5, 1976 Film Critic Derek Malcolm ranked Kings of the Road 89 on his list of his 100 favourite movies. Malcolm says that Wenders \\"achieves a palpable sense of time, place and atmosphere, and of how everybody is affected by their tiny spot in history.\\" It has been compared to Easy Rider and Two-Lane Blacktop and called the ultimate road movie.Wakeman. p. 1171. Richard Combs wrote that \\"alienation is not really Wenders subject, although his lonely, self-obsessed heroes might suggest as much.\\"Wakeman. 1172.

History KCWT went on the air as an independent station in 1984 as the \\"First Television Station in North Central Washington\\", airing a mix of off-network sitcoms, movies, dramas, and classic cartoons. A newscast was added at 5 and 10 pm weeknights to compete with the stations in Seattle and Spokane, to better reflect the views of the Wenatchee area that felt neglected by the two larger markets. They also carried a weeknight Bingo game to get people to tune to the station. In the fall of 1984, the station started running a 1-hour anime block in the afternoons. A year later, they briefly found success when it became one of the first stations in the United States to air the Robotech saga. The show was so popular, that when it was pulled from the schedule after its initial run, a letter writing campaign began to bring it back. They reran it for another year. KCWT became a satellite of KAYU in 1986, mostly simulcasting its entire schedule. Along with the Fox affiliation and new branding as \\"Fox 27\\", the quality of programming improved, with first-run syndicated shows as the Disney Afternoon block and Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 1989, KCWT dropped its Fox affiliation (which later moved to K53CY), and became an independent once again, filling out their programming schedule from the Channel America service. A year later, after new ownership took over, the station became an affiliate of Trinity Broadcasting Network. In 1993, KCWT was forced off the air after its transmitter (located at Mission Ridge) malfunctioned. It was never repaired. (Its cable channel slot, which varied on TCI systems in the region, was later occupied by the then-new premium channel Starz!-Encore 8 in 1994.) By then the station ceased operations and returned its license back to the FCC. Metropolitan Wenatchee became part of the Seattle DMA afterward. KCWT's offices (which were located at 32 B North Mission Street, above KPQ-AM and FM) later housed Columbia River Broadcasting's radio cluster of KYVF (later KKXA, now KWLN), KSSY (now KKRV) and KKRT til they relocated in 2008, after KPQ's acquisition by Cherry Creek Radio.

It is the second novel in the Queen's Thief series that Turner inaugurated with The Thief in 1996.  Setting  The books are set in a Byzantine-like imaginary landscape, reminiscent of ancient Greece and other territories around the Mediterranean. The action takes place in the countries of Eddis, Attolia, and Sounis. The characters‚Äô names are also Greek, and references are made to actual Greek authors, but this is fantasy, not historical fiction. The gods of Turner's pantheon, ruled by the Great Goddess Hephestia, are her own, and her world possesses such items as guns, pocket watches, printed books and stained glass windows.  Plot summary  Eugenides, the Thief of Eddis, has been caught spying on the Queen of Attolia. He expects to be hanged, but the Queen instead resorts to an ancient traditional custom ‚Äì she has his right hand struck off with a sword. This shocking act sets the plot in motion. Maimed and broken-hearted, Eugenides returns to Eddis and wallows in a deep depression. Attolia, an apparently heartless ruler, secretly regrets her action, but must live with the consequences of it. The countries of Eddis and Attolia are soon at war, with neighboring Sounis playing both sides. Also manipulating the situation is Attolia‚Äôs ambassador from the Mede Empire, Nahuseresh, who pays extravagant attention to the beautiful Queen of Attolia while serving his own agenda. Attolia juggles her overattentive ambassador, the rebellious barons who do not believe a woman can rule alone, and a bloody, costly war. Meanwhile, a visit from the magus of Sounis awakens Eugenides to the fact that his country is at war. His cousin, the Queen of Eddis, may lose her throne and her country, forcing him to take on a new role. Eugenides once again begins to scheme, though he is seemingly different now. He attempts to shutter his heart just as Attolia does. Eugenides succeeds in stealing the Magus from Sounis, and temporarily turning Sounis and Attolia against each other. This gives the tiny country of Eddis a small break as Sounis and Attolia focus on each other instead of Eddis.  Reviews  The Queen of Attolia received starred reviews from the Horn Book, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly, as well as favorable reviews in other review publications.

Early life Thomas Teevan was born in Limavady, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in 1927. He was educated at Limavady Academy and Queen's University Belfast. He was a lecturer in law. Brief political career In 1950, a vacancy arose in the Belfast West constituency, owing to the disqualification of the Reverend J. G. MacManaway for being an Anglican priest despite the Church of Ireland being disestablished. Teevan was selected as Unionist candidate for the ensuing by- election. He was elected on 29 November 1950 over the Northern Ireland Labour Party candidate, Jack Beattie, a former MP for the seat, by 913 votes. Teevan was aged only 23 and became Baby of the House upon taking the oath on 5 December 1950. His tenure lasted only 330 days, and he lost the seat to Beattie by just 25 votes in the 1951 general election. Aged only 24, he thus became the youngest person to leave the House of Commons in modern times. MacManaway himself died in November 1951, aged 53. Early death Teevan qualified as a barrister in Northern Ireland in 1952. He also served as Chairman of Limavady Urban District Council.

As their marriage was a morganatic one, none of their children were in the line of succession to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Still, they represent the senior agnatic line of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. The head of house bears the title of duke with the style of Highness, with all other members titled as princes and princesses with the style of Serene Highness. Establishment and history The House of Hohenberg was established by imperial decree of Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria when, upon the couple's marriage in 1900, he created Francis Ferdinand's wife F√ºrstin von Hohenberg (Princess of Hohenberg) in her own right with the style of Durchlaucht (Serene Highness) and the specification that this name and title should also be borne by her descendants. In 1909, the Emperor raised Sophie to the more senior title of Herzogin von Hohenberg (Duchess of Hohenberg) with the superior style of Hoheit (Highness). Since that title had been granted ad personam, it expired upon Sophie's assassination in 1914. In 1917, Emperor Charles of Austria granted the eldest son of Francis Ferdinand and Sophie the title of duke with the style of Highness. The other members of the family retained the titles of prince and princesses with the lesser style of Serene Highness. Thus, Maximilian became the first Duke of Hohenberg, with the dukedom being hereditary according to primogeniture in the male line. Following the collapse of the monarchy, the Austrian nobility, along with hereditary titles and such nobiliary particles as von, were abolished by law in 1919. In 1938, several members of the family who were opposed to Adolf Hitler were arrested by the Nazis and sent to Dachau concentration camp, most notably Maximilian and his brother Ernst. The former head of the family, Georg, was ambassador of the Republic of Austria to the Holy See during part of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. He was also a Knight of the Golden Fleece. Members of the Hohenberg family are not only descended from, and married into, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, but are also related through marriage to several other European dynasties, including the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg and the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. They also descend from King George II of Great Britain through his daughter Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange and are therefore distantly related to the British Royal Family.  Residences  The Hohenberg family still owns Artstetten Castle in Lower Austria, and parts of this castle are open to the public for visits. Former residences of the family include Konopi≈°tƒõ ch√¢teau in Bohemia. Artstetten Castle was selected to provide the main theme for an Austrian 10 euro commemorative coin, minted on 13 October 2004. The reverse shows the entrance to the crypt of the Hohenberg family. There are two portraits on the left, showing Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg.
