It is the type species of the genus Clavulina. The commonly used species name cristata was coined in 1790 by Danish mycologist Theodor Holmskjold (as Ramaria cristata). However, Linnaeus described apparently the same fungus as Clavaria coralloides in Species plantarum in 1753.See bottom of p. 1182 of Carolus Linnaeus \\"Species Plantarum, exhibentes ...\\" (1753), available on-line at the Missouri Botanical Garden's digital library. Therefore, according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the name Clavulina coralloides should be used in preference to Clavulina cristata,See the Index Fungorum entry .See Kuo, M. (2007, April) the MushroomExpert.Com Web site entry: . although the latter name is in more common use. Description Fruit bodies, which are generally white- to cream-colored, can be up to tall, and broad. The coral \\"arms\\" are sparingly branched (3‚Äì4 times), 2‚Äì4 mm wide, smooth, and sometimes wrinkled longitudinally. The tips are cristate, having small pointed projections, and will often darken with age or in dry weather.Google Books The fruit bodies have no distinctive odor, and a mild taste. The fruit bodies may have a darker color either due to natural variation (whereby the appearance of this species may approach and be confused with C. cinerea) or because of infection by a microscopic fungus, Helminthosphaeria clavariarum. =Microscopic features= The spores are white, roughly spherical, thick- walled, non-amyloid, smooth, and have dimensions of 7‚Äì11 by 6‚Äì10 ¬µm. Basidia are club-shaped, 60‚Äì80 by 6‚Äì8 ¬µm, and 2-spored. Cystidia are absent. Sterigmata, the slender projections of the basidium that bear the spores, may be straight or curved, and up to 7‚Äì8 ¬µm long. Google Books Spores Habitat Clavulina cristata is found growing solitary or in clusters on the ground (sometimes on rotten wood) in both coniferous and hardwood forests. It is a common mushroom, and typically fruits from late summer to winter. Edibility This fungus is edible, Google Books but the tough flesh and insubstantial fruit bodies make it unappetizing for some individuals. It is considered excellent by some. Lookalikes Several other coral fungi have overall appearances similar to Clavulina cristata, making identification confusing. Clavulina rugosa is unbranched or sparingly branched. Clavulina cinerea is usually darker in color. Ramaria stricta has parallel branches and grows on wood. Chemistry In addition to the major fatty acid components, palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, C. cristata contains two unusual fatty acids, cis-9, cis-14-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, and the conjugated cis-9, trans-11, trans-13, cis-15-octadecatetraenoic acid (commonly known as Œ±-parinaric acid).Endo S, Zhiping G, Takagi T.

It is the country's largest voluntary organisation for girls and young women with 61,375 members in 3,500 units throughout Scotland. History The origins of the Guiding and Scouting movement date back to 1907 when Robert Baden-Powell formed the Boy Scouts as a training organization for boys. The first Patrol of Girl Scouts in Scotland was formed in Glasgow in 1908 with links to the 1st Glasgow Scout Patrol, similar patrols were being set up all over the UK. This led to a more specific demand for \\"something for the girls\\" at the Crystal Palace Rally in 1910. The first registered Girl Guides in Scotland were the 1st Peebles Patrol formed in 1910 and was founded by Lady Erskine. The first meeting occurred on 26 February 1910 at Venlaw Castle, Tweeddale. The Girl Guides were officially launched in the same year by Baden-Powell‚Äôs sister Agnes Baden-Powell, and Imperial Headquarters set up. A Scottish Headquarters Committee was formed in 1912 and the Girl Guide movement established in Scotland. The Girl Guides Association for Scotland was established in 1933 with its own constitution. Administration The earlier membership badge features the Scottish thistle, one of the national emblems of Scotland Girlguiding Scotland has active units in six regions that cover all of Scotland: The six regions are further subdivided into a total of 38 geographical counties plus a 39th non-geographical county for Lone members. These in turn are divided into divisions, divisions may then be split into districts. Each district comprises a number of individual units covering all sections. How districts and divisions work together varies and is dependent on a number of factors- location, number of units and members, historic tradition and events and current leadership teams and may change over time. Each area works towards delivering the best Guiding experience for their particular circumstances under the overall guidance from Girlguiding Scotland and Girlguiding UK. Regions and counties The 39 counties are arranged in the following format Lothian and Borders Region * Edinburgh, East Lothian, West Lothian, Midlothian, Roxburghshire, Tweed Valley, Berwickshire Central Region * Fife, Forth Valley, Clackmannanshire, Angus, Perth & Kinross, Dundee Strathclyde Region * City of Glasgow, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Dumbartonshire, North Lanarkshire, West Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire Highlands & Islands Region * Shetland, Orkney, Western Isles, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross-shire, Inverness-shire, Argyll Grampian Region * Aberdeen, Kincardine & Deeside, Gordon, Banff & Buchan, Moray Ayrshire & South West Region * Ayrshire North, Ayrshire South, Dumfries-shire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Wigtownshire The 39th County of Lones is not Geographically located as it provides support Scotland wide and therefore sits separate from the regional structure. In all other ways it is identical to the other counties. Membership In 2016 the membership was over 60,000 members and registered volunteers and is the largest voluntary organisation for girls and women in Scotland. There were approximately 10,000 Rainbows, 22,000 Brownies, 14,000 Guides, 2000 Senior Section young women, and over 9,000 Adult members. About one in three eight-year-old girls in Scotland is a Brownie, and half the women born in Scotland have belonged to Girlguiding Scotland at some point in their lives. The adult members give over 1 million hours in voluntary service each year ranging from face to face time with young members through to attending and delivering training, accounts, record-keeping, membership support & planning. This is the equivalent to 550 full-time jobs. Girlguiding Scotland is a charity and is funded by fundraising, grants, membership subscriptions and a trading arm. Girlguiding Scotland became independent in 1933 and in 1939 moved its headquarters to Coates Crescent, Edinburgh where it remains today. The figure head in Scotland is the Scottish Chief Commissioner who serves for a term of five years. Dinah Faulds became Scottish Chief Commissioner on 1 September 2007. She was succeeded by Sue Walker in 2012. The current Scottish Chief Commissioner is Dr Moira Mckenna who took over in 2017. Girlguiding Scotland Locations Netherurd is Girlguiding Scotland‚Äôs home from home in the Scottish Borders. It is a Georgian Mansion in grounds of 30 acres amid the Border Hills of Peeblesshire and was given to the Girl Guides in the 1940s by Major Thomson. The centre includes accommodation in the main house, the Garden House, a small number of new wigwam style cabins and 5 campsites. The centre offers a number of outdoor activity options including high and low ropes courses, water activities and archery; there are facilities to deliver training and indoor activities across the site. The Centre is located 25 miles south of Edinburgh and 42 miles from Glasgow.

A younger son of Abu Sa'id al-Jannabi, the founder of the Qarmatian state, Abu Tahir became leader of the state in 923, after ousting his older brother Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id. He immediately began an expansionist phase, raiding Basra that year. He raided Kufa in 927, defeating an Abbasid army in the process, and threatened the Abbasid capital Baghdad in 928 before pillaging much of Iraq when he could not gain entry to the city. In 930, he led the Qarmatians' most notorious attack when he pillaged Mecca and desecrated Islam's most sacred sites. Unable to gain entry to the city initially, Abu Tahir called upon the right of all Muslims to enter the city and gave his oath that he came in peace. Once inside the city walls the Qarmatian army set about massacring the pilgrims, taunting them with verses of the Koran as they did so. The bodies of the pilgrims were left to rot in the streets or thrown down the Well of Zamzam. The Kaaba was looted, with Ab≈´ TƒÅhir taking personal possession of the Black Stone and taking it away to al-Hasa. Early life Abu Tahir's father Abu Sa'id was a tribal leader who had initiated the militarization of the Qarmatians. Abu Sa'id began preaching against Sunni Islam around 890 after being taught by his mentor Hamdan Qarmat, a native of Kufa, from whose name the Qarmatian sect is derived. Abu Sa'id started off plundering caravans, traders and Persian hajj pilgrims en route to Mecca before gathering a large following. The Qarmatians soon mobilized an army and set out to lay siege to Basra. However, the governor of Basra learned of their preparations and informed the Abbasid Caliph, al-Muktafi, in Baghdad. The Caliph sent the general Abbas bin Umar to save Basra, but Abbas was defeated and his men executed and the Qarmatian siege was successful in capturing the city. Rise to power Map of eastern and central Arabia in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries Most Arabic sources agree that Abu Sa'id appointed his oldest son, Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id, as his heir, and that Abu Tahir led a revolt against him and usurped his power. Another tradition, by the Kufan anti-Isma'ili polemicist Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Rizam al-Ta'i, on the other hand reports that Abu Sa'id always intended for Abu Tahir to succeed him, and had named Sa'id only as regent. According to this view, Sa'id handed over power to his younger brother (who was then barely ten years old) in 917/918. This report chimes with the story in Ibn Hawqal that Abu Sa'id ha instructed his other sons to obey the youngest. Indeed, it is likely that power was nominally invested among all of Abu Sa'id's sons, with Abu Tahir being the dominant among them. Whatever the true events, Abu'l-Qasim was not executed, but lived until his death in 972. Early reign Soon after succeeding al-Muktafi, Caliph al-Muqtadir recaptured Basra and ordered the re-fortification of the city. Abu Tahir successfully laid siege to the city once more, defeating the Abbasid army. After capturing Basra the Qarmatians proceeded to loot it and then withdrew. Abu Tahir returned again and ravaged it totally, destroying the grand mosque and reducing the marketplace to ashes. He ruled Bahrayn successfully during this time and corresponded with local and foreign rulers as far as north Africa, but continued successfully fighting off assaults from the Persians, who were allied with the Caliph in Baghdad. Conquests Abu Tahir began to frequently raid Muslim pilgrims, reaching as far as the Hijaz region. On one of his raids he succeeded in capturing the Abbasid commander Abu'l-Haija ibn Hamdun. In 926 he led his army deep into Abbasid Iraq, reaching as far north as Kufa, forcing the Abbasids to pay large sums of money in for him to leave the city in peace. On his way home he ravaged the outskirts of Kufa anyway. On his return, Abu Tahir began building palaces in the city of Ahsa, not only for himself but for his fellows, and declared the city his permanent capital. In 928 Caliph al-Muqtadir felt confident enough to once again confront Abu Tahir, calling in his generals Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj from Azerbaijan, Mu'nis al-Muzaffar and Harun. After a heavy battle all were beaten and driven back to Baghdad. Abu Tahir destroyed Jazirah Province as a final warning to the Abbasids and returned to Ahsa. Abu Tahir thought that he had identified the Mahdi as a young Persian prisoner from Isfahan by the name of Abu'l-Fadl al-Isfahani, who claimed to be the descendant of the Sassanid Persian kings.Imagining the End: Visions of Apocalypse By Abbas Amanat, Magnus Thorkell - Page 123Women and the Fatimids in the World of Islam - Page 26 by Delia Cortese, Simonetta CalderiniEarly Philosophical Shiism: The Ismaili Neoplatonism of Ab≈´ Ya ªq≈´b Al-SijistƒÅnƒ´ - Page 161 by Paul Ernest WalkeThe Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy by Yuri StoyanovClassical Islam: A History, 600‚Äì1258 - Page 113 by Gustave Edmund Von Grunebaum Al-Isfahani had been brought back to Bahrayn from the Qarmatians' raid into Iraq in 928. In 931, Abu Tahir turned over the state to this Mahdi- Caliph, who instituted the worship of fire and the burning of religious books during an eighty-day rule. His reign culminated in the execution of members of Bahrayn's notable families, including members of Abu Tahir's family.Farhad Daftary, The Assassin Legends: Myths of the Isma'ilis, IB Tauris, 1994, p21 Fearing for his own life, Abu Tahir announced that he had been wrong and denounced the al-Isfahani as a false Mahdi. Begging forgiveness from the other notables, Abu Tahir had him executed. Invasion of Mecca Abu Tahir desecrated Islam's holiest site after gaining entry (Mecca circa 1778) In 930, Abu Tahir led the Qarmatians' most infamous attack when he pillaged Mecca and desecrated Islam's most sacred sites. Unable to gain entry to the city initially, he called upon the right of all Muslims to enter the city and gave his oath that he came in peace. Once inside the city walls the Qarmatian army set about massacring the pilgrims, riding their horses into Masjid al-Haram and charging the praying pilgrims. While killing pilgrims, he was taunting them with verses of the Koran as they did so, and verses of poetry: \\"I am by God, and by God I am ... he creates creation, and I destroy them\\". Their victims allegedly numbered around some thirty thousand. The bodies of the pilgrims were left to rot in the streets, or thrown down the Well of Zamzam, filling it. The Kaaba was looted, houses were plundered, slaves were seized. Ab≈´ TƒÅhir and his army removed the Black Stone and took it away to al-Hasa. For 21 years, it was in his possession, and it is reported that he daily desecrated it with urine. The attack on Mecca symbolized the Qarmatians' break with the Sunni world; it was believed to have been aimed to prompt the appearance of the Mahdi who would bring about the final cycle of the world and end the era of Islam. Final years and death Abu Tahir resumed the reins of the Qarmatian state and again began attacks on pilgrims crossing Arabia. Attempts by the Abbasids and Fatimids to persuade him to return the Black Stone were rejected. He died in 944, around the age of 38, and was succeeded by his three surviving sons and nephews.

It was a prosperous commercial city on the Loire River at the time of Caesar's conquest of Gaul.  History  This port was the commercial outlet for the grain produced in the Beauce. The city had strong fortifications, and also controlled a bridge over the Loire of considerable economic and strategic importance. Strabo, in his Geography,Strabo, Geography, V, 2, 3 calls the city (ŒöŒÆŒΩŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒΩ) the 'emporium of the Carnutes (œÑ·Ω∏ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒöŒ±œÅŒΩŒøœçŒΩœÑŒøŒΩ ·ºëŒºœÄœåœÅŒπŒøŒΩ ).An emporium was a commercial centre. Kenabon/Cenabum is probably a transcription of a Gallic word with the same sense. For Caesar, it was imperative to secure control of this strategic location. He easily succeeded in establishing a protectorate over the Carnutes whilst assuring himself of the collaboration of Tasgetios, whom he re- established on his ancestors' throne in return for services rendered. However, this situation came to an end after two years, when in 54 BC Tasgetios (considered a traitor) was assassinated and (in the dead of winter) Caesar ordered the occupation of Cenabum by Roman legions.Caesar, De Bello Gallico, book 5, chapter 25 It was Cenabum which gave the signal for the Gallic revolt of which Vercingetorix quickly became the head and which was the motivation for Caesar's seventh Gallic campaign. In 53 BC, Roman merchants who had established themselves at Cenabum, the overseer Gaius Fufius Cita whom Caesar had installed there to control commerce and to ensure his legions' grain supply, and some Roman troops garrisoning the town were all massacred or thrown into the Loire by the Carnutes who had penetrated the city.De Bello Gallico, Book 7, Chapter 3 Rushing back from Italy at phenomenal speed and reaching Sens, Caesar reached Cenabum by forced marches and did not even need to besiege it. On his approach, its population attempted to flee via a wooden bridge linking the two banks of the Loire and, as it collapsed, the Romans scaled the ramparts, massacring all the inhabitants and pillaging and burning down the town.De Bello Gallico, book 7, chapter 11 In the 3rd century AD, the emperor Aurelian rebuilt the ruined town (273-274), reconstructed its defences, detached the new town from the territory of the Carnutes (which it had until then depended upon), and named it after himself Aurelianum or civitas Aurelianorum, which later metamorphosed into the word Orl√©ans.\\"Orl√©ans\\", in Larousse  Notes and references   See also  * Autricum, Chartres, capital city of the Carnutes.

During the Early Modern Period belonging to a guild gave people a voice and was an important part of one's identity. Handicraft producers were linked to one another by a range of social, political, and economic ties.Faroqhi, Suraiya N. 2006. ‚ÄúGuildsmen and Handicraft Producers.‚Äù In The Cambridge History of Turkey, vol. 3, The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839. New York: Cambridge UP, 336. Guilds varied among societies, social class, and genders. There were many misconceptions, differences, as well as similarities between Europe and the Ottoman Empire. There were hierarchies within guilds; sometimes they shared tools, worked together, or worked alone. History In the Early Modern Period, collective identity was mainly established by normative framework, but was also a result of the process of interaction itself, and could be manipulated according to the circumstances.Trivellato, Francesca. 2002. ‚ÄúJews of Leghorn, Italians of Lisbon, and Hindus of Goa. Merchant Networks and Cross-Cultural Trade in the Early Modern Period.‚Äù In Commercial Networks in the Early Modern World. Eds. Diogo R. Curto and Anthony Molho. Badia Fiesolana: European University Institute, 88. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Islamic state created a system, based upon an open- minded interpretation of Islam‚Äôs attitude toward rival monotheists that allowed inclusion for the Christians and Jews who populated the conquered lands of Anatolia and the Balkans.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. Cambridge university press, 1999, 169. The uprising of Istanbul in 1651 was a successful protest against dominant authority. The people marched on the palace and got a powerful religious leader on their side in order to get the vizier to step down. They made their voices heard as a group within their guild, and gave people a sense of pride to belong to a guild. Economic activity within guilds was controlled by political powers. Misconceptions Contrary to general assumption, even in the highly segmented world of the Early Modern Period, trading Diasporas did not simply act as middlemen within dominant societies, but also developed durable commercial ties with other merchant groups outside any institutional structure.Trivellato, Francesca. 2002. ‚ÄúJews of Leghorn, Italians of Lisbon, and Hindus of Goa. Merchant Networks and Cross-Cultural Trade in the Early Modern Period.‚Äù In Commercial Networks in the Early Modern World. Eds. Diogo R. Curto and Anthony Molho. Badia Fiesolana: European University Institute, 89. Not all workers were equal among guilds; many of them had hierarchies which varied among different regions. ‚ÄúThere might be four or five different shoemakers‚Äù.Faroqhi, Suraiya N. 2006. ‚ÄúGuildsmen and Handicraft Producers.‚Äù In The Cambridge History of Turkey, vol. 3, The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839. New York: Cambridge UP, 340. Being a part of a guild was a great way for people to create compositions; it became a major part of one's identity. It was assumed that guilds declined due to repressed innovations but in all truth guilds declined mainly due to political issues. Political authorities were very much a part of production within guilds and controlled all economic factors involved. The prosperity and commercial success of merchants were both a cause and consequence of their domination of urban politics.Wiesner- Hanks, Merry. Early Modern Europe, 1450- 1789. Cambridge university press, 2006, 207. Guilds are often associated with the medieval times in nature but guilds have been along for a long time; even prior the medieval era. Guilds are often associated with Europe only as well, but in fact guilds were a massive part of the Ottoman Empire too. Guilds within the Ottoman Empire and Europe had both their similarities and differences. Europe Metal products created a significant share of the goods handled by European merchants; but their most important commodities were raw and finished cloth.Wiesner- Hanks, Merry. Early Modern Europe, 1450- 1789. Cambridge university press, 2006, 202. Guilds were mainly male dominated but wives and servants still played an important role in production. In some cases woman could even hold formal positions and widows could inherit. Stocking knitting became a common livelihood for the poor in numerous parts of Europe, because it required more or less no capital investment; knitters would use yearn from their own sheep or yarn given by merchants.Wiesner- Hanks, Merry. Early Modern Europe, 1450- 1789. Cambridge university press, 2006, 202. All social classes were allowed, but there still was an evident hierarchy within the guilds. Although, religion was more exclusive; therefore Jews were marginalized. Europe was a very spiritual economy meaning people took care of each other and would help when one another when they could. For example, there were charitable services. Around 1560, Antwerp reached its peak of its success just before the revolt of the Netherlands. The Ottoman Empire In the Ottoman Empire many young woman were hired to unwind cocoon, spin silk threads, and weave.Wiesner- Hanks, Merry. Early Modern Europe, 1450- 1789. Cambridge university press, 2006, 203. Also, there were many woman groups outside of guilds such as cloth makers. Woman would exchange good among each other within female markets. In the late sixteenth century estates of peasant woman living near Konya and owning some jewellery have been stumbled upon, which indicates market links.Faroqhi, Suraiya N. 2006. ‚ÄúGuildsmen and Handicraft Producers.‚Äù In The Cambridge History of Turkey, vol. 3, The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839. New York: Cambridge UP, 338. Guilds were a major part of an economy that was very state dominated like the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman dynasty, especially along its seaboards and borderlands opportunities of commerce tended to diversify economies and put together sundry people and ideas.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. Cambridge university press, 1999, 171. The Ottoman society was extremely mixed main due to conquest and immigration; therefore there was a vast number of religion and Jews were very much included. The Ottoman society was a spiritual economy but not as much as Europe. This was mainly because the Ottoman Empire was mixed religiously meaning there were many different religions mixed within guilds. Guilds were an urban phenomenon. The Ottomans had politics as much as commerce in mind when they negotiated and dispersed capitulations.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. Cambridge university press, 1999, 176. The Ottoman- Venetian conflicts led to international commerce booms in Dubrovnik, Florence, Ancona, and Genoa. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries Florence, Genoa, and Venice vied for control of Ottoman markets and merchandises.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. Cambridge university press, 1999, 187. Primarily in the north and east, Muslim traders dominated several Ottoman exchanges and some international routes.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. Cambridge university press, 1999, 182. There were links between cities and the countryside; although, direct commercial exchanges were probably the exception rather than the rule. The Empire was separated into zones so that civilians were limited to buying only from the source that they had been assigned to.Faroqhi, Suraiya N. 2006. ‚ÄúGuildsmen and Handicraft Producers.‚Äù In The Cambridge History of Turkey, vol. 3, The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839. New York: Cambridge UP, 339. Division of labor In small towns, craft structures might be reasonably simple, for example, with one type or a few types at the most of tailors who made up fabrics into ready to wear clothing; but large cities producers were highly specialized.Faroqhi, Suraiya N. 2006. ‚ÄúGuildsmen and Handicraft Producers.‚Äù In The Cambridge History of Turkey, vol. 3, The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839. New York: Cambridge UP, 339. Different guilds often produced similar goods. ‚ÄúCollective workshops were considered more desirable by more substantial craftsmen themselves‚Äù. This would make collective workshops a suitable means of social control. Every member was monitored very closely; there were influential members but no one completely controlled the productivity of other fellow members.Faroqhi, Suraiya N. 2006. ‚ÄúGuildsmen and Handicraft Producers.‚Äù In The Cambridge History of Turkey, vol. 3, The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839. New York: Cambridge UP, 341. Partnerships existed, although it‚Äôs unknown how common partnerships occurred. A more modern type of labor division also existed during the Early Modern Period. During this time bleachers, twisters, and dyers craftsmen not only owned their own equipment but their own shops as well. A compound product such as silk may go through the hands of many different craftsmen prior to reaching the consumer.

He was the director of the Deland Theater Company in 1833-1861, a travelling theater famous in both Sweden and Finland, and as such an influential and well known figure of the stage life of both countries in the mid 19th-century. He was the founder of the Dramatiska och musikaliska artisternas pensionsf√∂rening ('Retirement Fund for Dramatic and Musical Artists') in 1857.  Life  Pierre Deland was born to Jean Pierre Deland, violinist of the Hovkapellet, and Eva Magdalena Eklund. His paternal grandfather Louis Antoine Deland was from Luxembourg and hairdresser to the queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. He was the nephew of the ballet dancer Louis Deland of the Royal Swedish Ballet, and the brother of the actors Lars Mauritz Deland and Fredrik Deland. =Career= Pierre Deland was active as an interpreter, a private teacher, a clerk and an officer of the Livgardet before entering the stage profession in 1825, when he was engaged at the travelling theater of Carl Gustaf Bonuvier. He continued to the travelling theater of Christoffer Svanberg, where his brothers Lars Mauritz Deland and Fredrik Deland where also employed. In 1831, he married the actress Charlotta de Broen, stepdaughter of Christoffer Svanberg and daughter of Isaac de Broen and Christina Margareta Cederberg, directors of the Djurg√•rdsteatern, and in 1833, he took over the travelling theater company of his wife's stepfather Christoffer Svanberg (thereby making it the Deland theater company). From 1835, the Deland theater company regularly performed in the Djurg√•rdsteatern when they passed Stockholm in summer, and in Finland during the winters. As director of the Deland travelling theatre, he became one of the most famous artists in both Sweden and Finland. The Deland theater company toured both Sweden and Finland and was one of the most significant of the travelling Swedish language theater companies performing in the towns and small cities during the first half of the 19th century, when only the capital had theatres with permanent staff. This was also a period during which several of the small towns and cities erected their first proper theater buildings for the travelling companies to perform in, and the Deland company is known to have inaugurated several of them, such as the Uppsala theater (1840) and the √Öm√•l theatre (1848). In Finland, they regularly performed in the √Öbo Svenska Teater when they passed √Öbo after its foundation in 1839. Perhaps most significantly, the Deland company inaugurated the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki, the Finnish national stage, upon its foundation in the 1860‚Äì61 season, and it was from among its members the first permanent staff of the Finnish national stage was hired. As an actor, Pierre Deland was described as well educated and versatile. He instructed his students in the more realistic way of acting and speaking which was at that time an innovation. Deland was considered best in comedy, though only \\"finer comedy\\", and preferred to stage so called French salon comedies, a popular genre of the time, and one in which he was well suited: according to critics, he was not suited for tragedy, nor for more burlesque forms of comedy. He was considered a capable actor but, however, not one who kept himself updated, and reportedly, his success and popularity in the countryside caused him to stagnate somewhat during the latter part of the career, as he had become unaccustomed to criticism. As a director, he was described as very strict, insisting not only on a high artistic standard from his actors and colleagues, but also upon a strict moral discipline of \\"virtue and order\\" from their private lives as well, and he was therefore not very well liked as an employer, and described as cold and arrogant. In the 1850s, the finances of the Deland company slowly deteriorated because Pierre Deland's choice of plays had become outdated and he was reportedly to unaccustomed to criticism to change it. After his daughter and son-in-law Betty Deland and Knut Alml√∂f had been engaged at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Pierre Deland and his spouse accepted employment there in 1861. =Social work= In 1857, he founded and organized the first pension fund for actors in Sweden, the Dramatiska och musikaliska artisternas pensionsf√∂rening ('Retirement Fund for Dramatic and Musical Artists') for retired actors and other stage artists. His initiative was prompted by his experiences as a director, as the actors of that time where normally given insufficient salaries and the acting profession was very expensive in an era when actors had to, among other things, pay for their own costumes, causing a dejecting recklessness and a miserable retirement for the majority of actors. A comment is quoted about Deland chastising his actors for financial recklessness: \\"You may laugh, gentlemen, but remember the promissory note!\\"Pierre Joseph Deland, urn:sbl:17414, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av O.

Germany pushed for the independence of the First Georgian Republic following the First World War and was one of the first countries to recognize the newly formed state in 1918, while making it the protectorate of the German Empire. The bilateral relations were interrupted due to Georgia's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1922, but were restored on 13 April 1992 following the dissolution of the USSR. Georgia has an embassy in Berlin and Germany has an embassy in Tbilisi. Germans in Georgia In 1815, while participating in the Congress of Vienna, Russian emperor Alexander I visited Stuttgart, a city in his mother's native Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Upon witnessing the oppression of local peasants due to their non-Lutheran faith or as a result of their participation in separatist movements, the Emperor arranged for their settlement in the suburbs of Tiflis, the historical capital of Georgia, with the aim of forming agricultural colonies. On September 21, 1818 the first German settlement of Marienfeld, now Tbilisi, was established by a group of Swabian Germans. Two months later another group of colonists founded a settlement on the bank of the Asureti River and named it Elisabethtal, after the Emperor's wife Elisabeth Alexeievna. Within the next year five more colonies were established: New Tiflis and Alexandersdorf (both part of modern Tbilisi), Petersdorf (now part of Sartichala), and Katharinenfeld (present-day Bolnisi).

It is named after 18th-century leader of Nizamani tribe in Sindh, Qaiser Khan Nizamani who founded the village after his son Gulham Ali Nizamani died there whilst Qaiser, his younger brother Aloda and their forces were moving north to their original home of Dera Ghazi Khan in Southern Punjab. Tando means fortified settlement and indicates original settlement founded by Qaiser was a militarily fortified settlement. History Qaiser Khan was a great-grandson of Nizamuddin Rind (also known as Nizam Sakhi) of Dera Ghazi Khan. Nizam Sakhi is buried in a tomb in Choti Nawab, Dera Ghazi Khan. He was a Qaiserani Rind Baluch and Nizamani is a Rind sub-tribe which is now spread over Southern Punjab and Sindh. Qaiser entered Sindh sometime around A.D. 1750 with his regiment to join the army of the then Kalhora kings of Sindh at the invitation of the Talpur tribe who were already serving the Kalhora dynasty as the leaders of the Kalhora army. At the time, the Talpurs formed the major part and commanded the Kalhora army. Subsequently, around A.D. 1780, the Talpur chief Fateh Ali overthrew the Kalhora kings with the support of Qaiser and the Nizamani contingent of the army as well as the support of other Baloch chieftains. However, the alliance with the Fateh Ali did not last long and for various reasons Qaiser fell out with the Talpur chief and, therefore, decided to go back to Dera Ghazi Khan. On the way back, his son Ghulam Ali fell ill and died close to the current town of Tando Qaiser around A.D. 1790. Qaiser, then well in his 70s, was extremely saddened by the demise of his beloved son and decided to go no further and settle near to where he buried his son. Qaiser's sorrow is carved in Persian words on Ghulam Ali's grave which roughly translate as \\"I stand sorrowful at the death of my son\\". Qaiser fortified his settlement, which subsequently grew and became famous as Tando Qaiser. At about the time of the invasion of Sindh by the British East India Company in A.D. 1843 which led to the battles of Miani and Dabo, Tando Qaiser was a thriving town led by Qaiser's great grandsons Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Hussain. Ghulam Hussain was martyred whilst Ghulam Ali was wounded at the Battle of Miani where both fought against the army of the East India Company under the command of General Charles Napier. Many other men from Tando Qaiser were also martyred or wounded at Miani and Dabo. Thereafter the British occupied Sindh and the supremacy of the Baluch tribes in Sindh came to an end. The British gave favours to those who gave allegiance to them and awarded titles such as 'Sir' and 'Nawab' as well as grants of lands. In particular, the Hindu community greatly benefited and grew in wealth and prominence. The Sindhi community also benefited. The Hindu Thakurs of Tando Qaiser became highly successful in business, trade, and industry. Mango produced in Tando Qaiser were sold in the markets of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) by the Thakurs. They also established a cotton factory in Tando Qaiser in the early part of the 20th century but due to the independence of Pakistan in 1947, they left Tando Qaiser and their established cotton factory was sold to Haji Wahi Dino Pahore. With that, industrialisation ended in Tando Qaiser. Education The opening of Agriculture College, and then Sindh Agriculture University in Tando Jam, left a great impact on the social set-up of Tando Qaiser. A large number of youths from Tando Qaiser graduated from that university. Although most of them are Nizamani and Khaskheli, other communities, like Qaboolani youths graduated from that Agriculture University. The literacy rate in Tando Qaiser is high.There are a large number of graduates in different areas, including agriculture, medical, engineering, business administration, information technology and education. A number of educated people from Tando Qaiser have migrated to other countries, including Australia, Sweden, UK, USA and Canada.  Distribution of population  Tando Qaiser has a population in excess of 25,000. Consequently, the town is split into several neighborhoods (Paro), named after the people living in that vicinity. These neighborhoods include: * Potho * Aloodani Paro * Bakhrani Paro * Baqanee Paro * Qaisrani paro * Khairani Paro * Khaskhaylee Paro * Koree Paro * Kumbhar Paro * Lohar Paro * Nazrani Paro * Roshan Shah Paro * Juman Nizamani colony * Mushtaq colony Nowadays, people from Tando Qaiser are living in different parts of Pakistan. Some of them are also living abroad, including Middle East, Far East Asia, Europe, Australia, Canada, United States.

Economy The economy of Tando Qaiser is mainly based on agriculture. The town is surrounded by lush green orchards of Mango, Guava, and Jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana). Mangoes, guava and Jujube of Tando Qaiser are very famous. They are not only sold around the country, but also exported to other countries. A large number of people are involved in the production, harvest, and marketing of these fruits. Local businesses and trade services form a major component of the growth of the communal economy. Concurrently, such business schemes further serve as viable sources of income for residents. Notably, the renowned Tando Qaiser 'bazaar' forms an integral aspect of income generated from business in the locality. Notable people Kadir Bux Kaiserani s/o Fateh Ali Kaiserani left Tando Kaiser at the age of 16 in 1930 for Soviet Union and became the first Western educated Nizamani of Tando Kaiser and on return to then India in 1933, became active in Indian independence movement and general secretary of the Sindh branch of the Indian Communist party and also a founding member of Hari Movement in Sindh. He also wrote the first history in Sindhi of the Battle of Miani as well as translating into Sindhi the English travelogue of Pottinger - Sindh Jo Safar.

History The American Eagle Aircraft Corporation was started in 1925 in Kansas City, Kansas by Edward E. Porterfield. It was incorporated in Delaware in September 1928. Porterfield was running a flying school at the Fairfax Airport outside Kansas City. He had been operating Jennies and Lincoln Standard biplane trainers, and felt the need for a more suitable and better-performing trainer aircraft. He consulted with several aeronautical engineers of the period, including Bellanca, and soon launched the production of several light single-engine two-seat high-wing and biplane aircraft. Late in 1929, the worldwide stock market crash severely depressed the sale of non-essential items such as sport airplanes, although American Eagle continued producing airplanes until 1931. Early in that year, Porterfield's company declared bankruptcy and halted production. On 15 May 1931, the company's assets were purchased by the Lincoln-Page Aircraft Company of Lincoln, Nebraska, and Porterfield assumed the title of aircraft sales representative of that company, which became known as the American Eagle- Lincoln Aircraft Corporation, with production headquarters in Lincoln. Porterfield left the company in 1932, later forming the Porterfield Aircraft Corporation, and died of a heart attack in 1948. Victor Roos, a co-founder of the 1921 Roos-Bellanca Aircraft Company in Omaha, Nebraska, had left a management position with the Swallow Aircraft Company in 1928, and was tapped to head the American Eagle-Lincoln Aircraft Corporation. Most of the new company's effort went into producing the Eaglet, but the depth of the Depression soon killed this effort. During the six years of its existence, the American Eagle company (including its merged existence with Lincoln-Page) produced over 700 airplanes. At the time of the Depression it was the world's third-largest aircraft production company. It held 8 Approved Type Certificates. Products *Eagle Model A-1: Three-place biplane open-cockpit aircraft of conventional configuration. Designed by Waverly Stearman. First flew in April 1926; received Approved Type Certificate #17 in November 1927 using a Curtiss OX-5 V8 engine. Various versions were produced, powered by various available inline engines. *Eagle Model A-101: Improved version of the A-1, with ailerons on the lower wing and other improvements. During May 1928, A-101 production was 12 airplanes per week; unit price was $2,815. About 300 of the A-1 and A-101 aircraft were built. *Eagle Model A-129: Similar to the A-1, but with a five-cylinder Kinner radial engine. Since the Kinner was considerably lighter than the OX-5, it had to be mounted in a longer nose in order to maintain balance, leading to the A-1/A-101 being known as \\"short-nose Eagle\\", and the A-129 being known as \\"long-nose Eagle\\". However, the A-129 was also sold with other available engines, including the OX-5. *Eagle Model A-139 *Eagle Model A-201 *Eagle Model A-229 *Eagle Model A-329 *Eagle Model A-429 *Eaglet Model A-230 Eaglet: Single-place high-wing monoplane open-cockpit aircraft of conventional configuration.

Background =Pre- independence era in Namibia= Long before Namibian independence, the country's ruling party, the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO), had a unique relationship with Angola. SWAPO and its militant wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) had emerged during the 1960s in response to South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia, which the United Nations had denounced as illegal. Beginning in 1965, PLAN frequently used Angolan territory to mount raids on South African military positions in Namibia. Over the course of the war, the fighting in Namibia would eventually drive at least 43,000 Namibian refugees into exile in Angola, many of whom joined PLAN. Following Angolan independence in 1975, SWAPO established a formal alliance with Angola's new ruling party, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). After being expelled from Zambia between 1976 and 1979, PLAN was permitted by the MPLA to establish its regional headquarters inside Angola. Access to bases inside Angola provided PLAN with opportunities to train its forces in secure sanctuaries and infiltrate insurgents and supplies across Namibia's northern border. The MPLA government also permitted shipments of arms and ammunition destined for PLAN to pass through Angolan ports. South African troops frequently launched search and destroy operations along PLAN's external infiltration routes in Angola; they also sabotaged Angolan port and rail infrastructure being used to transport supplies to PLAN. This resulted in an effective state of war between South Africa and Angola which lasted until both nations, along with Cuba, signed the Tripartite Accord in 1989. Under the terms of the Tripartite Accord, South Africa agreed to grant Namibia independence in exchange for a Cuban military withdrawal from Angola and an Angolan commitment to cease all aid to PLAN. Angola later cooperated with the United Nations in confining PLAN insurgents to their bases until they could be disarmed, demobilised, and returned home to participate in Namibia's first free and fair elections. =Post-independence era in Namibia= Following independence, Namibian-Angolan relations continued to be governed by security matters. In 1999, Namibia signed a mutual defence pact with Angola. Between 1999 and 2001, Namibia cooperated with the MPLA government by detaining suspected sympathisers of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).Cape Argus/IOL.co.za, Namibian army faces abduction, torture claims, 2001 Namibian troops were also deployed to Angola to assist in counter-insurgency operations against UNITA insurgents near the border. Namibia and Angola were both instrumental in an allied military intervention with Zimbabwe during the Second Congo War. In 2001, there were about 30,000 Angolan refugees residing in Namibia. Many of them resided in the Osire refugee camp near Otjiwarongo. The overwhelming majority of the refugees were repatriated to Angola after the end of the Angolan Civil War in 2002. Namibians were the only nationality who could access Angola visa-free until 30 November 2017 when citizens of South Africa and Mozambique were allowed visa- free access on 1 December 2017. Currently citizens of 11 countries can visit Angola visa-free. Economic Relations In 2016, Namibian exports to Angola amounted to US$99.6 million and Angolan exports to Namibia amounted to US$6.2 million.https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/NAM/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Export/Partner/by- country/Product/Total Embassy of Angola in Windhoek Resident diplomatic missions * Angola has an embassy in Windhoek and consulates-general in Oshakati and Rundu. * Namibia has an embassy in Luanda.

It dates from the mid-17th century and exists in several versions, for example \\"The Tailor's Breeches\\", \\"The Tailor and the Louse\\", \\"The Bold Trooper\\", and \\"The Trooper and the Tailor\\". In all versions the tailor suffers a variety of humiliating indignities. Synopsis In a version sung by Nic Jones, the tailor is a cowardly man dominated by his wife. She goes to the butcher for a joint of meat and hatches a plan whereby her husband is to hide under the bed with a sword while she lies with the butcher, explaining that, by doing this, her husband might become a rich butcher himself. When the time arrives the butcher sees the tailor's leg and, thinking it belongs to a dog, announces that he will fire a gunshot to scare it away. On hearing this the tailor leaps up and says that, if the butcher spares his life, he can have his wife. In other versions, the wife is replaced by a louse and with whom the tailor goes to battle. Eventually, and despite many humiliating reverses witnessed by tinker, broom- makers and beggars, the tailor emerges victorious but it is a pyrrhic victory.

On June 26, 1987, the Hawker Siddeley HS 748 crashed onto a mountain en route to Baguio City, killing all 50 persons on board. Accident On the morning of June 26, 1987, Flight 206 departed the Manila Domestic Airport for Loakan Airport in Baguio City, around 250 kilometers north of Manila. It was scheduled to arrive at 11:10:00 Philippine Standard Time in Baguio, a city with an altitude of about 1500 meters. As the plane approached Baguio City, its pilot reported poor visibility. A monsoon was also reported in the area. Flight 206 disappeared from the radar screens around ten minutes before it was scheduled to land. The wreckage of the plane was discovered five hours after it had gone missing. Flight 206 had crashed onto the fog-shrouded slopes of Mount Ugu, a 2,086 meter-high mountain located between Itogon, Benguet and Kayapa, Nueva Vizcaya. The crash site was located around 180 meters below the summit of Mount Ugu, and 15 kilometers south of Loakan Airport. Fatalities There were no survivors among the 46 passengers and 4 crew members on the plane. Most of the fatalities were Filipinos, including Catholic Bishop Bienvenido Tudtud, Prelate of Marawi City, and Gloria Mapua-Lim, wife of then-Philippine Airlines executive vice-president Roberto Lim. At least one American citizen, John Neill who was then the Managing Director of Texas Instruments Philippines in Baguio City, died in the crash. The crash of Flight 206 was, at that time, dubbed as the second worst commercial aviation accident in Philippine history; however, the report of The New York Times proved to be inaccurate, as Philippine Airlines' previous accident in 1967 actually had fewer fatalities than Flight 206. The death toll has since been superseded by the crash of Cebu Pacific Air Flight 387 in 1998, which was surpassed two years later by Air Philippines Flight 541. During the Flight 206 crash, President Corazon Aquino and the airline's board of directors gave condolences to the victims of the Flight 206 and their respective families.

He was the director of the travelling Djurstr√∂m theater company, which was one of the most well known in the first half of the 19th-century.  Biography  Erik Djurstr√∂m was the son of the lawspeaker Erik Vilhelm Strandberg, and given a good education. In 1807, he was engaged as an actor at the Djurg√•rdsteatern in Stockholm, upon which he took the name Djurstr√∂m. After his debut he toured Sweden as a member of the theater company of Fredrik Wilhelm St√•hlberg, and from 1819 his St√•lberg's widow Fredrika Gustafva St√•hlberg. Upon the death of his employer director Fredrika Gustafva St√•hlberg in 1824, he took over the theater company as its director. The Djurstr√∂m theater company was regarded as the perhaps most prestigious of the travelling theaters in Sweden of its time, and held a high artistic standard compared to the others in the yes of several contemporary critics. Erik Djurstr√∂m was described as an intelligent artist with refined manner and good taste who translated many foreign plays to Swedish and introduced them on the Swedish stage, and has been referred to as the most noted theater director in Sweden of his time. Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon He was described as passionate but tolerant and was well liked as an employer for not interfering in his actors private lives - as an example if his tolerance it was noted that he did not interfere in the fact that his lead female singer Angelique Magito lived with and had children with one of the actors without being married to him, something which was not a given thing during this epoch.Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar.

The method is a series of calculations that uses horizontal illuminance criteria to establish a uniform luminaire layout in a space. In its simplest form, the lumen method is merely the total number of lumens available in a room divided by the area of the room. In order to perform this calculation, many factors, coefficients, lamp lumen data and other quantities must be gathered. Despite the scientific impression of the lumen method equations, there are inaccuracies and assumptions built into the method. Therefore, the lumen method should not typically be used as a standalone, final solution; it should be used as a tool in particularly uniform settings of lighting design if a simple, rough technique of illuminance quantification is desired.Steffy, LC, IES, FIALD, Gary 1963. Architectural Lighting Design, 2nd edition John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York Light loss factors Light loss factors (LLF) are the factors that need to be considered when calculating the Lumen Method. The most important factors to be considered are: # Lamp Lumen Depreciation (LLD): Lamp lumen depreciation values reflect the overall performance of a lamp over its life. LLD = (mean lumens/rated lumens) Those values can be found from the lamp manufacturer data # Ballast Factor (BF): Compares the ratio of light output of a lamp working by a specific ballast to the light output of the same lamp working by a standard reference ballast. The BF is given in the ballast manufacturer data. # Luminaire Dirt Depreciation (LDD): It is the light loss prior to cleaning dust. LDD is estimated from tables in IESNA Lighting handbook. # Room Surface Dirt Depreciation (RSDD): This value accounts for dirt or dust that accumulates on all of the room surfaces ‚Äî especially on the upper walls and ceiling. RSDD is also estimated from handbook tables. The product of all these factors is the light loss factor (LLF) which then is used in the Average Illuminance equation. Method A step-by-step guide is given in textbooks and the IESNA Lighting Handbook.Rea, PH. D., FIES, Mark S., Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (2000), \\"The IESNA Lighting Handbook\\", 9th edition, 8-11 to 8-14 The lumen method in brief consists of calculation of the \\"cavity ratios\\" of the upper, middle, and lower volumes of the space to be lighted. The lower cavity is from the floor to the working height, the upper cavity is from the lower edge of the luminaires to the ceiling, and the middle cavity is the volume between these planes. The effective reflectance of ceiling, floor, and walls are estimated from tabular data. A coefficient of utilization, representing the fraction of light that is directed to the working plane, is supplied by manufacturers for each luminaire design for the various calculated room cavity ratios. Some of the light produced by the lamps is lost due to non-ideal lamp operating conditions, dirt on the luminaires, dirt on the room surfaces. A light loss factor is calculated for all these, based on tabulated empirical factors. Given the usual lighting problem of obtaining an average lighting level at the working plane, the number of luminaires can be calculated based on the effective amount of useful light that each luminaire has been calculated to emit. Since the zonal cavity method only gives an average lighting level, manufacturers tabulate recommended spacing to mounting height ratios that must not be exceeded if uniform illumination is desired. Usage The lumen method can be manipulated to solve for a particular variable. This is valuable because certain numbers are needed at different times in the design process. ‚ÄúNumber of luminaires‚Äù is important because this number can be used to estimate costs and layout the spacing of luminaires in a computer lighting calculation program (Steffy 2002). Variables The CU value should be obtained by the manufacturer of the luminaire which is to be evaluated. In order to determine the CU on the manufacturer's table, a room cavity ratio (RCR) must be used. Also, the reflectance of the ceiling, walls and floor must be known. RCR = 5 x (room height) x (room width + room length) / [(room width) x (room length)] Hughes, S. David (1988), \\"Electrical Systems in Buildings\\", 150, Delmar Publishers Inc Lumens per lamp should be obtained from the lamp manufacturer. Light loss factors can be calculated using methods in the IESNA handbook. Sometimes, individual companies have their own rule of thumb for Light Loss Factors. The ballast factor can be obtained from the ballast manufacturer.

He lived and worked in Villa Opicina in the Province of Trieste, Italy. He was a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Life Rebula was born in the ethnically Slovene village of San Pelagio () near Duino, in what was then the Kingdom of Italy. Because of the anti-Slavic Italianization policies of the Fascist regime, Rebula could not have an education in his native language. He attended Italian-language schools, where he became acquainted with Italian culture and literature. He went to the gymnasium of Gorizia and later the lyceum in Udine, which he graduated from in 1944. After the end of World War II, he moved to Yugoslavia. He studied classical philology at the University in Ljubljana, from where he graduated in 1949. In 1951, he moved back to Italy because of the pressures of the Communist regime. In 1956, he was banned from entering Yugoslavia because of his political opposition to the Communist system. In 1960 Rebula obtained his PhD from the University of Rome with the thesis Dante's Divine Comedy in Slovene Translations.Helga Glu≈°iƒç, Sto Slovenskih Pripovednikov (Ljubljana: Pre≈°ernova dru≈æba, 1996) The same year the authorities prohibited him from entering Yugoslavia for a second time, because he had publicly protested in Trieste newspapers against the suppression of the publication of the novel Listina (The Document) by Edvard Kocbek in Slovenia. In the 1960s Rebula settled in Trieste, where he worked as a teacher of Latin and Ancient Greek at secondary schools with Slovene as the language of instruction. He also engaged in cultural work with the local Slovene community. Together with Boris Pahor, he edited the journal Zaliv (The Bay), founded to promote political and cultural pluralism and the values of western democracy. He was also co-editor of the literary journals Sidro (Anchor), Tokovi (Currents) and Most (Bridge). During this period, Rebula re-embraced Catholicism, after having turned to vitalist agnosticism in his teenage years, due partially to the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche and Slovene modernist authors such as Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç. In 1975, Pahor and Rebula published a book interview entitled Edvard Kocbek: Priƒçevalec na≈°ega ƒçasa (Edvard Kocbek: Witness of Our Time), in which Rebula condemned the summary killings of 12,000 members of Slovene anti-communist militia in May and June 1945, perpetrated by the Communist authorities. The book created a scandal in Yugoslavia and both Pahor and Rebula were banned from entering Yugoslavia for several years.Boris Pahor, Ta ocean stra≈°n√≥ odprt (Ljubljana: Slovenska matica, 1989) After the democratization and independence of Slovenia in 1990 and 1991, Rebula worked as a columnist for several Catholic journals and magazines in Slovenia. He lived and worked in his native village in the Italian part of the Karst region. Rebula died on October 23, 2018, at the age of 94. Work Rebula published numerous collections of essays, diaries, novels, plays, short prose, and other works that have been translated into a number of foreign languages. The prominent Slovene author and intellectual Andrej Capuder stated that Rebula's work \\"is the best we Slovenes can show to the world today.\\" The terms that best define Rebula are antiquity, Christianity and Slovenehood or, as he stated himself: \\"Ancestral Karst ordered two tyrannical loves: on an ancient raft you shall cleave the Slovene sea!\\" His source of inspirations mostly came from the historical, cultural, and natural world of the Slovenian Littoral, although he also wrote a novel on the life of the missionary Frederick Baraga. He reflects on the fate of a small nation and on the more general issues of the human condition. His prose is lyrical and reflexive. He is renowned for his diaries and essays. Alongside the philosopher Milan Komar (whose works were prohibited in Slovenia until the late 1980s), Rebula was one of the first Slovene authors who wrote extensively about the philosophy of Jacques Maritain, whom Rebula sees as one of his most important \\"spiritual fathers\\".Alojz Rebula, Jacques Maritain: ƒçlovek in mislec (Ljubljana: Na≈°e tromostovje, 1981) He also translated Aeschylus' Seven Against ThebesAjshil: Sedmerica proti Tebam, translated by Alojz Rebula, Zalo≈æba Litera, and Plautus' Miles GloriosusTitus Maccius Plautus: Bahavi voj≈°ƒçak, Maribor, Zalo≈æba Obzorja, 1994. into Slovene as well as Slovene authors such as KocbekEdvard Kocbek: La Compagnia, Jaca Book, Milano, 1975. and Levstik into Italian. Rebula was awarded several prizes for his writing. In 1969 he received the Pre≈°eren Fund Award, the so-called \\"small\\" Pre≈°eren award, for the novel V Sibilnem vetru (In Sybil‚Äôs Wind). In 1995 he received the Pre≈°eren Award, the highest Slovenian prize for cultural achievements, for artistic achievement for his life‚Äôs work. In 1997 he was awarded the Acerbi Prize for his novel In Sybil‚Äôs Wind in the Italian translation, and in 2005 the Kresnik Award for A Nocturne for the Littoral, which the jury voted the best Slovene novel of the year.

'Mant≈°ebo was the first of the three wives of Seeiso, who was paramount chief from 1939 to 1940. She was elected regent a month after his death, becoming the only female ruler during Lesotho's colonial period. Her early years in power were marked by disputes over both the legitimacy of her rule and her guardianship of her stepson (Seeiso's heir). However, 'Mant≈°ebo retained the regency for over 19 years, and laid the foundations for Lesotho's current constitutional monarchy. Early life 'Mant≈°ebo's name at birth was Moipone Nkoebe. She was the daughter of Sempe Nkoebe, who was a chief in the Quthing region and a \\"ranking member of the royal dynasty\\". After completing her primary education, 'Mant≈°ebo married Seeiso Griffith, the son of Griffith Lerotholi (who had succeeded his brother Letsie Lerotholi as paramount chief of Basutoland in 1913). She was her husband's first wife (or \\"senior wife\\"), and bore him a daughter, Nt≈°ebo (who was ineligible to succeed to the throne). Seeiso married twice more, and had one son each by his second and third wives. His son by his second wife, Bereng (the future Moshoeshoe II), became his heir when he acceded to the throne in July 1939. Regency =Power struggle= Seeiso died on 26 December 1940. He had been ill for some time, and during his illness authorised his chief counsellor, Gabasheane Masupha, to act as paramount chief while he was incapacitated. As Seeiso's heir, Bereng, was only two years old, Gabasheane initially continued as acting paramount chief after Seeiso's death.Rosenberg and Weisfelder, p. 163. In January 1941, however, a council of the leading Basotho chiefs (collectively known as the \\"Sons of Moshoeshoe\\") was called to elect a permanent regent during Bereng's minority.Rosenberg and Weisfelder, p. 88. 'Mant≈°ebo was one of two candidates, along with Bereng Griffith (Seeiso's half-brother). The council voted 44‚Äì23 in her favour, and she had the support of all but one of the principal chiefs. She was subsequently recognised as regent by the British Resident Commissioner, Edmund Richards, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Moyne. Despite the council's ruling, Bereng Griffith and his supporters refused to recognise 'Mant≈°ebo as regent, and sued her in the High Court of Basutoland (which had only been established in 1938). Bereng put forward an argument that traditional law and custom prevented women from functioning as chiefs. He also contended that Seeiso and 'Mant≈°ebo had married under the levirate custom, and therefore, as his brother's widow, he was obliged to marry her. However, the presiding judge rejected both of those arguments and upheld the decision of the council, allowing 'Mant≈°ebo to continue as regent.Machobane and Karschay, p. 199. Bereng continued to agitate for power until 1949, when he and the former regent Gabasheane were convicted of muti murder and hanged.Rosenberg and Weisfelder, p. 273. =Guardianship of Bereng= When 'Mant≈°ebo was elected regent in 1940, she was also made the guardian of Seeiso's heir, her step-son Bereng. 'Mant≈°ebo and Bereng's mother, 'Mabereng, were said to have \\"loathed each other thoroughly\\".Machobane and Karschay, p. 267. 'Mabereng and her supporters contrived to keep him away from the direct control of the regent, as it was feared that 'Mant≈°ebo (or one of her allies) might have him killed. At one point, rumours of an assassination attempt meant the boy was hidden in a cave for two days.Machobane and Karschay, p. 266. As Bereng grew older, however, 'Mant≈°ebo began to have more of a say in his affairs. She arranged to have him raised in her own Roman Catholic faith, and rejected a plan to have him taught at a non-denominational government school, despite the strong objections of his mother (a Protestant), the Legislative Council, and the Resident Commissioner.Machobane and Karschay, pp. 268‚Äì269. This conflict over schooling resulted in \\"a full-scale war between the royal widows\\", which only ended when Bereng left Lesotho to continue his education in England.Machobane and Karschay, p. 270. =Politics= 'Mant≈°ebo has been described as a \\"shrewd and willing\\" leader who was skilled in dealing with the British administration, but yet unable to develop an \\"alternative national agenda\\". She employed various tactics to frustrate colonial officials, including feigning poor health and affecting frequent bouts of \\"tears and histrionics\\". Internally, 'Mant≈°ebo laid the foundations for Lesotho's current constitutional monarchy. She agreed to consult the Basutoland National Council (the protectorate's legislative council) on certain matters, and supported the right to freedom of association, allowing political organisations to hold public meetings without interference. Basutoland's \\"first modern political parties\\" were formed in the 1950s, during her regency. However, 'Mant≈°ebo herself was not politically neutral, and came to \\"informally support\\" the Basutoland National Party, which was led by Leabua Jonathan (a former advisor).Rosenberg and Weisfelder, pp. 193‚Äì194. By the late 1950s, she was facing increasing pressure to step aside and allow Bereng to assume the chiefship. Her intention was to remain regent until he had completed his university education and married. 'Mant≈°ebo was eventually forced into \\"involuntary retirement\\" in March 1960. Later life and legacy 'Mant≈°ebo died four years after relinquishing the regency, as \\"an evidently depressed and broken-hearted lady\\".Machobane and Karschay, p. 274. She was the only female ruler of Basutoland prior to independence, and in southern Africa Labotsibeni of Swaziland was the only other woman to rule for a comparable length of time. In his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, Nelson Mandela recalled a meeting with 'Mant≈°ebo in which she chided him for his poor grasp of the Sotho language, which he said made him \\"realise [his] parochialism\\". =Honours= In the 1946 Birthday Honours, 'Mant≈°ebo was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), \\"in recognition of the war effort of the Basuto Nation\\". The following year, during a deviation from a royal tour of South Africa, King George VI personally inducted her into the order in front of a crowd of thousands. His wife, Queen Elizabeth, and daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, were also present for the ceremony.Royal Tour 1947, British Path√©. Retrieved 22 October 2016.

Morchard Bishop, FRSL) (3 July 1903 ‚Äì 12 April 1987) was an English novelist, reviewer, translator, and man of letters. He was briefly the husband of the Irish writer Norah Hoult. He was born at Teddington, the son of Alfred Hills Stoner and Sarah Louise Stoner, and educated at Kingston Grammar School. His father and grandfather were quantity surveyors, and he was trained in this profession at the offices of the family firm in Broad Street, City of London. As soon as he was 21, he took up writing as a career in the Literary London of the 1920s, though he later put his surveying to good use in wartime. He used the nom-de-plume Oliver Stonor because he felt it looked and sounded better than his own name; the \\"er\\" at the end of \\"Oliver\\", clashing with \\"Stoner\\", prompted the change to \\"Stonor\\". He was not related to the Stonor family of Stonor Park; the Stoners came originally from Cowfold in Sussex; his grandfather had bought Harcourt, near Pembury, in Kent. The name Morchard Bishop is actually that of a town in Devon. In 1926, he visited the home of the writer Arthur Machen, who was living at Melina Place. He joined the wide and varied circle of those who sought out and admired Machen for his conversation, as well as for his writing; and when Machen and his wife Purefoy moved to Amersham, they stayed in touch. Stonor also corresponded with John Betjeman.Candida Lycett Green, John Betjeman Letters: 1926-1951, Methuen, 1994. (p. 237-8).

The vessel was built by Daniel Brent Shipwrights in the Greenland South Dockyard, Rotherhithe, London. It was financed mainly from the proceeds of the 2nd Greek Loan raised by the London Philhellenic Committee, but also by Capt Hastings' private funds. The 233-ton vessel was propelled by steam-powered paddles. Power was generated by 2 small steam engines. The vessel also featured 4 masts and could operate under sail: it was envisaged that the vessel would normally cruise under wind-power, but switch to steam-power during combat operations, to allow maximum maneuvrability. It was armed with just 8 guns but all were 68-pounders, the most powerful calibre. The on-board furnaces that burnt coal to generate steam could also be used to heat cannon-shot to a red-hot state, creating highly incendiary missiles.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: article on F.

The station sees over 180,000 departures, which the council says makes the station one of the \\"busiest in Wales\\". The facility forms part of the roadmap for the Welsh Government's North Wales Metro in the town and the region.  History  A new complex was opened in two halves in December 2003, on the site of the original bus station which was originally built in the late 1960s with the adjacent office buildings. The original station had much graffiti on its aging steel bus stands, and main brick building, which housed a small Newsagents.  Modern form  While the original bus station was redeveloped, use was made of the wide pavement area of King Street as temporary locations for the bus stands. The new bus station features a number of small shops, varying from newsagents to a Fat Cat Cafe Bar. Most services are operated by Arriva Buses Wales, which operates the longest routes using Wright Commander buses, however GHA Coaches also operate several services, due to continuing recent expansion. A number of smaller firms also operate from the bus station. In 2013 the station benefitted from a ¬£1.4m improvement project, which saw the installation of wider pavements, shop fronts, walls and other infrastructure. The scheme was backed by the European Regional Development Fund.  Improvements  The Bus station received a ¬£250,000 grant from the Welsh Government in February 2019 intended for \\"refurbished toilets, new bins, real time information screens and an external clean-up.\\" Wrexham Council announced in 2019 it was considering a range of methods to improve the image of the bus station after much negative press attention. Solutions discussed included enhanced CCTV, increased fees for bus companies rest facilities, increased departure charges, and a new three-year contract to reopen the information centre. A new route opened that month introducing services to HM Prison Berwyn, one of the largest employers in the region near Wrexham industrial estate. In May 2019 the Welsh Government rolled out discounted My Travel Pass products for those between 16 and 21 in the Wrexham area, reducing fares by 30%. In June 2019 in response to social issues in and around the bus station, a Salvation Army Community Care Hub was promoted to \\"bring together the Department for Work and Pensions, GPs, chiropodists, health visitors and mental health, housing and crime reduction teams.\\" The project has been supported by First Minister Mark Drakeford and it is aimed at resolving deprivation and poverty in the town centre. The Leader of Flintshire Council however criticised the Welsh Government for their failure to push forward the North Wales Metro and asked where the ¬£50m spending pledged for the project was being used. A Welsh Government spokesperson however said a Transport for Wales business unit has been established in North Wales to support it, beginning with improvements to the Wrexham-Bidston line, improved access to and within Deeside Industrial Park with a focus on bus and active travel, and spending on the Wrexham bus station. The Council is undertaking a scheme of works in the area surrounding the bus station, including work to improve Regent Street, Hope Street, and Queen's Square. Further work will involve rollout of LED lighting across the town centre and work to the area around St Giles Church and the neighbouring streets. On 24 August 2019 the station's waiting area was closed from \\"8pm Monday to Saturday and throughout Sundays\\" to reduce anti social behaviour which had become prevalent at night. The Council state the work is part of a scheme of improvements to the bus station, including \\"refurbished toilets, new bins, external clearing and cleaning works and digital timetables.\\" The improvements are funded by a ¬£250,000 grant from the Welsh Government. In September 2019 MP Ian Lucas criticised the bus station for failing to provide adequate services to Wrexham Maelor Hospital. Welsh Government Economy and Transport minister Ken Skates responded by stating they are \\"investing more than ¬£10 million\\" in transport improvements including planning a \\"Wrexham General integrated transport hub\\".  Controversies  The bus industry in the region saw extensive issues around 2016, with the collapse of GHA Coaches which led threats to school bus contracts, nearly 400 people facing redundancy, and the loss of a number of local services. In 2017, the bus station and area gained notoriety in the national press with the nickname \\"Spice Town\\", after bus driver Gavin Rodda received social media attention for highlighting photos of drug users and paraphernalia in the area. The issue led to meetings between Welsh Government ministers and North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones. Hugh Jones of Wrexham council told the BBC that there had been a \\"significant increase in anti-social behaviour in the past two years\\". He stated, however, that improvements had been made following the introduction of a public space protection order, and collaboration with agencies such as Cais and the Wallich. In September 2018 it was reported that a homeless man had entered the bus station and threatened to \\"stab people\\" during a 12-minute episode which was seen by children. The BBC reported that the town now had 44 rough sleepers, the second most in Wales after Cardiff, and homelessness volunteers urged the public to \\"speak to\\" and \\"befriend\\" the homeless in the community. A session held by volunteers attracted over 100 supporters. In October 2018 proposals were made to reduce disabled parking spots at the station, however these were rejected by Wrexham Council after receiving significant complaints from voluntary groups in the area. In January 2019 a security officer at the station was accused and later convicted of assaulting another man while travelling on a bus service which came to a stop. In February 2019, further issues arose when Arriva Buses Wales withdrew two services from operation, describing them as \\"not commercially viable\\". The Welsh Government criticised 1980s bus deregulation as creating significant problems for communities. A local councillor blamed the cancellations on a \\"lack of competition\\". In March 2019 the EasyCoach service which operates from the station received press attention when it had its license suspended, as a result of an incident which saw a \\"wheel come off a vehicle\\". Another incident took place that month, with armed police stopping a Wrexham to Chester bus service in Gresford, boarding the vehicle with weapons to search for a \\"specific individual\\". Incidents of police searches were reported across Wrexham and Chester bus services. A councillor stated at the time that the Wrexham bus industry was at \\"breaking point\\". In July 2019 issues arose at the station when the operator of the EasyCoach service collapsed, and franchise holder Transervis Ltd closed the station information office in the process. MP for Wrexham Ian Lucas also raised fears for the station when it was announced that the taskforce of police, health and other officials dealing with drug issues in and around the area would be disbanded.  Destinations  Bus services run from the station to Chester, Oswestry, Llangollen, Mold, Denbigh, Whitchurch, Barmouth, and Machynlleth.

The church was founded by the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig and is affiliated with the Danish Church Abroad and the Church of Denmark. Though the church opperates independently, it is overseen by the bishop of the Diocese of Haderslev. As such, it shares many of the Church of Denmark's liberal views, including its support for the ordination of women and of remarriage after divorce. Today, the church has nearly 30 congregations across Southern Schleswig and approximately 6,000 registered members who are serviced at 62 individual places of warship. The central church is the Church of the Holy Spirit (Danish: Hellig√•ndskirken) in Flensburg.  History  Following the reformation, many pastors in Southern Schleswig performed services in Danish, though certain parts of the ceremony had to be performed in German by mandate of the German Church. In 1905, the \\"Church Society of Flensburg and the Surrounding Area\\" (Danish: Kirkeligt Samfund for Flensborg og Omegn) was established with the purpose of reaching congregations within the German Church whose primary language was Danish. The society was rejected by officials who felt the Danish minority should conform to German society and its language. In 1921, following the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites, the Danish Church in Flensburg (Danish: Den Danske Menighed i Flensborg) was established as a free church. In the following years the church expanded to include the whole of Southern Schleswig, and in 1959 it was given its current name.

He ruled from a new capital at Ramavati, which remained the Pala capital until the dynasty's end. He reduced taxation, promoted cultivation and constructed public utilities. He brought Kamarupa and Rar under his control, and forced the Varman king of east Bengal to accept his suzerainty. He also struggled with the Ganga king for control of present-day Orissa; the Gangas managed to annex the region only after his death. Ramapala maintained friendly relations with the Chola king Kulottunga to secure support against the common enemies: the Ganas and the Chalukyas.

Lvov began his career as a deputy governor of Nizhny Novgorod (1610), Rylsk (1615), and Astrakhan (1618‚Äì20). In 1621 he was sent to the court of Danish king Christian IV with a Tsar's proposition to marry one of Christian's nieces, the Schleswig- Holsteinian princesses, but the mission failed completely. After his return, he was made a deputy chief of Pomestny Prikaz. In 1634, Lvov was one of two heads of Russian delegation in Russo-Polish negotiations which resulted in signing the Treaty of Polyanovka.

In 1644 he once again went to Poland as Ambassador Plenipotentiary.

In January 1626, Lvov was appointed to serve as a majordomo of the Tsar's court, in 1627 was made an okolnichy and official head of the Prikaz Bolshogo Dvortsa ('Prikaz of the Great Palace'), a government office dealing with the Tsar's palace economy and judging monasteries.

Tornax built its first motorcycle in 1926. This was the model I-26, which has a 600 cc single-cylinder side-valve engine imported from JAP in London, England producing 15 bhp. For the remainder of the 1920s all Tornax models featured side-valve and overhead valve (OHV) JAP engines of 500, 550 and 600 cc, apart from the V-28 in 1928 whose 600 cc side-valve engine was supplied by the German engine manufacturer Columbus in Bad Homburg. In 1930 Tornax produced its first twin-cylinder model, the III-30, which had a side-valve 1000 cc V-twin JAP engine producing . In 1931 it added a sports version, the III-31 SS, with a 1000 cc OHV JAP engine. Tornax claimed that this machine would produce , and guaranteed a top speed of 190 km/h (118 MPH). This model was very expensive, and economic conditions in the Great Depression meant that very few were sold. For 1932 the range remained unchanged, with all the model suffixes changed from \\"-32\\" to \\"-33\\". In 1933 Tornax added smaller single- cylinder OHV models to its range: the SF 2 and SF 35, again using OHV JAP engines. The full 1933 range featured six models ranging from 200 cc to 1000 cc, with the OHV V-twin continuing as the III-33 SS. From 1934 the National Socialist government forbade the import of foreign components. Many German motorcycle builders had been using engines, gearboxes, forks or other components from English or Swiss suppliers, and it was difficult to substitute sufficient supplies from German factories quickly enough to remain in business. Some German manufacturers ceased making motorcycles, but Tornax survived by reducing its range to one model, the aptly named Universal, with a 600 cc side-valve Columbus engine. In 1935 Tornax added two OHV Columbus engines to its 600 cc range and introduced the 800 cc, Tornado model. The latter was a sports machine that used the same overhead camshaft Columbus parallel twin engine as the rival Horex S8. Tornax also launched a small sports car, the Rex, with a 700 cc DKW engine, but only 158 were built. Neither the Tornado nor the Rex continued in production for 1936. Tornax reduced its 600 cc range to two models, and added its first lightweight model, the K 20, with a 200 cc two-stroke engine made by ILO. In 1937 the company added further ILO-engined two-stroke singles of 200 cc and 250 cc. During the Second World War Tornax reduced its range to one model, the K 125 with a 125 cc ILO engine. All Tornax motorcycle production stopped in 1941, and the factory was destroyed by Allied bombing in March 1945. In 1948 Tornax resumed K 125 production. It steadily expanded its range with larger single-cylinder two-stroke ILO engines, culminating in 1953 with a twin-cylinder model, the Z-250 Schwarze Josephine (\\"Black Josephine\\") which has a two-stroke ILO-engine producing . In 1954 Tornax built its first four-stroke models since 1939: the V 250 and SV 250. These have unit construction 250 cc engines from Opti in Essen, mounted in a frame that has swinging-arm rear suspension and typically German Earles front fork. Tornax ceased motorcycle production in 1955. The company's total production in its 29-year existence was about 50,000 vehicles.

With usually 550-600 pupils on the roll, the College is situated near the centre of the town in a 60-acre campus, which includes administrative offices in the Georgian Birkfield House, a Prep School, the College Chapel, and teaching and sports facilities. Also lying within the grounds are the College's two boarding houses, Goldrood and The Mews. The school makes use of two mottos: 'Fides labore et tenatcitate' and 'being our best'. History St Joseph's College was established in 1937 by the De La Salle Brothers, a Catholic order. The original site for the school was nearby Oak Hill. When Birkfield house was bought Oak Hill was used as the College's prep school. With the building of a new prep, Oak Hill ceased to be part of the school site. In 1996 the school merged with a girls' school, the Convent of Jesus and Mary, and became independent of the De La Salle order. However, the order retained the freehold of the site and charged rent to the school. In August 2005, the school was used as the setting for season 3 of the Channel 4 historical reality show 'That'll Teach 'Em'. In 2014, the school bought the freehold outright. As a result of the merger with the girls' school, the College crest was altered. Whilst the crest had previously borne two oak leaves (reflecting Oak Hill, the original grounds of the school), and the de la Salle star, the current design has replaced one of the oak leaves with a crown of thorns from the crest of the Jesus and Mary Convent School.http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/ipswich-st-joseph-s-site-sold-to-school-in- multi-million-pound-deal-1-3262218 Future Development The College campus has evolved over the decades and still continues to do so, with a ‚ÄòBuilding for the Future‚Äô programme underway. Phases 1 and 2 have already been completed, with a new Technology Centre and a state-of-the-art Sixth Form Centre. In building the latter, the College sought the input of its Sixth Formers. The College's fitness suite has also been refurbished with new equipment and an extension. Other important buildings on the site include the award-winning Prep School, featuring bright colours, rounded walls and a circular library ‚Äì together with high tech classrooms. The grounds are a particular feature of the College and include many trees, shrubberies and gardens, together with a series of sports pitches and casual open spaces. The College has an Astroturf for all weather sports, tennis courts, a sports hall and a dedicated changing room block/PE office. St Joseph's is known as a centre of sporting excellence. House system Goldrood House The College currently has four houses: * Birkfield (Red) * Goldrood (Yellow) * La Salle (Green) * Orwell (Blue) Birkfield House takes its name from the Georgian building of the same name found at the centre of the campus. Birkfield House was the original building that the school moved into in 1946. Birkfield Mews is the name of one the two boarding houses on campus, but it is more commonly known as ‚ÄòThe Mews‚Äô. Goldrood House is named after ‚ÄòThe Gold Rood‚Äô house and estate, which the school acquired in 1963. The mansion, built in 1811 is now home to 50 boarders, having previously been the home of the Prep School. Prior to the Mansion's existence the land held an ancient and celebrated cross - or rood - erected in monastic times. La Salle House is named in honour of the College's patron saint, John-Baptist de la Salle (1651‚Äì1719), a French priest and educational reformer who spent his life teaching poor children in parish charity schools. Saint John-Baptist is also the patron saint of teachers. Orwell House takes its name from the River Orwell flowing through Suffolk. The river, whose name dates to pre-Celtic, remains central to the lives of the people of Suffolk and beyond. Not only key to trade, the River Orwell inspired artists such as Constable and Gainsborough. Many believe Eric Arthur Blair took his famous pen name (George Orwell) from the river. Arthur Ransome (Swallows and Amazons) spent much time on the river fuelling his creativity. Covenants existed on the land between Goldrood and the River Orwell preventing obstructions to the river view. The house system originally had two houses designated for day pupils and two for boarders, with all named after major figures in England's Roman Catholic history: * Campion (named after St Edmund Campion, an English Jesuit and martyr) (green) [Boarders] * Sherwin (named after St Ralph Sherwin, an English martyr) (blue) [Boarders] * More (named after St Thomas More, English lawyer, politician and martyr) (black) [Day pupils] * Beckett (named after St Thomas Becket, an early archbishop of Canterbury and martyr) (orange) [Day pupils] Boarding The College offers full, weekly and flexi boarding and its boarders come from both the United Kingdom and overseas. Goldrood house is used for younger male boarding students and The Mews for female boarders as well as Sixth Form boys, with separate sleeping areas. Annual Rugby Festival The National Schools Rugby Festival was started in 1986 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of the College. It is now the country's premier schoolboy 15-a-side rugby tournament. Schools invited to take part come from both the state and independent sectors. The Festival has a track record as a proving ground of future stars: former England captain Chris Robshaw, British and Irish Lion Mako Vunipola, England winger Charlie Sharples, and Zach Mercer, Player of the Tournament 2014, who went on to help England to the World Rugby U20 Championship in June. Mike Tindall is another who trod the St Joseph's turf. Jonathan Joseph was named Player of the Tournament for Millfield School. The most recent success is Marcus Smith, who was named Player of the Tournament for Brighton College in 2016; a year later he and Zach Mercer are Eddie Jones' apprentices in the England Training Camps. The Rugby Festival is streamed and watched online by tens of thousands. Attendance at the weekend festival also runs into thousands. Arts Week The annual St Joseph's College Arts Week in June grew from a one-off lunchtime concert in 1996. It is now an important feature of the school's summer calendar, with timetabled lessons given a creative spin and a programme of special events and activities, ranging from jewellery workshops to poetry readings. Headline events include lunchtime concerts, the Prep School and Lower School productions, Rock in the Quad and Unplugged. The Festival also includes a photography competition open to students and non- students (up to the age of 25) alike. Throughout Arts Festival students are encouraged to get creative and the week usually buzzes with spontaneous ‚Äòpop up‚Äô happenings and performances. Chapel One of the most notable buildings on the campus is the College Chapel. Built in modern style, the Chapel design echoes the form of a tent, like those used by the Israelites whilst they were in the desert. In 2017, just as the Chapel reached its 50th anniversary, serious flaws in the roof were discovered. The building was temporarily closed whilst detailed investigations were begun. The College is currently considering the best way forward to repair the Chapel. In the meantime the school's former library has been refurbished as a general meeting and assembly space, and renamed The ARC, reflecting the College's three key values: Aspiration, Respect and Confidence.

Work Shelly Blake-Plock is co-founder of Yet Analytics. Shelly Blake-Plock was an educator and education blogger. A founder of the Baltimore EdTech Forum, Blake-Plock was blogger-in-chief at TeachPaperless and taught in the Johns Hopkins University School of Education. Music Blake-Plock's musical work includes elements of folk and blues as well as free improvisation, electronica, and unorthodox recording techniques. His early work consisted ‚Äúalmost entirely of rudimentary home recordings of songs committed to tape as they were being written, never to be refined or recast. Partially inspired by the field recordings of Alan Lomax, Blake [used] a one-take method to get back to the essence, as he sees it, of folk music, which once hinged on a much closer relationship between audiences and those who made it. In this light, his works-in-progress can be seen as a rather unpretentious attempt to rehumanize (and even bring the 'folk' back into) folk music.\\" Around 2004, Blake-Plock's work took on a more wholly improvised quality seemingly inspired both by European Free Improvisation as well as American noise and performance art. Blake-Plock's 2007 album The Violencestring is a musical narrative consisting almost entirely of free improvised music and studio manipulation. In 2006, Blake-Plock and double- bassist Joel Grip performed as a duo live for 48 continuous hours. The performance was a benefit for Public Health Music, a non-profit organization; Blake-Plock is an official partner of the organization.

He presided over the convention that organized the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion in 1843, and was among the founders of what became known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church, having separated from the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was born in Brookfield, Vermont, the eldest of eight children. The family was poor and Orange was working full-time when he was twelve. \\"Orange Scott became convinced that the holy hearts should result in holy lives and that holy men should seek to bring an end to social evils such as slavery and intemperance.\\" Painting of Martin Wells Knapp, Scott (middle), and Seth Cook Rees on display at the World Methodist Museum, Lake Junaluska, NC  New Church: Anti-Slavery, Anti-Intemperance  In 1843, Rev. Scott organized what he called \\"a new anti- slavery, anti-intemperance, anti-every-thing wrong, church organization\\" named the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion. Despite public opinion, Rev. Scott insisted: \\"...though public opinion commanded Mr. Wesley to desist through the medium of mobs, still he stood it out! Shame on his compromising sons! The Methodists in all parts of the United States have braved, and, finally, to a considerable extent, changed public opinion. Every man's hand has been against us, and yet we have stood firm. But now comes up the new doctrine of compromise! Let it be banished from the breast of every patriot, philanthropist, and Christian. The advocates of temperance have braved and changed public opinion. The same may be said of Wilberforce, and the English abolitionists. And with all these examples before us, shall we succumb to an unholy public opinion, founded in the love of gain! Shall we turn our backs upon the cause of suffering humanity, because public opinion frowns upon us? No! Never!!\\" Rev. Scott: \\"I assumed the position that the principle of slavery‚Äî-the principle which justifies holding and treating the human species as property, is morally wrong‚Äî-or, in other words, that it is a sin. The principle, I contended, aside from all circumstances, is evil, ONLY EVIL, and that CONTINUALLY! I said, no hand could sanctify it‚Äî-no circumstances could change it from bad to good. It was a reprobate‚Äî-too bad to be converted‚Äî-not subject to the law of God, neither indeed could be. I admitted that circumstances might palliate, and circumstances might aggravate, but no circumstances could justify the principle.\\" \\"He who has made of one blood, all nations of men to dwell on the earth' [Acts 17:26] must look with disapprobation upon such a system of complicated wrongs, as American slavery... abolition is from above (of which I have no more doubt than of the truth of Christianity)...\\"  References   External links   The Life of Rev.

Life Guglielmo Audisio was born January 27, 1802 and graduated with degrees in philosophy and theology from the University of Turin. After teaching for four years in the seminary of Bra, in 1837 he was appointed by King Carlo Alberto, Dean of the Ecclesiastical Academy of Superga, where he taught sacred eloquence, moral theology, canon law and institutions of Roman law. He was expelled from this office because he was opposed to the Piedmontese Government. Audisio was a fervent upholder of papal and Catholic rights against the political liberalism of Piedmont. In 1848, along with Giacomo Margotti, he founded the newspaper, Armonia (\\"Harmony\\") in Turin. It was for this reason that he fell a victim to the anti-clerical influence which had deprived him of his post at Superga.Benigni, Umberto. \\"Guglielmo Audisio.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 9 May 2015 He then went to Rome, where Pope Pius IX appointed him professor at the Roman University, where he taught the law of nature and of nations. He was also appointed Canon of the Vatican Basilica. In Rome Audisio joined the liberal reformist Italian ecclesiastics, such as Monsignor Liverani, and tried to reconcile the new political and cultural needs of his time with Catholic tradition. He urged Catholics to exercise their right and duty against political revolutionaries and Mazzini, rejecting all forms of abstention. At the time of the First Vatican Council he was suspected of Gallicanism, to the grief of his patron Pius IX, and his work on political and religious society in the nineteenth century was condemned by the Church. Audisio submitted to the condemnation of his book, but he warmly protested against the accusation of heterodoxy and disobedience. Works In 1839, in Turin, he published a manual of sacred eloquence, his most noted work, which was issued in eight Italian and a French edition.Corvino, Francesco. \\"Guglielmo Audisio\\", Dizionario Biografico, Vol.4, 1964 He also devoted himself to historical studies, especially relating to the history of the papacy.

The castle stands on the top of the hill overlooking the town. Ptuj Castle () is a castle in Ptuj, Slovenia. It stands on a hill alongside the Drava River overlooking the town, and it is a prominent landmark. History The castle was built in the mid-12th century, when it was constructed to defend against the Hungarians. When the castle was built, the town of Ptuj was part of the Archdiocese of Salzburg. It was owned by the Jesuits of Zagreb for some time. In 1656, due to financial hardship, the Jesuits sold the castle to the Holy Roman Field Marshal Walter Leslie, a Scot by birth. The castle was thoroughly rebuilt during the Baroque period. Due to the end of the Turkish invasions the castle lost its defensive character.

It was noted on several occasions that he had removed the covers from the two 5\\" that contained the system and that they were under an open window in a shed in his back garden and all the equipment was covered in a layer of cigarette ash. Frederick Brown later went on to create AFPAS, the Association of Free Public Access Systems, which was set up to bring together sysops and BBS users and became an information service for people to contact for help in accessing UK BBS's.

The adult stages are called crambid snout moths (a name shared with the rest of the family Crambidae, to distinguish them from Pyralidae snouth moths), while the larvae of Crambus and the related genus Herpetogramma are the sod webworms, which can damage grasses.  Life cycle  Crambus patella mating Sod webworms have a bivoltine life cycle with four stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago (adult). They overwinter as larvae in their final or penultimate instar in the thatch or soil. With the coming of warmer weather, the larvae will pupate, and moths will appear in late spring or early summer. The first generation of eggs is laid in June, with larvae appearing in June and lasting until July. Adult moths appear from July until August. Under favorable conditions, a second generation will occur, with the adult stage laying eggs in early October. = Egg = The eggs of Crambus species are dry and nonadhesive, with an oval to elliptical shape. The eggs of most species are white to creamy white when first laid, but later turn bright orange or red. The size of the eggs varies between species, but ranges from 0.3 mm to 0.6 mm. = Larva = The color of the larvae also varies from greenish to beige, brown, or gray, with most larvae having dark, circular spots that extend over the entire body. From the first instar to the third instar, the head capsule will appear black, but later instars have a light brown head capsule with various black sculpturation. At the first instar, the head capsule is 0.19‚Äì0.23 mm wide, growing to 1.23‚Äì2.21 mm by the last instar. The length of whole larvae is at the first instar and at the last instar. Crambus larvae, known as \\"sod webworms\\", feed primarily on grasses. In turfgrass species, their primary host plants are cool-season grasses, with fewer records on warm-season grasses. Some species also feed on maize, wheat, rye, oats, timothy-grass, and other grasses in pastures, and meadows, with the most damage occurring in areas with permanent sod. The damage caused is more pronounced during times of drought. = Pupa = The pupa develops in a silken cocoon attached to soil particles, plant debris and fecal pellets. The cocoon resembles a small lump of earth, while the pupa itself is pale yellow at first, darkening to a mahogany brown. The pupae are long by wide. = Imago = The adult moth is whitish or light gray to tan. Many species have patterns of colors, including silver, gold, yellow, brown and black. The moths are approximately long, with wingspans of . Like other snout moths, they have long labial palpi that extend in front of their heads, and fold their wings underneath their bodies, making them slender and harder to see while resting on plants.  Damage  Sod webworms were first recognized as a serious pest of lawns and golf courses during the drought of 1928‚Äì1934 that affected most of the United States. Unlike many of the other more destructive turfgrass pests, the sod webworm is native to the United States and was not introduced. Most damage occurs during the first instar, when the sod webworm only feeds on the foliage of the turfgrass. Damage is often seen as a small area of leaves that are yellow to brown. Sod webworms themselves will not be seen because of their nocturnal nature. During the day, the sod webworm can be found in its burrow in the center of the damaged area. Even though damage can be an eyesore, it does not hurt the turf because no damage is done to the crown of the plant. In closely mown turf and drought conditions, damage is more severe than in poorly maintained turf. In closely mown turf, symptoms will appear more quickly and prominently. During drought conditions, damage is more severe because the damage is often not seen until rainfall occurs. = Management = To be considered a serious infestation of sod webworms, 12 larvae must be found in a area. To test this, hollow pans are placed with a pyrethrum or detergent drench and allowed to sit for 10 minutes, then the larvae in the area are counted. During peak growing periods, the grass will often be able to recover by itself and not show serious damage. For high-end turf that cannot show any damage or serious infestations, predators of the sod webworms must be attracted, including birds and insect predators, such as ground beetles, robber flies, and predatory wasps. The larva is also prone to infection from microorganisms such as Beauveria bassiana and Nosema (Microsporidia). Parasitic nematodes such as Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis heliothidis can also infect sod webworms.  Systematics and taxonomy  The genus Crambus was erected by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1798, and was originally used to cover species which are now considered to belong to the Noctuidae. The type species was designated by John Curtis in 1826 as Phalaena pascuella (now Crambus pascuella). Fabricius originally included 62 species, a number which had increased by 1940 to 116, of which only 98 were thought to be valid. A 1986 estimate suggested there were \\"perhaps 400\\" species of Crambus.

According to the 2001 census, the parish population was 769, consisting of 386 males and 383 females. The population had increased to 816 by the time of the 2011 census. The parish includes the hamlets of Hanbury Green, Uphampton, Easthampton and Ledicot.  History  In the 17th century the village of Shobdon was run by the Bateman family (hence the Bateman Arms) who lived at Shobdon Court. Shobdon church is St John the Evangelist, north of the village. The original interior arches of the church were removed in 1756, being placed at the top of the adjacent hill as a folly where they still stand. The Shobdon Arches consist of a central chancel arch and two Norman doorways. The weathered carvings are the work of the Herefordshire School of sculpture, which dominated in the western counties during the mid-12th Century. Tympana were once probably part of the original doorways. Shobdon Church is an important work of architecture. It has a direct connection to Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill in Twickenham and the members of the \\"Committee of Taste\\" which strongly influenced its design. Its intact interior and matching furniture are the sole example of this Walpolean Gothick style of Georgian church architecture and furnishing. On 4 November 2013 was culminated 12 years and ¬£1.25 million of repairs to restore this \\"Strawberry Hill Gothic\\" Church. Nearby is the Shobdon Arches folly.  Amenities  The village has a primary school with approximately 82 children attending. When the children leave Shobdon Primary they mostly progress to Wigmore High School, although some go to either Weobley High School or Lady Hawkins' School. Co-located with the Primary School is Shobdon Village Hall which consists of a community room and kitchen, and shared access to the school hall. Occasional fundraising activities are undertaken by the village hall committee. The biggest user of the village hall is Shobdon Arches Preschool. At the western end of the village is Pearl Lake caravan park, which has a number of permanent caravans as well as access for tourers. This is adjacent to Pearl Lake, the largest natural body of water in Herefordshire. To the south is Shobdon Aerodrome, formerly a Second World War RAF glider training facility, now used for commercial and recreational helicopter flying, fixed wing power flyinghttp://www.herefordshireaeroclub.com and glider flying.http://www.shobdongliding.co.uk Shobdon Aerodrome was constructed in 1942 and used as a glider training base. Pilots who trained here took part in both the Normandy landings and Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. Shobdon Festival Every third year Shobdon church hosted a flower festival. This was expanded into an annual food, drink, flower and flying festival which is held on the last weekend in June.

Brand logo Early life  An admirer of her mother's work as a seamstress, Lolita Lempicka dressed Barbie dolls herself at the age of six; as a teenager she crafted her own clothes. By 17 Lolita was studying fashion design at Studio Ber√ßot.  Career  From the age of six Lempicka was fascinated by wonderlands full of princesses and sumptuous dresses. She was inspired by fairy tales, such as Beauty and Beast, Peau d'√Çne, and other tales of Charles Perrault, as well as fashion magazines such as Femmes d'Aujourd'hui and Marie Claire. When designing her collections, she drew inspiration from Coco Chanel, whom she discovered on French TV show Dim Dam Dom. Her inspiration was also drawn from the work of artists such as the photographer David Hamilton, the poet Jean Cocteau, pre-Raphaelite and symbolist painters, as well as Amedeo Modigliani, Picasso, Matisse, Gustave Moreau and Ingres. Lempicka's designs are also influenced by \\"the thirties and forties and their lace and silk negligee dresses, XVIIIth century Baroque and its dainty marchionesses\\". Her signature ivy leaf symbol is drawn from her interest in fairytales and nature. Lolita began her career as an independent designer. In 1983, at 29, she presented her first collection with the help of her husband. In 1984, she opened the first Lolita Lempicka shop in the Marais district in Paris. That year, she also held her first fashion show in Tokyo, Japan. In 1985, Lempicka held her first fashion show in Paris. In 1986, she launched \\"Lolita Bis\\", a collection dedicated to young women. From 1987 to 1990, she was artistic director at Cacharel in charge of the Women and Children lines. In 1987, she started a long lasting partnership with the Japanese group Onward Kashiyama for a master license including fashion clothes and accessories (leather, sun glasses, jewelry, shoes, and lingerie). In 1990, she established her own fashion house in a townhouse on Avenue Marceau in Paris. In 1990 her collection was shown in a courtyard in the Louvre.\\"Latest fall fashions are strictly for leggy spring chickens\\", The Santa Fe New Mexican, 21 October 1990, p. 24. Throughout the 1990s, she designed special collections for La Redoute, Trois Suisses or Monoprix. In 1994, Lolita Lempicka designed a collection dedicated to brides-to-be and opened another shop in the Marais district dedicated to wedding dresses, Les Mari√©es de Lolita. Wedding dresses play an important role in the designer's creative universe. In 1996, Lolita Lempicka launched LSD (Lolita Studio Design), a new casual and affordable fashion line. That year, her eldest daughter Elisa Melodie joined the fashion studio and started collaborating actively in the design of new collections. 1997 saw the introduction of Lempicka's first fragrance, \\"Lolita Lempicka\\", inspired by fairytales from her childhood. In the early 2000s, Pedro Winter, the Parisian music producer of Daft Punk and DJ, arranged the music of her fashion shows. In 2003, after studying art and fashion, Lolita's twins Lauren Leslie and Paulina Leonor joined the family business. In 2004, Lolita Lempicka celebrated 20 years of creation. On that occasion she published a book celebrating 20 years of design (¬´ Lolita Lempicka : 20 ans de cr√©ation\\"). That year, Lolita Lempicka associated her name with a premium car: Nissan Micra \\"Lolita Lempicka ¬ª. The partnership continues to-date, and three versions, including a convertible, were created since. In 2006, she resumed her partnership with La Redoute for a capsule collection. In 2007, she created a fashion clothes and lingerie line for Etam. That year, Lempicka also partnered with Nissan Motor Company to reinvent the Nissan Micra. In 2008, she launched another collection, including a wedding dress, for Trois Suisses. This year also saw the first year Lempicka designed a Samsung mobile phone. In 2009, she expanded her partnerships with luggage maker Delsey and organic product creator Bonneterre (tea, biscuits, chocolates) with Les Gourmandises de Lolita Lempicka. 2011 saw the second mobile phone partnership with Samsung by Lempicka. In 2012, she designed a capsule collection (fashion clothes and accessories) for the organic and ethical brand Ekyog. = Perfumes = During Lolita Lempicka's successful career in fashion design, she was brought to international fame by the launch of her legendary perfume \\"Lolita Lempicka\\", or \\"Le Premier Parfum\\". Launched in 1997 with a bottle in the shape of an apple, \\"Lolita Lempicka\\" has been at the top of the world's perfume sales ever since. In 2000 was released her first fragrance for men: \\"Lolita Lempicka au Masculin\\". In 2006 the mermaid- inspired \\"L\\" was created. In 2008, Lolita Lempicka released \\"Fleur D√©fendue\\" (Forbidden Flower) and \\"Fleur de Corail\\" (Coral Flower) inspired by her two first fragrances. In 2009, Lolita Lempicka launched \\"Mon Rose\\". The same year, Lolita Lempicka Perfumes opened their online store. In the fall of 2009, \\"Si Lolita\\" was launched and quickly became the third most successful feminine fragrance. Packaged in a four leaf clover-shaped bottle, \\"Si Lolita\\" explored new horizons in Lolita Lempicka's range of fragrances. The perfume muse was Charlotte Le Bon, the weather girl from Canal +, France premium TV channel. In 2010, \\"Lolita Lempicka au Masculin\\" fragrance was made available in eau de toilette \\"L'Eau Au Masculin\\". \\"Si Lolita\\" was also made available in Eau de Toilette in 2011. In 2012, the brand launched the first edition of \\"L'Eau en Blanc\\". In September 2012, Elle Fanning was chosen by Lolita Lempicka as the new face for \\"Le Premier Parfum\\". She stars in a new campaign, created by Yoann Lemoine, along with Woodkid. In September 2013, Lolita Lempicka launched Elle L'Aime, an incandescent white floral fragrance. The face of the fragrance is the model Sasha Pivovarova. In 2017, after 20 years of success, Mon Premier Parfum begins its most exciting period, that of its metamorphosis, affirmation, and challenges. The famous apple of Eden reveals modern forms and new facets. This jewel-bottle conceived as a piece of art also sublimates Sweet and So Sweet, Mon Eau and Elixir Sublime perfumes. The model and actress Thylane Blondeau is the new face of Mon Premier Parfum. She is the embodiment of the new millennium Lolita: an obvious beauty, assumed and connected. At spring 2018, Lolita Lempicka launches Mon Eau, a fruity floral eau de parfum with breathtaking freshness. In an eco-friendly approach, Mon Eau meets its commitment to the respect and protection of the environment and animals by being labeled vegan \\"One Voice ¬ª. = Marketing = Lolita Lempicka has dressed many French actresses, such as Charlotte Gainsbourg and Anouk Grinberg in the film \\"Merci La Vie\\", Vanessa Paradis in \\"L'Arnacoeur\\" (Heartbreaker), Victoria Abril in \\"Gazon Maudit\\" (French Twist), and Mathilde Seigner in \\"Mariages!\\" (Marriages!).

Life Little is known of his life save what may be gathered from his own writings. A native of Assisi, he is found in 1312 as a student in Perugia, and in 1316 at Cologne, whence he returned to Umbria bearing many relics, including those of St. Louis, King of France, given him by the latter's daughter, Princess Blanche, who had become a Poor Clare. In 1320 and in 1326, he was lector of theology at the Porziuncula, in 1332 guardian at S. Damiano and in 1334 he was at the Sacro Convento. He appears to have lived to a great age. He was acquainted with Marinus of Assisi, John of La Verna, Alvarus Pelagius and other well-known Franciscans. Whether he is to be identified with the Francesco Rubea who is mentioned among the partisans of Michael de Cesena or with the Franciscus de Assisio who was long imprisoned at Florence on a charge of heresy is a matter of conjecture. Works Bartholi wrote several works including a history of the Passion. He is best known for his Tractatus de Indulgenti√¢ Sanctae Mariae de Portiuncul√¢ composed about 1335. He spent many of his later years in retouching and completing this treatise, on the origin and evolution of the Indulgence of Portiuncula.

In all cases the map sheets are headed \\"Land Utilisation Survey of Britain\\".) was a comprehensive survey of land use in Great Britain in the 1930s. The survey was the first such comprehensive survey in Britain since the Domesday Book survey in the 11th Century. A Second Land Use Survey was carried out in the 1960s. Subsequent work has mainly been based on satellite imagery, with sample field survey work for quality checking. First Land Utilisation Survey The first survey was instigated in the 1930s by L.Dudley Stamp, reader and later professor of geography at the London School of Economics. Mapping was carried out by volunteers at the scale of six inches to the mile (1:10,560) using around 20,000 six-inch field maps. The maps were published at one inch to the mile (1:63,360) using the Ordnance Survey One Inch 'Popular Edition' (the 4th Edition) as the base. Publication of maps and reports began in 1933 and was completed in 1948 after interruption by World War II, though sheets were published in every year from 1933 to 1948 with the exception of 1941 (Stamp 1948). The printing plates of the pre-war maps were destroyed by bombing. Besides maps and regional summaries, publications leading from the survey included Stamp's 1937 and 1948 books The Land of Britain.Stamp, L.D. (ed) (1937),The Land of Britain. The Report of the Land Utilisation Survey of BritainStamp, L.D. (1948),The Land of Britain: Its Use and Misuse. London: Longmans, Green and Co. By comparison with later surveys the classification employed relatively few categories. The base-map was overprinted with a wash of six basic colours to indicate broad land-use categories: Yellow (moorland and heath), light green (grassland), dark green (woodland), brown (arable), purple ('gardens etc.') and red (agriculturally unproductive). The key subdivided each of these by reference to the detail already present in the base-map, for example woodland into coniferous, deciduous, mixed and new plantations. Built-up areas showed essentially only two categories of urban (red) and suburban (purple) land. The suburban and urban categories in combination with the base-map detail allowed the key to subdivide suburbs into 'houses with gardens sufficiently large to be productive of fruit, vegetables, flowers, etc.' and 'new housing areas, nurseries and allotments'. Urban areas were subdivided into 'land so closely covered with houses and other buildings as to be agriculturally unproductive' and 'yards, cemeteries, pits. quarries, tip heaps, new industrial works, etc.'. All the one inch to one mile maps created by the Survey are available on-line for study at the Vision of Britain website created by the Great Britain Historical GIS, including the unpublished maps of upland Scotland which Stamp deposited with the Royal Geographical Society, plus the ten mile to one inch summary sheets. These maps are still the copyright of Stamp's estate, for 70 years after his death in 1966. Second Land Use Survey In the 1960s a second survey was carried out by Alice Coleman, a geographer and later professor at Dudley Stamp's alma mater, King's College London. This followed Stamp's approach of the use of volunteers, with Coleman acknowledging 'generous encouragement and financial help from Professor Stamp'. The maps were published by the Isle of Thanet Geographical Association, with specific sheets receiving funding from local authorities such as Essex County Council.Second Land Utilisation Survey of Britain (1968), Basildon (TQ68 and TQ78) Land Use sheet 226, sheet marginalia Published maps were printed at a scale of 1:25,000 using the Ordnance Survey Provisional and First Series maps as a base. Pairs of 10x10km sheets were combined along the lines of the later Second Series (Pathfinder) maps. Coleman's survey employed a much more detailed classification than Stamp's in both urban and rural areas, giving 64 categories grouped into 13 groupings.Coleman, A & Maggs K.R.A (1965), Land Use Survey Handbook, fourth (Scottish) Edition, Isle of Thanet Geographical Association The general colour scheme of Stamp's survey was followed (red, yellow, brown, purple, dark and light green), but red now signified industry rather than urban, and purple indicated market gardening and orchards rather than suburban. The new colours of grey (settlement), orange (transport) and lime green (parks and open spaces) were added. Besides solid colour the maps employed patterned colour (stipple, horizontal, diagonal and pecked lines etc.), and numeric and alphabetic symbols. In addition black stipple was used for derelict sites, white for unvegetated land (naturally bare rock etc. or stripped land awaiting development), and blue for water and marsh. Industry was subdivided into manufacturing (solid red) and extractive, tips and utilities using various patterns. Manufacturing was further divided by numbers indicating 14 groupings based on the Standard Industrial Classification as used in the 1951 Census, for example 3 for glass, ceramics and cement, 6 for engineering and shipbuilding, 7 for vehicle manufacture, etc. Large transport uses (ports, airports, railway yards etc.) were indicated by orange stipple. Rural uses were also subdivided using patterns: Market gardening into 10 categories ranging from 'field vegetables' to 'orchards with market gardening' and arable into 6 categories ranging from cereals to fallow. Heath, moorland and rough land (yellow wash) was overprinted with one or more of 16 symbols to indicate vegetation types. Although around 3,000 volunteers completed much of the field work, coverage of only around 10% of the country was published at 1:25,000 due to printing problems. Nevertheless published sheets included the whole of Greater London and industrial Thames-side, giving a snap-shot of London at its peak as a centre of manufacturing. The survey led to Coleman's later criticism of the planning system and work on the rural-urban fringe, for example Coleman (1977).Coleman, A. (1977) Land-use planning ‚Äì success or failure?, Architects Journal, (January 1977), pp.94-124. Land Cover Map Subsequent work has been based largely on remote sensing rather than field survey. The Land Cover Map of Great Britain (1990) was the first comprehensive survey since the Second Land Use Survey. This used satellite imagery, with ground survey used for checking. The end product is a digital dataset rather than paper mapping, providing classification of land cover types into 25 classes, at a 25m (or greater) resolution. Land-Use UK In 1996 the Geographical Association organized a further field-based survey with the participation of around 50,000 school pupils. This originated as a 'Geography Action Week' and was carried out in co-operation with the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, a forerunner of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the body responsible for the satellite-based Land Cover Map. Mapping was carried out on the 1:10,000 scale using a stratified sample of a thousand 1 km2 squares, 500 urban and 500 rural.Walford, R. (ed) (1997), Land-Use UK: A Survey for the 21st Century.

It should not be confused with a lesser-known, unrelated Victoria Motorcycle Company in Glasgow, Scotland that made motorcycles between 1902 and 1928.Victoria Motorcycle Company, Glasgow, Scotland In its early decades Victoria in N√ºrnberg fitted proprietary engines purchased from various manufacturers including Fafnir, FN, Minerva and Z√©del. 1920‚Äì1932 Victoria 1929. 1931 Victoria KR 50 S in the Zweirad-Museum Neckarsulm 1934 Victoria KR 6 In 1920 Victoria launched the model KR 1, which has a 494 cc BMW twin-cylinder side-valve flat twin (boxer engine) mounted longitudinally in the motorcycle frame. The engine produced and transmission was via a two-speed gearbox. When BMW started making its own motorcycles, Victoria turned to making its own engines. In 1923 Victoria launched its KR 2, an overhead valve (OHV) flat twin producing . In 1924 Victoria followed this with the KR 3, which produces and has a 3-speed gearbox. In 1925 Victoria built Germany's first forced induction engine, and in 1926 a 496 cc Victoria achieved a motorcycle Land speed record of 165 km/h (102.5 MPH). In 1927 Victoria launched the 596 cc KR VI or KR 6. Based on this model the factory offered a high-speed sports model with twin carburettors that produced , later named the KR 7. At the same time Victoria also offered the 200 cc side-valve KR 20 and 350 cc overhead valve KR 35 models. In 1930/31 it added to its range the KR 50 (side-valve) and KR 50 S (overhead valve) models, which have engines imported from Sturmey-Archer in England. In 1932 Victoria won the sidecar class of the European Hill Climb Championship with a 600 cc machine and thereafter offered a model with and a four-speed gearbox as the KR 6 Bergmeister.Victoria history at www.victoria-bike-ig.com At the same time it offered the KR 15 and KR 20 Z models with 150 cc and 200 cc two-stroke engines supplied by ILO. 1933‚Äì1945 1939 Victoria V 99 Fix In 1933 Victoria introduced a 500 cc parallel twin, the KR 8. This had a side-valve engine with its cylinder block inclined forwards almost horizontally. This placed the valves under the cylinder head, where the exhaust valves suffered from overheating.Victoria history at www.Victoria-Oldtimer.de In 1934 the National Socialist government forbade the import of foreign components, which ended Victoria's use of Sturmey-Archer engines. 1942 Victoria KR 35 Pionier In 1935 Victoria revised the KR 8 engine to the unusual exhaust over inlet (EOI) valve layout, and called the resulting model the KR 9 Fahrmeister.Victoria history at www.schlauweb.dePhotograph of KR 9 stripped of bodywork, revealing the engine with its EOI valve layout. Using EOI on a nearly horizontal engine placed the exhaust valves in cooler air at the front and solved the overheating. Unfortunately it also increased the complexity and cost of manufacture and maintenance. Victoria discontinued the KR 9 after 1935. Also in 1935 Victoria introduced the 350 cc KR 35 B and KR 35 G models with Lackler-patented cylinder heads. In 1937 the first KR 35 Sport was built with a Columbus engine. In the same year Victoria introduced new KR 20 LN Lux and KR 25 S Aero two-stroke models, whose engines with flat-topped pistons were developed by Richard and Xaver K√ºchen. In 1938 Victoria offered the Columbus- engined KR 35 SN (18 bhp) and KR 35 SS (20 bhp) models. At the same time Victoria expanded its range of two-strokes with the lightweight V 99 Fix, V 109 Fix (which was a ladies' version of the V 99 Fix),V 99 Fix & V 109 Fix specifications KR 12-N and KR 15-N. In 1939 the Second World War almost completely halted production of the KR 35 Pionier, although limited production continued until at least 1942. In 1945 the Victoria factory's production hall was severely damaged. 1946‚Äì1966 1954 Victoria V35 Bergmeister In 1946 Victoria resumed production with the 38 cc FM 38 bicycle engine. In 1949 the company resumed production of the pre-war KR 25 Aero model. In 1950 Victoria introduced the 99 cc V 99 BL-Fix and modernised the KR 25 Aero with a telescopic front fork. At the same time the company built the models Vicky I and Vicky II using the FM 38 bicycle engine. By the end of the year KR 25 Aero production was 14,000 per year, and from 1951 the model was equipped with Jurisch plunger rear suspension. 1955 Victoria KR 21 Swing in the Motorradmuseum Ibbenb√ºren In 1953 Victoria developed its popular model further as the KR 26 Aero, and expanded its range with the new K√ºchen-designed V 35 Bergmeister. The V 35 is a 350 cc OHV four-stroke V-twin producing . The V 35's powertrain combines chain primary drive to the gearbox with shaft drive to the rear wheel. The Bergmeister was highly over engineered and very expensive to buy. Only around 1000 motorcycles could be produced before the model was scrapped due to poor sales. The Bergmeister is one of the rarest motorcycles in the world today with only a few known survivors In 1955 Victoria introduced the Peggy motor scooter, which has a 200 cc fan-cooled two-stroke engine and an electric starter. In the same year the company also offered the technologically advanced - but consequently expensive - KR 21 Swing motorcycle. In 1957 Victoria launched a new model with a 175 cc OHV four-stroke engine imported from Parilla in Italy: the KR 17 Parilla. In 1958 Victoria merged with DKW and Express Werke AG, forming Zweirad Union, which continued the Victoria name for mopeds such as the Vicky and motor scooters. In 1966 Hercules took over Zweirad Union and terminated Victoria production. Vicky 1954 Victoria Vicky In 1954 Victoria introduced the Vicky moped. It was designated ‚Äòmodel III. Vicky had a 2-stroke 48cc engine. The Vicky III was imported into Great Britain from January 1956. In Sweden it was marketed as the MS50.

Life In 1541, at the age of twenty-two, Girolamo Benzoni travelled from his hometown of Milan (Italy) to Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, Spain, and then on to the New World. He claims to have been seeking adventure and fortune. He spent fifteen years in the territories conquered and being exploited by the Spaniards, travelling widely through the West Indies, Central America and South America, and visiting: the Caribbean (Greater and Lesser Antilles), Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. After losing much of the 'few thousand ducats' he had accumulated in a shipwreck on his way home, he finally arrived back in the port town of Sanl√∫car de Barrameda (Spain) on 13 September 1556, with nothing more than his wealth of experiences. Subsequently, he returned to Italy. In the dedication of his first edition he claims to have been born of humble parentage and unable to go to college. He also says his father sent him throughout Europe, one assumes on business. He then writes a new dedication in the second Italian edition in 1572. After that nothing is known of Benzoni. Exactly what he was doing in the New World is not clear: he attached himself to various military expeditions though he was not by nature a fighting man; he reveals a good knowledge of political intrigue but does not apparently become involved in politics; he is informed about economics but does not discuss the commodities he traded in. Works Title page of Historia del Mondo Nuovo Benzoni's Historia del Mondo Nuovo was published at Venice in 1565 and was dedicated it to Pope Pius IV. The book purported to present facts and describe events that Benzoni himself had witnessed. Since there was controversy at the time, concerning treatment of Native Americans, a work by someone who had both spent 15 years in the New World and was willing to criticize colonists, could not fail to attract attention. Controversy came to surround that Historia del Mondo Nuovo itself. Critics claimed that Benzoni included many factual errors and often in intentional misstatements; suggested that the author had limited education and very narrow views; was motivated by hatred of the Spanish people and government, against whom it made many diatribes and accusations; had the tone of a disappointed trader, motivated by a lack of personal success, despite protections given to him by Spanish authorities and favors that he acknowledged only reluctantly; did not faithfully report Benzoni's own experiences; failed to notice mitigating circumstances and tended to ignore positive aspects of colonisation. In particular, it was alleged, Benzoni's book included a clumsy rehash of Bartolom√© de Las Casas's accounts of the Antilles, and made many factual errors regarding the conquest of Mexico and conquest of Peru. The ultra-philanthropists found in Benzoni a welcome auxiliary. This was especially the case in countries vying with Spain to establish colonies in the Americas. Several editions of Benzoni's writings were published in rapid succession, including translations into at least five languages.http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-07757-4.html In 1572, the original edition of the Historia was reprinted; in 1579, translations into French and German appeared, by Eustace Vignon and Nicolaus H√∂niger (German Wikipedia article: Nicolaus H√∂niger) respectively. An 1857 edition by Admiral W. H. Smyth, published in London by the Hakluyt Society, under the title,History of the New World, by Girolamo Benzoni, of Milan: Shewing his Travels in America, from A.D. 1541 to 1556: with some Particulars of the Island of Canary , was the only English translation until the publication of a new edition in 2017.

Between 1978‚Äì1981 the ship sailed for Irish Ferries as Saint Killian. In 1981‚Äì1982 the ship was lengthened by at Amsterdamsche Droogdok Maatschaapij in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Subsequently, she was renamed Saint Killian II and remained in Irish Ferries service until 1997. In 1998 the ship was sold to Greek interests and renamed Medina Star, but was laid up. From 2002 until 2005 she sailed as Egnatia III for Hellenic Mediterranean Lines and Alg√©rie Ferries. She was laid up from 2005 until 2007, when she was scrapped in Alang, India.  Service history  The Stena Scandinavica was one of four identical ships built by Yugoslavian shipyards for Stena Line in 1972‚Äì1974. She was delivered to Stena on 27 June 1973, primarily for use on their Gothenburg‚ÄîKiel service, but she also sailed on the Kors√∏r‚ÄîKiel and Gothenburg‚ÄîFrederikshavn services. In January 1974 she was rebuilt with additional cabins ay S√∂lvesborgs Varv. In February 1978 the Stena Scandinavica was sold to Irish Ferries but was chartered back to Stena Line until April 1978. On entering service with her new owners he sailed from Rosslare and Cork to Cherbourg and Le Havre. By the early 1980s Irish Continental needed more capacity on the Ireland-France routes, and instead of getting new tonnage, it was decided to lengthen Saint Killian. Between February 1981 and February 1982 the Saint Killian was lengthened by at Amsterdamsche Droogdok Maatschaapij in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Her capacities were increased by 517 passengers and 98 cars. On 26 February 1982 she was renamed Saint Killian II and was subsequently placed back on the Ireland‚ÄîFrance service. On Christmas Eve 1986 a fire disabled the ship off the coast of Cornwall. The vessel was taken under tow to Falmouth where she received temporary repairs, and in January 1987 moved to Blohm & Voss, Hamburg, Germany where she was fully repaired. In February 1987 she resumed service. In 1997 the Saint Killian II was withdrawn from service following her final departure from Ringaskiddy to Le Havre on September 27, 1997, where she was laid up and put for sale. In October 1998 the Saint Killian II was sold to Cape Enterprise Ltd, Panama and renamed Medina Star. She sailed to Piraeus, Greece, where she was laid up. In 2000 she was sold to Green Island Maritime Ltd, and in 2001 the Commercial Bank of Greece, but remained laid up. In 2002 the ship was chartered to Hellenic Mediterranean Lines, renamed Egnatia III and refitted, entering service on the Patras‚ÄîIgoumenitsa‚ÄîKorfu‚ÄîBrindisi service in May 2003. In June 2004 she was charted to Alg√©rie Ferries for use on their services from Bejaia, Algiers and Oran to Marseille, and Oran to Alicante. After end of the charter to Alregie Ferries in January 2005 the Egnatia III was laid up at Eleusis Bay, Greece.

Academic advising synthesizes and contextualizes students' educational experiences within the frameworks of their aspirations, abilities and lives to extend learning beyond campus boundaries and timeframes.\\"National Academic Advising Association. (2006). NACADA concept of academic advising. History Academic advising traces its beginnings to the earliest of American colleges including Harvard University. The book Academic Advising: A Comprehensive Handbook, sponsored by the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA), contains chapters on the historical foundations, theory, current practices, ethics, and legal issues of academic advising. According to Kramer (as cited in Harrison, 2004), the history of faculty as academic advisors can be traced back to 1841 at Kenyon College. At that time, the college required students to choose a faculty member to be their advisor. The faculty member would then help the student determine what courses they needed to take in order to graduate. Standards Of significance to the profession of academic advising are the Standards and Guidelines for Academic Advising that have been developed by the Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education (CAS) and endorsed by the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA). These Standards and Guidelines are available at the NACADA web site. The Standards and their accompanying Guidelines cover thirteen areas from Mission to Assessment. The current Standards and Guidelines were last updated in 2005. Models A variety of approaches exist to academic advising, each of which is informed by the goals of the advisor-student interaction. Three principle models of advising include developmental advising, prescriptive advising, and intrusive advising. = Developmental Advising = Developmental advising was first introduced by Crookson in 1972. This approach is focused on helping students explore and define academic, career and life goals and pathways, and develop problem-solving and decision-making skills through collaborative and process- oriented advising. Fostering a relationship between the advisor and student is critical to this model, which is based primarily on adult development theory and student development theory. Although many studies have shown that students generally prefer this approach it can require a greater commitment of time and resources compared to other advising models. = Prescriptive Advising = The prescriptive or traditional advising model is focused primarily on providing students with information directly related to their academic program and progress, such as academic policies, major/program requirements and course selection. Prescriptive advising is normally initiated by the student as the goal of this approach is to address immediate questions to facilitate the student‚Äôs progress through their academic program, rather than play a role in helping the student form long-term goals beyond their academic pursuits. This type of advising is sometimes equated to a doctor-patient relationship model. = Intrusive Advising = A model for intrusive advising (also known as high involvement or proactive advising) was first introduced by Glennon in 1975. A defining feature of this approach is that contact is initiated by the advisor rather than the student. Generally, contact with students is initiated at critical periods throughout a student‚Äôs academic career, such as during a student‚Äôs first year of study, while taking developmental or remedial courses, before they must declare a major, or as they approach graduation. Additionally, particular cohorts of students may be targeted such as academically at-risk students (e.g. students on probation), or high-achieving students. In practice intrusive advising has been shown to have a positive impact on developmental/remedial undergraduate mathematics course pass rates, as well as student retention and degree attainment rates, and research indicates that students prefer this approach to advising over strictly prescriptive advising. However, it is important to note that some students may find this approach invasive. Misc Advising Advising has been around for sometime, but there are many different settings of advising. The differences can include from high school to undergraduate degrees to graduate degrees. In research it is shown that there are two specific college advising that have been helpful to students asking for advice. Collaborative and individualistic are those two. Individualistic is similar to intrusive and is not necessary to repeat information. Collaborative advising is shown to be more helpful than individualistic advising and has been shown to help due to the group participation. Students learn more from other students co-advising them. They learn more when details become more realistic and generalizable. Collaborative advising is also where group advisors and group advisees work together to come up with multiple solutions to give the students' options. Effectiveness Academic advising is shown to be more successful when advisors hold face-to- face appointments with their advisees. Particularly with topics like future classes, and careers. Face-to-face interactions make advising more meaningful for the students. Additionally, students place more importance on the supportive and caring nature of their relationship with their advisor than on the particular approach to advising. Participation in academic advising has been shown to increase student satisfaction and mitigate students‚Äô feelings of isolation or disconnection from the institution as a whole, both of which according to Tinto (as cited in Gravel, 2012 ) are linked to with increased university student retention and graduation rates, and reduced attrition and withdrawal rates. This effect has been documented for both traditional ‚Äòon- campus‚Äô institution and institutions which offer courses and/or entire programs through online/virtual formats.

Marks, a former officer of the United States Department of State. Content The book discusses how the CIA works and how its original purpose (i.e. collecting and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, and persons in order to advise public policymakers) has, according to the author, been subverted by its obsession with clandestine operations. It is the first book the federal government of the United States ever went to court to censor before its publication. The CIA demanded the authors delete 339 passages but they resisted and in the end only 168 passages were deleted. The publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, published the book with blanks for deleted passages and with boldface type for items which the CIA initially wanted deleted, but later withdrew its objections. It is perhaps the earliest published book to adopt this format. The book was a critically acclaimed bestseller whose publication contributed to the establishment of the Church Committee, a United States Senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities, in 1975. The book was published in paperback by Dell Publishing in 1975. Cult of intelligence Victor Marchetti used the expression \\"cult of intelligence\\" to denounce what he viewed as a counterproductive mindset and culture of secrecy, elitism, amorality and lawlessness within and surrounding the Central Intelligence Agency in the service of American imperialism: Critical reception In his 1978 memoir, Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA, William Colby, a former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, endorsed Marchetti's critique and adopted the use of the expression \\"cult of intelligence\\": In popular culture In reaction to Marchetti's use of the expression \\"cult of intelligence\\", it has also come to be used by some writers of conspiracy theory and conspiracy fiction to describe a cabal, with a pyramid-shaped hierarchy, which is fanatically devoted to gathering information, often of an esoteric or occult nature.

Shapiro is a professor of Sociology and Public Policy at Brandeis University and is the author The Hidden Cost of Being African American and the co-author of Black Wealth/White Wealth. Shapiro's current professional titles include the Pokross Professor of Law and Social Policy and the Director of the Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The primary areas of focus for Shapiro's research and publications are racial inequality and public policy. Early life and education Thomas M. Shapiro was born in Los Angeles, California on April 24, 1947. He received his B.A. Degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1969. Shapiro went on to receive both his M.A. degree (1971) and PhD (1978) from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.Shapiro, Thomas M. Personal Interview. April 14, 2008. Writings Thomas Shapiro's first book was Population Control Politics, published in 1985, which focused primarily on female sterilization, the welfare state, and public policy in the United States. Shapiro co-authored Black Wealth/White Wealth with Professor Melvin L. Oliver, which was originally published in 1995; a tenth-anniversary edition was published in 2006. Black Wealth/White Wealth investigates racial inequality in the United States, however, what sets Black Wealth/White Wealth apart from the numerous other works on racial inequality from this time period is that Shapiro and Oliver examine racial inequality through the lens of wealth. The book demonstrates that a huge wealth gap exists between white and black Americans (according to the book, black families have, on average, 10 cents of wealth for every dollar white families have). Although the income gap between whites and blacks has narrowed, Shapiro and Oliver argue that the remarkable differences in wealth, and the impact that these differences have on housing, education, and more. Both also challenge the notion of growing equality between races in the United States.Shapiro, Thomas and Melvin L. Oliver. Black Wealth/White Wealth: A New Perspective on Racial Inequality. New York: Routledge, 1995. Great Divides: Readings in Social Inequality in the United States is a textbook on American social inequality compiled by Thomas Shapiro with contributions from classical and contemporary writers. Great Divides has gone through three editions; the first was published in 1998, and the other two editions followed in 2001 and 2005. According to Shapiro, the purpose of Great Divides is to examine the barriers between groups and individuals and to evaluate the impact that these barriers have had, and continue to have, on American society. Additionally, and unlike existing readers on social inequality, Shapiro seeks to meld older, more famous texts (from authors such as Max Weber and W. E. B. Du Bois) with cutting-edge research on the subject of inequality, thereby creating a more comprehensive and challenging text for students.Shapiro, Thomas. Great Divides: Readings in Social Inequality in the United States. Third Edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2005. In his 2004 publication The Hidden Cost of Being African American, Shapiro focuses on the importance of family wealth and the central role that it plays in passing down racial inequality from generation to generation in the United States. Drawing from interviews with 182 black, white and Latino families with school aged children in Boston, Los Angeles, and St. Louis, Shapiro argues that there continues to be a substantial racial wealth gap in the United States. Shapiro also claims that families lacking financial assets, characteristically the African American population, are hindered from becoming upwardly mobile in American society. 3/4 of the people that Shapiro interviewed were middle class and 1/4 were working class or poor. These same inherited, transformative assets are leveraged by whites, enabling them to take fuller advantage of economic opportunities and accumulate additional wealth, what many refer to as White privilege. This vicious cycle, Shapiro argues, has the effect of perpetuating and worsening racial inequality in the United States. Shapiro focuses on the \\"big picture\\" of wealth dynamics in the United States and explores how family money effects racial inequality. His book is organized around the ideas that inheritance and racial discrimination are making inequality between whites and African Americans worse. He coins the term \\"transformative assets\\" as money that is acquired through family that allows for social mobility beyond what their current income level would allow for. He shows that different starting lines of wealth for different people has a huge impact on inequalities and that race plays a huge role in determining your starting place. In terms of racial equality, inherited wealth and housing discrimination limit educational and employment gains which have a huge impact on social mobility.Brandeis University. . Retrieved November 15, 2008. More narrowly, Shapiro also focuses on the advantages that transformative assets have on the value of housing and the subsequent quality of neighborhoods and schools, to the additional benefit of whites and disadvantage of blacks.Shapiro, Thomas. The Hidden Cost of Being African American: How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. In his 2017 book, Toxic Inequality: How America's Wealth Gap Destroys Mobility, Deepens the Racial Divide, & Threatens Our Future, Shapiro argues that wealth disparities and racial inequities must be understood in tandem. Following nearly two hundred families of different races and income levels over a period of twelve years, Shapiro's research vividly documents the recession's toll on parents and children, the ways families use wealth to manage crises and create opportunities, and the real reasons some families build wealth while others struggle in poverty.

Located on the southern side of the city's central Tito Square (at Titov trg/piazza Tito 3), it houses the Koper city government and a wedding hall. It is considered one of the city's architectural landmarks.Koper Municipality Website History An earlier municipal hall existed on the same site by 1254, before the square itself (then called the Platei Comunis, established around 1268.) Work on a new building began after the original was destroyed during a major revolt in 1348, but the incomplete building was again destroyed in 1380 by a Genoese raid that sacked and burned the city in that year. The current structure dates from the mid-15th century, having been begun in 1452-1453. The left wing and the portico leading from the square to the colorful via Calegaria (ƒåevljarska ulica, \\"Cobblers' Street\\") were the first to be completed, while the right wing dates from the 1480s. In 1505, the Porto del Corte was added; the renaissance gateway supports a small terrace and connected the Praetorian Palace with the Foresteria. Praetorian Palace, Tito Square The external staircase facing Tito Square was completed in 1447. In 1481, Giovanni Vitturi replaced peaked gothic windows with semicircular renaissance ones. The arms of the city governors on the facade attest to the fact that the balustrade was not completed until the beginning of the 16th century. The center of the crenellated portico features a statue of Justice.Slovenian Tourist Board Website The main facade took its present shape in 1664, when a thorough renovation rearranged the numerous plaques and arms set into it. Additional ornaments and signage are fixed into the palace's Cobblers' Street wall, testifying to its status during the time it served as the seat of the city podest√† (a joint civil and military authority), the Captaincy, and the Grand Council (an assembly of the city's nobility). The fall of the Venetian Republic to Napoleon I in 1797 caused the palace to lose much of its importance, as the deliberative bodies that had met in it were now defunct. During the 19th century, Austrian authorities moved the seat of the mayoralty to the Armerija Palace. Interwar plans by Italy, which had gained Koper in 1918, to restore it as the municipal seat were not realized. The palace continued to gradually decay until 1968/1969, when it was rehabilitated in situ, and a restaurant called \\"Capris\\" was opened in the ground floor. A more thorough renovation was carried out between 1991 and 2001, at a cost of 800 million SIT (3.34 million ‚Ç¨). After its completion, the palace resumed its historic role as city hall; the offices of the mayor and the municipal council of Koper were relocated to it in May 2001.

It was the seat of a branch of the Gravisi family, whose senior line had the title of Marquis of Pietrapelosa, first granted to Nicol√≤ Gravisi in 1440. Location The mansion is one of a number of interesting buildings in the old town center, others being Almerigogna Mansion, Carli Mansion and Belgramoni‚ÄìTacco Mansion, which is home of the regional museum. It is a Renaissance mansion built in 1664, lies on a narrow street on a site about by . The front of the mansion faces Osvobodilne (Liberation) street (), formerly known as via degli Orti grandi. This street, and the mansion, lay on the edge of the central part of Koper's Poliƒçastega island. Judging from Gothic finds, the area was extremely important during earlier periods of history. Building The mansion is one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in Koper. It has two stories above the ground floor. The ground floor windows are relatively small. The first floor windows are considerably larger and are decorated with lunettes or tympana, with balustraded balconies. The mansion has a fine main portal, above which is the main balcony. The noble family's coat of arms is above the door of the main portal, which is flanked by triple lancet windows. The smaller portal to the left, which leads to the garden, is inscribed with the date 1664. The right wing of the mansion was never completed. The renovated building has a floor area of as well as an extensive garden. The foundations lie on an artificial embankment of sand, gravel and loam capped with clay, about deep, which rests on load-bearing sandstone. Groundwater migration has eroded this embankment and caused subsidence and cracks to open in the structure. Recent deep excavations for municipal facilities caused pronounced settling in one corner, threatening the integrity of the building. In 2010 the foundations were stabilized through injecting a polymer-based mixture of latex and cellulose. Usage The oldest records of the mansion come from 1878, with a reference to Caterina De Gravisi, widow of Giuseppe Gravisi, as its owner. The renovated building today is the headquarters of the autonomous Italian national community of Koper. Other tenants are the Santorio Santorio thermal spa, ASCI sports club and the Society for Historical Research. The Insula-Obala Visual Artists Association, which runs the Insula Gallery in neighboring Izola, sometimes prepares exhibitions in the mansion.

It was built in 1710. It was the family seat of the Gravisi family, who held the title of the Marquis of Pietrapelosa. Today it is the home of a music school. Location The mansion is packed in among other houses in a densely built area of the old town but the Baroque facade is visible at the end of a blind alley, a typical arrangement for the period. Its facade fronts on the narrow Gallusova Street, with the north end jutting into the south of the roughly triangular Brolo square, once the center of medieval Koper. The square contains a large cistern fed by rainwater that supplies two stone fountains from the 15th century. Other buildings around the square are the Fontico (1392), formerly the city granary, the 14th century St. James's Church, Vissich‚ÄìNardi Mansion, Bishop's Mansion (≈†kofijska palaƒça) and Brutti Mansion. After World War II the square was converted into a park. Since 2010 the square has been the venue for the Baladoor Jazz Festival. Facade The Gravisi-Barbabianca is one of the most significant of Koper's Baroque buildings, obtaining its present form after major renovations in 1710. It illustrates a stage in the evolution of the mansions of the town from Romanticism to 19th century architecture. The mansion is a three-story building with a symmetrical facade. The windows on the ground floor are relatively small and high. On the floor above they are larger and more ornate, and on the floor above that they are less decorated. The central axis of the facade rises one floor higher than the two wings, capped by a tympanum supported by volutes. The main ground floor entrance in the center section is a carved stone portal that opens into a spacious atrium, which in turn opens onto the garden. There is a richly decorated balcony above the portal, with triple arch lancet windows. A more modest version of the balcony and the triple arched windows is repeated on the next floor. Above these, the facade is decorated with carved dragons over the two side windows and a representation of the family crest on the tympanum over the taller central window. Interior Over the centuries many works of art were collected in the mansion. The ceremonial hall was painted in the mid- nineteenth century by Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri, a fresco painter from Trieste. The fresco on the ceiling depicts Apollo on a chariot. Before World War II there was an important collection of work by the Venetian masters. The hall is reached by a richly stuccoed staircase from the left of the atrium. Three statues on the balustrade of the stairway represented sculpture, painting and architecture. One of these has been lost. Until 1967 there were four large equestrian portraits on the walls of this stairway: the Polish King John III Sobieski, Charles V, Duke of Lorraine the Austrian Emperor Leopold I and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The staircase today is hung with pictures of prominent members of the Gravisi family. Occupants The Gravisi family of Koper (Capodistria) has held the title of Marquis of Pietrapelosa since 1440, when Nicol√≤ Gravisi was given the title and the estate of Pietrapelosa as a reward for services rendered to the Republic of Venice. The palace site was originally occupied by a modest house of the Tacco family. According to an inscription on the first floor triple lancet windows, the house was incorporated in the south wing of the mansion in 1710 in a renovation initiated by Giovanni Nicol√≤ Gravisi. The Marquis Girolamo Gravisi married Countess Chiara Barbabianco on 12 September 1745. She brought a rich dowry, and from then the family assumed the surname of Gravisi-Barbabianca. With the upheavals of World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) followed by incorporation of Istria into the Republic of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito the family lost possession of the mansion. For a while the building was used as a tax office, and is therefore sometimes called \\"‚Äúthe cameral\\". The mansion today is used as a school of music. Concerts are held in the main hall, attracting lovers of both music and fine art. The Koper Music School (Glasbena ≈°ola Koper) was established in Portoro≈æ in 1948, moved to Koper in 1951 and moved into the Gravisi Barbabianca in 1955. In 1984 the building had a major restoration. In 2003 the Centre for Music Education, Koper was renamed Koper Music School, incorporating three coastal music schools of Izola, Koper and Piran. The concert hall is too small and the building does not have enough space, so the music school has been forced to hold classes in various other locations in Koper. On 25 November 2010 a ceremony was held in the concert hall to mark the 300th anniversary of the building. The Slovenian Minister of Education, Dr. Igor Luksic, was the keynote speaker. The historian Salvator ≈Ωitko attended the ceremony. He presented three of four major equestrian portraits that had been removed from the mansion in 1968 for restoration and were now finally being returned to their original site. Two of the portraits were briefly hung in their original locations, but were then returned to the Praetorian Palace and Koper Regional Museum. The other two are still waiting for restoration work.

The fish is from waters near Ambon Island and Bali, Indonesia. Description The psychedelic frogfish was first described in 2009 by Pietsch, Arnold, and Hall in the scientific journal Copeia, where they described it as having \\"a remarkable pigment pattern of white swirling stripes\\", hence their use of the term psychedelic. The psychedelic frogfish has been known to reach a length of . The skin of the psychedelic frogfish is flabby and fleshy, like other frogfishes. As a member of the order Lophiiformes, it has no scales. The skin covers the dorsal and ventral fins of the fish, which aid in camouflaging the fish. The skin may be covered in protective mucus. The psychedelic frogfish is different from many other anglerfishes in that it has a tiny luring appendage on its forehead. It has a relatively flat face with a mouth smaller than that of most anglerfishes. The coloring of the skin is a pattern of yellowish brown or peach colored stripes. This pattern covers the entire fish, including its fins, except for the hidden skin that is exposed when the lips are stretched forward, which is pale in color. At the margins, the skin can appear to be turquoise, although the exact nature of this coloration is unclear. Unlike some frogfishes, the psychedelic frogfish's color never changes, even if the habitat changes, and its offspring maintain that color as well. The fingerprint pattern, like the stripes on a zebra or the spots on a humpback whale's tail, is unique to each individual. This allows researchers to easily track multiple psychedelic frogfish in the wild and still identify them from any angle. depth perception similar to that of humans.left The face of the psychedelic frogfish is flattened; the cheeks and chin of the fish are extended laterally, much like the sides of a collapsible paper orb. The fish is able to both expand its head and extend its mouth forward, thus expanding the head and giving it a more elongated shape more often seen in large fish. The fish employs this behavior periodically when not feeding, as though yawning. Habitat right The psychedelic frogfish has so far been positively identified only at Ambon Island, Indonesia. It has been found in coral rubble, where it may be camouflaged from predators, though the location is primarily considered a 'muck' dive with few corals in the area. The fish have so far been found in locations where the water is deep, about away from the shoreline. Occasionally, the current in these areas is so strong that it makes it nearly impossible for the fish to swim, but usually the current is only mild. The coloration of the fish may be reminiscent of a number or hermatypic corals such as Symphyllia sinuosa, Leptoseris explanata, Pachyseris rugosa, Platygyra ryukyuensis, Pectinia lactuca, and Caulastrea furcata, all located in the Indo-West Pacific area. jet propulsion to swim forward. Habits =Locomotion= The psychedelic frogfish moves by walking on its pectoral fins over the seafloor, and has been observed using its fins to push off from the sea floor while at the same time shooting water through its gills to propel itself forward via jet propulsion. When doing so, the fish takes on a ball shape, and its behavior takes on that of a bouncing beach ball in the wind. These modes of locomotion are quite common for frogfishes, although rare for other fish. =Diet= The fish's diet likely consists of shrimp and small fish. Fish cannot be attracted using the illicium, as this spine is so reduced in size that it is unnoticeable externally. Instead, the psychedelic frogfish is presumed to strategically block off tight crevices which serve as passages to chambers in rocks and coral. The psychedelic frogfish was reported to wriggle itself very tightly into these holes, pushing with its fins, often for as long as two minutes before making its way inside the hole. Its skin may be covered with a protective mucus that aids in protecting it from scratches. This may also be an artifact of divers causing a fright response, especially when using high- powered strobes on underwater cameras. Psychedelic frogfish squeezing into a hole. The holes chosen are often so tight it may take a minute or two for the fish to maneuver into position, wriggling and pushing with its pectoral fins. =Defense= The psychedelic frogfish is relatively defenseless, but by hiding in these tight passages it is highly unlikely that any fish capable of swallowing it will be able to reach it. The combination of camouflage and the tight cavities in which it might hide makes it virtually impossible to find a psychedelic frogfish without overturning rocks and coral. According to Andy Shorten, co-owner of the Maluku Divers diving facility where the fish was discovered, \\"Seeking out these fish is probably going to be like the Holy Grail of divers for a while.\\" It is not known what the purpose is of the frilled cheeks and chin, although Pietsch, Arnold, & Hall hypothesize that these serve the same function as whiskers on a cat, which is to detect movement of potential predators. It is also hypothesized that the ball-like shape which the psychedelic frogfish takes on when swimming in the open may be a form of camouflage. When assuming this shape, the fish looks much less like a fish and more like a piece of debris bouncing along the reef. left =Spawning= One female psychedelic frogfish laid a cluster of about 220 eggs. Like all members of the genus Histiophryne, the female wrapped its caudal, dorsal, and anal fins around the cluster of eggs, hiding it from view. As the fish had already spawned when it was observed carrying the eggs, the length of time to hatching is unknown. right Discovery In June 1992, a shipment of assorted fishes from Bali, Indonesia, to the Dallas Aquarium at Fair Park revealed \\"something different\\"‚Äî two curious-looking anglerfish that became known as the \\"paisley anglers\\". They were in \\"very poor condition\\", and they died that same month. The specimens were preserved and sent to Theodore W. Pietsch for identification, along with a photo, although the photo was poor quality. However, after having been fixed in formalin and preserved in ethanol, their colors faded to a solid white, and their frilled faces lost their distinct frill shape. When the fish were analyzed, they were misidentified as cryptic anglerfish (Histiophryne cryptacanthus). These specimens were preserved and placed on a shelf. No one returned to them until their recent rediscovery in 2008. The species was first photographed in the wild during its second sighting in January 2008 by Buck Randolph, Fitrie Randolph and Toby Fadirsyair of Maluku Divers, located in Ambon, Indonesia. This quickly made headlines across American and Indonesian online newspapers, and the species was named one of the top 10 species discovered in 2009 by the International Institute for Species Exploration. Researchers were not sure how to classify it, since it was so different from any other known fish. The nearest genus, Histiophryne, had so many differences it was debated whether the fish deserved its own genus. In fact, it was even considered that the new fish did not belong in the family Antennariidae. However, DNA tests, which are today's standard for making the final call on whether a species is new, proved that the fish belonged in the genus Histiophryne. Ichthyologists Pietsch, Arnold, and Hall collected a holotype from the Laha I dive site at Maluku Divers on April 2, 2008. They discovered that the fish, when fixed in formalin and preserved in ethanol, shrank 23% (especially the fleshy cheeks and chin) within four months and hardened considerably. The colors all faded to a solid white, but when viewed using a dissecting microscope, the stripes were again visible. These observations were consistent with the mysterious paisley anglers from Bali in 1992. This was subsequently tested on the two specimens saved from 1992, and the stripes could still be found using this method.

Confirm Fly is from Rhode Island. under a Congressional authorization dated 16 January 1775 for a small tender or despatch vessel for the fleet. A schooner, often referred to as a sloop, she was first commanded by Lieutenant Hoystead Hacker. This ship appears to be the same one that General George Washington authorized on 18 September 1775 to sail for supplies. A list of those supplies brought to the colonies by Fly was reported in the Naval Documents of the American Revolution, Volume 2, pg 254. Early in 1776, Fly joined the squadron of Commodore Esek Hopkins off Reedy Island at the head of Delaware Bay, and on 17 February sailed with this force for its historic cruise to New Providence, America's first amphibious operation. Two nights out, Fly fouled the sloop USS Hornet, who was forced to return to port. Fly, however, was able to rejoin the squadron off New Providence 11 March, finding that the operation had been a great success, and that a large quantity of military stores sorely needed by the Continental Army had been taken. Heavily laden with the valuable supplies, the fleet departed New Providence 17 March, and on 4 April arrived off Long Island where it took two small British ships of war and two merchantmen. Two days later the squadron engaged the British sloop-of-war HMS Glasgow, damaging her so badly that she fled into Newport Rhode Island, leaving her tender to be captured. On 8 April the fleet arrived at New London, Connecticut to land the captured military stores. Fly patrolled off New London to learn the strength of the British Fleet until June, when she was detached to carry cannon from Newport to Amboy, New Jersey, where she was blockaded briefly by the British. Later in 1776, she cruised the New Jersey coast to intercept enemy ships bound for New York City. In an encounter with one of these in November, a number of Flys men were wounded, and she was damaged to the extent that she had to put in at Philadelphia to repair and refit. Ready for active service early in 1777, Fly convoyed merchantmen to sea, carried dispatches, and protected American ships in Cape May Channel. During the later part of the year, she was one of the Continental ships working with the Pennsylvania Navy to defend the Delaware River. In November when the British Fleet and powerful shore batteries forced the evacuation of Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer, giving the British control of the river, Fly and the other Continental ships were burned to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy.

Its common names include egusi in Yoruba ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòElegushi‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô in Igbo and agushi in Hausa. In English it is known as Mann's cucumeropsis and white-seed melon. It produces climbing vines up to 4 meters long which are covered in stiff hairs. The heart-shaped or roughly palmate leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and 14 wide. It bears small yellow male and female flowers with petals under a centimeter in length. The fruit is egg-shaped or an elongated ovate shape, up to about 19 centimeters long and 8 wide, and cream in color with green streaks. The fruit and white seeds are edible. The plant is grown more often for the seed oil than for the fruit.  Description  Cucumeropsis mannii is a member of the family Cucurbitaceae.

The seeds are commonly processed into soups and oil products, and are also eaten individually as a snack.National Research Council. (2006) p. 161 Benefits of Cucumeropsis mannii crops are many. The crop thrives in harsh climates and high yields are attainable in barren landscapes. Pests and disease are rarely a problem for farmers of this crop. Further benefits include increased soil quality through ground cover and suppression of weeds.National Research Council. (2006). p. 158 This crop also holds significant nutritional value. Oil makes up 44% of the seed, where 30% is protein rich in essential amino acids.National Research Council. (2006). p. 157 The seed is an excellent vegetable protein, and is ideal for battling nutritional debilitations. High in essential vitamins and minerals, egusi-itoo complements the starch and grain diet of most Africans.National Research Council. (2006). p. 162 Despite the crops obvious advantages, Cucumeropsis mannii remains an underutilized tool for nutritional intervention in Africa.  Growing conditions  The propagation of C. mannii is entirely by seed. In the transitional zone of West Africa this crop is sown during the major rainy season between March and May. Here the soils are rich in organic matter with a high rainfall of 1,400 mm distributed April‚ÄìOctober. Propagation starts after the first couple heavy rainfalls of the season. Holes around 2 cm deep and 1 m apart are planted with 3-4 seeds in each. A complete fertilizer should be applied before the propagation, with periodical application of nitrogenous fertilizer to follow. Growing methods contrast in the northern savannahs where conditions are more challenging with low fertility and organic matter. Rainfall in this zone is small at 800 mm annually. Cucumeropsis mannii is more successful in this area as a mixed crop, specifically grown in the ridges of sorghum crops. In more challenged areas this crop should be spaced at least 3 m apart, greatly decreasing per-hectare production. After 6‚Äì8 months, around September‚ÄìDecember the fruit are ready for harvest. The physical signs of ripe fruit include creamy colour and dried stems and leaves. Each plant averages at 2-5 fruits, each weighing 0.8-1.8 kg and containing 90-400 seeds.  Stress tolerance  This melon can survive in nutrient poor soils in climatically diverse areas. The high degree of ground cover from the plant blankets the soil protecting it from sun exposure and water loss, and therefore increases the quality of the soil. It can thrive in humid, dry and upland areas with little to no consequence on growth or quality of crop. It is drought tolerant, thriving in West Africa's dry regions, adapted to semiarid zones, and is also compatible with warmer tropical highlands.National Research Council.

The fruit fly species Dacus punctifrons may also attack the fruit of this plant. The fruit generally rots due to the existence of larvae. Halticus tibialis is a flea hopper similar to an aphid and may also cause problems for egusi-itoo crops, often killing the leaves of the plant by sucking out sap.

(2006). p. 157-158 This has significant positive effects on the female farmer who spends the majority of her time weeding.  Consumption and uses  Egusi-itoo is primarily grown for the oily seeds it produces. Seeds are commonly ground up and used to thicken soups and stews or as an ingredient in dumplings. Another consumption of egusi-itoo is in patty form after oil has been extracted from the seed, it is then eaten as a protein substitute. Most commonly it is dehulled and consumed as a snack.National Research Council. (2006). p. 155 In Northern Ghana egusi oil is the second most prominent cooking oil. The kernel of the egusi-itoo seed contains semi-drying oils which can be used for making soaps, cooking and for illumination, with the rest of the seed fed to livestock. The flesh of Cucumeropsis mannii is edible but is not commonly consumed due to its bitter taste. In some countries such as Ghana the juice of the fruit is used as healing ointment.  Nutritional information  The kernel of the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% linoleic acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% stearic acid and 10.9% palmitic acid. Vitamins Thiamin, Niacin, B1 and B2 are also prevalent in the seed, as well as many micronutrients. Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate.National Research Council. (2006). p. 157-159 The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient vegetable protein. This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories. Just 100 g of seed daily provides essential fatty acid, amino acid and Vitamin E requirements. There is potential for these seeds as a critical tool for interventions in diseases such as marasmus and kwashiorkor.  Practical information  There is a need for more widespread knowledge on Cucumeropsis mannii in order to re-popularize the crop and spread its many benefits. NGOs should distribute vital knowledge on crop propagation and handling, and use the crop for nutritional interventions. Importance must be placed on specific harvest timing. Early or late harvesting of Cucumeropsis mannii has a correlation with seed quality. It is important to ensure that the fruit has reached full maturity before harvest in order to secure maximum egusi-itoo yields. Full maturity is signified by fully dried plant leaves. Seeds of this fruit should be harvested after 65 days after anthesis. This allows for increased germination ability of stored seeds ensuring productive future yields. It is recommended that farmers select for the seeds with the highest weight for best germination results. In order to achieve the highest possible seed quality it is recommended that harvested fruits be left for 10‚Äì20 days to after-ripen. In order to combat pests such as the Dacus punctifrons fields should be rotated yearly, as the fly pupae remain in the soil. Increases in egusi-itoo yield and proper storing techniques will help rural subsistence farmers increase food supplies, while allowing for profit gain.  References  *National Research Council.

Long before the European settlers arrived in North America, the Native Americans took part in hunting wild turkeys. Cody Ledford is widely considered the best turkey Hunter in the world.NWTF  History of Hunting Female (hen) turkey History By the early 1900s, the turkey population had been decimated in North America because of habitat destruction, commercial hunting, and lack of wildlife regulations. Hunters, wildlife agencies and conservation organizations intervened and turkey populations rebounded dramatically. More than 7 million wild turkeys now roam North America, with populations in every U.S. state but Alaska. Wild turkeys are also hunted in parts of Mexico and Canada. http://www.nwtf.org/all_about_turkeys/history_of_hunting.html =Species and subspecies= There are two species of turkey pursued as game animals in North America, the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and the ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata). The wild turkey is further divided into six subspecies. To harvest a bird from the Eastern, Osceola, Rio Grande, and Merriam's wild turkey subspecies is known in turkey hunting circles as a \\"grand slam\\".http://www.nwtf.org/all_about_turkeys/records_slams.html Harvesting a bird from all the subspecies in the \\"grand slam\\" as well as the Gould's wild turkey subspecies and the ocellated turkey is known as a \\"world slam\\".http://www.nwtf.org/all_about_turkeys/records_slams.html =Techniques and equipment= Woman carrying a dead turkey after a hunt in California Depending on local rules and regulations, the wild turkey is hunted either in the spring or fall.http://www.wildturkeyzone.com/hunting/stateregs.htm Spring hunts target gobblers (male turkeys) and fall hunts usually target either sex. Spring hunting coincides with the wild turkey mating season, where gobblers can be called into gun range with calls that mimic the sounds of a hen.http://www.wildturkeyzone.com/hunting/tips.htm Fall seasons occur when turkeys are in flocks, and the typical fall hunt strategy is to \\"bust up\\" or \\"scatter\\" a flock of turkeys, and then use turkey calls to encourage the scattered birds to group back up together.http://www.midwestturkeycall.com/locating_and_strategy.asp The shotgun is a popular weapon for hunting wild turkey. Shotgun gauges used in turkey hunting include 10, 12, 16, and 20 gauge.#2, #4, #5, and #6 lead shot is often used in 2 3/4\\", 3\\", or 3 1/2\\" shotshells. Bow and arrow is starting to become popular among hunters. Common hunting broadheads are used for body shots while \\"guillotine\\" style broadheads are intended to remove the head with the shot. Some states even allow small caliber rifles to be used while pursuing turkeys. Turkey hunters usually wear full camouflage, from head to toe, to conceal themselves from the wild turkey's excellent eyesight. This includes pants, shirt, hat, boots, gloves, and a mask. Many hunters wear a turkey vest with a cushion to sit on and compartments to carry their calls and dead turkeys. Calls used in turkey hunting fall into two categories, air and friction activated. Air calls include diaphragms, wingbone calls, Turpin yelpers, trumpet calls, and snuff tube calls. Friction calls include box calls, pot and peg calls, scratch boxes, and push pin calls. These calls are relatively easy to use and even a beginner can use them to call in turkeys. Common locator calls include owl hooters, crow calls, hawk calls, and anything that will produce a loud noise. This causes a turkey to \\"shock\\" gobble and give away his location. Scent control also contributes to the turkey hunter's technique. While artificial or synthetic scents like those used by hunters of deer and other game are not typically utilized while hunting turkey, removal or masking of foreign scents from the hunter and his equipment is a technique which is commonly used by hunters of wild turkey. Turkey hunters will often \\"owl\\" to shock a gobbler into gobbling. To do this, you can either use your voice or you can even use a specific call to produce the sound. Crows will also shock a gobbler into gobbling. When the gobbler gobbles, he gives away his location so you can sneak up on him and get close and \\"call him up\\". In the past couple of years many turkey hunters have started using decoys to make it seem like a \\"jake\\"‚Äî a young gobbler‚Äî is trying to breed a hen. When a dominant gobbler sees that, he gets territorial and aggressive because he wants to breed the hen rather than a youngster. There is no single decoy that covers every possible situation. In a typical hunting scenario, either with a shotgun or a bow, the hunter waits for the dominant male, or \\"tom\\", to get within range. Oftentimes in the Spring, the dominant male will come within range while in \\"strut\\". The hunter will then wait for a time where the Wild Turkey is parallel to their position and the side of the head is exposed. This affords the hunter an opportunity to harvest the bird with a clean shot in order to make the harvest quick. Additionally, this has the benefit of ensuring that the \\"shot\\" from the shotgun does not penetrate the meat nor shred the feathers during the harvest.

It strives to offer an effective means of communication aimed primarily at junior ranks but also of interest to all ranks of the British Army, cadets and the wider military community, including veterans and members of the public with an interest in militaria. Its objectives include providing a channel of welfare information; promoting the British Army's image internally and externally; and contributing to the upkeep of morale within the Service. Tri-annual independent readership research (by the Army Management Consultancy Services) of its core audience has produced strong evidence that most officers and soldiers read some of the magazine, and that some officers and soldiers read most of the magazine. The publication's robust and oversubscribed correspondence pages, which allow serving personnel to air grievances, criticise procedure and raise areas of concern, further indicate that the readership is genuinely engaged with the magazine. The magazine is distributed free to serving personnel (70,000 copies), but paid-for subscriptions ‚Äì an unusual requirement for a government-sponsored publication ‚Äì have risen year- on-year, most recently by 2 per cent. SOLDIER subscribers number 2,627 (), with an additional 4,514 copies sold through newsagents in the UK. About 15,000 visitors from 85 countries read the magazine online each month, taking away a positive impression of the British Army. In January 2008, a free-access digital edition of SOLDIER was launched on the World Wide Web. The range of coverage includes news sections; features; celebrity interviews; sport; music, book and games reviews; and, crucially, a controversial warts-and-all correspondence section, in which military personnel are invited to have their say. After some initial misgivings about \\"washing dirty linen in public\\" the Army's chain of command is now fully signed up to the section, regarding it both as a valuable pressure valve for serving personnel with grievances, and confirmation of issues flagged up by the MOD's independent Continuous Attitude Surveys and the Chief of the General Staff's Briefing Team. Tapes and CDs of the magazine produced by the Talking Newspapers organisation are used for English language tutoring of Gurkha recruits, and the magazine is extensively used as a language learning aid by British Council teachers instructing former Soviet Bloc military personnel under the British Government's Partnership for Peace initiative. History Given the go-ahead by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery as a morale-boosting magazine for British Liberation Army troops then fighting in Europe, the first fortnightly edition of SOLDIER was printed in Brussels in March 1945. It was conceived by Colonel Sean Fielding (later to become Editor of The Tatler and Daily Express) while he was serving in the Western Desert. Its first editor was Philip 'Pip' Youngman Carter (the husband of detective fiction writer Margery Allingham) who, in due course, also went on to become editor of The Tatler. A reporter from SOLDIER was one of the first to record the horrors of the Belsen concentration camp and the magazine's \\"scoops\\" included revealing the secret engineering feat of Operation Pluto. The publication was expected to disappear as peace and normality returned, but survived to become the house magazine of the entire British Army. As the Armed Forces reduced in size after the Second World War, so the magazine's circulation declined to fewer than 20,000 by the end of the 1980s. It was radically redesigned in October 1997 and changed from fortnightly to monthly publication. It is printed by Wyndeham (Roche). Awards Since switching in October 1997 from fortnightly production to an expanded monthly aimed broadly at a younger audience, SOLDIER was named in 1998, 2000 and 2005 as the best internal magazine in Britain by the British Association of Communicators in Business (CiB), the leading professional corporate communicators' body in the UK. It was named the best internal magazine in Britain for 2009, 2010 and 2011 by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations and was awarded the same title in 2010 by the Institute of Internal Communication.

He made his fortune as the founder of the spread betting firm IG Index in 1974, but was best known for his political activism, being a major donor to the Conservative Party and treasurer of the UK Independence Party from 2011 to 2014. Early life and career Wheeler was adopted just before his second birthday by an American, Alexander Wheeler, a former Army officer and heir to a banking fortune, and his young wife Betty, daughter of a baronet, Sir John Gibbons. The couple also adopted a little girl, Susan, on the same day. Wheeler spent his early years growing up on the Leighon Estate in Manaton, Devon. He was educated at Eton College. He did his National Service with the Welsh Guards, before studying at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he graduated with a second-class degree in law. He practised law as a barrister, before becoming an investment banker. However, Wheeler found his niche through IG Index, which pioneered spread betting. Originally, the company was launched to allow Britons to speculate on gold, when foreign exchange controls made it exorbitantly expensive to actually buy it. Politics =Conservative Party= Although a successful businessman, Wheeler was not a well-known figure nationally until he donated ¬£5m to the Conservative Party during the 2001 election campaign. This was, and remains, the largest single donation ever made to a political party in the United Kingdom. In January 2008, Wheeler brought an action against the government, represented by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, over the government's process of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.R (John Stuart Wheeler) v Office of the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2008] EWHC 936 (Admin) The action sought to prevent the government from completing ratification of the treaty, on the grounds that it was illegal for a government to breach the public's legitimate expectation of adherence to manifesto and other commitments. The government, along with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, had pledged in their 2005 manifestos to hold a referendum on the European Constitution, which Wheeler held did not have \\"significant or material differences\\" from the Treaty of Lisbon. This action failed.R (Wheeler) v Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary [2008] EWHC 1409 (Admin) Wheeler was seen as belonging to the right wing of the Conservative Party. He supported Liam Fox in the 2005 leadership contest, and switched his support to David Davis against David Cameron in the final run-off. He was critical of the leadership of David Cameron during its first few months. On 28 March 2009, Wheeler donated ¬£100,000 to the UK Independence Party (UKIP) after criticising David Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Union. He said, \\"If they kick me out I will understand. I will be very sorry about it but it won't alter my stance.\\" The following day he was expelled from the Conservative Party. =The Trust Party= On 29 March 2010, Wheeler announced that he was forming a new political party to be called the Trust Party and that he would run for the Bexhill and Battle seat. The seat was won by Gregory Barker for the Conservatives, but Wheeler polled 4.9% and therefore lost his deposit. The new party also fielded a candidate in Perth and North Perthshire, where it won 1.1% of the vote. =UKIP treasurer= In 2011, Wheeler was appointed treasurer of UKIP to spearhead fundraising in advance of the 2014 European elections. His appointment was seen as a blow for the Conservatives because of his network of contacts.Woodhouse, Craig (10 January 2011). \\"Former Tory donor named as Ukip's new treasurer\\". London Evening Standard. Party leader Nigel Farage said the move would enable the party to \\"raise serious money\\" as a lack of funds was \\"holding them back\\". =Vote Leave co-treasurer= At the launch of the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit in October 2015, Wheeler was reported to be one of the new group's three major donors, with Peter Cruddas and John Mills; the three men were appointed as joint co-treasurers.Paul Goodman, Vote Leave launches, Join it today dated 9 October 2015 at conservativehome.com Personal life Wheeler was called an \\"obsessive\\" gambler, taking a keen interest in card and risk games and having played bridge with Lord Lucan on 6 November 1974, two days before his disappearance, and with Omar Sharif, as well as being a regular competitor in World Series of Poker championships.

The site lies west of Fayette across the Sevier River. The community was named after Dover, in England. History The land was first settled in 1877-1878 by 45 families led by William Robinson. They found the soil was good, but water somewhat scarce. By 1879 they had a schoolhouse, also used for church and civic functions, and a post office, which operated until 1895. There were also two general stores, where residents typically paid for goods in kind with eggs. When Utah Territory achieved statehood on January 4, 1896, Dover's celebrations were marked by an utter and complete tragedy. They had no cannon to fire, instead exploding some dynamite with a well-driving hammer. The hammer, which had been through many such celebrations before, blew apart, injuring several people. In the years 1910-1916, irrigation companies in Millard County dammed the Sevier River some distance to the north. The resulting reservoir, now known as Yuba Reservoir, covered parts of Dover's farmland, driving out some of the residents. A severe drought in the 1930s finished off the town; a few houses were moved, and most of the others were later torn down. Nothing remains but some foundations and fallen buildings, and a memorial cemetery.

They are a traditional observation point for Brixham trawler races, both past and present. The site of Battery Gardens was first used as a battery in 1586 during the war between England and Spain. The Battery was not permanently armed but was certainly 'active' throughout the American War of Independence during the 1780s and the Napoleonic War against France during the first decade of the 19th century. The Battery was also used by the Coast Guard for gunnery training during the 1870s. All that can be seen today was built from June ‚Äì September 1940 immediately following the defeat and evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk after the fall of France. Of the 116 Emergency Batteries built in 1940 from John O'Groats to Kent, to Lands End, and to South Wales only 7 remain. Of these Brixham battery is the most complete. English Heritage had surveyed the whole site and it is now a scheduled monument. The Battery File:Battery_observation_post.jpgBattery Observation Post File:The_altmark.jpgThe Altmark File:Brixham Battery gun floor.jpgNo.2 4.7inch Gun Floor \\"Battery\\" is a category of artillery weapons and the soldiers who operate them. The World War II coast and defence batteries had two main guns, anti-aircraft weapons and, in the case of Brixham, extra harbour defence guns. A total of about one hundred officers and soldiers manned the Battery. The Battery was originally manned by soldiers from the Royal Artillery, but following the receding threat of invasion the Battery was later manned by 378 Battery ‚Äì of which almost all were members of the Home Guard.  History  = 1776 ‚Äì 1890 = It is known that as far back as 1586 a gun platform was established in battery grounds against the threat of attack from Spain. This was maintained until 1664. During the period 1776 ‚Äì 1890 the battery was known variously as Furzdon, Furzeham, Furzham, Furzedown and Fishcombe point. During the end of the 18th century Brixham was the station for the western approach of the Royal Navy, and as such was a very necessary port for the Navy, especially during the American Civil War of Independence. When France joined America in 1778 and Spain in 1779, the Board of Ordnance decided that, along with other naval stations along the south coast of England, Brixham was to be protected by gun emplacements. Battery gardens was to be the most westerly battery covering the harbour. The militia were to prepare the positions, and the guns, 24 pounders, arrived in May 1780 at the same time as the Berry Head guns (the site of a Napoleonic fort a little along from battery gardens). The land being commandeered, compensation being paid in 1783 at the end of hostilities. At the start of the French wars the land was purchased and the guns returned. Again the guns were removed at the end of hostilities. The battery was still a military station in a report of 2 June 1862 and was manned by the 11th Devon Artillery Volunteers, Royal Garrison Artillery. In a naval return of 13 March 1891 there had been a 64 pounder muzzle loading rifled cannon at Furzham on 1 April 1889. This was mounted on gun racers about where number five gun had been eighty years before. = 1940 ‚Äì 1945 = 40mm Bofors light anti-aircraft gun The role of Brixham battery, in conjunction with a similar battery at Corbyn Head, Torquay was to defend all the beaches against landings. Beaches such as those at Torre Abbey, Livermead, Hollicombe, Preston, Paignton, Goodrington, Broadsands and Elberry Cove would have made ideal sites for enemy landings. The Corbyn Head battery was well sited to cover targets within the Bay while the Brixham battery could also engage craft further out in Lyme Bay. In addition to the 'big guns' the batteries were equipped with Anti-aircraft weaponry and Brixham battery also had a 6 pounder Hotchkiss harbour defence gun. The Anti-aircraft defences at Brixham battery consisted of a 37mm AA gun, an Unrotated Projectile Projector and 40mm Bofors guns. The Brownstone Battery complex from across the River Dart estuary, showing the battery lookout, some buildings, both searchlight posts, one gun emplacement, and sundry other concrete worksThe Brixham battery and a similar one at Corbyn Head, Torquay, were only two of many sited along the South Coast. One of the more heavily armed batteries was at Froward Point, near Kingswear, known as Brownstone battery. This was a 'close defence' battery sited in June 1942 and armed with 'LS' (Land Service) 6 inch Mark VII guns on mark II mountings. The role of the battery was to engage enemy forces, such as landing craft and mother ships carrying landing craft, attempting landings on Slapton Sands or Blackpool Sands beaches and to destroy any beach head which had been established. Parts of the gun beds, Battery Observation Post, magazines, searchlights and other features can still be seen, and are now preserved by the National Trust. The battery observation post is let by the trust to the National Coastwatch Institution, known as NCI Froward Point, and manned by volunteer watchkeepers keeping a lookout for coastal dangers. In 1940, during the Second World War, the site was manned initially by the Royal Artillery 362 Battery 18 CA GP Regiment, becoming 362 Battery 556 Regiment in 1941 and 378 Battery 556 Regiment in 1942. The Royal Artillery was strongly supported by local men transferred from 'D' Company (10th Torbay) Battalion Devonshire Home Guard. Trained in all the functions of the Battery and being able to man it on their own if the occasion arose, the crews became very efficient and were often commended by the Brigadier Royal Artillery Southern Command and Commander of Coast Artillery South West District. The guns were never used in earnest against enemy forces though there were occasions when alerts were ordered. German E-boats entered the bay on several occasions but were never engaged since this might have given away the location of the Battery ‚Äì information deemed to valuable to an enemy landing force. In principle, engagement of enemy vessels would have been left to the Royal Navy unless orders to the contrary were given by the Port Commander or higher authorities. There were, however, many occasions on which the anti-aircraft defences at the battery were in action against the hit-and-run raiders attacking Brixham harbour and shipping in the Bay. These included Messerschmitt ME109's carrying a single bomb, and later the Focke Wolfe 190's which carried a formidable bomb.

The company assumed the new name Original Ballet Russe after a split between de Basil and Blum. De Basil led the renamed company, while Blum and others founded a new company under the name Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. It was a large scale professional ballet company which toured extensively in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the United States, and Central and South America. It closed down operations in 1947.  History  = Dissolution of Ballets Russes and formation of Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo = The company's name is derived from the Ballets Russes of impresario Sergei Diaghilev. The last season of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was 1929, during which it toured and performed in both London, England, and Paris, France. During the final season, it produced the new ballets The Prodigal Son and Le Bal. The company performed for the final time in London at the Covent Garden Theatre on July 26, 1929. Diaghliev died of complications from diabetes a month later, on August 19, 1929. In 1931, with the help from financier Serge Denham, Ren√© Blum and Colonel Wassily de Basil formed Les Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo. One of the new company's board members was American businessman Jim Thompson. = Massine and Balanchine join = The company hired Leonide Massine and George Balanchine as choreographers. The majority of the works performed had previously been staged by Diaghilev's company, but other new works were commissioned, such as Jeux d'enfants, with music by Georges Bizet and sets by Joan Mir√≥. Featured dancers included David Lichine (who soon began choreographing ballets for the company), and the \\"baby ballerinas\\" Irina Baronova, Tamara Toumanova, and Tatiana Riabouchinska. The company conductor was Efrem Kurtz,Anderson, Martin, \\"A Century in Music: Manuel Rosenthal in Conversation\\" (April 2000). Tempo (New Ser.) (212): pp. 31-37. who stayed until 1942, touring with them extensively, and the librettist was Boris Kochno. The company gave its first performance in Monte Carlo in 1932. Without consulting Blum, Col. de Basil dropped Balanchine after one year ‚Äì ostensibly because he thought that audiences preferred the works choreographed by Massine. Librettist Kochno was also let go, while dancer Toumanova left the company when Balanchine was fired. According to historian Katherine Sorley- Walker, however, Balanchine and Kochno left of their own volition, because they found Blum and De Basil \\"dictatorial.\\" = Blum leaves, Nijinska joins = Col. de Basil and Blum had an acrimonious relationship,Homans, Jennifer. \\"Ren√© Blum: Life of a Dance Master,\\" New York Times (July 8, 2011). which ended in 1934 with Blum breaking up the partnership. Col. de Basil renamed his company Ballets Russes de Colonel W. de Basil. In April, 1934, Bronislava Nijinska directed the company's season at the Th√©√¢tre de Monte-Carlo, presenting her ballets Bolero, Variations, Etude, and Les Comediens Jaloux. Nijinska created Les Cent Baisers for the company's London season in 1935. The company struggled financially in the wake of the Great Depression, and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Sol Hurok, an American, took over the management of the Ballet Russe and brought the company to the United States. = The company splits = In 1937, Massine left, joining with Blum to form their own company,\\"BLUM BALLET SOLD TO COMPANY HERE; World Art, Inc., Formed by Julius Fleischmann, Takes Over Monte Carlo Troupe,\\" New York Times (November 20, 1937). recruiting several dancers from their previous group. However, the ballets which Massine had choreographed while under contract with Col. de Basil were owned by his company. Massine sued de Basil in London to regain the intellectual property rights to his own works. He also sued to claim the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo name. The jury decided that de Basil owned Massine's ballets created between 1932 and 1937, but not those created before 1932.australiadancing through the Internet Archive It also ruled that both successor companies could use the name Ballet Russe ‚Äì but only Massine and Blum's company could be called Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. Col. de Basil renamed his company again, calling it the Covent Garden Russian Ballet and bringing on Michel Fokine as resident choreographer. Sol Hurok ended up managing Blum and Massine's company as well. The Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo and the Original Ballet Russe often performed near each other. Under its new name, the company's first season, starting May 1938, was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Massine's Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo had a season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane a few hundred yards away, and this season was known as the \\"London Ballet Wars\\". After London, Hurok booked both of the companies to perform in New York (with de Basil's company playing the Hollywood Theatre), for a total of fifteen weeks, making it the longest ballet season of New York. Along with management, the two companies also shared dancers. Hurok continued to have the companies perform near each other; he hoped to reunite the companies, but ultimately was unsuccessful. The company then spent some weeks on a \\"whistle stop\\" tour of America, sleeping on the special train hired to transport them. In 1939, the company spent a six-week season at Covent Garden. English ballerina Mona Inglesby danced with the company that season. Finally, in 1939, Col. de Basil gave the company its final name, the Original Ballet Russe. The company toured extensively throughout Europe and Australia, visiting Australia in 1936‚Äì37, 1938‚Äì39, and 1939‚Äì40.Amanda. \\"Ballets Russes\\", The Age (17 July 2005)During his visit to Australia, de Basil commissioned work from Australians, especially from designers, who included Sidney Nolan and Kathleen and Florence Martin. He also instigated a design competition for an original Australian ballet, which was won by Donald Friend with designs for a ballet based on a fictitious event in the life of Ned Kelly.. A number of dancers stayed in Australia, including Kira Bousloff, who went on to found the West Australian Ballet. = During World War II = Soon after they returned to the United States in 1939, World War II broke out. The company suffered financially, but was able to book an entire cast of dancers on tour to Havana, Cuba, in 1941. Alberto Alonso and his first wife Patricia Denise danced all the principal roles on the Havana tour. The company could not pay the dancers adequately, and some took second jobs in nightclubs to survive. Principal dancers were forced to take roles that were not solos.Associated Press, \\"Former New York City Ballet star Yvonne Mounsey, who founded West Coast school, dies at 93,\\", Washington Post (Oct. 3, 2012). While in Cuba, David Lichine and Tatiana Leskova appeared in Conga Pantera at the Cabaret Tropicana. Other dancers included Tamara Grigorieva, Nina Verchinina, Anna Leontieva, Genevieve Moulin, Tatiana Leskova, Anna Volkova, Your Lazowski, Dimitri Romanoff, Roman Jasinski, Paul Petroff, and Oleg Tupin. = Disbandment = In 1947, the Original Ballet Russe gave its last season in London before disbanding. The company was revived in 1951 by family members G. Kirsta and the Grigorievs, after Col. de Basil died. The company proved to be financially unstable, and folded while on tour in Europe in 1952.  In popular culture  A feature documentary about the company, featuring interviews with many of the dancers, was released in 2005, with the title Ballets Russes. A Thousand Encores: Ballets Russes in Australia was a documentary screened on ABC Television on November 3, 2009, about the company's three visits to Australia between 1936 and 1940.

She taught at the College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York, the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and American University in Washington, DC, and was literary editor of The New Republic for several years. For two decades, she and her partner, Sybil Pike, operated a bookstore, Wayward Books, in Sargentville, Maine, until 2009 when they moved to a retirement home in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. She turned 100 in July 2018.http://www.thegayalmanac.com/2018/07/happy-100th-birthday-to- memoirist.html?m=1 Life Grumbach was born in New York City, a fifth- generation Manhattanite, to Leonard William and Helen Isaac. She grew up in Manhattan, where she attended elementary school PS 9. A very bright student, she skipped many grades and entered high school at age eleven. She was not prepared socially for this early advancement and did poorly, developing a stammer and losing her self-confidence. She was encouraged by the principal to take a year off from high school, and when she returned, she was an indifferent student in the classroom but showed talent in theater and in creative writing. In her senior year, she won a citywide short story contest, which helped secure her admission to Washington Square College of New York University. She majored in philosophy and graduated Phi Beta Kappa, receiving her BA degree in 1939. She earned her MA degree in medieval literature in 1940 from Cornell University. At Cornell, she met her future husband, Leonard Grumbach, who had his doctorate in neurophysiology. They were married on October 5, 1941, and during 1940‚Äì41, Grumbach worked for Loew's Inc./MGM writing subtitles for films distributed abroad. During 1941‚Äì42, she was employed as a proofreader for Mademoiselle magazine and then for the journal Architectural Forum in 1942‚Äì43, eventually rising to the position of associate editor. When her husband was drafted during World War II, Grumbach joined the Navy in 1943 as an officer in the WAVES and served in the Navy from 1943 to 1945. After the war, Grumbach moved around the country with her husband as he taught physiology. During this period, the Grumbachs had four daughters: Barbara, Jane, Elizabeth, and Kathryn. Before the birth of their fourth daughter, the Grumbachs settled in Albany, New York, where Leonard Grumbach taught at Albany Medical College and Doris Grumbach began a career in teaching. From 1957 to 1960, she taught senior English at the Albany Academy for Girls. In 1960, she became a professor of English at the College of Saint Rose in Albany and taught there until 1971. During her time at the college, Grumbach also began to focus on her writing career and published her first two novels, The Spoil of the Flowers (1962), and The Short Throat, The Tender Mouth (1964). In 1967 she published a literary biography of novelist Mary McCarthy titled The Company She Kept, based in part on correspondence and other documents which McCarthy had shared with Grumbach. In 1971, after raising their children, Grumbach left her husband. She spent a year in Saratoga Springs, New York, helping to set up the external degree program at Empire State College. Following her 1972 divorce, she began a relationship with Sybil Pike, who became and remains her life partner. In 1972, accepting a position at The New Republic magazine as literary editor, she and Pike moved to Washington, D.C., where Grumbach worked for the magazine for two years. After it was sold, and she lost her job, she remained in Washington and in 1975 accepted a position as professor of American literature at American University. During this time, she wrote a nonfiction column for The New York Times Book Review. In 1979, Grumbach published the novel Chamber Music, which was critically well received and helped establish her reputation as a novelist. In six years, three more books followed: The Missing Person (1981), The Ladies (1984), and The Magician's Girl (1987). During this period, Grumbach also taught creative writing at the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa and at The Johns Hopkins University, where she substituted briefly for John Barth. Grumbach also was a book reviewer and commentator for the Morning Edition of National Public Radio and the televised MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour. In 1985, Grumbach resigned her professorship at American University but remained in Washington, D.C., for five more years. She and Pike opened a bookstore for rare and used books, named Wayward Books, located near Eastern Market, on Capitol Hill. In 1990 Grumbach and Pike moved to Sargentville, Maine, and opened their bookstore there. In 2009 Wayward Books and their house in Maine were sold. They moved to a Quaker retirement community in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Grumbach continues to write, contributing pieces of memoir and articles on old age to The American Scholar. Critical reception of Grumbach's work Several facets of Grumbach‚Äôs work have won her both praise and criticism. Grumbach is often lauded as a feminist writer championing the cause of women in her fiction and revealing the economic, social, and psychological difficulties women face. Other critics find her work not feminist enough and regard her portrayals of women characters as stilted. Grumbach is both highly regarded and often criticized for her focus on gay and lesbian characters. A number of her works, such as The Spoil of the Flowers, Chamber Music, and The Ladies, focus on gay and lesbian themes and characters. Grumbach writes in a wide range of genres, as a novelist, literary critic, essayist, biographer, memoirist, and cultural critic. As a writer who explored gay and lesbian themes in the 1950s and 1960s, Grumbach tends to be grouped with other groundbreaking authors who explored these themes and issues at a time in which the popular sentiment was to regard homosexuality as deviant behavior. Such writers as Ann Bannon, Marijane Meaker, Sylvia Townsend Warner, and Patricia Highsmith explored gay and lesbian themes in positive ways similar to Grumbach. As Ann Cothran, a literary critic of writers on lesbian themes and author of a study on Simone de Beauvoir states, perhaps Grumbach‚Äôs ‚Äúmost important contribution to gay and lesbian literature is the manner in which she consistently represents homosexual relationships matter of factly, as an integral part of the human landscape. Grumbach depicts lesbianism as a positive, life-giving force in women's lives.‚Äù Grumbach‚Äôs novels tend to be literary and literate in tone in that she often draws upon well-known writers or writings for her titles and for references within her works. For example, she drew her title for The Spoil of the Flowers from a poetic fragment by Euripides, the title for The Short Throat, The Tender Mouth from \\"The Pardoner‚Äôs Tale\\" in The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer, and The Magician‚Äôs Girl from a poem by Sylvia Plath. In addition, Grumbach‚Äôs writings often refer to well-known or arcane writings; her dialogues or internal monologues have phrases from Latin, French, and other languages. Critics have noted that she has drawn from historic persons and events for her fiction. In Chamber Music, for example, she bases the characters and the plot on the American composer Edward MacDowell and his wife, Marian, upon Marilyn Monroe in The Missing Person, upon Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby in The Ladies, and Sylvia Plath and Diane Arbus in The Magician‚Äôs Girl. A significant part of her reputation and current audience is based upon her two memoirs that focus upon aging: Coming into the End Zone and Extra Innings. She has also explored spiritual reflections about her life in The Presence of Absence: On Prayers and an Epiphany and in her memoir Fifty Days of Solitude. Grumbach has written introductions and critical assessments to the works of such writers as Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, and Zora Neale Hurston. Grumbach also wrote an influential review of the novel Wise Blood by Flannery O'Connor. Her article on an aborted plan to write a biography of Willa Cather was published in The American Scholar in January 2001. Grumbach remains an important author for the focus she brought to women‚Äôs lives and women‚Äôs struggles in the redefinition of women‚Äôs roles from the 1950s onward. This dimension is especially true with regard to her positive presentations of lesbians and lesbian lifestyles. Grumbach is admired for her writing style and characterization, which often presents overtones of Henry James and of Gustave Flaubert and Jane Austen in Grumbach‚Äôs focus upon social conventions and their influence upon the development of individual lives and psyches. Grumbach is one of several 20th- century women writers, such as Sylvia Townsend Warner, Valentine Ackland, and Katherine Mansfield, who represent a transition from Victorian styles and emphases combined with the social and psychological concerns of modernism. Grumbach‚Äôs papers (from 1938 to 2002) are archived in the New York Public Library (Humanities and Social Sciences Library, Manuscripts and Archives Division). She received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from Publishing Triangle in 2000.

It acts as an antagonist of the Œº-opioid receptor (MOR) and as an agonist of the Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR), and as a result, blocks the effects of stronger agents with greater intrinsic activity such as morphine whilst simultaneously producing analgesia. Levallorphan was formerly widely used in general anesthesia, mainly to reverse the respiratory depression produced by opioid analgesics and barbiturates used for induction of surgical anaesthesia whilst maintaining a degree of analgesia (via KOR agonism). It is now less commonly employed for this purpose as the newer drug naloxone tends to be used instead. Levallorphan was also used in combination with opioid analgesics to reduce their side effects, mainly in obstetrics, and a very small dose of levallorphan used alongside a full agonist of the MOR can produce greater analgesia than when the latter is used by itself. The combination of levallorphan with pethidine (meperidine) was indeed used so frequently, a standardized formulation was made available, known as Pethilorfan. As an agonist of the KOR, levallorphan can produce severe mental reactions at sufficient doses including hallucinations, dissociation, and other psychotomimetic effects, dysphoria, anxiety, confusion, dizziness, disorientation, derealization, feelings of drunkenness, delusions, paranoia, and bizarre, unusual, or disturbing dreams.

Other important ingredients include: dried fruit (figs, raisins, apricots, dates, etc.) almonds and other kinds of nuts (the choice of nuts and dried fruit varies). It is flavoured with sugar, honey, vanilla, cinnamon and rum. The bread is cut into thin slices and layered in a clay pot or more often into a glass or crystal bowl. After each layer, the sauce of the boiled poppy seeds, with flavouring and nuts, is poured so that the bread is well soaked. The top is decorated with some extra nuts and fruit. The dish is served cold, at least several hours after preparation. Significance in Silesia Silesian cuisine can be very conservative. The tradition of serving mak√≥wki/mohnklie√üla/mohnpielen is well maintained among Silesian peoples and it is difficult to imagine a Silesian Christmas without the dish. By the elders, it would be considered unorthodox to prepare it outside the Christmas‚ÄîNew Year period. Preparing mak√≥wki outside Silesia can be a difficult due to the unavailability of finely grounded poppy seed (a special mill is usually required).

Speech by Martin Luther King Jr. Info and transcript. Say It Plain. A Century of Great African American Speeches. By American RadioWorks.Martin Luther King Jr.: \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\", delivered 3 April 1968, Memphis, Tennessee at Stanford University, including transcript of audience responses. King spoke on April 3, 1968, at the Mason Temple (Church of God in Christ Headquarters) in Memphis, Tennessee. On the following day, King was assassinated. The speech primarily concerns the Memphis Sanitation Strike. King calls for unity, economic actions, boycotts, and nonviolent protest, while challenging the United States to live up to its ideals. At the end of the speech, he discusses the possibility of an untimely death.  Excerpts from Dr. Martin Luther King's speech  Regarding the strike, King stated that He warned the protesters not to engage in violence lest the issue of injustice be ignored because of the focus on the violence. King argued that peaceful demonstrations were the best course of action, the only way to guarantee that their demands would be heard and answered. Regarding the Civil Rights Movement, King demanded that the United States defend for all its citizens what is promised in the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and stated that he would never give up until these natural rights were protected, saying Regarding economic boycotts, King advocated boycotting white goods as a means of nonviolent protest. He said that the individual Negro is poor but together they are an economic powerhouse, and they should use this power to stop support for racist groups and instead empower black businesses. Although the industries might not listen to protests, they would be forced to listen to boycotts lest they be driven out of business. King named several businesses as targets for the boycott: Toward the end of the speech, King refers to threats against his life and uses language that prophetically foreshadowed his impending death, but reaffirming that he was not afraid to die:  Biblical references  The language is seen by some as a \\"prophetic\\" analogy. King was referring to events described in the Biblical book of Deuteronomy. In it, Moses is the leader of the people of Israel, who follow him to life in a Promised Land. Before they reach it however, Moses is informed by God that, because of an incident in which he did not follow God's directions, he will not reach the land himself, but will only see it from a distance. Shortly after, Moses dies, and his successor Joshua leads them into the Promised Land.

She was built in 1973 by the J.J. Sietas Schiffswerft in Hamburg, West Germany as Aurella for SF Line for use on Viking Line traffic. Between 1982 and 1998 she sailed as Saint Patrick II, between 1998 and 2000 as Egnatia II, in 2000 as Ville de S√©te and between 2001 and 2002 as City of Cork, before being sold to her current owners. History Aurella was ordered by SF Line, Finland on 27 May 1972. She was delivered on 30 June 1973, and entered service three days later on Viking Line's Naantali‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìKapellsk√§r -route. She was the largest ship in the services across the Sea of √Öland at the time. Aurella continued in Viking Line service until September 1981, when she was laid up at Mariehamn. The following January she was sold to Irish Ferries and renamed Saint Patrick II, to provide extra capacity on the Ireland-France route in the summer months. The lack of traffic during the winter saw her chartered to other operators. During the winter 1982‚Äì1983 she was chartered to North Sea Ferries and Belfast Car Ferries, 1984‚Äì1985 to B&I; Line, 1985‚Äì1986 to DFDS Seaways and Stena Line, 1987‚Äì1988 and 1988‚Äì1989 again to B&I; Line, 1989‚Äì1990 to Sealink, and 1990‚Äì1991 to P&O; European Ferries. From 1992 until 1995 she spent the winters sailing for Tallink. During the Tallink charters she was also re-registered to Estonia, but returned to the Irish registry during the summer service with her owners. On 4 March 1994, while under charter to Tallink, Saint Patrick II participated in the evacuation of the sinking cruise ship near Porkkala, Finland. Falling passenger numbers caused Irish Ferries to withdraw Saint Patrick II from service in September 1997. In May 1998, Saint Patrick II was chartered to Hellenic Mediterranean Lines, renamed Egnatia II and placed on Brindisi‚ÄìPatras service. In May 2000 she was chartered to Balear Express, Spain and renamed Ville de S√©te for S√®te‚ÄìPalma service. Balear Express went bankrupt in September 2000, and Ville de S√©te was laid up. Between March and December 2001 she was chartered to Swansea Cork Ferries as City of Cork. In March 2002, City of Cork was sold to the Government of Canada and registered to Navigation Madeleine Inc, a subsidiary of Coop√©rative de Transport Maritime et A√©rien (CTMA). In June she was renamed C.T.M.A. Vacancier and placed on CTMA's service between Montreal and Cap-aux- Meules. In 2003 she was rebuilt at Les Mechins Dry Dock, Quebec with covered bridge wings. In January 2020, C.T.M.A. Vacancier was hired by the Soci√©t√© des traversiers du Qu√©bec to cover the Matane-Baie-Comeau-Godbout route across the Saint Lawrence River, while the M.V.

It stars Woody Harrelson as Arthur Poppington, a regular man who adopts a superhero persona named Defendor, with Elias Koteas, Michael Kelly, Sandra Oh and Kat Dennings in supporting roles. Plot Dr. Park (Sandra Oh), a psychiatrist, is interviewing Arthur Poppington (Woody Harrelson), a vigilante known as \\"Defendor\\", who tells about assaulting a police officer who claims to be working undercover. Dooney (Elias Koteas) is a corrupt detective who Defendor believes is in the employ of his nemesis, \\"Captain Industry,\\" who Arthur blames for his mother leaving him as a child, dying of drug abuse. Later; his grandfather ended up raising him, teaching him how to read through comics. Arthur is arrested for assaulting Dooney, but Fairbanks (Clark Johnson), the police captain in charge, connects with Arthur because their grandfathers both served in World War I. After Arthur is released, he takes his trench club and disappears. Arthur is living in the government construction depot where he works during the day. His life is very solitary, but after another confrontation with Dooney, he meets Angel (Kat Dennings), a prostitute who was smoking crack with Dooney. After he is brutally beaten by Dooney's friends, she helps him recover. She also informs him of Captain Industry's whereabouts and that his real name is Radovan Kristic (A. C. Peterson). He lets her move in with him, and enlists her help in apprehending Kristic. Angel reveals her real name is Katerina Debrofkowitz. Arthur's boss and close friend Paul (Michael Kelly) becomes concerned for Arthur after he finds that Arthur is living at the construction depot with Kat. Paul tries to help, offering Arthur the opportunity to come and live with him, which Arthur rejects. Paul gives Arthur a cell phone to use in case he is ever needed. That night, Arthur ventures out to spy on \\"Captain Industry\\" and Dooney, but he reveals himself. After a short chase, Arthur is beaten and shot. Paul gets Kat to take him to Arthur, and they call paramedics. While Arthur is in surgery, Paul tells Kat to leave Arthur alone. They are relieved when they find out that Arthur was shot with training bullets. Kat visits an unconscious Arthur and reveals that she ran away from home because her father was physically abusing her. After she leaves, Arthur opens his eyes, having heard everything. Angered at how Kat was treated, Arthur walks down to the mall and beats up Mr. Debrofkowitz. After Park absorbs all this, she admits his honesty is admirable. At the hearing, Paul rises in the gallery to address the court, and explains that Arthur is mentally underdeveloped (revealed to be fetal alcohol syndrome) and tries to persuade the judge that it is best not to be too harsh. The judge agrees on the condition Arthur doesn't become Defendor again. A reporter approaches Paul and convinces him to let her run a story about Arthur as Defendor, and he agrees. People are inspired by Defendor's attempts to save lives and fight crime. Depressed about having to leave Arthur, Kat becomes desperate for a fix and tries reuniting with Dooney. However, knowing of her friendship with Defendor, Dooney takes her hostage and threatens Arthur to stay quiet; however, he doesn't know Arthur believed that Dooney meant never speaking again. Arthur decides to save Kat and once again becomes Defendor. Kat manages to escape from Dooney and the pair reunites. Kat is devastated when Arthur reveals he still plans to go after Kristic, and she tells him Captain Industry isn't real; she only wanted revenge on Kristic. In a flashback it is revealed that Arthur's grandfather, in order to spare him pain as a child, metaphorically blamed his mother's death on the \\"captains of industry\\"; due to his disability, Arthur has been chasing a delusion his entire life. Defendor manages to subdue the henchmen, but is shot repeatedly by Kristic. Arthur accuses him of killing his mother, and Kristic recognizes her name, implying he truly was responsible for her death. As Arthur lies dying, Kat runs to help him. She promises to stop smoking crack and get a job. In an earlier conversation, Kat had revealed she had always had a talent in writing, which Arthur had described as being \\"like Lois Lane\\". She promises to be like her as Arthur dies in her arms. Dooney and Kristic are arrested. Dooney is sentenced to 26 years in prison and Kristic is extradited to his home country of Serbia. A memorial service is held for Defendor under a spray paint mural that was drawn in his honor, which is attended by Park and her daughter. The film ends with Kat sitting at her typewriter, writing stories about Arthur for a newspaper. Cast Production Defendor is actor Peter Stebbings' first produced screenplay and his debut as a director. He wrote the first draft of his Defendor script in 2005 when the idea came to him \\"in one whole piece\\". He failed to sell the script to numerous major Hollywood studios because it did not fit into a particular genre; he said that \\"[The studios] didn't want to touch it, but all the actors and their agents wanted to.\\" Nicholas Tabarrok of independent production company Darius Films agreed to back the project after he \\"was hooked from the very first read\\", and agreed to fly Stebbings from Toronto to Los Angeles so that he could meet the actors. Ellen Page was originally set to star in the production, which was slated to begin in 2007, but she pulled out. He collected financing from Canadian film fund Telefilm Canada‚Äîabout one quarter of the film's C$4 million budget‚Äîand \\"turn[ed] over stones to find the rest\\". After he added all of his personal savings, the film was still $100,000 under its financial requirements. Though principal photography was scheduled to take place from November 21 through December 17, 2008, it was delayed until mid-January 2009 and continued through the end of January. Filming took place in and around Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario. Specific filming locations included the Hamilton City Centre, Humber River Regional Hospital and a Toronto warehouse. The producers consulted with workers from Toronto's social services and prostitute and decriminalization of sex workers activist Wendy Babcock, to help Kat Dennings develop her character; they wanted people with experience using crack cocaine and doing sex work so she could create a more realistic character.  Release  Defendor had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival in September. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group acquired the distribution rights to the film in the United States and most of Asia, Europe and South America. The Canadian rights were pre-sold to Alliance Films as part of the film's financing deals. However, Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group decided to not release the film in the United States theatrically, so Darius Films (which produced the film) self-released the film in the United States theatrically on February 26, 2010. Home media The film was released on DVD on April 13, 2010.  Reception  Defendor received mixed reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 74% rating based on 23 reviews, with an average score of 6.33/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Defendors reach occasionally exceeds its grasp, but this unique take on the superhero genre is held together by Woody Harrelson's solid performance.\\" Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star wrote writer/director Stebbings \\"fills Defendor with humorous bits, comic treats dropped in quickly and without fanfare\\", while David Germain of the Associated Press faults the film for its \\"inconsistent tone\\".

Fume hoods, also known as laboratory chemical hoods, are one of the most important and widely used engineering controls to protect workers in laboratories. Fume hoods were introduced about 100 years ago to safeguard personnel working with hazardous materials. While many changes and improvements have been made, the basic concept and design of fume hoods remains the same. Air is drawn from the workplace, around the worker and into the front of the hood, and is then exhausted out of the laboratory. Most laboratory hoods are described as constant air volume (CAV) hoods because they draw a constant amount of air at all times. Rising energy costs have made these hoods exceptionally expensive to operate. For example, a single six-foot hood operating 24/7/365 costs over $5,000/year to operate.T. Smith, S.

Calm Uncertainties. Dodd was a key member of New York‚Äôs postwar art scene. She played a large part and was involved in the wave of modern artists including Alex Katz and Yvonne Jacquette who explored the coast of Maine in the latter half of the 20th century. Biography Lois Dodd received education at the Cooper Union in New York City from 1945 to 1948. She was the only woman founder of the Tanager Gallery, which was integral to the Tenth Street-avant-garde scene of the 1950s where artists began running their own coop galleries.Kramer, Hilton. \\"Painter Lois Dodd, Overlooked by Era, Finally is Feted\\". The New York Observer, March 2, 2003. She exhibited at Tanager Gallery from 1952 to 1962. From 1969 to 1976, she exhibited at the Green Mountain Gallery. From 1971 to 1992, Dodd taught at Brooklyn College and at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where she served on the Board beginning in 1980 and is now Governor Emerita. In 1992, she retired from teaching at Brooklyn College. Since 1954, her work has been the subject of over fifty one-person exhibitions. Dodd is an elected member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and of the National Academy of Design.New York Studio School Lois Dodd She currently lives in New York and works in Maine. Scabiosa Stellata (2019) In a 2011 interview, Dodd said of the original Tanager gallery: \\"In 1952...I was married to Bill King and we had an apartment on 29th Street. Ely was born in ‚Äô52 at just about the same time we opened the gallery. Angelo Ippolito, Charles Cajori, Fred Mitchell, King, and myself were the original group. Bill King and I were in Italy on his Fulbright where we met Angelo and Fred there on the G.I. Bill. Cajori had been at Skowhegan with Bill. We had reunited in New York after our return from Italy...It was on 4th Street in this tiny space that had been a barbershop. The elevated subway was still running up and down the Bowery. There was a bar across the street and a lot of Bowery guys were around the corner, completely different than it is now.\\"Brooklyn Rail Interview As part of the wave of New York modernists to explore the coast of Maine just after the end of the Second World War, Dodd helped to change the face of painting in the state. Along with Fairfield Porter, Rackstraw Downes, Alex Katz, Charles DuBack, and Neil Welliver, Dodd began spending her summers in the Mid-Coast region surrounding Penobscot Bay. Attracted by inexpensive old farmhouses, verdant fields, and the bright sunshine, they sought both companionship and an escape from the demands of city life. The break from the city and its urbane art circles allowed them the freedom to explore new modes of painting, both landscapes and figures, that were anathema in the era of Abstract Expressionism.Cozad, Rachael Blackburn \\"Lois Dodd: Catching the Light, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art\\"  Work  2nd Street View, November (2016) Dodd is known primarily for her observational paintings of landscapes, nudes and still lives.

By painting her immediate circumstances, Dodd rejected the sources that others of her generation took as a given: mass media, popular culture, and the bright surfaces of a comfortable life. There is nothing glitzy about the work, neither in its subject matter nor in her use of materials. She does not celebrate excess, ownership, or leisure, nor does she condemn it. Whether or not she intends her refusals to be a comment on the work of those around her, her paintings embody an implicit critique of those who believe acquisitiveness, possession, and leisure are integral to the pursuit of happiness.Yau, John \\" Every Day is a Good Day, Lois Dodd: Catching the Light, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art\\" She is currently represented by Alexandre Gallery in New York.

Sampson's biography said that Gregory was pretending to be Mandela's friend in prison, so that he could make money. According to Sampson, the close relationship depicted in Gregory's book, Goodbye Bafana, was a fabrication, and in reality Gregory rarely spoke to Mandela. Gregory censored the letters sent to the future president and thus discovered the details of Mandela's personal life, which he sold in Goodbye Bafana. Sampson said that Mandela considered suing Gregory, but refrained from doing so when the Prison Department distanced itself from Gregory's book. Sampson also said that other warders had told him in interviews that they suspected Gregory of spying for the government. Mandela: The Authorised Biography, p.217.

It is Volume 10 in the original Tom Swift novel series published by Grosset & Dunlap. The novel is notable for inspiring the name of the Taser.  Plot  While Tom Swift is working on his latest new invention, the electric rifle, he meets an African safari master whose stories of elephant hunting sends the group off to deepest, darkest Africa. Hunting for ivory is the least of their worries, as they find out some old friends are being held hostage by the fearsome tribes of the red pygmies. Swift builds two major inventions in this volume. The first is a replacement airship, known as The Black Hawk. This new airship is to replace The Red Cloud, which was destroyed during his adventures in Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice. This airship is of the same general construction as The Red Cloud, but is smaller and more maneuverable. Of foremost notice is Swift's invention of the electric rifle, a gun which fires bolts of electricity. The electric rifle can be calibrated to different levels of range, intensity and lethality; it can shoot through solid walls without leaving a hole, and is powerful enough to kill a rampaging whale, as in their steamer trek to Africa. With the electric rifle, Tom and friends bring down elephants, rhinoceroses, and buffalo, and save their lives several times in pitched battle with the red pygmies. It also can discharge a globe of light that was described as being able to maintain itself, like ball lightning, making hunting at night much safer in the dark of Africa. In appearance, the rifle looked very much like contemporary conventional rifles.  Homages  Sixty years later a non-lethal weapon delivering an electric shock was developed by Jack Cover and marketed by Taser International under the name \\"Taser\\", an acronym for Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle. The middle initial 'A' is used to produce a word more pronounceable than \\"TSER\\", as no other name than \\"Tom Swift\\" is used for the book's hero.  2015 film  The cinematographic adaptation rights were acquired in 2007. Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle is a documentary film (later retitled \\"Killing Them Safely\\") about TASER International, the primary manufacturer of TASER weapons for law enforcement.

The 2008 Gippsland by-election was held for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Gippsland on 28 June 2008. It was triggered by the resignation of National Party MP Peter McGauran. The writ for the by-election was issued on 19 May 2008. Nominations closed at 12 noon on 5 June 2008. The declaration of nominations, including the ballot order, was revealed the following day, 6 June 2008. The electorate was contested on the same boundaries drawn for Gippsland at the 2007 federal election. The by-election saw the National Party retain the seat with an increased margin, electing candidate Darren Chester. Background At the 2007 federal election, the opposition Labor Party defeated the incumbent Liberal-National coalition government. This marked the first change of government in over 11 years. This meant a transition from the government frontbench to the opposition backbench for several Liberal Party and National Party politicians. It was speculated that a number of former ministers would not serve out their terms but resign their seats early. This speculation later became reality as Peter McGauran, Alexander Downer, Mark Vaile, and Peter Costello all resigned prior to the next federal election. On 4 April 2008, McGauran became the first former Howard government minister returned at the 2007 election to announce his resignation. McGauran first won the seat of Gippsland at the 1983 federal election. He retained the seat at every subsequent election. At the 2007 election, McGauran won the seat for the National Party by a two-party preferred margin of 55.91% to Labor's 44.09%. McGauran had reportedly lined up a job in the racing industry with Thoroughbred Breeders Australia. Candidates National Party candidate and eventual winner, Darren Chester Five candidates contested the by-election. They are listed below in ballot order. *Australian Greens ‚Äì Malcolm McKelvie, doctor from Yarragon. *Liberal Party of Australia ‚Äì Rohan Fitzgerald, senior manager with the Central Gippsland Health Service. He is based in Traralgon. *Liberty and Democracy Party ‚Äì Ben Buckley, pilot and a councillor of East Gippsland Shire Council. Buckley is a perennial candidate who contested Gippsland as an independent in 1984, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2001 and 2007, and as a One Nation candidate in 2004. He is based in Benambra. *Australian Labor Party ‚Äì Darren McCubbin, Mayor of Wellington Shire at the time of nomination but has since resigned in order to focus on the campaign. He won preselection over Latrobe City Deputy Mayor David Wilson. He is based in Sale. *National Party of Australia ‚Äì Darren Chester, chief of staff to Nationals leader in Victoria Peter Ryan. He won preselection over retired army officer Russell Smith. He is based in Lakes Entrance. A joint Coalition candidate? Following McGauran's resignation announcement, Craig Ingram, independent Victorian MLA for the seat of Gippsland East, told reporters that he was considering contesting the by- election as an independent. Subsequently, Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan made an offer to Ingram to run with the joint endorsement of the Liberal and National parties. Heffernan saw this as the first step in a potential merger between the two parties. However, the idea was rejected by both party organisations; and it is doubtful whether Heffernan had the authority to make such an offer. Soon after that, Ingram announced that he would not be running in any capacity. Results Darren Chester retained the seat for the National Party with an increased margin.

Construction Detail Map of Fort D, Cape Girardeau, Missouri Work on Fort D began on August 6, 1861 under the direction of Lieutenant John W. Powell of Illinois. Later, Powell recruited a company of men from Cape Girardeau to serve in the Union army. Since Powell was from Illinois, these men were designated as Battery F, 2nd Illinois Light Artillery. After training for several months, the battery was sent up the Tennessee River to Pittsburgh Landing, near a small chapel known as Shiloh. During the Battle of Shiloh, on April 6, 1862, Powell gave a command to fire by raising his hand. A bullet shattered his wrist, and the arm was later amputated to stop infection. In 1869, one-armed John Wesley Powell led the first successful navigation of the Colorado River through what Powell named \\"the Grand Canyon\\". The earthwork walls are the original Fort D, as constructed in 1861 and restored in 1936. A palisade wall, probably made of upright logs, constituted the rear wall and was pierced by a gate. The gap in the south wall may have been a \\"sally\\" port, allowing soldiers access to the rifle pits below the parapet. The fort was armed with three 32-pounder cannons and two 24-pounder cannons; all mounted on movable siege carriages. A 32-pounder cannon was a smoothbore cannon that could fire a 32-pound solid round shot over one mile. The cannon plus carriage probably weighed more than four tons. Fort D was garrisoned by Union troops from Illinois, Missouri, and other Midwestern states throughout the Civil War. The fort was never engaged in real combat; The Battle of Cape Girardeau, April 26, 1863, was fought west of the city. Other forts Gunpowder house, Fort D, Cape Girardeau, Missouri Fort D is the only surviving fortification built by Union troops in the area during the Civil War. Fort A was located slightly north of downtown Cape Girardeau on a high hill. A grist-grinding windmill was included in the fort. Fort B was located where Academic Hall now stands at Southeast Missouri State University. Fort C was built at the end of Bloomfield Road east of Pacific St. Smaller earthworks included Battery A at the corner of Henderson and New Madrid Streets, Battery B on Whitener Street just east of Sunset Avenue and rifle pits along Perry Avenue and on the hill where Southeast Missouri Hospital now stands. Modern preservation The fort was saved from development in the early 20th century. The earthworks were repaired by the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s. The stone blockhouse was also built by the WPA in 1936 and has been used for various purposes since. The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.

Kjell Aronsen, known as \\"Oslolosen\\", is a fictional character on the Norwegian sketch comedy television show Uti v√•r hage 2, a show that ran on the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) in the spring of 2008. The character, portrayed by Harald Eia, premiered in episode two of the show, and has also appeared in several shorter segments released directly onto the NRK website and on YouTube. As of 1 September 2011, some of the YouTube episodes have received as many as 800,000 views. Character biography The character is a certified guide for the city of Oslo, though his title - \\"oslolosen\\" - uses a Norwegian word corresponding to the English \\"maritime pilot\\". The meaning of this becomes clear from his first appearance, where his job is to lead a group of men from Northern Norway - who have managed to get stuck in a roundabout - onto the right exit. He is consequently obliged by law to give the three men a guided tour of the capital. It later becomes clear that he also has a secondary task: to shoot with tranquilizer darts artists and performers who have arrived in Oslo from the countryside to realise their creative potential, so that they can be released back into their natural habitat. Little is known about Aronsen's own background, but according to himself a certified oslolos must be \\"conceived, born, brought up and molested\\" in Oslo. However, his use of the traditional Oslo dialect as well as his fondness for the East End, would suggest origins in the city's working class districts. He has a deep connection to the Sagene district, where it's often believed he was conceived. Aronsen's version of Oslo's culture and history often diverges dramatically from what is the conventionally accepted truth, and he is also passionate in his insistence that the official version of the city, presented to tourists, is a distortion of reality. Elements that frequently occur in his narratives are Labour history, prostitution and Jewish businesspeople. His comportment can be aggressive, and his language is often obscene and scatological. In real life In March 2008 a competition was held where fans of the show could win an actual guided tour with a real, certified Oslo-guide and the oslolosen-character. On 1 April 2008, 25 winners were led on a tour of the city where Eia would interrupt the official guide with contradictory, largely improvised comments. The popularity of the character was shown by fans coming - by plane - from as far away as Stj√∏rdal. According to online newspaper Nettavisen, a man from T√∏nsberg was in March selling t-shirts with images and catch-phrases clearly taken from \\"oslolosen\\" printed on them. Harald Eia himself had no problems with the venture, and thought NRK had been acting too slowly with their own t-shirt production to capitalise on the popular attention. NRK on the other hand considered the t-shirt an infringement of copyright, and would take steps to stop the unauthorised sales. References External links *The show's home page.

Livingston Incident or Dechmont Woods Encounter is the name given to claims of sighting an extraterrestrial spacecraft on Dechmont Law in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland in 1979 by forester Robert \\"Bob\\" Taylor (1919‚Äì2007). When Taylor returned home from a trip to Dechmont Law dishevelled, his clothes torn and with grazes to his chin and thighs, he claimed he had encountered a \\"flying dome\\" which tried to pull him aboard. Due to his injuries, the police recorded the matter as a common assault and the incident is popularly promoted as the \\"only example of an alien sighting becoming the subject of a criminal investigation\\".Bob Taylor (Obituary), The Telegraph 23 March 2007 (2008-04-06)Obituary: Robert Taylor, a possible victim of alien abduction, died on March 14th, aged 88 The Economist published 29 March 2007 Taylor's story According to Taylor, a forestry worker for the Livingston Development Corporation, on 9 November 1979, he parked his pickup truck at the side of a road near the M8 motorway and walked along a forest path up the side of Dechmont Law with his dog. Taylor reported seeing what he described as a \\"flying dome\\" or a large, circular sphere approximately in diameter, hovering above the forest floor in a clearing about away from his truck. Taylor described the object as \\"a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper\\" featuring an outer rim \\"set with small propellers\\". Taylor claims he experienced a foul odour \\"like burning brakes\\" and that smaller spheres \\"similar to sea mines\\" had seized him and were dragging him in the direction of the larger object when he lost consciousness. According to Taylor, he later awoke and the objects were gone, but he could not start his truck, so he walked back to his home in Livingston.Gareth Edwards; I'm after the aliens that beat up Bob; Edinburgh Evening News dated 9 November 2004. Date recovered 4 April 2008. Police investigation Taylor's wife reported that when he arrived home on foot, he appeared dishevelled and muddy with torn clothing and ripped trousers. His wife called the police and a doctor, who treated him for grazes to his chin and thighs. Police accompanied Taylor to the site where he claimed he received his injuries. They found \\"ladder-shaped marks\\" in the ground where Taylor said he saw the large spherical object and other marks that Taylor said were made by the smaller, mine-like objects. Police recorded the matter as a criminal assault. Ufologists The story drew attention from ufologists, who erected a plaque on the site of the alleged encounter, and Taylor became notable among UFO enthusiasts for being involved in the only UFO sighting that was subject to a criminal investigation. Ufologist and author Malcolm Robinson accepts Taylor's story, saying he believes \\"it could be one of the few genuine cases of a UFO encounter\\".  Sceptical reception  In 1979, the UFO sceptic Steuart Campbell visited the scene of the incident with the police. Campbell was convinced that a simple explanation would be found. On his second visit to the site, he stated that he had observed some PVC pipes in an adjoining field. He discovered that the local water authority had laid a cable duct within 100m of the clearing. He came to the conclusion that stacks of pipes may have been stored in the clearing and were responsible for the ground markings.Campbell, Steuart. (1994). The UFO Mystery Solved. Explicit Books. pp. 150-158. Patricia Hannaford, founder of the Edinburgh University UFO Research Society and a qualified physician, advised Campbell on medical aspects of the case. She suggested that Taylor's collapse was an isolated attack of temporal lobe epilepsy, and the fit explained the objects as hallucinations. Symptoms such as Taylor's previous meningitis, his report of a strong smell which nobody else could detect, his headache, dry throat, paralysis of his legs and period of unconsciousness suggested this cause. Steve Donnelly a physicist and editor for The Skeptic also considered the incident to be explained by an epileptic attack. Campbell suggested Taylor's attack may have been stimulated by a mirage of Venus. Local businessman Phill Fenton published a report in 2013, speculating that Taylor \\"may have suffered a mini-stroke and been exposed to harmful chemicals which left him confused and disoriented\\" and that \\"the UFO he believes he saw could have been a saucer-shaped water tower nearby\\".

The formation of the Kermadec and Tonga Plates started about 4‚Äì5 million years ago. Today, the eastern boundary of the Tonga Plate is one of the fastest subduction zones, with a rate up to 24 cm/yr. The trench formed between the Kermadec-Tonga and Pacific Plates is also home to the second deepest trench in the world, at about 10,800 m, as well as the longest chain of submerged volcanoes. Geological setting The Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone is a convergent plate boundary that stretches from the southwest of the Kermadec Plate (northeast of New Zealand) to the northwest tip of the Tonga Plate, with the Pacific Plate being subducted under both the Kermadec and Tonga Plates. The Kermadec and Tonga Plates are micro oceanic plates in the Pacific Ocean, bounded by the Australian and Pacific Plates to the west and east respectively. The Kermadec Plate begins at the northeastern part of New Zealand and stretches northward to its contact with the Tonga Plate. The Tonga Plate begins 2500 km NNE of New Zealand and stretches northward, until the plate ends bounded by the Niuafo‚Äôou Plate to the northwest and the Pacific Plate to the northeast. The Hikurangi Margin is an extension of the Kermadec- Tonga subduction zone further south down the east coast of the North Island. Subduction The southern end of the subduction zone transitions to a right lateral-moving transform fault south of the North Island called the Alpine Fault. The subduction seems to be driven primarily by the excess weight of the cold/old oceanic plate entering the hot mantle of the Earth. Trench The eastern boundaries of the Tonga and Kermadec Plates constitute the subduction zone of the Pacific Plate, characterized by a trench about 2,000 km in length. The trench is continuous, but has different names for different sections: Hikurangi Trench, the Kermadec Trench and the Tonga Trench. The Tonga Trench is the second deepest trench in the world at about 10,800 m, with the deepest point, Horizon Deep, being the deepest point in the Southern Hemisphere and the second deepest point in the world, after the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. The eastern boundary of the Kermadec Plate is also the site of the Kermadec Trench, which is the fifth deepest trench in the world at about 10,000 m. The eastern boundary of the Tonga Plate is one of the fastest subduction zones with a rate of up to 24 cm/yr. Creation The Tonga and Kermadec Plates originated about 4-5 million years ago. Before their creation, the Pacific Plate was subducting under the Australian Plate, producing the Lau-Colville Ridge (now extinct). About 6 million years ago, this region underwent crustal extension and through a complicated series of spreading centers, ultimately leading to the separation of the Pacific and Australian Plate and the creation of what are now Tonga and Kermadec Plates. The Tonga and Kermadec Plates separated because the northern portion of the original plate was growing much more quickly (96 mm/year) than the southern portion (39 mm/year), eventually generating a transform fault between them, creating the Tonga and Kermadec Plates. Just as this phenomenon created the Tonga and Kermadec Plates, it was also the cause of the creation of the Niuafo‚Äôou microplate to the northwest of the Tonga Plate because the Tonga's northern portion is still growing much faster than the southern counterpart. \\"Kermadec Sanctuary\\" With the largest underwater volcano chain, the region surrounding the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone is one of the most geologically diverse areas in the world. The Kermadec Sanctuary was proposed in 2015 by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, at the United Nations in New York, which would create an area off limits to aquaculture, fishing, and mining. The sanctuary would be 620,000 square kilometers, making it the world's largest and most significant fully protected areas. The intention was to have the sanctuary in place, enacted by Parliament in November 2016. In September 2016, the enactment of the Kermadec Sanctuary was delayed due to failed negotiations over the MƒÅori people's rights. As of June 2017, these issues have still not been resolved.

Glazing and firing methods From the earliest known product, stoneware made in the Catawba Valley was alkaline glazed. Alkaline glazes are made by combining hardwood ash or crushed glass with clay and water. Alkaline glazed stoneware takes on a brown or green color once fired in the kiln. Catawba Valley potters chose alkaline glazes over salt glaze, the predominant stoneware glaze used in America at the time. Potters enjoyed an abundance of wood ash from burning their kilns while salt deposits were not very plentiful in the Carolinas. Furthermore, salt was especially expensive during and after the Civil War. The alkaline glazed ware was initially fired in what is known as \\"groundhog kilns\\". These kilns were a unique southern U.S. variation of climbing kilns built into hillsides, such as the Asian anagama. Semi-subterranean in construction, the groundhog kiln featured a door leading into a long, low passage of brick or rock construction, with a stack or chimney poking out of the ground up hill. Ware was loaded in the low passageway or \\"ware-bed\\" and the fire was built in a sunken firebox, located just inside the door. The design allowed the stack to draw heated air, flames and ash through the pottery grouped inside and created the draft needed to generate the intense heat required to create stoneware. This type of firing or \\" burning \\" worked particularly well with large pieces of pottery. Variations of these kilns, usually referred to as \\"tunnel kilns\\", are used by modern potters in Catawba Valley and other pottery regions in the American southeast. Modern Potters from the Region Burlon Craig Swirl Ware. Catawba Valley. C.2000 Charles Lisk Face Jug. Catawba Valley. 2004 An early recorded pottery in the Catawba Valley was operated by Daniel Seagle (ca.1805-1867) of Lincoln County. After Seagle's death the pottery was operated by his son and various apprentices into the 1890s. Other notable potteries of the 19th and early 20th centuries included those operated by the Hartzogs, the Hilton family and brothers Harvey Ford Reinhardt and Enoch William Alexander Reinhardt. Burlon B. Craig (ca. 1914-2002) was born in Lincoln County, North Carolina and learned to make pottery as a teenager. When Craig returned from service in the Navy following World War II he purchased the Reinhardt farm and pottery complex in Vale, North Carolina. The pottery operation included a groundhog kiln and fully equipped shop. His pottery was featured in several publications and in 1981 examples of his work were added to the Smithsonian Institution collection. In 1984 he received the National Endowment for the Arts' National Heritage Fellowship. Craig continued to live and work in Vale until his death in 2002. In 1981 Charles Lisk and his family moved to Vale and developed a friendship with his neighbor Burlon Craig who shared with him the techniques of the Catawba Valley pottery tradition. Lisk built his own groundhog kiln and began making alkaline glazed stoneware. He makes a variety of wares including the traditional swirl pottery and face jugs. The Reinhardt-Craig House, Kiln and Pottery Shop was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. See also * Anagama kiln * Bartmann jug * Pottery References * Zug, Charles G. III.

The current editor is Gunnar Stavrum. As of 2015 it was one of Norway's most popular news websites. History The online newspaper (its literal name in Norwegian) was launched on 1 November 1996, and was founded by Odd Harald Hauge, Stig Eide Sivertsen and Knut Ivar Skeid. In 1999 the newspaper was bought by Spray Sweden, which became part of Lycos Europe in 2000. In 2000 the founders of Nettavisen helped launch the (now- defunct) German sister site Netzeitung. In 2002 Nettavisen was bought by Norway's largest commercial television channel TV 2. Due to millions of NOK in deficits and resulting major staff cuts, on 23 October 2008 the board of TV 2 decided to initiate negotiations with its owners, Egmont and Amedia, to sell the newspaper. From 2009 Nettavisen has been owned directly by Egmont and Amedia. The newspaper has been part of the media company Mediehuset Nettavisen since 2008. In 2014 the media company posted record earnings with 39,7 per cent in annual income growth. By the 2010s Nettavisen turned deficits into major surpluses, making it in the unusual position in 2015 of being able to hire new staff with its new offices in traditional newspaper street Akersgata, when other newspapers continue to be under strong pressure despite millions in press support (of which Nettavisen receives none). Nettavisen was as of 2015 the second most visited news website in Norway on mobile platforms, and one of the largest overall on digital platforms. It has a weekly readership of 2,6 million in the Norwegian market. According to Stavrum, Nettavisen is currently the only large national newspaper in Norway considered somewhat right-of- centre. Stavrum himself supports the Liberal Party. In 2017 the newspaper launched editions in Polish, Arabic, Russian and Somali. The same year, Amedia purchased full ownership of Nettavisen.

It was established by an act of the Polish parliament dated 7 September 2007 called the Act on the Pole's Card (Ustawa o Karcie Polaka, Dz.U. 2007 no. 180/1280), which specifies the rights of the holder of the Card, the rules for granting, loss of validity and rescission of the Card, and the competencies of the public administration's bodies and procedures in these cases. The law came into force on 29 March 2008.  Conditions for granting  Initially, the Card could be granted to people who do not have Polish citizenship or permission to reside in Poland and who are citizens of the former Soviet Union states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Since 2019, the Card can be granted to citizens of all states (excluding Poland). States whose citizens of Polish origin may apply for the Karta Polaka (red), as of 29 March 2008 The Card can be granted to a person who declares belonging to \\"the Polish Nation\\" and meets the following conditions: * proves his/her relationship with Polishness by at least a basic knowledge of the Polish language, which is considered their native language, along with knowledge and cultivating Polish traditions and habits; * in the presence of the consul of the Republic of Poland or an authorized employee of a Polish organisation submits a written declaration of belonging to \\"the Polish Nation\\"; * proves that at least one of his/her parents or grandparents or two great grandparents were of Polish nationality or had Polish citizenship, or present an attestation from a Polish or Polish diaspora organization acting on the territory of one of the above mentioned states, confirming that he or she has been actively involved in Polish linguistic and cultural activities within Polish community of their region for a period of at least the past three years. Those who have confirmed Polish origin by the procedure established in the Act on repatriation of 9 November 2000 (Dz.U. 2000 no. 106/1118) can also apply for the card, on the condition they fulfill the conditions stated above. The Card can also be granted to children of holders of the Card. If only one parent holds the Card, the consent of the other expressed in a statement before a consul is necessary (on condition he or she has parental responsibility). Granting of the Charter to a minor who is over 16 years old may occur only with his or her consent.  Rights of the holder  Granting of the Card does not mean acquiring Polish citizenship or confirmation of Polish origin within the meaning of other acts. The Charter does not entitle to cross the border or settle in the territory of the Republic of Poland. A person of Polish origin wishing to settle in Poland needs a permanent residence card (however, after it is granted the person loses the right to apply for the Card and the document already granted is rescinded). A holder of the Card has a number of rights though. The holder may apply for exemption from fees for consideration of an application for a country Schengen-visa (however, entitling to enter Poland only) and granting it or refund of fees. The refund is financed from the part of state budget controlled by the minister responsible for foreign affairs and is made through the proper consul. A holder of the Karta Polaka has the right to: # exemption from the obligation to have a work permit for foreigners; # set up a company on the same basis as citizens of Poland; # study, do a doctorate and participate in the other forms of education, as well as participate in research and development work. The holder retains the right to apply for scholarships and other forms of aid for foreigners; # preschool, primary and secondary education in Poland; # use of health care services in the states of emergency; # 37% discount on public transport omnibus, flier and express rail travel; # free admission to state museums. Enforcement of the rights listed in 3‚Äì7 (study, education, health care, public transport, museums) requires the presentation of the Card and a valid document confirming the identity of the holder.  Granting procedure  The granting of the card is an administrative decision, followed by prescribed procedure commenced upon written application of the individual or his legal representative. The proper authority for the grant of the card is the consul of consular district of the place of residence. This procedure is free of consular fees. The applicant is required to present documents or other evidences confirming compliance with the conditions for the granting of the Card. Examples of documents and evidence are: * Polish identity documents * vital records or their copies, baptism metric, school certificates or other documents proving relationship with Polishness; * documents attesting military service in the Polish military formations; * documents proving the deportation or imprisonment (e.g. Soviet repressions of 1939-1946) which include information of Polish origin; * documents of rehabilitation of deported person which include information of Polish origin; * foreign identity cards with information about the Polish nationality of the holder; * attestation of entitled Polish or Polonial organization acting on the territory of one of the states mentioned above, confirming that he/she have been actively involved in activities on behalf of Polish language and culture or Polish national minority. * final, legally binding decision on the determination of the Polish origin, as it is prescribed by the procedure established in the Act on repatriation of 9 November 2000 (on the basis of this decision the consul must grant the card). A consul may exempt meritorious Poles from the obligation to fulfil the terms stated above. The consul estimates Polish language proficiency and knowledge of Polish traditions and habits during interview with the applicant. Authorized employee of entitled Polish or Polonial organization can examine language proficiency as well. There are 34 entitled organizations, including Union of Poles in Belarus and Association of Poles in Lithuania. Before issuing the decision to grant the card, the consul may ask Head of the Internal Security Agency or other administrative units whether there are reasons not to grant the charter (reasons of defence, security or protection of public order or acting of the applicant against the fundamental interests of the Republic of Poland). The card is issued by a proper consul or person authorized by him for a ten-year period with a possible further extension of another 10 years. If possible, handing over of the card is carried out in a ceremonial manner. In the case of loss or destruction of the card, the consul issues a duplicate, at the request of the holder. In the case of a negative decision of a consul, the applicant may appeal through the consul to the Council for Poles in the East.  Applicants  According to Grzegorz Opalinski, consul general of Poland in Lvov, the number of Poles interested in receiving the Card may reach 200,000 in Western Ukraine.Radio RMF FM, Pole's Cart desired in Ukraine, February 27, 2009 Polish consular services in Lviv received around 20,000 applications in the month of February 2009 alone. To meet the demand, consulates in both Lviv and Lutsk had to employ additional staff. Also, additional consulates of Poland were opened in January 2009, in Vinnytsia and Ivano-Frankovsk. The process is hampered by the stance of governments of some nations, especially Belarus and Lithuania. In Lithuania, a conservative MP Gintaras Songaila publicly stated that two MPs who represent Polish minority there (Waldemar Tomaszewski and Michal Mackiewicz) should resign, because they accepted the Card. Similar opinion has been presented by Andrius Kubilius.Lithuanian Parliament plays with Pole's Card, Rzeczpospolita daily, February 20, 2009 Also, another problem is poor command of Polish language, which is one of conditions of granting the card. In Ukraine, according to estimates of Polish consul in Kiev, Edward Dobrowolski, only about half applicants received their cards. Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed in late January 2009, that most applicants come from the areas of Hrodna, Brest, Lutsk and Lviv. 85% of all applicants were residents of either Belarus or Ukraine. However, there are applicants from other states as well. On March 9, 2009, the first Card in Azerbaijan was received by Ms. Helena Szejch-Zade,The first Karta Polaka (Card of the Pole) while Polish consulate in Chi≈üinƒÉu, Moldova, has been receiving a number of applications, mostly from the town of BƒÉl≈£i, where lives a 2,000-strong Polish minority.More Cards in Moldova  Ratio legis  The Charter is intended to aid Polish communities abroad, e.g. by maintaining national heritage. Members of Polish minorities in the Post-Soviet states have limited access to Poland since Poland's joining the European Union's Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007, which imposed stricter border controls and necessity of visas on Poland's eastern neighbors.

Etymology Cox Green is from Old English cocc \\"cock\\" (crest of a hill) in the plural form coccs (the plural form represented by modern \\"s\\"). Due to corruption of the name over the years, the name is similar to the modern surname Cox. The name was recorded as Cosse in 1108, and Couuse in 1146 and Cokksgrene in 1248.

History Al-Salam Palace was taken over by coalition forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The palace was significantly damaged during the \\"Shock and Awe\\" campaign, when it sustained several airstrike attacks. It is headquarters for the Joint Area Support Group. It has been known to coalition forces as \\"Camp Prosperity\\" and \\"Forward Operating Base Prosperity.\\" Layout and amenities The palace has 200 rooms with approximately floor space. There are six floors, three of which are usable (others serve as 'false floors'); two large ball rooms. The palace is internally lined with marble floors with hundreds of thousands of hand-cut pieces, granite walls, and ceilings that also have hundreds of thousands of hand-carved and inlaid hand-painted flowers. The palace is also surrounded by a sequence of square tiles bearing the initials of Saddam Hussein (S & H); the letters in Arabic are called \\"Saad\\" & \\"Haa.\\" These tiles are obvious on the top side of the palace building. Iraqis report that the palace dome used to have a life-sized statue of Saddam. The fireplaces, which are placed around the lake in front of the palace, are fresh air vents used to provide fresh air to the bunkers below the lake. These bunkers are now inaccessible, having been flooded and sealed off by the coalition. In the basement of the palace is an entry to one of many concrete tunnels lying beneath the city of Baghdad. These tunnels are also ventilated and provide access to other palaces, governmental facilities and Baghdad International Airport.

Children's rights in Mali are secured by several laws designed to protect children and provide for their welfare, including an ordinance that provides for regional positions as \\"child delegates\\" to safeguard the rights and interests of children.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Mali. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. However, as with most legal issues, this is the official account, based on laws that have only a status on paper. There are no provisions for the execution of the laws, and as any visit to any medium-sized town in Mali will show, there are scores of children in the street who live on the verge of starvation and who are often maltreated. Especially the talibe, young boys 'given' to a 'marabout', are subject to all sorts of negligence if not inhuman treatment by their masters. Such 'marabouts' are also in practice above the law‚Äîin spite of widespread maltreatment of children by them not a single complaint against them has been made. There is a serious problem here, because hardly any research in this area has been carried out. However, a qualitative study by Jelle Hilven, of the Free University of Brussels, revealed acute deviations from official politics in daily life.  Background  For many years education in Mali was tuition free and, in principle, open to all; however, students were required to provide their own uniforms and supplies. Primary school was compulsory up to the age of 12, but only 56.6 percent of children from seven to 12 years old (49.3 percent of girls and 64.1 percent of boys) attended primary school during the 2005‚Äì6 school year. Girls' enrollment in school was lower than boys' at all levels due to poverty, cultural tendencies to emphasize boys' education, and early marriages for girls. Other factors affecting school enrollment included distance to the nearest school, lack of transportation, and shortages of teachers and instructional materials. Members of the black Tamachek, or Bellah, community reported that some Tamachek children were denied educational opportunities because their traditional masters would not allow them to attend school. Approximately 11 percent of students attended private Arabic-language schools, or medersas (from ).\\" Medersas were encouraged to follow the government curriculum, and most taught core subjects including math, science, and foreign languages; however, few medersas fully adhered to the government's curriculum due to a lack of teacher training and instructional materials. An unknown number of primary school-aged children throughout the country attended part- time Koranic schools. Most Koranic school students were under the age of 10. Koranic schools taught only the Koran and were partially funded by students, known as \\"garibouts,\\" who were required by schoolmasters to beg for money on the streets as part of their religious instruction. A 2005 UNICEF study of Koranic schools in Mopti found that children who attended these schools spent the majority of their time begging on the streets or working in fields. The government provided subsidized medical care to children as well as adults, but the care was limited in quality and availability. Boys and girls had equal access to medical care. Statistics on child abuse were unreliable, and reported cases of abuse were rare, according to local human rights organizations. The social services department investigated and intervened in cases of child abuse or neglect. As one of the few pieces of empirical research carried out, Hilven (2011) reports widespread neglect and deep fear to report maltreatment, both by the local population as by non-Malian residents and organisations. A 2004 governmental study, which involved 450 interviews, found that the children most at risk for sexual exploitation were girls between the ages of 12 and 18 who worked as street vendors or domestic servants, or who were homeless children or the victims of child trafficking. Such exploitation was most prevalent in areas in which the population and economy were in flux, such as border zones or towns on transportation routes or in mining areas. The study noted that most cases of sexual exploitation went unreported and recommended that the country strengthen its laws to protect children. Female genital mutilation, or FGM, was common, particularly in rural areas, and was performed on girls between the ages of six months to six years. According to domestic NGOs, approximately 95 percent of adult women had undergone FGM. The practice was widespread in most regions and among most ethnic groups, was not subject to class boundaries, and was not religiously based. There are no laws against FGM, but a government decree prohibits FGM in government-funded health centers. The government continued its two-phase plan to eliminate FGM by 2008. According to the local human rights organizations fighting FGM, the educational phase (workshops, videos, and theater) continued in cities, and FGM reportedly decreased substantially among children of educated parents. In many instances, FGM practitioners agreed to stop the practice in exchange for other income-generating activity. The National Committee Against Violence Towards Women linked all the NGOs combating FGM. Women may legally marry at age 18 and men at age 21. The marriage code allows girls under age 15 to marry with parental consent or special permission from a judge. Women's rights organizations opposed this provision as contradicting international conventions that protect children through the age of 18. Underage marriage was a problem throughout the country with parents in some cases arranging marriages for girls as young as nine. A local NGO reported that at least 10 girls-‚Äîsome below the age of 13‚Äî-lost their lives between 2005 and May 2007 because of medical complications resulting from early marriage. Medical specialists noted that child brides were often the victims of FGM, which exacerbates the possibility of complications from infection and childbirth.  Movement  Local women's rights NGOs, such as Action for the Promotion and Development of Women, the Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights, and the Women's and Children's Rights Watch, educated local populations about the negative consequences of underage marriage. The government also helped to enable girls married at an early age to continue in school.

It consists of the 1500 and 1600 blocks of the road Shelby Place. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places due to its historic architectural designs. Immediately to the east Vincennes Street separates the district from New Albany High School. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The primary architectural style of the district is Bungalow, although there are examples of Queen Anne, Dutch Colonial Revival, American Foursquare, and one Prairie-type. In total, 38 buildings and one site contributed to the historic nature of the district; fourteen buildings and one structure within the district do not contribute. The contributing buildings were built between 1907 and 1925, with the majority built within a five-year period of 1911‚Äì1916, 75% of which built in 1912 and 1913. Shelby Place started in 1906 as New Albany recovered from an economic depression, thanks to woodworking industries. To this day the district retains historic architectural integrity. Unlike nearby areas, Shelby Place has a wider street with central median. Shelby Place Brick Marker The sole non-building contributing feature of the district is the eastern entrance to Shelby Place, which consists of two five-feet tall square brick columns on concrete bases which are original to the district. Both have concrete caps which say \\"Shelby Place\\" on them. Two similar columns once occupied the western entrance of the district, but nothing remains of the northwestern column, and the southwestern has only remnants. On March 23, 1917, a tornado that severely damaged New Albany barely missed the district, causing minimal damage and no loss of buildings. The Ohio River flood of 1937 caused some flooding in Shelby Place, but the south side was on higher ground, and thus did not suffer as badly as other parts of New Albany. In 1994 an architectural study determined that Shelby Place could eventually achieve National Register status. In 2006 the Indiana Department of Natural Resources gave a grant of $6,150 to the city of New Albany to prepare Shelby Place, Cedar Bough Place Historic District, and the DePauw Avenue Historic District for registration on the National Register of Historic Places. (Depauw has a similar architecture style as Shelby Place's, but are mostly larger domiciles than Shelby Place's, and has more architectural diversity.) All three neighborhoods were placed on the National Register on March 19, 2008.http://www.allbusiness.com/government/3665564-1.html DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AWARDS 21 HISTORIC PRESERVATION GRANTS, May 10, 2006, Accessed April 3, 2008 References Category:Historic districts in New Albany, Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Floyd County, Indiana Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Bungalow architecture in Indiana Category:Queen Anne architecture in Indiana Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Indiana Category:Dutch Colonial Revival architecture in the United States Category:American Foursquare architecture ","title":"Shelby Place Historic District"},{"id":"16749255","title":"Here We Stand (The Fratellis album)"},{"id":"16749258","text":"200px The following is a list of people who served in the United States Coast Guard and have gained fame through previous or subsequent endeavors, infamy, or successes: Note: When adding a name to this list, please place the same in alphabetical order and provide a reliable verifiable source.

It was released in Japan by Atlantic Records in 1971 and in the US and Canada by GRT Records. Production Yuya Uchida formed the Flower Travellin' Band as a way to create a group with international appeal. At Expo '70, Canadian rock band Lighthouse saw Flower Travellin' Band perform, liked what they saw and suggested they go to Canada. Sensing the chance for international popularity, the group quickly recorded Satori to have something to bring with them. Tired of covering Western blues bands, the Flower Travellin' Band wanted to create their own material. The members would get together and Hideki Ishima would come up with guitar riffs while everyone tried new ideas on each other. Because Ishima was interested in Indian music, the Oriental aspect became a part of the band's sound. Joe Yamanaka revealed that there are relatively few lyrics on the album because of the band's love for improvisation. He stated that because you can not suddenly change direction with lyrics as you can with instrumentation, he consciously stepped back and trusted the other musicians. The album was recorded in just two days; one day recording and one mixing. Release The North American release differed from the Japanese original, as it contained songs from their then upcoming album Made in Japan and the bonus track \\"Lullaby\\". The original Japanese version was reissued on CD by Warner Music in 1988. A re-release in 1991 contained the bonus track \\"Map\\", which was written by Kuni Kawachi and originally on his album Kirikyogen, which featured Joe Yamanaka and Hideki Ishima, under the name \\"Works Composed Mainly By Humans\\". This version of the song was previously released as a single by Flower Travellin' Band. The album was digitally remastered in 1998. In 2009 it was remastered on the new SHM-CD format. Reception In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated Satori #71 on their list of the \\"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time\\". David Fricke of Rolling Stone declared Satori his \\"favorite Japanese rock album of all time.\\" Hernan M. Campbell of Sputnikmusic said that Satori, with its traces of early heavy metal, progressive rock and psychedelia, captures \\"the eclecticism of the '70s rock scene, and all of the different philosophies that were steadily evolving into fully recognized genres.\\" Giving the album a 4.8 rating out of 5, he also wrote that like Ishima and Yamanaka's previous work on Kuni Kawachi's album Kirikyogen, Satori has \\"the formidable and ominous sound that would become the essence of doom metal.\\" Allmusic's Thom Jurek gave the album 4¬Ω stars out of 5 and made it their pick as the band's top album calling it \\"a real classic\\"; \\"From power chords to Eastern-tinged, North African, six-string freakouts, to crashing tom toms, to basses blasting into the red zone, Satori is a journey to the center of someplace that seems familiar but has never before been visited.\\" The Guardians Rob Fitzpatrick stated that the album \\"blends edge-of-your-seat psychedelic shamanism with hair-shaking proto-metal rifferama\\". Legacy \\"Satori Part III\\" was later re-imagined into Flower Travellin' Band's staple song \\"Hiroshima\\", on their next album Made in Japan. The entirety of Satori was used as the music score for Takashi Miike's 2002 film Deadly Outlaw: Rekka, which features Yuya Uchida and Joe Yamanaka as actors. \\"Satori Part I\\" was covered by The Claypool Lennon Delirium, which consists of Les Claypool and Sean Lennon, for their 2017 EP Lime and Limpid Green. Lennon, whose mother Yoko Ono introduced him to the band's work and who knew the Flower Travellin' Band members, chose the song as a nod to his fellow Japanese, who he said had been suffering since the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.

He was the second son of Matthias D'Oyly, Archdeacon of Hastings and his wife Mary. He was educated at Westminster School and graduated from Cambridge University in 1796. He went out to Ceylon in 1801, initially as a writer in the civil service and then as President of various provincial courts. He mastered the Sinhalese language during a tenure at Matara under the tutelage of the scholarly Buddhist Monk; Karathota Dhammarama Nayake Thera, and for this proficiency, he was appointed as the Government's chief translator in 1805. He became an Agent of Revenue for the District of Colombo the following year. Further promotions saw him elevated through the ranks of civil and military and he was ultimately appointed to the post of Civil Auditor-General. D'Oyly had a key role in arranging for the British takeover of the Kandyan kingdom in 1815. Being fluent in Sinhala, he was the intermediary between the British Governor and the disaffected Kandyan chiefs who were intriguing to \\"sell out\\" the king, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. D'Oyly is credited with drafting the Kandyan Convention of March 2, 1815 which set out the terms of the accession. He was created a baronet in 1821 and chose to stay in Kandy, eventually dying there in 1824. A Briton who visited Kandy before 1815 had described him as living like a \\"Cingalese hermit\\". His earlier association with a woman poet, Gajaman Nona, in Matara led to some speculation. He died in 1824 and was buried in Garrison Cemetery, Kandy. His Obituary, from the Ceylon Gazette of May 29th 1824, read; Even though some describe D'Oyly as someone who has done an immense work to develop Sri Lanka (Ceylon at that time), modern day academicians challenge that view after considering some historical data. He is considered as instrumental in subjugating the people of then Ceylon to the colonial regime of the British. His work led to the dismantling of the entire social order of the country and resulted in great chaos.

Plot The film portrays a tragic love story set in late 1930s Ireland, focusing on the relationship between Fiona Flynn (Moya Farrelly), a beautiful, feisty seventeen-year-old from a middle-class family, and Kieran O'Dea (Aidan Quinn), a shy labourer in his early thirties, and the search decades later by their son, Kieran Johnson, (James Caan) to find his roots in late 1990s Ireland. The film is told as an interweaving of the nineties setting, where Kieran is hearing the story of his parents, and the events of the 1930s. Kieran Johnson grew into adulthood unaware of his parents' story or of the tragic events that caused his mother to leave Ireland on her own while pregnant. The story highlights the issues of prejudice, classism, alcoholism and social and religious conservatism in rural 1930s Ireland.

Its origin dates back to the Ottomans who ruled Iraq from 1534 to 1918. During that time, the only known public street in Baghdad was Al Naher Street (Shari al-Naher). Al Naher means river - the street stretches a few kilometers along the east banks of the river Tigris, so this may be the reasoning behind its name. The British were defeated by the Ottomans on April 29, 1916 in Kut (south of Baghdad), where tens of thousands of Anglo-Indian troops died or were wounded, and thousands more were taken prisoner, including their commander Sir Charles Townshend. The military governor of Baghdad, Khalil Pasha (1864‚Äì1923), decided to honor this victory by giving orders to build the first ever \\"real\\" street in Baghdad. Work began in May 1916, after the head of Baghdad's municipality, Ra'ouf Al Chadirchy, met with local landlords to pay them compensations for the demolition of their property. The street was first opened for the public on July 23, 1916. The first name given to the street was by Khalil Pasha who named the street \\"Jadde Si\\". The name of the street was then inscribed on a ceramic plate and placed on the main wall of Sultan Ali Mosque. The sign lasted until the mid-1950s. In 1917, Al Rasheed Street was the first street to be electrically illuminated in Baghdad city.

Boothapandi is the headquarters of Thovalai taluk in Kanyakumari District, India. It is north east of Nagercoil. The village sits on the western bank of the river Pazhaiyar, at the foot of the hill known as Thadakaimalai which is considered to be the abode of Thadakai in the Ramayana. It forms a place of legendary importance. The Travancore Manual says that Bhoothapandi is an ancient place founded by one of the pandya sovereigns and vague traditions are preserved in the Keralopatti and Kerala Mahamiyam wherein the Pandiya invasion of Keral if referred to in a mythical form. The Mahatmiyam says that the Pandyas invaded Kerala with an army of Bhuthatans (spirits) and they were defeated by Parasurama, the warrior sage. The boundary of Kerala and Pandya kingdoms was fixed at Bhoothapandy as a compromise. A later interpretation brought to bear upon the Parasurama legend is that it is an allegoric representation of the advent of the Aryans into Kerala. The temple was constructed by the King Pasum Pon Pandyan who is the son of Boothapandiyan. The Suampu lingam lord of sanctuary's other name is Salian Kanda Thirumani. In the 17th century Saliar caste peoples lived in the town. A member of the community was worried that his cow was being milked by some unknown person. One day he followed the cow and discovered it discharging milk on a bush. Enraged at this he destroyed the bush where he found a stone idol. He slashed the idol and found it bleeding. So they decided to construct a temple for the stone idol[Lord Siva] so this lord of sanctuary is called Salian Kanda Thirumani. File:Theppakulam view.jpg Structure of the temple The temple faces east and there is a tank with a small Mandapa on the northern side. The presiding deity is called Bhoothalingaswamy. The sanctorum of the temple is a crude cell excavated on the eastern face of a huge irregular mass of rock. The linga is also carved in the same rock. There is no vimana over this shrine. The ardhamandapa and mahamandapa were only later additions. The rock is grit round by a thick stonewall which gives it the appearance of a minor fort. On the right side of entrance to the sanctum is the image of Vinayak and the image of Nandi is in front of the linga. On the right side of Nandi facing south is Nataraja with Sivakami ambal. Adithyan, Subramanian with valli and Deyvanai, Sandikeswarar are other deities of the temple. Outside the prakaram(outer courtyard), anyone will be allowed pooja to the Kasi Viswanathar and Ulagayanayagi. Besides the Bhuthalingaswamy is a separate shrine dedicated to Sivakami Ambal for which there is a small vimana above the shrine. File:Theppakulam view.jpgBhoothalingaswamy Tank View File:Elephant @ Theppakulam.jpgElephant in Bhoothalingaswamy Tank History History says the formation of the Bhuthalingam is based on a story. Bhoothalinga Swamy is named as Saliyar Kanda Thirumeeni. Long ago, Bhoothapandy was a little forest surrounded with bushes and trees. A man who belonged to the caste of Saliyar had four cows and sent the cows to the forest every morning for their food and run them back to home at evening. Among the cows one did not give milk to the man daily. The man thought he saw a haker draw his cows milk daily. He followed the cow the next day. He saw that the cow went to a long grass bush and drew its milk automatically. He was shocked to see this, and cut the bushes with an iron cutter. He was shocked that the iron cutter was full of blood. He was scared by that and called all the people. Together they removed the bushes and they saw a lord Siva sculpture created by Suyambulingam (Saliyar Kanda Thirumeeni). The king built a temple beyond that became the Bhoothalingaswamy temple. The temple is Kudaivu Kovil (built inside rock). Sculpture glory The front of Sivagami Ambal shrine is the best example of its sculpture. The Manmathan and rathi are attractive to view. The chain is made from stone. The Ramayana says Rama killed Vaali from behind. If stood in front, Rama Vaali's image can be seen, but if the observer is in front of Vaali's image, then Rama's image cannot be seen. A beautiful piece of art in the temple lies in the wooden Kalyanamedai the Mandapa. It has been made so skillfully that the joints are invisible. The medai contains numerous multi-colored images. a Srichakram is engraved on the panel of pillar in the Kalyanamandpa. There is no inner prakaram for both the shrines. On the south west corner of the common Prakaram of the shrines is Vinayaga who is locally called \\"Ninaithathai Mudikkum Vinayakar\\". Car Festival Yearly in the month of Thai (Tamil calendar month from the mid of January to the mid of February), Thai (‡Æ§‡Øà) (Tamil month), all members in Bhuthapandy and its surrounding members allot a committee to celebrate a car festival. It runs for ten days. Daily at night there is katcheri, Orchestra, Bharatham dance by kids Competition, Light arrangement around four streets (rathaveethy). Fourth day and seventh day Thiruvila is a great moment with elephants, Horse Bhavani, Siringari melam, Muthu kodai Bhavani. There are Kolam competitions for all women and girls around streets.

It is also the tectonic plate boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate to the northwest and the Pacific Plate to the southeast. The Macquarie Fault Zone includes a component of convergence which increases as it approaches the South Island of New Zealand. Many researchers conclude that the fault zone here is an incipient subduction zone, with oblique motion corresponding to the transition from lateral (strike-slip) motion. In the area known as the Puysegur Trench, the Indo- Australian Plate appears to be starting to sink beneath the Pacific Plate, the reverse of what is occurring off of New Zealand's North Island (see Kermadec- Tonga Subduction Zone).

She had previously served with the French Navy as the Tonnant- class Franklin, but was captured after less than a year in service by the British fleet under Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Having served for less than six months for the French from her completion in March 1798 to her capture in August that year, she would eventually serve for 89 years for the British. Her career began as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Armand Blanquet du Chayla, second in command at the Battle of the Nile, where she distinguished herself with her fierce resistance before being forced to surrender with over half her crew dead or wounded, and most of her guns disabled. Taken into British service she was refitted and served as the flagship of several admirals. Commanded by Francis Austen Canopus was Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis's flagship in the Mediterranean under Nelson, and narrowly missed the fighting at Trafalgar. She saw action with Duckworth's fleet at the Battle of San Domingo, and remained with him during the attempt to force the Dardanelles, and the operations in support of the Alexandria expedition in 1807. She remained active against the French in the Mediterranean for the rest of the Napoleonic Wars, helping to drive ashore two large French ships of the line in a notable incident in 1809. Canopus remained in service after the end of the wars, serving as a flagship into the mid- nineteenth century, but as sail gave way to steam, she was relegated to support duties in Devonport, becoming a receiving ship, tender and a mooring hulk. She was eventually sold for breaking up in 1887, after nearly ninety years in British service. Construction and French career Franklin was built to a design by Jacques-No√´l San√© at the Toulon shipyard between November 1794 and March 1798, having been launched on 25 June 1797. She was named after the American scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin. Commanded by Captain Maurice Gillet and flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Armand Blanquet du Chayla, Franklin was one of the ships that accompanied Vice Admiral Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys's fleet, carrying Napoleon Bonaparte and the French troops to invade Egypt.Franklin was anchored with Brueys's fleet in Aboukir Bay on 1 August, when they were discovered in the evening by a British fleet under Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson. Nelson ordered his fleet to attack immediately, with the British forces moving on the French van, doubling their line. Brueys was taken by surprise, having expected the British to attack his rear and centre, where he had consequently placed his heaviest ships, including the Franklin. Franklin did not therefore enter the engagement until later that evening, as the French van surrendered and the British ships moved down the line to engage the remaining ships. =Franklins fight= Franklin, positioned just ahead of Brueys's flagship, the 120-gun Orient, and astern of the 74-gun Peuple Souverain, came under fire from , and . The British ships and the French centre exchanged a heavy fire, with the British being joined by the newly arrived , and . As Du Chayla later recalled 'The action in this part then became extremely warm.' The two sides were intensely engaged for the next hour, during which the Peuple Souverain was forced out of the line, and the Orient caught fire. As the fire on Orient raged out of control, the nearby French and British ships scrambled to escape the anticipated explosion. Orients magazine blew up at 9:37 p.m., obliterating her and sending burning debris raining down on the nearby ships. Large amounts fell upon the Franklin, starting fires which caused the arms locker to explode and set fire to the poop and quarterdeck. Orient explodes at the Battle of the Nile. Franklin is the ship third from right of the picture, and was almost set on fire herself by falling debris.https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/12001.html For a while it seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able to put out the fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he continued to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours. British service =Mediterranean and San Domingo= The Franklin was one of nine ships captured by the British at the Nile, and she was taken into service with the Royal Navy, being registered under the name HMS Canopus on 9 December 1798. She was sent back to Britain under the command of Captain Bartholomew James, and arrived at Plymouth on 17 July 1799. She briefly became the flagship of Admiral Philip Affleck for service off Lisbon, but was paid off into ordinary in August that year. She began a refit at Plymouth in August 1801, but the work was suspended incomplete in November that year, and was only completed in January 1803. She recommissioned in April that year under the command of Captain John Conn, and became the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Campbell. Thomas Whitcombe's depiction of Duckworth's squadron forcing the Dardanelles Canopus was sent in August 1803 to join the Mediterranean Fleet, based off Toulon under Nelson. Conn was succeeded in February 1805 by Captain Francis Austen, and Canopus became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis. Canopus narrowly missed being present at the Battle of Trafalgar, having been sent to Gibraltar with Louis's squadron to resupply. She returned to Britain in mid-1806, where she was taken in hand at Plymouth for repairs, which were completed in August at a cost of ¬£31,804. In January 1806 she joined Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth's squadron in the pursuit of Corentin Urbain Leiss√®gues, and took part in the Battle of San Domingo on 6 February, engaging the 74-gun Diom√®de among other ships. Canopus sustained casualties of eight dead and 22 wounded. Thomas Shortland became captain of Canopus in July 1806, and sailed to the Mediterranean with Duckworth's squadron, still flying Louis's flag. She took part in the attempt to force the Dardanelles on 19 January, and in subsequent operations in support of the Alexandria expedition, during which nine Turkish vessels were captured or destroyed. Shortland was succeeded by Captain Charles Inglis in 1808, and became the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Martin. Canopus was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood and in October 1809 was part of the fleet that gave chase to a French convoy and their escorts under Rear-Admiral Fran√ßois Baudin in the Gulf of Lyons. In the ensuing Battle of Maguelone, the French were chased into the mouth of the Rhone, where the 80-gun Robuste and the 74-gun Lion were driven aground, and after attempts to salvage them had failed, the French were forced to burn them. Canopus became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Boyles between 1811 and 1812, after which she was paid off into ordinary again. =Postwar= A large repair was carried out at Plymouth Dock (i.e. Devonport) for the sum of ¬£78,909 between March 1814 and March 1816, but with the end of the Napoleonic Wars she was laid up for a number of years. Canopus was fitted for sea at Devonport in May 1834, and underwent further repairs between December 1839 and May 1842. She was prepared for sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted out there as a receiving ship between June and October 1862, and served as a tender to , the Devonport guardship. Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 years service with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J. Pethick, and was broken up.

Italy, Naples and Illyria were all controlled either directly or via proxy by the French Emperor Napoleon I, who had seized them at the Treaty of Pressburg in the aftermath of the War of the Third Coalition. Control of the Adriatic brought numerous advantages to the French Navy, allowing rapid transit of troops from Italy to the Balkans and Austria for campaigning in the east and giving France possession of numerous shipbuilding facilities, particularly the large naval yards of Venice. From 1807, when the Treaty of Tilsit precipitated a Russian withdrawal from the Septinsular Republic, the French Navy held naval supremacy in the region. The Treaty of Tilsit also contained a secret clause that guaranteed French assistance in any war fought between the Russians and the Ottoman Empire. To fulfil this clause, Napoleon would have to secure his supply lines to the east by developing the French armies in Illyria. This required control of the Adriatic against increasingly aggressive British raiders. The Royal Navy decided to prevent these troop convoys from reaching Illyria and sought to break French hegemony in the region, resulting in a six-year naval campaign. The campaign was not uniform in approach; British and French forces were limited by the dictates of the wider Mediterranean and global conflict, and consequently ship numbers fluctuated. Although numerous commanders held commands in the region, the two most important personalities were those of William Hoste and Bernard Dubourdieu, whose exploits were celebrated in their respective national newspapers during 1810 and 1811. The campaign between the two officers reached a climax at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, when Dubourdieu was killed and his squadron defeated by Hoste in a celebrated action. The events of 1811 gave the British dominance in the Adriatic for the remainder of the war. British and Greek expeditionary forces steadily captured fortified French islands and their raiding parties inflicted havoc on trade across the region. As a result, French plans against the Ottoman Empire were cancelled, La Grande Arm√©e turning towards Russia. British forces continued operations until the advancing armies of the Sixth Coalition drove the French from the shores of the Adriatic in early 1814, British troops and marines assisting in the capture of several important French cities, including Fiume (Rijeka) and Trieste. Background Map illustrating the strategic importance of Corfu in controlling the entrance to the Adriatic.There had been a French presence in the Adriatic Sea since the Treaty of Campo Formio during the French Revolutionary War. Campo Formio marked the end of the War of the First Coalition in 1797 and confirmed the demise of the independent Republic of Venice and the division of its territory between the French Republic and the Austrian Empire.Chandler p. 78 One of France's grants from this division were the seven Ionian Islands that controlled the entrance to the Adriatic. These French outposts in the Eastern Mediterranean were considered a threat by both the Russian and the Ottoman Empires and in 1798 a united Russo-Ottoman force attacked the massively fortified French citadel on Corfu, which fell the following year after a four-month siege. The victors took possession of the islands and from them created the Septinsular Republic, nominally Ottoman, practically independent and guaranteed by the Russian Navy. On mainland Europe, the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte as the ruler of the new French Empire resulted in a new conflict, the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, which ended disastrously for the Austrian and Russian allied armies at the Battle of Austerlitz. The treaties that ended the war created two French client monarchies in Italy, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Naples, and French troops were left holding substantial parts of the Eastern coastline of the Adriatic in Dalmatia.Chandler p. 348 These holdings significantly increased French naval interest in the Adriatic, which was well supplied with excellent ports and shipbuilding facilities, particularly at Venice. The Russian garrison on Corfu, augmented with a powerful naval squadron, effectively blocked French use of the Adriatic by sealing the entrance through the Straits of Otranto. French military concerns were also directed further north at this time, resulting in the War of the Fourth Coalition during 1806 and 1807 that saw Napoleon's armies overrun Prussia and force the Russians to sign the Treaty of Tilsit on 7 July 1807.Chandler p. 163 One of the minor clauses of this treaty transferred the Ionian Islands back into French hands, the Russians withdrawing completely from the Adriatic.Adkins, p. 209 This withdrawal supported a hidden clause in the treaty that guaranteed French support in the continuing Russian war with the Ottomans in the Balkans.Chandler p. 441 Campaign =Opening exchanges= As the Russians withdrew, the French immediately despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan troops on Corfu alone.Gardiner, p. 153 This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea from which they could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier.Gardiner, p. 9 To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.James, Vol. 6, p. 44 The Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet responded rapidly to this threat, and in November 1807 the fourth rate ship HMS Glatton and several smaller craft were blockading Corfu, seizing several French and Italian reinforcement convoys.James, Vol. 4, p. 342 Encouraged by the success of the blockade, small British raiders began entering the Adriatic independently, to prey on French convoys along the Italian coast. One of the first British operations in the region was the seizure of the small Dalmatian Island of Lissa, for use as a safe harbour deep in nominally French-controlled waters. The largely uninhabited island was rapidly developed into an effective naval base with the construction of a town and harbour at Port St. George.Henderson, p. 112 During 1807, British ships stationed in the Adriatic were relatively small and their impact was consequently minor. British raiders also limited their attacks on the Illyrian coast to purely military objectives in order to maintain the support of the local population, who supplied the British cruisers with food, water and naval stores. The French Mediterranean Fleet, led by Admiral Ganteaume made a foray to Corfu in February 1808 that the British blockading squadron was powerless to stop, but this was the only attempt by the French to send ships of the line to the region and the fleet had returned to Toulon by mid-March.Gardiner, p. 19 The first major British deployment into the Adriatic came in May 1808, when the frigate HMS Unite under Captain Patrick Campbell arrived off Venice. During May, Campbell severely disrupted French and Italian shipping off the busiest Adriatic seaport and captured three ships sent against him by the Italian Navy.James, Vol. 5, p. 52 The French response to these depredations was to despatch the small frigate Var to Venice, an action which had little effect on British operations. British activity in the Adriatic was however curtailed during the year by the British war with the Ottoman Empire, which absorbed the scant British naval resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.Woodman, p. 247James, Vol. 5, p. 57 =Invasions of the Ionian Islands= The situation in the Adriatic from 1810. The British presence in the Adriatic was greatly strengthened in 1809 with the arrival of the frigates HMS Amphion under William Hoste and HMS Belle Poule under James Brisbane. These reinforcements made an immediate impact with a series of raids in the Dalmatian and Ionian islands.James, Vol. 5, pp. 152‚Äì153 In February Belle Poule captured the Var off Valona; the French responded by despatching the frigates Dana√© and Flore from Toulon.Gardiner, p. 154 HMS Topaze attacked these frigates as they arrived, but they were able to reach Corfu before sailing north to augment French defences in the Adriatic.James, Vol. 5, pp. 171‚Äì173 Throughout the year British attacks intensified, driven by Hoste's Amphion operating from Lissa. Raids on the Italian coastline seized dozens of coastal merchant vessels and gunboats while parties of marines and sailors landed at coastal towns, driving off the defenders and blowing up the fortifications before returning to their ships.James, Vol. 5, pp. 171‚Äì178 These successes in the face of negligible French opposition encouraged the British commander in the Mediterranean, Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, to detail a force specifically to eliminate the French garrisons on the Ionian Islands. This expedition, led at sea by Brigadier-General John Oswald from HMS Warrior succeeded in landing on the island of Cefalonia on 1 October and forcing the Neapolitan garrison to surrender within hours.James, Vol. 5, p. 146 Within days the neighbouring islands of Zante and Ithaca had also surrendered and the detached frigate HMS Spartan under Jahleel Brenton effected a successful invasion of Cerigo shortly afterwards.Brenton, Sir Jahleel, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, P. K. Crimmin, (subscription required), Retrieved 18 June 2008 The invasion of the Ionian Islands sought not only to deny their use to the French, but also to foster Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire, with whom Britain was still at war. Local Greek nationalists and brigands were formed into the 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry under John Oswald and later Richard Church.Oswald, Sir John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H. M. Stephens, (subscription required), Retrieved 22 June 2008 This was the first modern independent Greek military unit, and its existence encouraged other Greek nationalists to join the British forces in the region, forming the core of what was to become the United States of the Ionian Islands.Church, Sir Richard, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H. M. Chichester, (subscription required), Retrieved 18 June 2008 Troop withdrawals late in 1809 delayed any further invasions until March 1810, when Collingwood's temporary successor Thomas Byam Martin detached a squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet for an operation against Santa Maura. Landings were effected on 22 March, and the island surrendered on 16 April after an eight-day siege of the principal fortress, the attackers considerably aided by the desertion of the garrison's native Greek troops to Oswald's Greek Light Infantry.Gardiner, p. 155 =French reinforcements= Captain Bernard Dubourdieu. The conclusion of the War of the Fifth Coalition in late 1809 had changed the political situation in the Adriatic, confirming French possession of the Illyrian Provinces and removing any threat to the Adriatic seaports from Austrian-held territory.Chandler p. 405 It also freed the French Army to operate against the Ottoman Empire, as intended in the Treaty of Tilsit. It did not however affect the British frigates raiding in the Adriatic under the command of William Hoste, who was now launching coordinated raids against coastal convoys, towns and forts along the Italian coast.James, Vol. 5, p. 169‚Äì178 In the late summer of 1810 the French Navy made their first serious effort to contest British operations in the Adriatic, with the despatch of Bernard Dubourdieu from Toulon in Favorite.Gardiner, p. 172 Dubourdieu was considered one of the more successful frigate commanders in the French Navy, and he collected the French and Italian forces scattered across the Adriatic into a squadron that significantly outnumbered Hoste's forces. Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's movements and maintained a careful watch on the French-led squadron in its base at Ancona.Adkins, p. 357 In early October, having failed to draw Dubourdieu into battle the previous month, Hoste resupplied at Lissa and returned to the blockade of Ancona, now accompanied by HMS Cerberus. Discovering Dubourdieu and his squadron missing, Hoste gave chase in the direction of Corfu, acting on inaccurate information supplied by a passing Sicilian privateer. As Dubourdieu had planned, this detour opened Lissa to attack. Landing on the island with overwhelming force on 21 October, the French seized the shipping in the harbour but were unable to find the island's garrison, which had retreated to the mountains.Woodman, p. 253 Dubourdieu remained on Lissa for seven hours, but withdrew to Ancona when local fishermen informed him that Hoste was returning from the south.James, Vol. 5, p. 252‚Äì256 To defend against a repeat of this raid and to guard against intervention by the French ship of the line Rivoli, which was completing at Venice, the British Mediterranean Fleet sent the third-rate HMS Montagu to Lissa. The arrival of such a powerful vessel stifled any further French initiatives during the year, allowing Hoste to conduct limited raids on the Italian coastline.James, Vol. 5, p. 256 =Battle of Lissa= In early 1811 Montagu left the Adriatic. With HMS Cerberus and HMS Active detached on operations against the ports of Pescara and Ortona in February, Dubourdieu organised a second attack on Lissa, this time with the ambition of permanently seizing the island and garrisoning it with Italian troops. Departing Ancona on 11 March with six frigates, numerous support craft and over 500 soldiers, the Franco- Italian squadron sailed for Lissa overnight. Early in the morning on 12 March, the French were spotted by British observers on Lissa and Hoste brought his squadron, including the recently returned Cerberus and Active, to meet Dubourdieu off the island's northern coast.Adkins, p. 359 Battle of Lissa, 13 March 1811, engraved by Henri Merke based upon a painting by George Webster in 1812. Maintaining a close line of battle, Hoste forced Dubourdieu to attack him directly, Dubourdieu attempting to personally board Hoste's Amphion at the head of the Italian soldiers carried aboard his flagship. Hoste responded to the attempt with fire at point blank range from a carronade containing over 750 musket balls.Henderson, p. 113 The first shot killed Dubourdieu and almost all of his officers, creating confusion in the French squadron that resulted in Favorite being wrecked on Lissa's coastline. Hoste then engaged the following Flore and Bellone, forcing them both to surrender.Gardiner, p. 174 The head of the British line, led by HMS Volage engaged the three remaining French and Italian ships, driving off Dana√© and Carolina and capturing Corona. Flore too later escaped to the safety of French batteries off Lesina.Woodman, p. 255 The victory at the Battle of Lissa confirmed British dominance in the region for the next three years, the French unable to replace the losses in ships and experienced officers inflicted at the action.Adkins, p. 362 Attempts to reinforce the Adriatic and maintain the convoys that supplied Corfu were launched from Toulon during the spring of 1811, but few reached the Adriatic; stopped by the British blockade of the Southern French ports.James, Vol. 5, p. 362 Of those that escaped the blockade of Toulon, most were subsequently captured by the squadron at Lissa, which had been augmented by the return of HMS Belle Poule and the newly arrived HMS Alceste, replacing HMS Amphion and the wounded Hoste who had returned to Britain. The squadron also continued the raids on coastal shipping and towns that defined the British campaign, attacking Parenzo and Ragosniza to destroy supply ships sheltering in the harbours.James, Vol. 5, p. 371 In November HMS Eagle chased and captured the small French frigate Corcyre in a failed attempt by a French convoy to transport supplies to Corfu.James, Vol. 5, p. 375 A day later, the action of 29 November 1811 foiled the most significant French attempt to bring more forces to the Adriatic in 1811 when a British squadron under Captain Murray Maxwell in Alceste chased and engaged two frigates and an armed store ship.James, Vol. 5, pp. 375‚Äì380 One frigate and the store ship were captured, the other reaching Ancona in a disabled state. This action had wide-ranging effects; Napoleon himself took an interest in the reports, and it has been suggested that it was this engagement that convinced him to change the direction of his plans for eastwards expansion from the Balkans to Russia. =British dominance= French hopes of regaining supremacy in the Adriatic now rested on the Rivoli, a ship of the line under construction at Venice. Although her completion had been delayed by almost two years, British intelligence was aware of her condition and had periodically supplied ships of the line to observe her movements and engage her if the opportunity should arise.James, Vol. 6, p. 64 In February 1812, Rivoli departed Venice for the first time, destined for Pola on her maiden voyage. Waiting for Rivoli was the British HMS Victorious, commanded by John Talbot, who chased Rivoli and captured her in a four-hour battle in which both sides suffered heavy casualties.Talbot, Sir John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 18 June 2008 The loss of Rivoli ended French efforts to contest British dominance of the Adriatic. Although the campaign in the theatre would continue until 1814, from February 1812 British raiders were able to attack French convoys, forts, islands and even significant cities with impunity.Gardiner, p. 180 In the summer of 1812, William Hoste returned to the Adriatic as captain of HMS Bacchante and raided the Apulian coast for several months.Gardiner, p. 179 The freedom with which British cruisers could operate within the Adriatic attracted reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet, such as HMS Eagle which arrived off Ancona in September and blockaded the city, chasing and destroying whole coastal convoys unopposed.James, Vol. 6, p. 75 Even without British intervention, French losses in the Adriatic mounted. In November 1811 the Flore, veteran of Lissa, was wrecked off Chioggia while in September 1812, the Dana√© suddenly exploded with heavy loss of life at Trieste.James, Vol. 6, pp. 491‚Äì494 For the French Navy, these losses were irreplaceable; French frigates were increasingly unable to escape the blockades of their home ports to reach the Adriatic and ensure the protection of their convoys. In early 1813 the first significant British squadron was detached to the Adriatic, under the command of Admiral Thomas Fremantle. This force had wide-ranging orders to seize or destroy all French islands, forts and outposts, disrupt coastal trade wherever possible and assist the allied armies of the Sixth Coalition. Under Fremantle's orders the islands or coastal towns of Lagosta, Curzola, Carlopago, Cherso, Dignano, Giuppana and others were systematically invaded, to be either held by British forces or have their shore facilities slighted to prevent their use by the French.James, Vol. 6, pp. 172‚Äì179 Fremantle also despatched several officers, including Hoste, to operate independently. Hoste in Bacchante returned to Apulia and attacked a string of ports, castles and anchorages, while Captain George Cadogan in HMS Havannah effectively halted the movement of supplies along the northern Italian coast in support of the approaching Austrian armies.Gardiner, p. 181 In June, Fremantle himself led his whole squadron against the important port city of Fiume, seizing or burning 90 vessels from the harbour and huge quantities of naval stores after a sharp battle in the city streets.James, Vol. 6, p. 179 Three months later, Fremantle attacked the city of Trieste, blockading it from the sea, bombarding its defences and landing marines and cannon to join with the besieging Austrian armies and force the city's surrender.James, Vol. 6, p. 180 =End in the Adriatic= In the autumn of 1813, British raiders enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea. Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy, Fremantle's ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic port of Zara in December. Cattaro was captured in collaboration with Montenegrin ground troops, and the same result occurred at Ragusa in January 1814.James, Vol. 6, p. 257 By 16 February 1814, Fremantle wrote to his superior Sir Edward Pellew that every French harbour had been captured by British or Austrian troops. Over 700 French merchant ships had been seized and the only remaining French outpost in the region was Corfu.Fremantle, Sir Thomas Francis, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 18 June 2008 The last surviving French warship in the region, the frigate Uranie, was destroyed by its own crew at Brindisi on 3 February to prevent her falling into British hands.Clowes, p. 562 The abdication of Napoleon in early April 1814 brought the War of the Sixth Coalition to a close. Corfu, the longest-held French territory in the Adriatic surrendered and was added to the United States of the Ionian Islands under British protection. Aftermath Many awards were presented in Britain for service in the Adriatic, Hoste, Maxwell and Fremantle among those knighted in the 1815 reforms to the knightly orders, as well as the recipients of a large amount of prize money for their captures in the theatre. The dearth of significant fleet actions in the last nine years of the war also increased public interest in actions such as that at Lissa, which were widely celebrated both before and after the peace.Hoste, Sir William, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 22 June 2008Ireland p. 194 =Impact= Although a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, the naval campaign in the Adriatic may have had far reaching consequences for the wider conflict. In particular, the events of 1811 were studied closely by Napoleon; in a chance meeting with Murray Maxwell in 1817, the former Emperor recalled Maxwell's action on 29 November 1811 intimately and commended Maxwell on his victory.Henderson, p. 162 The agreement between France and Russia to support each other in operations against the Ottoman Empire could not have been fulfilled without secure supply lines from France to the Balkans and those supply lines could not be assured without naval control of the Adriatic.Henderson, p. 111 British historian James Henderson has linked the action of November 1811 to this strategic problem, suggesting that the loss of the convoy and its 200 cannon may have been a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the emphasis of his planned campaign of 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.Henderson, p. 152 On a smaller scale, the Adriatic was one of the few areas in which French and British ships saw regular combat during the period, Rivoli being the last French ship of the line captured in battle at sea. The drain of resources from the French Mediterranean Fleet to the Adriatic in the final years of the Napoleonic Wars, prompted by the need to convoy supplies to the isolated garrison of Corfu, frustrated successive French admirals, particularly after the death of Dubourdieu in 1811. The British blockade of Toulon stifled efforts to rebuild forces lost in battle and through accident to such a degree, that by 1812 British ships were free to operate almost with impunity, keeping thousands of French and Italian soldiers that would otherwise have been deployed against the Sixth Coalition in garrisons along the coastline. In the final months of the war, the ability of the Royal Navy to strike at any point on the coast without opposition undermined the entire defensive structure of the French forces in the region and eased the capture of several heavily defended port cities by the advancing Austrian armies.

Japanese hip hop draws incredible homage to the United States for its rap culture and its African-American culture. Youth in Japan have even been known to darken their faces, in a style known as burapan, to mimic the look and style of blacks in America.Wood, Joe. \\"The Yellow Negro\\" Transition 73:40-67 However, as the lyrics of the song show, Japanese hip hop heads are not simply going for the look of black youth, they have a message, and often a politically charged message, that falls into lockstep, (or rhythm) with black youth. King Giddra was not the only hip hop group to criticize the American government for the terrorist attacks: Wyclef Jean, the Gorillaz, and countless other groups have released songs in the wake of 911.

The Brunner Mine disaster happened at 9:30am on Thursday 26 March 1896, when an explosion deep in the Brunner Mine, in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South island, killed all 65 miners below ground. The Brunner Mine disaster is the worst mining disaster in New Zealand‚Äôs history. It is most likely that the explosion was caused by firedamp, a common hazard in coal mines when a pocket of methane gas is accidentally ignited and explodes. Firedamp is all the more hazardous because of the after effects of the explosion. Gases known as \\"afterdamp\\" ‚Äì carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide produced by the explosion ‚Äì often prove to be just as deadly and can kill miners unhurt by the explosion itself.Cawte, H (2008). 'Case Studies In Archaeological Research: The Archaeology of Mining, Lecture 5: Safety, Clothing, Housing, University Of Otago, 10 March. ‚ÄúJoseph Scott, the Blackball Mine Manager.., believed that the majority (of miners) were killed by the explosion and ‚Äúnot more than half a dozen by the afterdamp‚Äù. Robert Russell, believing the explosion to be caused by firedamp, while acknowledging that the explosion force and coal dust flames contributed to the causes of death, believed that ‚Äúat the end it was the afterdamp gases that killed them (all).‚Äù Dr. James McBrearty‚Äôs description of many victims frothing at the mouth, suggests asphyxiation by the predominant afterdamp gas, being carbon dioxide. The afterdamp gas carbon monoxide which presented such a problem for the recovery teams must also have contributed to death through poisoning. It was not then fully appreciated that only small quantities of carbon monoxide or white damp could be fatal‚Äù. Rescuers entering the mine after the explosion found themselves suffocating on the afterdamp gas and had to return to the surface, often unconscious, carried by other rescuers; however, the determination was such to find the bodies, and to find any survivors, that the rescuers ‚Äì mostly miners from nearby mines ‚Äì would insist on returning to the airless mine as soon as they had been revived on the surface. Miners came from as far as Denniston to assist the rescue effort, though it took the Denniston miners several days to arrive as they had to travel by sea from Westport. Wood explains this: ‚ÄúThe response of the West Coast miners in volunteering for the rescue parties was due to their occupational loyalties and social and kinship ties. Occupational bonding, especially of coal miners, requires obedience to the miner‚Äôs code that they come to each other‚Äôs assistance. Denniston miners and mine managers, like Blackball miners, included former workmates, relatives and friends belonging to the same generation of immigrants, particularly those arriving between 1875 and 1885‚Äù. According to Wood: ‚ÄúThe tragedy helped to break down some old world differences and establish a West Coast identity especially in the mining community. The bodies of all 65 miners from the Brunner mine were eventually accounted for, including a Mr. John Roberts and three of his sons who were all working that day.

The term refers to an inner city area of West Kingston, Jamaica, called Jungle (the subject of the Bob Marley song \\"Concrete Jungle\\", from the Wailers album Catch a Fire). 'Junglist' developed into a slang term for outlaw toughs who have ostensibly survived- or operate according to the 'law of the jungle'. Certain tracks made references to the \\"original rudebwoys\\" or \\"original gangstas\\" as denoting particularly respected junglists. Most members of this sub-culture took great pride in the music created by jungle producers. Unlike some urban styles of music, drug-dealing is rarely mentioned in drum and bass tracks, but several MCs sometimes feature lyrics in relation. The only generally accepted illegal activity in the subculture are drug use and graffiti. Junglists often consume cannabis perhaps arising from the reggae roots of jungle music. Other terms applied to junglists in varying degrees are \\"ravers\\" or \\"drum and bassheads\\". Junglists belong to what is seen as a predominantly UK-based drum and bass subculture. As a subculture, however, it is not nearly as distinct as goth or punk to the untrained eye, where members can often distinguish each other by their mannerisms and fashion without hearing their choice of music. Many of those who identify as Junglists adopt a mix of rasta, rudebwoy and B-Boy fashions since jungle, drum and bass and hip hop have close ties as subcultures. Ali G could be seen as a parody junglist (e.g. dressing in camouflage and listening to loud drum and bass music in his car; M-Beat and General Levy's \\"Incredible\\" was played in the Ali G feature film and appearing on its soundtrack), though he could also be treated as a parody of an avid hip hop listener.

It is part of a series of dams that canalizes the Monongahela to a depth of at least for its entire length from Fairmont, West Virginia to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Pittsburgh District. Opekiska has a single lock chamber located on the right-descending river bank. The dam's upper pool extends about upstream to the Monongahela's source at Fairmont, West Virginia. The pool also extends up the Monongahela's two primary tributaries, the Tygart Valley River and the West Fork River. Opekiska's downstream pool is formed by Hildebrand Lock and Dam.

The cartel is based in Chihuahua, one of the primary transportation routes for billions of dollars' worth of illegal drug shipments entering the United States from Mexico annually. He was one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. Early life Vicente Carrillo Fuentes was born in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico on 16 October 1962 to Vicente Carrillo and Aurora Fuentes. He had seven siblings: Ang√©lica, Amado, Cipriano, Guadalupe, Alberto, Rodolfo and Jos√© Cruz Carrillo Fuentes (Vicente being the fourth one). All are nephews of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, a former drug lord.  Family relations and alliances  The Ju√°rez Cartel was founded by his brother Amado Carrillo Fuentes following the death of Pablo Acosta Villarreal. Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes died in the mid-1980s by gunshot under mysterious circumstances. Amado began in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle and eventually formed the Ju√°rez Cartel by 1993. Amado brought in his brothers and eventually his son Vicente Carrillo Leyva, who was arrested on April 1, 2009. When Amado died on July 3, 1997 following complications from plastic surgery, a brief turf war began in Juarez over the leadership of the cartel. Vicente would emerge as the victor after defeating the Mu√±oz Talavera brothers for control of the cartel. Vicente formed a partnership with Juan Jos√© Esparragoza Moreno, his brother Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, Ricardo Garcia Urquiza and the Beltr√°n Leyva brothers. He kept in service several lieutenants formally under his brother, such as \\"El Chacky\\" Hernandez. The organization was in flux by the time Vicente took control of the cartel and the death of Amado created a large power vacuum in the Mexican underworld. The Arellano F√©lix brothers became the most powerful organization during the 1990s while Vicente was able to avoid direct conflict and increase the strength of the Ju√°rez Cartel. The relationship between the Carrillo Fuentes clan and the other members of the organization grew unstable towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 2001 after the escape from prison by Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, many of the Ju√°rez Cartel members defected to Guzm√°n's Sinaloa cartel. In 2004 Rodolfo Carrillo was killed outside of a movie theatre allegedly at the behest of Guzm√°n Loera. Vicente Carrillo responded by having Guzm√°n Loera's brother \\"El Pollo\\" assassinated in prison. This sparked off a turf war; however, it seemed that the war between the two was on hold during 2005 and 2006 because the Sinaloa Cartel was engaged in a vicious war with their rival, the Gulf Cartel. During this time, the leadership of the cartel was between Vicente Carrillo and Ricardo Garc√≠a Urquiza, who was arrested in November 2005. The cartel had become factionalized between the groups loyal to the Carrillo family and the groups loyal to Juan Jos√© Esparragoza Moreno and Guzm√°n Loera's Sinaloa Cartel. The Ju√°rez Cartel, under the control of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, was placed under a large degree of pressure following the \\"House of Death\\" case, in which the organization was penetrated by law enforcement, but was corrupted by the fact that the informant participated in murders. In 2008, 200 murders occurred in the first three months and it appeared that the war between the Sinaloa Federation and the remnants of the Ju√°rez Cartel was back on. President Calder√≥n sent thousands of troops to Ciudad Ju√°rez. The Ju√°rez Cartel, at one time the most powerful in Mexico, is a shadow of its former self. Charges Carrillo Fuentes was charged in a forty-six count indictment in the Western District of Texas with continuing criminal enterprise, importation and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, conspiracy to import and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, as well as with money laundering, tampering with a witness, ordering the intentional killing of individuals to prevent communication of information by them to U.S. law enforcement, and murder in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise. The U.S. Departments of State offered a reward of up to $5 million USD for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes. =Kingpin Act sanction= On 1 June 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Carrillo Fuentes under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with eleven other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Arrest Carrillo Fuentes was arrested in a joint operation by the Mexican Army and Federal Police in Torre√≥n, Coahuila on 9 October 2014. He was then sent to Mexico City and transferred to the federal installations of SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave a formal declaration. Two days later, he was formally charged with drug trafficking and organized crime offenses.

This method, like others, was derived by integration of Boussinesq's equation for a point load.Das, Braja M. Principles of Geotechnical Engineering. 6. Toronto: Thomson, 2006. Background Newmark obtained values of R/z that corresponded to various pressure ratios by using the equation (R/z)=‚àö(1-(„Äñ‚àÜœÉ„Äó_z/q)^(-2/3)-1), where R = the radial distance away from the point at which the load is applied, z = the vertical depth below the applied load, „Äñ‚àÜœÉ„Äó_z = the stress at the point of interest a depth of z below the surface, and q = the load per unit area applied at the surface. Using the pressure ratios obtained from the equation above, he was able to form the influence chart. Application The chart is constructed by drawing concentric circles. The circles are divided by equally spaced radial lines. The radii of the circles are equal to the R/z values corresponding to F U K„Äñ‚àÜœÉ„Äó_z/q = 0, 0.1, 0.2,...,1. There are nine circles shown since when „Äñ‚àÜœÉ„Äó_z/q = 0, R/z = 0 also. The unit length for plotting the circles is AB. When solving a vertical stress problem using Newmark's influence chart, the influence value (IV) must be taken into account. It is proportional to the number of elements in the chart and is given by 1/N, N being the total number of elements in the chart. For example, a typical chart consists of 200 elements; therefore, the influence value is 0.005. The procedure for obtaining the vertical pressure at any point below a loaded area is as follows: # Verify the depth z below the uniformly loaded area where the stress increase is to be obtained. # Plot the plan of the loaded area with a scale of z equal to the unit length of the chart (AB). # Place the plan on the influence chart in such a manner that the point below which the stress is to be determined in located at the center of the chart. # Count the number of elements (M) of the chart enclosed by the plan of the loaded area. The formula used to solve for the increase in pressure at the point being considered is „Äñ‚àÜœÉ„Äó_z = (IV)qM, where IV = influence value, q = pressure on the loaded area, and M = number of elements enclosed by loaded area. Limitations The equation and chart needed to apply Newmark's method is based entirely on the principles of the theory of elasticity. There are however limitations to these theories that one must realize when they are applied to an actual soil. Generally, soil deposits are not homogeneous, perfectly elastic, and isotropic. This being the case, some variation from the theoretical stress calculations should be expected in the field. One could expect up to a 30% difference between theoretical estimates and field values. Important Figures Joseph Valentin Boussinesq (1842-1929) was a French physicist and mathematician. He was a professor of differential and integral calculus at the Faculty of Sciences of Lille (1872‚Äì86), and professor of physics and mechanics at Sorbonne, Paris (1886).Barran, Michel. \\"Boussinesq, Valentin Joseph (1842-1929).\\" ScienceWorld. May 2006. 16 Mar 2008 In 1883, he solved the problem of stresses produced at any point in a homogeneous, elastic, isotropic soil medium as the result of a point load applied on the surface of an infinitely large half-space. Nathan Mortimore Newmark (1910-1981) attended Rutgers University. He graduated in 1930 with High Honors and Special Honors in civil engineering. Newmark was extremely well known in his field for research in structural engineering and structural dynamics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.National Academy of Engineering, Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering. 2. Washington, DC: Joseph Henry Press, 1984. His research greatly influenced structural and mechanical design across the world. He is also known for his contributions to the design of earthquake- resistant structures and to the trans-Alaska pipeline. In 1942, Newmark expanded on Boussinesq's work by constructing what is now very widely known in geotechnical engineering as Newmark's influence chart.

He started racing at 19 and rode the Milk Race in 1960, finishing 7th.  Cycling career  Lewis represented Britain in the Tour de l'Avenir and the world championships at San Sebastian. He came 25th, the best British rider, in the individual road race at the 1964 Summer Olympics. After racing in France he received offers to join the AC Boulogne-Billancourt in Paris, often a stepping stone to professional teams and especially to Peugeot or to ride for a smaller British team, Mackeson-Condor. The sponsors were a brewing company and a London bicycle shop. He turned pro for ¬£4 per week. Average weekly pay in Britain at the time was about ¬£25. In 1967 he finished the Tour de France 84th and won the national road championship. Mackeson-Condor doubled his pay. In 1968 he won the road championship again, the only rider to win in successive years. He moved to another team, Holdsworth-Campagnolo, in 1969 and stayed there until he retired from professional racing in 1975. In the 1967 Tour de France, Lewis rode with and shared a room with Tom Simpson, who died during the race while climbing Mont Ventoux. Lewis said: The biggest lesson he learned on the Tour was that the ability to suffer for prolonged periods, Lewis said that this was the difference between British and Continental professionals at the time. Lewis was the last Welshman to ride the Tour de France in 1968 until Geraint Thomas in 2007. He said British professional racing scene was good but there were too few hard races and too much \\"chasing round straw bales all the time\\", a reference to races held up and down straight roads, often on seafronts. Lewis said the promise of development exited with companies such as Yellow Pages, V&G; Insurance and Redifusion sponsoring races, although the deals never lasted long, frequently sending them back to square one looking for new sponsors. Lewis had 250 victories, 38 professional, including the Golden Wheel Trophy and the Linz am Rhine.  Other work and personal life  He opened a cycle shop in 1976. He was manager of Eastway Cycle Circuit in Hackney, London, and spent seven years as training director at the South East Centre of Excellence. Lewis lives in Devon.

It stars Billy Zane, Christina Cole, Natalie Mendoza and Louise Barnes. The screenplay concerns six documentary filmmakers who attempt to survive their visit to a Philippine island to shoot a survival special when they discover that the shape shifting, bloodthirsty Aswang, a creature of Philippine folklore inhabits the island.See Billy Zane's Aswang in New Surviving Evil Trailer Plot A team of six documentary filmmakers, Sebastian \\"Seb\\" Beazley (Billy Zane), Phoebe Drake (Christina Cole), Cecilia \\"Chill\\" Reyes (Natalie Mendoza), Joey \\"Tito\\" Valencia (Joel Torre), Rachel Rice (Louise Barnes) and Dexter \\"Dex\\" Simms (Colin Moss), arrive to spend six days shooting a wilderness survival special, Surviving the Wilderness, on the remote Mayaman Island, one of the seven thousand islands that make up the Philippine Archipelago. They set up camp, and it‚Äôs not long until ominous events begin to happen, eventually sparking their suspicion that the mythical Aswang creature inhabits the island. The second day, Joey and Cecilia travel alone to the village of the Isarog tribe, where people had been savaged and one woman's corpse remains with her stomach gouged open. Determined to stay for the whole trip, Joey forces Cecilia to keep her silence among the group about the lurking danger. That night, Phoebe overhears one of their conversations and together they discuss the Aswang, detailed as a shape shifting, flesh-eating, jungle tree creature of the Filipino folklore, capable of procreating by altering the fetus of a pregnant woman in an evolutionary process called Dungo nan bunti. The creatures' fears include staying on the ground too long and fire. The third day, Sebastian is bitten by the Aswang and Phoebe comes across an infant corpse, as Joey and Cecilia follow map directions to a gun tower close to the Aswang‚Äôs nest. There, Cecilia finds out Joey is searching for gold to help his family. The gold and the treasure map were left behind decades ago by Joey‚Äôs grandfather who was a prisoner of the Japanese army in the Second World War. Joey detonates a hole in the tower floor and goes underground to find and obtain some of the gold. Just then, many Aswang creatures attack Cecilia, who stayed above to take cover for Joey. Cecilia falls out of sight, and when Joey returns to the surface, he is killed by the creatures, to Cecilia's horror. The group discovers Phoebe is pregnant and the Aswang creatures are after her blood to turn her baby into one of theirs. Cecilia escapes on foot from the creatures, with Dexter eventually finding her after she calls for help. This leads to the whole group coming under attack from the creatures, but they are able to injure some of them. The group attempts to leave the island on an inflatable raft, but the creatures pursue them again and end up killing Dexter. At nightfall, Sebastian and Phoebe go down a ditch in the jungle; however, Sebastian badly injures himself with his machete during the fall. He tells Phoebe to run and tries to fight off the creatures, but they kill him. By sunrise on the fourth day, Rachel and Cecilia take shelter at the gun tower. Rachel looks for Joey‚Äôs satellite phone, and one of the creatures emerges, only for Cecilia to shoot it with Joey‚Äôs gun. Rachel uses a rope to go underground, but it snaps from its wooden hinge and she falls, causing her to lose consciousness. Cecilia solely combats the entourage of creatures which fly out of its nest; however, one of them grabs her and brings her there. A handheld explosive she was preparing before she was taken detonates in the nest, killing her, a pregnant woman inside, and the creatures in the explosion. While this goes on, Phoebe escapes the island on the raft. The next day, she winds up on another island where she realizes three pregnant women are soon to give birth to more creatures. Back at the gun tower, the sat phone rings in Joey‚Äôs bag. Underground, Rachel shows signs that she is alive.

It marked the directorial debut of director/writer Terence Daw. The story was set on a small island in the Philippines, though the filmmakers discovered areas in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to shoot. Supported by national parks, they were able to film in the 253-hectare Kenneth Stainbank Nature Reserve in Yellowwood Park, Durban, which had the lush tropical vegetation the filmmakers needed and was the ideal double for a Philippine island. Another place used was a beach near Umkomaas, shown in the scene where the crew arrive on the island. Producer Anton Ernst said, \\"Our main aim with this film is to take the audience on a roller coaster ride - filled with fun, excitement and suspenseful horror.

There was a real effort here by Daw to make the best film he could and mostly succeeds. It seemed that the film was written with a specific budget in mind and was able to deliver on the said budget. He never once tried to over step his bounds and made a safe horror film with plenty of blood, awesome looking creatures, and the most important ingredient, characters that actually have souls. People we are able to root for and people that feel and look human.\\" Dread Central rated the film a score of 2.5 out of 5, commending the creature design as the film's best aspect, as well as the character development. However, the reviewer criticized the film's occasionally shoddy cinematography, and moments of stupidity.

Geography  The windswept valley of the Dzungarian Gate, wide at its narrowest, is located between Lake Alakol to the northwest in Kazakhstan and Ebinur Lake () to the southeast in China.Paul E. Lydolph, Climates of the Soviet Union, Elsevier Scientific Pub. Co., 1977, p. 174 At its lowest, the floor of the valley lies at about 1,500 feet (450m) elevation, while the surrounding peaks of the Dzungarian Alatau range reach about 10,000 feet (3,000m) to the northeast and 15,000 feet (4,500m) to the southwest. Douglas Carruthers, who explored the area in the first decade of the 20th century, writes: > The Dzungarian Gate is a defile about six miles wide at its narrowest point, > and forty-six miles long, connecting Southern Siberia with Dzungaria. It > forms a natural pathway from the plateau of Mongolia to the great plain of > North-western Asia, and is the one and only gateway in the mountain-wall > which stretches from Manchuria to Afghanistan, over a distance of three > thousand miles.

Geologically, the valley of Dzungarian Gate was created by the active strike- slip Dzungar fault system. In strike-slip faults the blocks slide past each other laterally, and in this case they do so in a counter-clockwise direction or dextrally, similar to the famous San Andreas Fault. Remarking on it as a geological and physical phenomenon, Carruthers continues: > [T]he Dzungarian Gate is as unusual as that of the Jordan depression. They > are both examples of a rift-valley caused by the movement of the earth's > crust, not by the action of water.

One of the earliest mentions of the Dzungaria region dates to when Emperor Wu of Han (reigning 156‚Äì87 BCE), dispatched the Han Chinese diplomat Zhang Qian to investigate lands to the west. The northernmost Silk Road trackway, about in length, connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerged in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia. Dzungaria is named after a Mongolian kingdom which existed in Central Asia during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It derived its name from the Dzungars, who were so called because they formed the left wing (z√º√ºn, left; gar, hand) of the Mongolian army, the self-named Oirats. It was raised to its greatest prominence by Kaldan (also known as Galdan Boshigtu Khan) in the latter half of the 17th century, who made repeated incursions on the territory of the Kazakh state, until Kaldan was wiped out by the Qing government in about 1757‚Äì1759. It played an important part in the history of Mongolia and the great westward Mongolian migrations. After 1761 its territory fell mostly to the Qing dynasty (Xinjiang and north-western Mongolia) and partly to Russian Turkestan (earlier the Kazakh state provinces of Semirechye- Jetysu and Irtysh river). A traveler going west from China must go either north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria or south of the Tian Shan through the Tarim Basin. Trade usually took the southern route and migrations the northern. This is most likely because the Tarim leads to the Ferghana Valley and Iran, while Dzungaria leads only to the open steppe. The difficulty with the southern route was the high mountains between the Tarim and Ferghana. There is also another reason. The Taklamakan Desert of the Tarim is too dry to support much grass, and therefore lacked nomads likely to rob caravans. Its inhabitants lived mostly in oases formed where rivers ran out of the mountains into the desert. These were inhabited by peasants who were unwarlike and merchants who had an interest in keeping trade running smoothly. On the other hand, Dzungaria had a fair amount of grass, few towns to base soldiers in and no significant mountain barriers to the west. Therefore, trade went south and migrations north.The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia Ren√© Grousset Rutgers University Press, 1970 p. xxii, = Modern development = Alashankou station The Chinese city of Alashankou lies on the eastern end of the valley in the B√∂rtala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang. To the west, in the Almaty Province of Kazakhstan, lies its smaller counterpart, Dostyk, or Druzhba in Russian. Modern development of the pass for its economic potential was delayed by political considerations. An agreement between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to connect Kazakhstan with Western China by rail had been reached in 1954. On the Soviet side, the railway reached the border town of Druzhba (Dostyk) (whose names, both Russian and Kazakh, mean 'friendship') in 1959. On the Chinese side, however, the westward construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway was stopped once it reached Urumqi in 1962. Due to the Sino-Soviet Split, the border town remained a sleepy backwater for some 30 years, until the Alashankou railway station was finally completed on September 12, 1990.

The Dzungarian Gate has been noted in modern history as the most convenient pass for horseback riders between the western Eurasian steppe and lands further east, and for its fierce and almost constant winds.Douglas Carruthers, Unknown Mongolia: A Record of Travel and Exploration in North-West Mongolia p. 415 The area has also become known for its gold deposits and for producing prodigious numbers of dinosaur fossils, especially Protoceratops. Given that Herodotus relates a story of a traveller to the East who visited a land where griffins guard gold and east of which live the Hyperboreans, modern scholars have theorized that the Dzungarian Gate may be the real-world location of the home of Boreas, the North Wind of Greek Legend.Given certain historical clues and parallels in legends, scholars like Carl Ruck have speculated on a connection between the Dzungarian Gate and the home of Boreas, the North Wind of Greek mythology. Difficulties and conflations, such as the claim that they sleep six months out of the year, remain. Yet the Hyperboreans, who live beyond the home of the North Wind have been identified by some as the Chinese. J. P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair, The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West, Thames & Hudson, 2000, p. 44 The Greek writer Herodotus writes in his Histories (4.13) that the explorer Aristeas, a native of Proconnesus in Asia Minor active circa 7th century BC, had written a hexameter poem (now lost) about a journey to the Issedones of the far north. Aristeas reported that beyond them lived the one- eyed Arimaspians, further on were the gold-guarding griffins, and beyond these the Hyperboreans. > This Aristeas, possessed by Phoibos, visited the Issedones; beyond these > live the one-eyed Arimaspoi, beyond whom are the Grypes that guard gold, and > beyond these again the Hyperboreoi, whose territory reaches to the sea. > Except for the Hyperboreoi, all these nations are always at war with their > neighbors...Herodotus 4.13.1 Based on Greek and Scythian sources, Herodotus describes the Issedones as living east of Scythia and north of the Massagetae, while the geographer Ptolemy (VI.16.7) appears to place the trading stations of Issedon Scythica and Issedon Serica in the Tarim Basin.Ptolemy's information appears to come at several removes from a Han guide of the first century CE, according to Phillips (Phillips 1955:170); it would have been translated from Persian to Greek by the traveller Maes Titianus for his itinerary, used by Marinus of Tyre as well as Ptolemy. They may have been identical with the people described in Chinese sources as the Wusun.Golden (1992), p. 51 According to E. D. Phillips, the Issedones are \\"placed by some in Western Siberia and by others in Chinese Turkestan.\\"Phillips, \\"The Legend of Aristeas: Fact and Fancy in Early Greek Notions of East Russia, Siberia, and Inner Asia\\" Artibus Asiae 18.2 (1955, pp. 161‚Äì177) p. 166. J. D. P. Bolton places them on the south- western slopes of the Altai Mountains. Since Herodotus places the Hyperboreans beyond the Massagetae and Issedones, both Central Asian peoples, it appears that his Hyperboreans may have lived in Siberia. Heracles sought the golden- antlered hind of Artemis in Hyperborea. As the reindeer is the only deer species of which females bear antlers, this would suggest an arctic or subarctic region. Following Bolton's location of the Issedones on the south- western slopes of the Altay Mountains, Ruck places Hyperborea beyond the Dzungarian Gate into northern Xinjiang, noting that the Hyperboreans were probably Chinese. =Griffin= Scythian vs griffin on a Greek vase Proteceratops skeletons are often found disarticulated. Unconnected to the skull, the plates of the head shield could be misinterpreted as wings. The griffin (Greek: Œ≥œÅœçœÜœâŒΩ, gr√Ωph≈çn), a legendary creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle,There are depictions of wingless and even crested griffins. is a common heraldic theme of Central Asia. According to modern theory, the griffin was an ancient misconception derived from fossilized remains of the Protoceratops found in conjunction with gold mining in the mountains of Scythia, present day eastern Kazakhstan.Adrienne Mayor, Archeology Magazine, Nov-Dec 1994, pp. 53-59.Dougal Dixon, The Pocket Book of Dinosaurs: An Illustrated Guide to the Dinosaur Kingdom, Salamander Company, 2004, p 133Peter Gwynn-Jones, The art of heraldry: origins, symbols and designs, Barnes and Noble, 1998, p 61 According to Mayor and Dodson the association of the Dzungarian Gate with gold and griffin (Protoceratops) skeletons spanned a thousand years of classical history:(See also map, p. 28) Adrienne Mayor, Peter Dodson, The first fossil hunters: paleontology in Greek and Roman times, Princeton University Press, 2001, pp. 27‚Äì28 > The second-century A.D.

According to Homeric fable, he begat, with the mares of Erichthonius, 12 horses of extraordinary fleetness. [\\"Boreas\\" New international Encyclopedia, Volume 3, Dodd, Mead, 1914] Buran Ildik√≥ Lehtinen writes that \\"the story of the cave of the stormwinds somewhere near the Dzungarian Gate\\" has been known for 2500 years, by travelers from Aristeas in the classic era, to Giovanni di Piano Carpini in the Middle Ages (before Marco Polo), and to Gustaf John Ramstedt in the 20th Century.Ildik√≥ Lehtinen, Traces of the Central Asian culture in the North: Finnish-Soviet Joint Scientific Symposium held in Hanasaari, Espoo, 14‚Äì21 January 1985, Suomalais- ugrilainen Seura, 1986, p 180 Carruthers reports the story of the buran, a ferocious winter wind said to sally from a hole in the side of a mountain: > We had frequently heard of the terrors, dangers, and winds of the Dzungarian > Gate. . . .

Boreas Boreas (, ) was the Greek god of the cold north wind and the bringer of winter. (Mallory and Adams speculate that the name may derive from a Proto-Indo-European root *gworh- meaning mountain.The Oxford introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World, J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Oxford University Press, 2006 p121) Boreas is depicted as being very strong, with a violent temper to match. He was frequently shown as a winged old man with shaggy hair and beard, holding a conch shell and wearing a billowing cloak. Pausanias wrote that Boreas had snakes instead of feet, though in art he was usually depicted with winged human feet. Closely associated with horses (native to the Eurasian steppe; see Przewalski's Horse, also known as the Dzungarian Horse), Boreas was said to have fathered twelve colts after taking the form of a stallion, to the mares of Erichthonius, king of Troy. Pliny (Natural History iv.35 and viii.67) thought that mares might stand with their hindquarters to the North Wind, and bear foals without a stallion. Przwalski's mares are noted for turning their hindquarters to strong winds.\\"In high wind, takhi \\"turn tail\\" and tuck their tails tightly between the back legs\\" Model Horse Reference: The Takhi (Przewalski's Horse, Asiatic Wild Horse) Equus ferus przewalkskii by Melissa Gaulding http://www.mhref.com/breeds/takhi/ The Greeks believed that Boreas's home was in Thrace, and Herodotus and Pliny both describe a northern land known as Hyperborea (\\"Beyond the North Wind\\"), where people lived in complete happiness and had extraordinarily long lifespans.

It is a \\"hospital within a hospital,\\" being situated within the University of Alberta Hospital and co-located with Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute in the Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The hospital, which was run by Capital Health before being merged in 2008 into Alberta Health Services, is named for Bob and Shirley Stollery who provided the original donation that went to help with the creation of the hospital. History The Northern Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation was created in 1978 with the intention of having a specific children's hospital built in Edmonton. The foundation was a backer of the Child Health program and in 1992, the name was changed to Children's Health Foundation of Northern Alberta to better show their support. Later, after the hospital opened, the name was changed to the current \\"Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation\\". Around 1989, after consultations with pediatricians and other interested residents of Edmonton, Bob and Shirley Stollery gave the donation that kicked off the campaign to build a state of the art hospital. The campaign, which was run by the foundation, was successful in raising over $10 million. At the time, it was recognised that a free standing hospital would not be economically viable, requiring, in addition to construction costs, a large maintenance and operations budget. It was decided that the hospital would be built within the grounds of the University of Alberta's Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre and co-exist with the University of Alberta Hospital. Originally known as the Stollery Children‚Äôs Health Centre, the name was later changed to the Stollery Children's Hospital to reinforce the fact that it is completely separate and independent of the University of Alberta Hospital. In February 2001, doctors at the Stollery were able to successfully revive Erika Nordby, a 13-month-old child that was hypothermic. Nordby had wandered outside, where the temperature was about , wearing only a diaper, and collapsed in a snow bank. When the girl was found, sometime after 3 am, her body temperature was and she had no pulse. Paramedics were called but could not revive her while transporting her to the hospital. After about 90 minutes, doctors were able to get her heart operating again; in total, she had spent about two hours clinically dead.Frozen toddler's recovery a 'miracle': doctors Services The hospital is noted as a \\"centre for specialized pediatric services\\", as well as being the \\"referral centre for pediatric cardiac surgery in Western Canada and for organ transplants. The hospital contains a neonatal intensive care unit,Neonatal Intensive Care Unit a pediatric intensive care unit with an Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) program,Pediatric Intensive Care Unit a Pediatric Thrombosis Program and multiple other clinics geared towards children. Biomedical engineers at the hospital developed the Sub-Arctic Intelligent Neonatal Transport Incubator (SAINT). This is a neonatal incubator designed to operate in temperatures below freezing where other incubators are unsuitable. It is used throughout Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.David Schiff NICU - Stollery Children's Hospital Site The hospital is part of the Canadian Neonatal Network, an organization composed of neonatologists and neonatal health professionals from across Canada. A walkway in Stollery Children's Hospital The Stollery was the first hospital in Western Canada to have the ECMO device, a pediatric thrombosis program, replace a valve in a child's heart without having to undergo surgery and perform pediatric surgery to do an intestinal transplant. The Stollery was the first hospital in Canada to perform open heart surgery and deliver a baby at the same time, and the first to perform the first pediatric auto-islet transplant. It is the site of Canada's Pediatric Centre for Weight and Health. It is also a major North American referral centre for the ventricular assist device known as the Berlin Heart.Champions of the Stollery ‚Äì A Donor Recognition Event The board is made up of a president and CEO, Mike House, chair, Marshall Sadd, vice-chair, Richard Kirby, fifteen members of the board of trustees, including Ray Muzyka, an investor, entrepreneur, physician and co-founder of BioWare and four ex- officio members. Fundraising The Stollery is a member of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, an international nonprofit organization that raises funds for children's hospitals, medical research and community awareness of children's health issues. They also raise money by holding community and foundation events along with suggested donation ideas. Some notable fundraising includes the village of Waskatenau with their softball marathons. In 2012, Curtis Hargrove of Cold Lake, Alberta started a run across Canada from Newfoundland to British Columbia with the goal of raising $1 million for the hospital.Run Curtis Run ‚Äì Story of a Small Town Boy Who Conquered Canada for Cancer CFMG-FM, 1049 Virgin Radio, has broadcast live from the hospital.

He is particularly known for his three volumes on the operas of Giuseppe Verdi (published in 1973, 1978, and 1981), a single-volume biography in 1982 and a single-volume work on Giacomo Puccini and his operas in 2002. He is also the author of numerous entries in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Personal life His parents were the then professor of architecture at Liverpool University, Lionel Budden, and a poet, writer and journalist Maud, (n√©e Fraser) who from 1938 until 1964 provided the rhymes for the strip Curly Wee and Gussie Goose, which was syndicated in newspapers throughout the world. Neither of his parents was especially musical and were not interested in what little opera was available locally. His operatic awakening occurred at school when a touring company with piano accompaniment and spoken recitatives performed The Marriage of Figaro.Budden, J., \\"I can't live without ...Le nozze di Figaro\\", Opera (London), November 2000, Vol. 51 No. 11, p. 1392.

He completed his BA in 1948 and then studied piano (with Thornton Lofthouse) and bassoon (with Archie Camden) at the Royal College of Music. Career From 1951 until 1983 Budden worked for the BBC, progressing from junior posts to become a producer, then Chief Producer of Opera (1970‚Äì76) and External Services Music Organizer (1976‚Äì83). This time saw many little- known works produced and important revivals, including the original versions of Macbeth, La forza del destino and Simon Boccanegra and the full French version of Don Carlos. He also produced programmes for others, and was meticulous in checking scripts and encouraging contributions. Concurrently Budden pursued a career as a writer, starting with the BBC publication, The Listener. Then came his major study of Verdi, built on the foundation of \\"patient archival research, practical musicianship, a sense of history and wide cultural sympathies\\", with every opera covered by a detailed discussion of the literary background, compositional process, and the music as part of the drama. The books were \\"free from obscure technical analysis or deconstructionist jargon\\". His writing style was \\"generous to past scholars... generous to his readers. [His prose was] full of wit and relaxed communication\\". Budden was considered a key person in securing the reputation of Verdi during the second half of the twentieth century.Obituary ‚Äì Julian Budden, The Times, 13 March 2007.

She represented District 36 (formerly District 11) in the Oregon House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013, and served as the majority leader from 2008-2010. She ran unsuccessfully for the Portland City Council in 2012. Personal life and education Mary Nolan was born in Chicago, Illinois. She is married to Mark Gardiner; they have one daughter. Nolan was in the first class of women admitted into Dartmouth College, from which she graduated magna cum laude in mathematics. Following her departure from elected politics, Nolan was a finalist for a position with Planned Parenthood, and was then hired in 2013 as a vice president at FamilyCare, a Medicare and Medicaid managed-care provider in Portland. Political career Nolan was first elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 2000. Upon winning her second term in 2002, she was named the assistant Democratic leadership. Before the 2009 legislative session, Dave Hunt, the then-majority leader, was elected speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. The Democratic Caucus then elected Nolan as the new majority leader. She was the House Majority Leader in the Oregon House of Representatives from November 2008 until November 2010. In November 2010, the House Democratic Caucus did not re-elect Nolan to any leadership position. According to The Oregonian, as of 2010 Nolan voted with Democrats 96.77% of the time, and had a 1.08% absence record. After Nolan voted \\"no\\" on House Bill 2001, which would have increased transportation taxes by $300 million a year in 2009, The Oregonian reported that the move could mean that she may be planning to run for another public office like Mayor of Portland or City Council because of what it meant for environmentalists who had opposed the transportation bill. Nolan ran for a seat on the Portland City Council in the May 2012, challenging incumbent commissioner Amanda Fritz.

He was a member of the Oregon House of Representatives, representing District 27 from 2007‚Äì2017, which comprises parts of Beaverton, southwest Portland, and unincorporated Multnomah and Washington Counties. He served as Speaker Pro Tempore, and was formerly the Democratic Majority Whip. In 2016, Read ran for Oregon State Treasurer, to succeed State Treasurer Ted Wheeler, who was barred from running in 2016 by term limits. Read won the general election on November 8, 2016 and became the State Treasurer in January 2017. Early life and education Read was born in 1975 in Missoula, Montana. After attending high school in Idaho, he moved to Oregon where he attended Willamette University, where he graduated in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in politics and economics. In 2003, he earned an MBA from the University of Washington in Seattle. He and his wife, Heidi Eggert, have two children, Annika, and Ellis.Inaugural Address, Tobias Read, January 6, 2017. Retrieved 23 February 2016. Career In 1997, he started working for Nike, Inc. in footwear development, where he remained until 2012. He also worked for the United States Department of the Treasury as an aide to then- Secretary Lawrence Summers from 1999 to 2001. His immediate supervisor was Sheryl Sandberg. Tobias Read served in the Oregon State Legislature from 2007 - 2016 as the Representative from the 27th district. As a Legislator, Read was a strong advocate for fully funding Oregon‚Äôs full-day kindergarten; supported state investments in green tech jobs and research through Oregon Inc and other initiatives ; worked to stabilize state funding and enhance the state‚Äôs Rainy Day funds; and sponsored legislation to redirect unclaimed funds from class action lawsuits to legal assistance for low income Oregonians; , rather than back to the original corporate wrongdoers. Throughout his legislative career, he sought to expand savings in Oregon‚Äôs college savings program, and sponsored legislation to create additional options for retirement savings for Oregonians. During his time in the Oregon House, Read served as House Majority Whip, and in 2015 he was elected Speaker Pro Tempore. He served as chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Economic Development and the House Committee on Higher Education, Innovation, and Workforce Development. He also served on the House Revenue Committee and the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, the primary budget writing body for the Legislature. =State Treasurer= In 2016, Read ran for Oregon State Treasurer, to succeed Ted Wheeler, who was barred by term limits from running again in 2016. He was unopposed in the primary and won the general election by a plurality on November 2016, defeating Republican Jeff Gudman and became the State Treasurer in January 2017. Since the 2019 death Secretary of State Dennis Richardson, Read has been first in the line of succession for the office of Governor. As Oregon does not have a lieutenant governor position, the Secretary of State is normally the first to succeed the governor in the event of a vacancy. Hovever, as Richardson's successor Bev Clarno is an appointee, she is ineligible to become Governor, making Read first in the line of succession.https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/07/some-oregon-republicans- are-having-regrets-about-effort-to-recall-gov-kate-brown.html  First State Retirement Savings Plan  In 2015, in an effort led by Read and organizations like SEIU and AARP, the Oregon Legislature enacted legislation which created the Oregon Retirement Savings Board and tasked it with establishing a state run retirement savings program and managing its oversight. The retirement program created was called OregonSaves. This is a first of its kind program to help individuals who do not have access to retirement plans through their employer save for retirement. OregonSaves is an opt out automatic enrollment retirement plan for employees who don‚Äôt have access to retirement plans through their employer. The plan includes an automatic annual contribution escalation to encourage increased savings. The program began its rollout with a pilot program in July 2017 and began its full roll out, starting with the largest employers, in late 2017. Since the roll out close to 100,000 Oregonians have joined OregonSaves with half of the accounts already funded. Oregonians have saved more than $30 million so far, the total savings increases by around $3 million each month. In 2019, Treasurer Read worked closely with the business community to establish guidelines for employers to ensure full participation in OregonSaves. This legislation ensures an even playing field for all employers and employees. Oregon is a leader on state led retirement savings plans with other states closely following Oregon to establish their own plans. In 2018, Finance industry publication Pensions & Investments and the Defined Contribution Institutional Investment Association (DCIIA) honored Read and OregonSaves with the Excellence & Innovation Award. The award recognizes public and private- sector efforts to enhance retirement security. In 2019 Treasurer Read was invited to speak to the United States Senate Finance Committee on the states innovative approach to retirement savings. Oregon College Savings Plan As Treasurer, Tobias Read oversees the Oregon College Savings Program (OCSP) which helps tens-of-thousands of Oregonians save for education after high school. The OCSP is a state sponsored 529 program with additional tax advantages. In the 20 years the Oregon College Savings program has been in existence, Oregon families have saved more than $2 billion towards their education and their kids education. Recognizing how important it is for families to have the ability to save for college, Treasurer Read worked with the Oregon State Legislature to pass the Education Savings Credit which changes the tax advantage from a deduction to a refundable credit. Rolling out in 2020, the Education Savings Credit will make it easier for low-to-moderate income families save for education after high school. The Treasurer worked with a diverse group of organizations including the Latina Network, Stand for Children and the Oregon Student Association and legislators to pass the Education Savings Credit.

Veruela Abbey (, or \\"The Royal Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Veruela\\") is a Cistercian abbey dating from the 12th century. It is situated near Vera de Moncayo, in Zaragoza province, Spain. It was founded in 1146 by Pedro de Atar√©s. History The monastery and church, forming one edifice, were founded in 1146 by Pedro de Atar√©s, to whom the Blessed Virgin appeared, and whom she directed in the discovery of a hidden statue of herself. The statue was placed in the monastery chapel, where it is still venerated. Pedro de Atar√©s did not live to see the completion of the buildings, whose construction took more than twenty years, but before his death he was enrolled among the Cistercians, who were dwelling in the partly finished abbey. The most famous abbots of Veruela were Hernando de Arag√≥n (1498‚Äì1577) and Lope Marco (died 1560). He was succeeded by Lope Marco who, as his epitaph tells us, raised the monastery \\"ex terreo marmoreum, ex augusto amplum\\". The chapter house at the southern side of the cloister (an exact representation of the Westminster Abbey cloister) is Byzantine. The great buildings, including church, monastery, house, and cloister, constructed at different times and in different styles, are surrounded by a wall that dates back to feudal times. Antonio Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, styled by Men√©ndez y Pelayo \\"one of the most remarkable cultivators of medical moral studies\\" (Ciencia espanola, III, 440), lived at Veruela and died within its walls in 1777. Gustavo Becquer, the Spanish poet, made Veruela his abode while the religious were prevented from living there. Abbey church, west front and tower From 1835 to 1877 the buildings were in the hands of secular clergy. From that date they were occupied by Jesuits. Assisted by the duchess of Villahermosa, they restored the church and monastery. Of the Jesuits who lived at Veruela, Padre Costa was theologian to the First Vatican Council; Llu√≠s Ignasi Fiter revived the \\"Congregaciones Marianas\\" in Spain; Antonio Rota, later secretary of the Society of Jesus, was the rector of Veruela when in 1888 the image of the Blessed Virgin was solemnly crowned.

A structure on the site is first mentioned in 1319, under the name Wintenaw. By the 16th century, it had grown into a fortified and moated renaissance manor. It passed through the hands of numerous owners, including the noble families of Herberstein, Khiessl, Auersperg, Ursini- Rosenberg, Szekely, Brandis in von der Dur. During their tenure, the counts Herberstein transformed it into a Protestant way-station, complete with chapel and cemetery. In 1863, Betnava became the summer residence of the bishops of Maribor and Lavant, having already been leased by the see for several decades. Dvorec Betnava In 1784, the mansion was rebuilt in late-baroque Florentine style, after the fashion of Vienna at the time. The west wing contains a chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross, while other notable features include a carved staircase leading to the main hall, itself decorated with late-baroque trompe l'oeil ceiling frescoes painted by an unknown artist c. 1780.

It is the sixth and last book of the Wess'Har Series. It was nominated for the 2009 Philip K. Dick Award. Plot summary The novel covers the arrival of the Eqbas Vorhi task force to start Earth's environmental restoration, with Shan Frankland, the Royal Marines squad, and Aras joining them. Australia agrees to host the eqbas, resulting in near war with other countries until the eqbas show their teeth. Shan's personal history as a police officer who covered up for eco- terrorists catches up with her, resulting in the death of one of the marines. Unknown to anyone else, eqbas commander Esganikan Gai has had herself inoculated with c'naatat, which almost results in disaster for the mission. Esganikan's successor sends the other c'naatat hosts back to Cavanagh's Star to end the risk of spreading it on Earth. Journalist Eddie Michallat has elected to stay on Wess'ej to watch the wess'har matriarch Nevyan's stepdaughter Giyadas grow up because he too regards her as a surrogate daughter, and also to report on the ecological renaissance of the isenj homeworld Umeh as a role model for Earth. Because of the distance involved, Shan, Ade, and Aras return just in time to say goodbye before Eddie dies of old age. Meanwhile, eqbas biologist Da Shapakti has solved the problem of how to remove c'naatat from wess'har tissue as well (curing humans was solved previously). Shapakti and captured EU spy Mohan Rayat flee back to Wess'ej to prevent the eqbas leadership exploiting c'naatat to create immortal super- soldiers as the earlier Wess'har and Esganikan intended. Disgraced Marines officer Lindsay Neville has been trying to atone for her unintentional genocide by caring for the surviving bezeri for decades, to the point where she can no longer take human form; nevertheless she too finally agrees to be cured of c'naatat and become human again. Shapakti's cure also means that Shan's m√©nage √† trois has to decide whether they will remain together, or let Aras go to fulfil his longing for life as a normal wess'har after centuries of loneliness.

Hans was revising his popular astronomy book The Stars: A New Way to See Them and needed a place away from the glare of city lights to do observation. Waterville Valley, an \\"inland island\\" surrounded by hundreds of acres of national forest, was the perfect location for stargazing and the many outdoor activities the Reys loved. They spent the next twenty summers there, and wrote several Curious George stories while in Waterville Valley. The Reys‚Äô cottage soon became an intellectual center for the town, hosting book clubs, discussion groups, and the opportunity to watch a children's author at work. Hans was known for his chalk talks, in which he would entertain visitors as he drew. Well-behaved children got to take a drawing home with them. At other times, he would take local children on nature walks, which often included conversations with imaginary people, thanks to his ability to throw his voice. After the Reys died, the cottage was donated to the town of Waterville Valley. It is now managed by the Margret and H.A. Rey Center, dedicated to providing educational and recreational programs for children and families, including nature walks, literary groups, writers workshops, discussion clubs, a monthly lecture series, art shows, and activities for children.

With the development of the Park in 1984-1985 approximately five million tonnes of waste was moved in the creation of the business park, the largest civil engineering contract involving landfill transfer in Europe. =Toponymy= Broad & Company's 1912 circular renaming the hamlet of Starveall (Starvhall) to Stockley Stockley Park takes its name from the former hamlet of Stockley. 'Stockley' is believed to be a portmanteau word derived from Cowley stock, the type of locally produced brick. The hamlet of Stockley came into being with the renaming of the hamlet of Starveall (or Starvhall) in 1912. Starveall was located in the ancient parish of Hillingdon, lying south of the Grand Junction Canal and Great Western Railway. The name is a common and possibly humorous description in central southern England for land of poor fertility - (Starve all). By the middle of the 19th century a significant brickfield has been established to the west of Starveall farm. A 2,000ft arm known as Starveall dock (and also as Pocock's or Broad‚Äôs dock) was cut from the Grand Junction Canal to service the brickfield. In 1872 it was extended south of the farm into the Parish of West Drayton. In 1884 the leaseholder of Starveall, Samuel Pocock conveyed his interests to Clement Burgess Broad and George Harris, of South Wharf, Paddington. The hamlet of Starveall continued to grow. However by 1911 its descriptive name must have been of concern to its inhabitants as on 1 January 1912 Broad & Co issued a circular stating the following: The Directors of Broad and Co., Ltd beg to inform you that in response to the general desire of their tenantry, and others concerned at Starvhall, West Drayton, to have a ‚Äòmore suitable designation of the place and works than that of ‚ÄúStarvhall and ‚ÄúStarvhall Brickfields,‚Äù they have decided, as from this date, to re-name the place ‚ÄúStockley‚Äù and the works to be known as ‚ÄúStockley Works.\\" Starveall was located within the Yiewsley Urban District and Broad & Co unilateral renaming of Starveall caused some disquiet at the Council meeting on Tuesday 9 January 1912. It was pointed out that Broad & Co had thought that they could rename Starveall without sanction and afterwards had realised their mistake and had written to the council asking them to pass a resolution confirming their action. Council member Mr J.A. Holland stated ‚ÄòIt is entirely out of order: they ought first to have applied to this Council.‚Äô However there was general agreement with the name change. Vice-Chairman of the council Mr T. Hancock stated ‚Äòhe saw no reason why the name should not be altered. Starveall was not a correct name, for nobody had been starved there.‚Äô (Laughter) Starveall was subsequently expunged, with Starveall Road, Starveall Farm, Starveall School, Starveall Church Mission hall, Starveall Football Club, Starveall Dock, and Starveall Brickworks all being renamed Stockley. The only reference to Starveall today lies on the canal network managed by the Canal & River Trust. The Grand Union Canal Bridge 195 is still known as Starveall Bridge.

Built around the turn of the 20th century, it is one of only three surviving carousels out of about 68 built by Abilene's Charles W. Parker Carousel Company, and it is the only remains of the company in Abilene today. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. and It is now a feature of the Dickinson County Heritage Center, a local history museum. Description and history The Parker Carousel is located in southeastern Abilene, on the grounds of the Dickinson County Heritage Center, just east of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home on South Campbell Street. It is housed in a roughly octagonal single-story wood frame structure, with an attached extension. The carousel consists of a circular wooden platform, whose outer portion has wheels that ride on a track set on the ground. The platform is fitted with 24 horses and four chariots. The horses are mounted in metal frames that impart a rocking motion when the carousel is in operation. The structure has no top of its own, as it was originally intended to be placed under a tent. The carousel is rotated via either an electric motor, or a period steam engine modified to meet modern safety standards. The power source is located in the extension, and is connected to the carousel by cabling. The carousel was built sometime between 1898 and 1901 by the Charles W. Parker Carousel Company of Abilene. The company manufactured about 68 carousels, of which this is one of only three to survive, and is now the only surviving reminder of the company's presence in the community. Parker's carousels were renowned for their particularly graceful carved horses. This carousel was part of a traveling show Parker operated, and was purchased from that show by a mechanic in Lander, Wyoming in 1928. There it was set up for annual Fourth of July celebrations. In 1959 it was purchased by the operated of a drive-in theater in Riverton, Wyoming, where it was operated until his death. His widow wanted to keep the machine intact, and a transfer of the carousel to the Dickinson County Historical Society was mediated by the Smithsonian Institution in 1976.

Souther, Linda Ronstadt, and Jackson Browne, with whom he was once in a band. Ned Doheny now lives in Silverlake, California. Career One of his earliest compositions, \\"On and On,\\" was recorded by Dave Mason in 1971. Doheny, Mason and Cass Elliott were in a trio for a time. Doheny was the first artist signed to David Geffen's Asylum label, which produced his first album Ned Doheny in 1972. His label mates included Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, David Blue and other West Coast musicians of the day. Doheny toured multiple times with a band made up of several studio musicians. His second album Hard Candy was released by CBS in 1976. It included the composition \\"A Love of Your Own,\\" which was covered by the Average White Band. Chaka Khan also had a hit with a Doheny composition, \\"What Cha' Gonna Do For Me.\\" Other Doheny songs such as \\"I've Got Your Number\\", \\"Get It Up For Love\\" and \\"To Prove My Love\\" have all charted in the US as well as the UK and Japan. His third CBS album Prone was recorded in 1977. Doheny's next album, Life After Romance, was released in Japan in 1988 due to his popularity there. Between April 1990 and September 1993 he hosted a radio program called \\"Postcards from Hollywood\\" on Yokohama FM. His next studio album, Between Two Worlds, was released in 1993. Though often categorized as a West Coast artist because of his Los Angeles roots and association with other West Coast artists, Doheny's music defies exact categorization, being variously described as pop, funk, jazz and AOR. He has been compared to Steely Dan and the Eagles. In addition to original CD releases in Japan, both Hard Candy and Prone, produced by guitarist Steve Cropper, have been reissued as LP-replica CDs. All three albums are currently available as digital downloads online. In 1978, the British singer Elkie Brooks recorded \\"Learn to Love\\", written by Doheny, for her album, Shooting Star. In 2014, the London-based reissue record label Be With Records, began an extensive vinyl-only reissue series of Doheny's albums. Hard Candy came first in September 2014 and in April 2015 they reissued the Japan-only Prone. The release was promoted via a tour of the UK and Europe.

It represented a continuation of the Red Sea Rift until break-up occurred in the middle Miocene, with most of the displacement on the newly developed Red Sea spreading centre being accommodated by the Dead Sea Transform. During its brief post-rift history, the deepest part of the remnant rift topography has been filled by the sea, creating the Gulf of Suez. North of the Gulf of Suez the rift becomes indistinct and its exact geometry uncertain, linking eventually to the Manzala rift beneath the Nile delta. Plate tectonic setting The formation of the Red Sea ‚Äì Gulf of Suez rift system was caused by the anticlockwise rotation of the Arabian Plate with respect to the African Plate. This model is consistent with near orthogonal rifting along the entire length of the rift system. Alternative models that suggest initiation by strike-slip faulting and pull-apart basin development along the axis of the rift have not been supported by detailed studies of the rift geometry. Towards the end of the Miocene, the Arabian Plate began to collide with the Eurasian Plate leading to changes in the plate configuration, the development of the Dead Sea Transform and cessation in rifting in the Gulf of Suez. Stratigraphy 340px =Basement= The basement consists of Precambrian rocks of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Gneisses, volcanics and metasediments are intruded by granites, granodiorites and a suite of dolerite dykes. These rocks contain shear zones, such as the Rehba Shear Zone of western Sinai, that are interpreted to have partly controlled the orientation and location of rift structures. =Palaeozoic= Cambrian rocks of Araba and Naqus Formations occur throughout the region above a planar unconformity, a result of peneplaination. These red and white sandstone units have a combined thickness of about 500 m. They were deposited in a continental environment except in the northeastern part of the gulf where they become marine. The next preserved sequence is the Umm Bogma or Abu Durba Formations of lower Carboniferous age, which sit apparently conformably on the Cambrian, although the base represents a hiatus of about 150 Ma. The Umm Bogma Formation is dolomitic, while the stratigraphically equivalent Abur Durba Formation consists of black shales and mudstones. These sequences then pass up into the sandstones of the Abu Thora Formation. In the northern Gulf, at Wadi Araba, the early Carboniferous is overlain by upper Carboniferous of the Rod e Hamal, Abu Darag and Ahmeir Formations. In the southern Gulf the Carboniferous strata are capped by Permian volcanics. =Mesozoic= The Qiseib Formation is found throughout the Gulf varying in thickness between 8 m and 300 m. It is thought to be mainly Triassic in age, although it is considered to include Permian strata near its base near Wadi Araba. The Qiseib Formation consists of sandstones, conglomeratic at the base with an overall fining upward trend. The Qiseib Formation is overlain by the sandstones of the Malha Formation of upper Jurassic to lower Cretaceous age. These sandstones are up to 400 m in thickness, form an important reservoir in the Gulf of Suez and are known informally as the 'Nubian' sandstone. The upper Cretaceous sequence consists of shallow marine deposits that generally thicken northwards. The Cenomanian Raha Formation, a sequence of interbedded shales limestones and sandstone, is succeeded by limestones of the Turonian Wata Formation. This is overlain by sandstones and shales of the Coniacian-Santonian age Matullah Formation. The central and northern parts of the gulf were locally affected by a phase of inversion at the end of the Santonian. Structures such as Wadi Araba became uplifted at this time giving rise to folding and local erosion of pre- Campanian strata. The Campanian Duwi Formation, known as the Brown Limestone, was deposited throughout the gulf apart from the uplifted area of the North Galala plateau and Wadi Araba where it is replaced by chalk of the Thelmet Formation. These pass up into Sudr Formation chalks of Maastrichtian age. On the southern margin of the uplifted Wadi Araba, a carbonate ramp sequence was formed during the Campanian/Maastrichtian, continuing into the Paleogene. =Cenozoic= Rocks of Paleocene age are represented by the Esna Shale Formation which overlies the Sudr Formation. This is succeeded by Eocene age limestones of either the Thebes or Waseiyit Formations. Together with the middle to late Eocene Mokattam Formation this sequence reaches a combined maximum thickness of 500 m. These limestones are followed by continental to locally shallow marine red sandstones of the Tayiba Formation, which represent the last of the pre-rift deposits. The continental sandstones and siltstones of the Abu Zenima Formation represent the earliest syn-rift deposits of late Oligocene (Chattian) to early Miocene (Aquitanian) age. Locally the Abu Zenima Formation is capped by basalts. The lower Miocene age conglomerates, sandstones and marls of the Nukhul Formation were deposited in shallow marine conditions as the sea began to flood the developing rift. The Nukhul Formation overlies the Abu Zenima Formation in some place but elsewhere is probably age equivalent, reflecting a diachronous change to marine conditions within the rift. The deepening of the rift is recorded by the lower Miocene Rudeis Formation. The lower part, consisting of marls and sandstones, is overlain by coarse sandstones and conglomerates reflecting a rapid increase in rift topography at that time. The Kareem Formation saw the first development of evaporites, indicating basin restriction, followed by open marine shales, as coarse clastic deposition began to reduce in the middle Miocene. Shales, anhydrite, halite and reefal limestones of the uppermost middle Miocene Belayim lie unconformably on the Kareem. More restricted basin conditions continued with the upper Miocene South Gharib and Zeit Formations with deposition of halite with some anhydrite and mudstone, representing the last syn-rift deposits. The Pliocene‚ÄìRecent postrift sequence reaches up to 2000 m in thickness in the southern part of the rift and is formed of interbedded sandstones, limestones and evaporites. History Generalised structural cross-section through the Gulf of Suez, just south of the Morgan Accommodation Zone. PZ-LK = Paleozoic to lower Cretaceous Nubia (reservoir rock); UK-EO = Upper Cretaceous to Eocene pre-rift carbonate (source rock); N, R, K, and B = syn- and post-rift Nukhul, Rudeis, Kareem and Belayim formation (sources, reservoirs, seals and overburden); SG = South Gharib salt (seal and overburden); Z=Zeit (seals and overburden); and PP = Plio-Pleistocene (overburden) =Pre-rift= During the Late Cretaceous to Eocene, the area now occupied by the rift was a shallow sea depositing carbonates. This period was mainly quiet tectonically but the northern part of the gulf region was affected by periodic far-field effects of the Alpine orogeny. A series of WSW- ENE trending extensional basins were inverted, creating isolated uplifted and folded areas known as 'Syrian arc' structures. These structures were mainly active during the Late Santonian but there is evidence of further movements on the same structures at the end of the Cretaceous and during the Paleogene. =Rifting= Rifting began along the whole of the Red Sea -Gulf of Suez rift system during the Late Oligocene. In the Gulf of Suez rift, the rifting culminated during the Burdigalian stage (late Early Miocene) (ca. 18 Ma). In the Middle Miocene break-up occurred along the whole length of the Red Sea rift with seafloor spreading beginning in the Late Miocene. This break-up was associated with a gradual reduction in the rate of rifting along the Gulf of Suez with most activity stopping by the beginning of the Pliocene. =Post- rift= Since the end of the Miocene the area of the Gulf of Suez rift has begun to experience post-rift thermal subsidence accompanied by flooding of the topographically lowest parts of the rift. Geometry Structural map of the Gulf of Suez rift The Gulf of Suez rift is strongly segmented along its length with half-grabens of alternating polarity. The changes in fault polarity and position from segment to segment are taken up by broad accommodation zones. =Zaafarana accommodation zone= This zone, also known as the Galala-Abu Zenima Accommodation Zone, marks a change in fault polarity from NE-dipping in the Darag Basin to the north to SE-dipping to the south in the Belayim province. It coincides with the location of the Cretaceous inversion structure, the Wadi Araba anticline. It has been suggested that the presence of this structure acted as a barrier to northward propagation of the rift. Its location may also be partly controlled by the Rehba Shear Zone in the underlying basement. =Morgan accommodation zone= The Morgan accommodation zone marks a switch in fault polarity from NE-dipping to the north to SW-dipping to the south in the Amal-Zeit province. It also coincides with a marked southward widening of the rift zone. There is no earlier structure known that influenced the location of this accommodation zone. Economic importance More than 120 hydrocarbon fields and discoveries have been reported from the Gulf of Suez rift with a variety of petroleum plays. =Source rocks= The main source rock in the Gulf of Suez is the Campanian age Brown Limestone or Duwi Member of the Sudr Formation. This unit is typically 25‚Äì70 m thick and is distributed from the southern end of the gulf as far north as Wadi Araba. It contains mainly type II kerogen and has an average Total organic carbon content (TOC) of 2.6 wt% with some samples measuring up to 21 wt%. In the southern part of the gulf, the Miocene source intervals become important as higher geothermal gradients cause parts of the syn-rift sequence to reach maturity. Marine shale of the middle Miocene Magna Formation is the most important of these younger source rocks with a TOC ranging from 1‚Äì2 wt %. =Reservoir rocks= The best quality reservoir in the Gulf of Suez is the mainly Lower Cretaceous Malha Formation, sometimes known as the 'Nubia' or 'Nubian A'. This pre-rift sequence is present throughout the gulf, and has porosities in the range 13‚Äì29 % with permeabilities varying from 70‚Äì400 md. =Main plays= The dominant play type in the Gulf of Suez is tilted fault blocks with pre-rift Early Cretaceous sands sealed by syn-rift sequences and source from the Duwi limestone. Additional discoveries have been made in a wide range of structural, stratigraphic and combined play types. =Importance as a rift basin analogue= The Gulf of Suez rift has been intensively studied by academic groups and by companies as analogue for rift basins in general. This is due to the generally good exposure within the onshore part of the rift coupled with the availability of hydrocarbon exploration wells and seismic reflection datasets within the gulf itself.

The black height is Shockley-Queisser limit for the maximum energy that can be extracted as useful electrical power in a conventional solar cell. However, a multiple-exciton- generation solar cell can also use some of the energy in the green area (and to a lesser extent the blue area), rather than wasting it as heat. Therefore it can theoretically exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit. In solar cell research, carrier multiplication is the phenomenon wherein the absorption of a single photon leads to the excitation of multiple electrons from the valence band to conduction band. In the theory of a conventional solar cell, each photon is only able to excite one electron across the band gap of the semiconductor, and any excess energy in that photon is dissipated as heat. In a material with carrier multiplication, high-energy photons excite on average more than one electron across the band gap, and so in principle the solar cell can produce more useful work. In quantum dot solar cells, the excited electron in the conduction band interacts with the hole it leaves behind in the valence band, and this composite uncharged object is known as an exciton. The carrier multiplication effect in a dot can be understood as creating multiple excitons, and is called multiple exciton generation (MEG). MEG may considerably increase the energy conversion efficiency of nanocrystal based solar cells, though extracting the energy may be difficult because of the short lifetimes of the multiexcitons. The quantum mechanical origin of MEG is still under debate and several possibilities have been suggested: *1) Impact ionization: light excites a high-energy exciton (X) which decays irreversibly into a quasi-continuum of multiexciton (multi-X) states available at this energy. The model requires only the density of states of multiexcitons being very high, while the Coulomb coupling between X and multi-X can be quite small. *2) Coherent superposition of single and multiexciton states: the very first suggested model but oversimplified (high density of states of multi-X is not taken into account). Light excites an X (which is not a true eigenstate of the system) which can then coherently convert to multi-X and back to X many times (quantum beats). This process requires Coulomb coupling between them to be much stronger than the decay rate via phonons (which is usually not the case). The excitation will finally decay via phonons to a lower energy X or multi-X, depending on which of the decays is faster. *3) Multiexciton formation through a virtual exciton state. Light directly excites the eigenstate of the system (in this case, a coherent mixture of X and multi-X). The term \\"virtual\\" relates here to a pure X, because it is not a true eigenstate of the system (same for model 2). All of the above models can be described by the same mathematical model (density matrix) which can behave differently depending on the set of initial parameters (coupling strength between the X and multi-X, density of states, decay rates). MEG was first observed in 2004 using colloidal PbSe quantum dots and later was found in quantum dots of other compositions including PbS, PbTe, CdS, CdSe, InAs, Si, and InP. Multiple exciton generation was first demonstrated in a functioning solar cell in 2011, also using colloidal PbSe quantum dots. Multiple exciton generation was also detected in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) upon absorption of single photons. For (6,5) SWNTs, absorption of single photons with energies corresponding to three times the SWNT energy gap results in an exciton generation efficiency of 130% per photon. The multiple exciton generation threshold in SWNTs can be close to the limit defined by energy conservation. Graphene, which is closely related to nanotubes, is another material in which multiple exciton generation has been observed. Double-exciton generation has additionally been observed in organic pentacene derivatives through singlet exciton fission with extremely high quantum efficiency.

Close-up of Hercules monument, Kassel The Hercules monument is an important landmark in the German city of Kassel. It is located in the Bergpark Wilhelmsh√∂he (Wilhelmsh√∂he Mountainpark) in northern Hesse, Germany. Hercules is a copper statue depicting the ancient Greek demigod Heracles (Gr. ŒóœÅŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒÆœÇ, German Herkules). The statue is located at the top of a Pyramid, which stands on top of the Octagon; the statue and the other parts of the monument were constructed at different times. Today \\"Hercules\\" refers not only to the statue, but the whole monument, including the Octagon and Pyramid. The monument is the highest point in the Wilhelmsh√∂he Bergpark. The monument is located in Bad Wilhelmsh√∂he, on the Eastern ridge of the Habichtswald. It was built in an artificial dell of the Karlsberg (526m above sea level) on the most western and at the same time highest location (515 m) of the line of sight Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he ‚Äì Hercules. On 23 June 2013 the Mountainpark and the Hercules were proclaimed as world heritage site during the UNESCO meeting in Phnom Penh. Building history Construction of the Bergpark began in 1696. The Hercules statue was built in the years 1701 to 1717 and is based on the design of the Italian Giovanni Francesco Guerniero. The entire complex is the northernmost part of the park and is an important baroque aspect of the Bergpark Wilhelmsh√∂he. It is 520 steps to the top. Water features Water running down the cascades, a coloured picture before 1903 For the first time the water features took place on 3 June 1714. Today during the summer (from May until October every Wednesday and Sunday afternoon) visitors can attend this event. Additionally, every first Saturday of the months of June, July, August and September this event takes place during the evening with lights of different colors illuminating the water, the fountain and the different monuments. Every time about 350.000 liters (92,000 gallons) of water are needed and visitors can follow the water's way starting from the Hercules monument and ending at the big lake of the castle Wilhelmsh√∂he. The water runs down the cascades, the Steinh√∂fer's waterfall, the devil's bridge, until it tumbles down the aqueduct before finally arriving at the lake of the castle where a fountain of about 50 meters ends the spectacle. The cascades are a 250m long stone structure that forms gigantic water stairs. This whole system relies on natural pressure from reservoirs and underground pipes whose locks are opened manually. This system has been in place for more than 300 years. Octagon and statue The Hercules monument has a total height of 70.5 meters. 32.65 meters are accounted for by the Octagon; 29.60 meters for the Pyramid and 8.25 meters for the Hercules statue itself. The height difference between top of the statue and the bottom of the cascades is 179 meters. Building material image:Herkules_mit_baugeruest.jpgRestructuring at the Hercules monument in autumn 2006 image:Herkules-KS-bauarbeiten-verhuellt.jpgJanuary 2007 ‚Äì Hercules still cloaked image:Hercules monument back view.jpgBack view of the statue in September 2011 The complete structure (Octagon and Cascades) are made of Tuff that was sourced from quarries nearby. This soft material has the advantage of a good workability but weathers quickly, particularly by frost- related erosion. This rapid weathering process has been a structural issue for the statue in its 300 years of existence. In late 2005 a complete restructuring process of the entire monument, including the Hercules statue, was initiated. Initially projected to be completed in 2009, the restoration of the statue and monuments has been estimated to cost more than 24 million Euro and will last through 2018.

The game provides a dual-era setting, alternating between London a few years in the future from the present day where the use of magic has been brought back to the world and a mythic age where dragons, giants, and other races fought against each other and against a mysterious enemy. History By 2004, the overall d20 industry had dramatically weakened and thus Fantasy Flight Games was now willing to release a non-d20 game: Fireborn (2004), by lead designer Rob Vaughn, assisted by Greg Benage. Setting The modern part of the game is set in London. In 2001 magic suddenly returned to the world, strange beasts straight out of myths appeared, and society still struggles to come to terms with the fact that from one day to the next the rules of life seemed to have changed. The players take the role of scions, ancient dragons reborn as humans who slowly but surely regain their memories of their former life by so-called flashbacks. These flashbacks take place in the mythic age, the second part of the game setting. This ancient setting is located in the area of the mediterranean sea and includes powerful civilisations like Atlantis, Kheheb (the predecessor of ancient Egypt), and the courts of the fae. The players (in the shape of dragons) interact with humans, fae, giants, and other creatures and fight against a mysterious enemy called Those who dwell below and the corruption of the world's magical energy (karma). Game mechanics Players characters have four aspects (Air, Earth, Fire, Water). For all skill tests a player rolls a number of six sided dice equal to the corresponding aspect score. Skills determine a character's ability to move dice from one aspect to another before making a test, allowing greater chance for success at the cost of temporarily lowering another of the character's aspect dice pools - representing focus and concentration being directed towards particular tasks, such as attacking with no regard for your own defence, or concentrating on a task while not paying attention to your surroundings Unique Features Fireborn has a number of (fairly) unique features: The dynamic attributes system, with its ability to \\"shift dice\\" allows players a much greater control over dice mechanics than usual for roleplaying games, adding tactical choices to dice rolling. The dual time-period play, where the game is played in both the modern age and a fantasy world, is not only unique, but allows the incorporation of many dramatic elements known from movies (flashbacks, foreshadowing, non-linear timeflow) into gaming. In addition, Fireborn solves two of the more serious player/character problems that plague most roleplaying groups, by incorporating them into the game. Fireborn characters are all telepathic - players will usually discuss game events around the table even if their characters are not within hearing distance of each other. Fireborn characters are also members of one \\"brood\\", a karmically linked group of dragons, which helps to reduce stress and conflict between player characters. Reception The game was reviewed with mostly positive results, though as one reviewer noted \\"The game isn‚Äôt without flaws.\\" The unique dice mechanics as well as the setting and dual-era play were given positive remarks, while the high number of errors in the rule books were the most common point of criticism, as well as the fact that due to its specific setting and nature, it will not satisfy all players. Current Fate Fireborn was discontinued by Fantasy Flight Games in 2006 (unconfirmed) due to financial issues with the company and a \\"focus on core games\\" (unconfirmed). The Fireborn community (see links) is still (2009) actively supporting and expanding the game with new legacies, powers, breeds, etc. The game books are still available in small quantities from the usual booksellers, as well as in electronic form (PDF files) for download from online sources such as DriveThruRPG. Novelization Fantasy Flight Games started publishing novels in the Fireborn universe in 2011. * Embers of Atlantis (Tracy Hickman, 2011) * Each Ember's Ghost (Steven Savile, 2012) * Ritual of Fire (Jordan Ellinger, 2012) References External links *Fantasy Flight Games *Fireborn Homepage *Fireborn Community Reviews: *http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10925.phtml *http://www.amazon.com/Fireborn-Handbook-Fantasy-Flight-Games/dp/1589941853 *http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?filters=0_0_0_10133&manufacturers;_id=6 Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Fantasy Flight Games games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2004 ","title":"Fireborn"},{"id":"16750987","text":"USS Naubuc may refer to: *, was a monitor during the American Civil War *, was a net laying ship in operation at the end of World War II Category:United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Naubuc"},{"id":"16751001","text":"Jagaddipendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur, K.C.I.E (15 December 1915 ‚Äì 11 April 1970) was Maharaja of Cooch-Behar, in India.

In the fall of 2011, Schaufler was accused of groping a woman's breast at an AFL-CIO convention held in Eugene, Oregon. The incident was publicized in Oregon's premier newspaper, The Oregonian, and Schaufler's behavior was referred to as \\"highly inappropriate\\" by the State Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. Shaufler later denied the incident by written statement, explaining, \\"A campaign worker and colleague of mine stuck a campaign sticker on my chest without my permission. I reacted by taking the sticker off of my chest and sticking it on her chest.\\" Schaufler further described the incident as \\"innocent horseplay\\" and a \\"knee- jerk response.\\" Schaufler has also been criticized for his record of siding with republicans on various issues in the legislature, including stalling a healthcare bill. During Schaufler's campaign for the 2012 primary election, he was further criticized for accepting a $3,000 donation from the conservative Koch Industries, although Schaufler later returned the money after public backlash.

It runs Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, England which is a 501 bedded District General Hospital providing acute and specialist services to a local population of 258,000 people. It has been led since May 2017 by Steve Clarke (Chairman) and Lance McCarthy (Chief Executive). It has a hospital radio station, Harlow Hospital Radio. In addition to Princess Alexandra Hospital, the trust provides services from St Margaret's Hospital, Epping and Herts and Essex Hospital, Bishops Stortford.  History  The trust was established on 22 December 1994, and became operational on 1 April 1995. Development In 2019 it was reported that the trust was considering a new form of private finance initiative developed by Community Health Partnerships for the rebuilding of its Princess Alexandra Hospital on a new site. Performance The Trust predicts a deficit of ¬£16.6m in 2013-14. It abandoned plans to become a Foundation Trust in April 2015 and plans to become an integrated care organisation, investigating both ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù and ‚Äúvertical‚Äù integration with other health bodies. Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. There were 2% fewer attendances in 2014-15 than in 2013-14, but the number of patients breaching the four-hour target more than doubled to 12,000. In October 2015 the trust announced that it was closing four beds on each ward, and was unable to see, treat, admit or discharge even 90% of patients within the accident and emergency four-hour target. The Chair of the trust said it was \\"becoming unviable clinically\\". It expects a deficit of ¬£28.6m in 2015/6. In the last quarter of 2015 it had one of the worst performances of any hospital in England against the four hour waiting target.

The 119th is equipped with the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. The squadron is a descendant organization of the World War I 5th Aviation School Squadron (later 119th Aero Squadron), established on 5 June 1917. It was reformed on 30 January 1930, as the 119th Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. History =Origins= The 119th Fighter Squadron is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, its origins beginning in June 1917 as the World War I 5th Aviation School Squadron at Langley Field, Virginia. In September 1917 it was redesignated as the 119th Aero Squadron. Not deployed overseas, the unit was inactivated in May 1919. The squadron was reactivated in 1930 when it was reorganized as the 119th Observation Squadron, New Jersey National Guard, at Metropolitan Airport, Newark, New Jersey as an air arm of the 44th Division Aviation and received federal recognition in January 1930. In 1934, aircraft of the 119th Observation Squadron were dispatched to the scene of the \\"Morro Castle\\", a ship burning off the coast of Asbury Park, New Jersey. Many hours were spent flying over the ship and adjacent water assisting in the direction of rescue efforts and locating survivors. The 119th Observation Squadron fell victim to the \\"draft\\" on 16 September 1940, when it was inducted into active service. The unit continued as the 119th until 12 April 1948, at which time it became the 490th Fighter Squadron. The 490th was disbanded in May 1944 while still at Thomasville, Georgia. =New Jersey Air National Guard= 119th Fighter Squadron ‚Äì North American F-51H-5-NA Mustang 44-64310. The wartime 490th Fighter Squadron was reconstituted on 21 June 1945. It was then re-designated as the 119th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the New Jersey Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Newark Airport, New Jersey and was extended federal recognition on 9 June 1947. The 119th Fighter Squadron was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 490th. The squadron was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and was allocated to the First Air Force, Continental Air Command by the National Guard Bureau. The 119th moved to the former Atlantic City Naval Air Station, now known as the William J. Hughes Technical Center, on 5 August 1958. This change of station also brought about a change in aircraft to the F-84F. The 119th was called to active duty again in October 1961, for the Berlin Crisis. The unit remained at home station; however, the pilots were periodically rotated to Chaumont Air Base, France. On 15 October 1962, the 119th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 177th Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 119th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 177th Headquarters, 177th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 177th Combat Support Squadron, and the 177th USAF Dispensary. The 119th transitioned into F-86H aircraft. Two years later, the unit transitioned into F-100 \\"Super Sabres\\".

In May 1968, the squadron was activated to federal service, and its personnel were assigned to the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing, Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina. Personnel were spread throughout the United States, Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam with the main unit stationed at the 113 TFW. The 119 TFS returned to Atlantic City, New Jersey, in June 1969, and transitioned into the F-105 \\"Thunderchief\\" in 1970. In 1972, Headquarters Air Force announced that the 119th TFS would be assigned to the Aerospace Defense Command and be responsible for protecting the United States from airborne attacks, and so was reorganized as the 177th Fighter Interceptor Group and 119th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. In 1973, the unit transitioned into the F-106 \\"Delta Dart\\" and assumed alert status the following year. The Aerospace Defense Command then came under TAC as the Air Defense Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), and then again changed to a numbered Air Force, 1st Air Force. During 1988, the unit transitioned into the F-16A/B, \\"Fighting Falcon\\", and received an \\"excellent\\" rating during its first Operational Readiness Inspection with the F-16 in October 1989. From 1 May through 13 June 1998, the squadron deployed five F-16C Fighting Falcon aircraft and 46 personnel to Howard AFB, Panama, in support of OPERATION CORONET NIGHTHAWK. 130 personnel rotated on a two-week basis during the six- week deployment. Operating as part of a joint interagency task force, the wing‚Äôs role was to detect and identify suspected drug smuggling aircraft. Once identified, the suspected aircraft are turned over to law enforcement agencies for apprehension. Since October 2001, the unit has had an active involvement in Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

She is Professor of Psychiatry at University College Dublin and consultant psychiatrist at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin. She is known for her regular column with the Irish Independent newspaper, and her conservative views on a variety of social issues. Background and personal life Brought up in Ballynoe in County Cork, Casey's father was a council worker and farmer, while her mother worked as a public health nurse at a time when it was highly unusual for both parents to work outside the home. She has one sibling; a younger sister, Terry. Excelling at school, she went on to study medicine at University College Cork, graduating in 1976 with Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery. She is married to barrister John McGuiggan. Casey notes that she and her husband are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Casey is a practising Roman Catholic. Medical career After graduating from medical school, Casey received specialist psychiatric and research training in Britain. Between 1977 and 1985 she held the positions of senior house officer, registrar, honorary senior registrar, and research fellow at Mapperley Hospital, Nottingham, and the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. From 1985 to 1991, she worked as a senior lecturer and consultant psychiatrist in the Department of Psychiatry at Cork University Hospital. She has been Professor of Psychiatry and director of an Acute Unit at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin since 1991.

Memberships and Fellowships Casey is associated with several professional organisations:https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FCdQlTzL- aUC&pg;=PA320&lpg;=PA320&dq;=patricia+casey+fellow+royal+academy&source;=bl&ots;=wbOCla5Lq9&sig;=ACfU3U17fwp7jMYgnouYsnV2bl0-GdYIMQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjY0frXspvoAhUpShUIHe3_DlAQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=patricia%20casey%20fellow%20royal%20academy&f;=falsehttps://www.psychiatrictimes.com/authors/patricia- casey-frcpi-frcpsych- mdhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6PGzHFuS1xkC&pg;=PR9&lpg;=PR9&dq;=patricia+casey+frcpi&source;=bl&ots;=ElAaTzDrF-&sig;=ACfU3U1NSszODyoN9jCmhYbqVo81BXaHRg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiE5MXztpvoAhVtTxUIHZaHDRIQ6AEwD3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=patricia%20casey%20frcpi&f;=falsehttps://www.patientcareonline.com/authors/patricia- casey-frcpi-frcpsych- mdhttps://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/5799/1/Abortion_and_young_women_new.pdf * Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists * Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland * Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine * Fellow of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland * Member of the Medico-Legal Society of Ireland Positions on social issues Casey is a patron and co-founder of the Iona Institute, a think tank, often described as a pressure group, which promotes a Catholic point of view. Casey is known for her opposition to divorce, advising the Irish government against holding a referendum to legalise divorce in 1995. She also maintains that \\"the sense of loss children feel when parents separate is greater than when a parent dies\\". She does not, however, disagree with divorce in the case of a violent or abusive spouse. Casey also opposes abortion,Ethical questions in embryo battle: ThePost.ieConference on New Research in Irish Feminism ‚Äì Events ‚Äì Centre for Gender & Women's Studies ‚Äì Trinity College surrogate pregnancy, anonymous donor in vitro fertilisation, non-traditional family units, adoption by gay parents, and same-sex marriage. She is a proponent of heterosexual adoption. Casey has testified before the Irish Government, at the British House of Commons, and in Irish legal cases on a number of these issues, in particular suicide and deliberate self-harm. She also writes a regular opinion column for the Irish Independent newspaper and in the past has contributed to the Sunday Business Post and to the letters page of the Irish Times, as well as appearing on national television and radio. =Newstalk interview= In a November 2009 interview on Newstalk's The Wide Angle programme, Casey criticised the way in which the Catholic Church dealt with child sexual abuse. She called for reform of the Church hierarchy in Ireland and for the resignation of bishops named in the Murphy Report. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland later found the interview to have been conducted in an \\"unfair and non-objective manner\\" and described Karen Coleman's questioning of Casey as \\"inappropriate\\" and \\"unjustified\\". Newstalk broadcast an apology following the interview. =Archbishop Diarmuid Martin row= In July 2012, Casey accused the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin of undermining the confidence of young priests by both criticising them for being \\"traditional\\" and referring to them as \\"fragile\\". In addition she criticised him for being unable to talk about the Catholic Church in an \\"upbeat\\" way, offering \\"no solutions\\" and merely analysing problems rather than solving them. Responding on behalf of the Archbishop in August 2012, his Director of Communications accused Casey of \\"mispresenting\\" his comments, saying she had \\"conveniently forgotten\\" the Archbishop's upbeat comments at the Eucharistic Congress 2012. She also said Casey \\"grossly misrepresented\\" the Archbishop's comments on young priests being \\"fragile\\", saying \\"his actual comments [...] indicate the opposite\\". Misrepresentation of research =Uppsala University study= Swedish scientists faulted Casey for presenting their research data in order to support her position against same-sex marriage and same-sex couple adoption. Casey had made repeated reference to a parenting study from Uppsala University, Sweden, claiming that it showed that \\"children...do best when raised by their married biological parents\\". The University and the authors of the report rejected as invalid Casey's interpretation of their results. They have stated that her claim that children do better when raised by married heterosexuals is \\"not valid based on our findings... no comparisons were made with gay or lesbian family constellations in the studies included in the review. Therefore, there is nothing whatsoever in our review that would justify the conclusion that same-sex parents cannot raise healthy children who do well.\\" Anna Sarkadi, the study's lead author, also commented, \\"I find it interesting that, since the report was published, we have been contacted by many ultra-conservative groups who are saying that it supports their point. But I think it's very important to be cautious about what conclusions you come to.\\" Casey said that she was \\"just taking the results of the report to its logical conclusion.\\" =UNICEF report= Casey has claimed that a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report supported her position on same-sex parenting. This was disputed by the then Executive Director of UNICEF Ireland, Melanie Verwoerd. Verwoerd stated that \\"Unicef does not make any judgments on the well being of children growing up with same-sex parents\\" and that Casey's claim of UNICEF support was \\"incorrect and unacceptable\\". = Views on counselling = In the Irish Examiner newspaper of 13 May 1999, Casey was quoted as saying that counselling is a waste of time for treating depression. The journalist Caroline O'Doherty wrote that Casey, an advocate of Prozac and related SSRI treatments, was speaking following the publication of a study in the British Medical Journal which asserted that counselling had no benefits for patients with depression. Casey was referring to a study on depression published in the British Medical Journal on 1 May 1999 by Ulrik Fredrik Malt, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oslo who provided expert evidence at the trial of Anders Behring Breivik. The only counselling involved in the study was the request that GPs be supportive during the consultation. Malt's paper clearly stated that specific forms of counselling were excluded from the study. In response to similar claims by Casey in the Sunday Business Post of 4 July 1999 ( 'Counsellor, Heal Thyself' ), Ivor Browne, Casey's predecessor as Professor of Psychiatry at University College Dublin, wrote in the Sunday Business Post on 11 July 1999 that the reference to counselling in the paper was merely incidental and that the concern of the paper was a comparison of one anti-depressant with another, continuing that; Brown continued to note that there is a well established body of research demonstrating the effectiveness of counselling and psychotherapy and expressed his surprise that Casey was unaware of these studies. =Publications= 'Using computers in research' in 'Research methods in psychiatry'.

The songs on the new > album sort of represent a struggle between good and evil, light and dark, > and despair and hope. We felt Agony and Irony was appropriate, I mean we > fancy ourselves as being pretty clever, and we felt a play on words was also > fitting for the new record.

In the Middle Ages heralds were used to deliver declarations of war, and ultimata as a form of one-sided communication. But for two-sided communication agents were needed that could also negotiate. These usually operated under a flag of truce and enjoyed temporary inviolability according to the customs and laws of war. Breaches of the customary protection of parlimentaires were deemed perfidy. International Law Later, these customs and protections were codified in international law. Articles 32-34 of the Hague Conventions (1907) state: :Article 32 :An individual is considered a parlementaire who is authorized by one of the belligerents to enter into communication with the other, and who carries a white flag. He has a right to inviolability, as well as the trumpeter, bugler, or drummer, the flag-bearer, and the interpreter who may accompany him. :Article 33 :The Chief to whom a flag of truce is sent is not obliged to receive it in all circumstances. :He can take all steps necessary to prevent the envoy taking advantage of his mission to obtain information. :In case of abuse, he has the right to detain the envoy temporarily. :Article 34 :The envoy loses his rights of inviolability if it is proved beyond doubt that he has taken advantage of his privileged position to provoke or commit an act of treachery. Contraventions of these articles constitute war crimes that may be prosecuted before the International Criminal Court.

The new western historians recast the study of American frontier history by focusing on race, class, gender, and environment in the trans-Mississippi West. The movement is best known through the work of Patricia Nelson Limerick, Richard White, William Cronon, and Donald Worster. The philosophy and historiography of the new western historians is discussed thoroughly and supportively in Patricia Nelson Limerick, Clyde Milner II, and Charles E. Rankin, eds., Trails: Toward A New Western History. An overview of the New Western History is available in Clyde Milner, et al., The Oxford History of the American West. The movement has been thoroughly critiqued by historian Michael Allen. Like the new social historians, new western historians made important contributions. By focusing on race, class, gender, environment, they added to the work of older Borderlands scholars of Hispanic studies, furthered the understanding of American Indians and frontier women, and worked the fertile ground of twentieth-century western history. Frontier history did not show the impact of the new social history until over a decade after most other historical fields. The reason for the lag is that frontier history, from its inception in Frederick Jackson Turner‚Äôs 1893 \\"Frontier Thesis\\" paper, had always been home to a strong school of non-Marxist economic determinists (‚ÄúProgressives‚Äù). These ‚Äúold‚Äù western historians had addressed multiethnic and environmental issues on the Colonial, trans-Appalachian, and trans-Mississippi frontiers. Although they left much work undone, these Progressives planted the fields the new western historians later harvested.

It once functioned as the centre of the medieval Jewish community in Maribor, among the most prominent in the Eastern Alps- area. History First mentioned in 1354, the synagogue is thought to have been built sometime in the late 13th century.Janez and Anja Premk, Mariborska sinagoga, ZRC SAZU, Ljubljana 2015 Located next to the city walls, it was part of a complex that included a Jewish cemetery, rabbinical residence, and Talmudic school. A fortified tower nearby - part of the walls themselves - was known as the ≈Ωidovski stolp (\\"Jewish Tower\\"), while a building housing ritual baths stood outside the walls on the Drava riverbank. At points throughout its history, the synagogue served as a temporary seat of the Supreme Rabbinate of Styria, Carinthia and Krain. In 1497, the Jews of Maribor were expelled, scattering all over Europe, especially Italy. After the expulsion, the synagogue was in 1501 turned into a Catholic church, the Church of All Saints (). The former rabbi's residence to the west of the main building became a curate office, while another, smaller building on the eastern side housed the sexton.

It served in this capacity until 1811, when it was sold to private owners for use as a merchant storage, a wine cellar, a brush factory, an art studio, and an apartment house, which it remained until the 1980s. Following several years of renovations, taking place from 1992 until 2000, including a reconstruction of the late Gothic sanctuary, the building opened in 2001 as a museum and cultural-exhibition venue devoted to the history of the Jewish community of Maribor, and of Slovenia.

August has used her skills as a beekeeper to build a successful business. She has also built a strong community of black women who gather regularly in prayer, overseen by a life-sized statue of a black woman with an outstretched arm. Despite the unlikeliness of Lily's lies about their circumstances, August takes them in, as trade for labor. Lily becomes an apprentice beekeeper and later discovers May's ‚Äúwailing wall‚Äù, tucked full of little notes about events that have distressed the brittle and sensitive May, and she learns about the \\"Black Mary\\" in the living room. In time Lily confides her truths in Zach, the teenage son of one member in the prayer group and August's assistant beekeeper. Lily and Zach try to watch a movie together, but their disregard for racial barriers, sitting with Zach in the \\"colored\\" section, gets Zach kidnapped and roughed up. June and August hide the news from May to try and protect her, but Zach's mother unknowingly reveals the news. Out of grief, May drowns herself to escape the pain of feeling the world's hatred, even though she leaves a note saying that she knows Zach will be returned alive, which happens the next day. With May's funeral comes some reconciliations and truths. June, strong and proud, agrees to wed her long-time boyfriend. Rosaleen is asked to be part of the household family. Lily, who already believes she probably killed her mother, as seen in flashbacks, now blames herself for Zach's kidnapping and May's death. Lily smashes several jars of honey, feeling unloved and unlovable. Before Lily leaves, August challenges her outlook, and tells Lily about her mother, whom August cared for as a child in Virginia and later sheltered her from the abuse of T. Ray. Meanwhile, T. Ray has figured out where Lily is from pin holes in the wall where a map had been in her room, and comes to take her home with him. Lily refuses to leave and the three women form a phalanx of support. T. Ray admits that her mother did come back for her, and he had lied because her mother had not come back for him. With angry reluctance, T. Ray leaves her to be raised on the Boatwright farm.

It had the distinction of being the first practical rotary- wing aircraft used by the United States Army and inaugurated the first scheduled air-mail service using a rotary-wing aircraft. Development Using the experience gained in building Cierva autogyros under licence the Kellett Autogiro Company developed the KD-1 which was similar to the contemporary Cierva C.30. It had two open cockpits, a fixed tailwheel landing gear and was powered by a 225 hp (168 kW) Jacobs L-4 radial engine. The D in the KD-1 designation stood for Direct control, meaning that the rotor was responsible for all control of the machine, so ailerons, wings and elevators were not necessary. This caused distrust from Kellett's test pilots, who refused to fly it. Kellett then hired Johnny Miller, who thoroughly understood autogyros, as chief test pilot. After successful testing of the prototype, it was converted into a mail-carrying variant designated the KD-1A which had the front cockpit converted into a baggage compartment and was put into production. It had a three-bladed rotor with folding blades and a number of minor detail improvements. A KD-1B was a development of the KD-1A, with an enclosed cockpit for the pilot, radio, blind-flying instruments and a landing light, and was ordered and operated by Eastern Air Lines, who hired Miller to fly it. They inaugurated the first scheduled rotary-wing air-mail service on 6 July 1939 between Camden Central Airport and Philadelphia's main Post Office. In 1935 the United States Army bought a KD-1 for evaluation and designated it the YG-1, a second aircraft followed which had additional radio equipment and was designated the YG-1A. These two aircraft were followed by a batch of seven designated YG-1B. In 1942 seven more were bought for use in the observation role as the XO-60. Six XO-60s were re-engined with 300 hp (224 kW) Jacobs R-915-3s and re-designated YO-60.\\"ARMY AUTOGIRO\\" Popular Science, June 1944, photo of YO-60 One YG-1B was modified with a constant-speed rotor and was re- designated the YG-1C, it was later re-engined with the more powerful R-915 and re-designated again as the XR-2.

He was the third Chief Minister of Nagaland and the fourth Governor of Himachal Pradesh. He was also a member of the drafting committee of Naga People's Convention.  Early life  Sema was born on 6 March 1921 in the Sutemi village in the erstwhile Naga Hills District (present-day Zunheboto District of Nagaland). He studied in Mokokchung Government School before proceeding to Serampore College and St Anthony's College in Shillong. He joined government service in the 1950s as a school inspector, later serving as an assistant commissioner of the then Naga Hills district of undivided Assam.  Political career  In the late 1950s, he became a member of the drafting committee of Naga People's Convention. A sixteen-point agreement signed with the Government of India on the basis of this Convention led to the formation of the separate state of Nagaland in 1960. Sema became a member of the interim body of the new state government in 1961. In 1964, Sema was elected unchallenged to the first legislative assembly of the newly-formed Nagaland state from Akuluto constituency.

Profile Compared to its predecessor, Literatur und Kritik printed more texts written by young authors and much more literature from Central and East European countries. A study by the German scholar Renate Langer argued that the magazine was conceived originally as an official literary magazine of the Austrian state and thus received public subsidies from the first day on. Until the end of the 1980s, the magazine was dogged by this reputation. Since its founding, Literatur und Kritik has been edited by the Salzburg publishing house Otto M√ºller Verlag, for several years now as five double issue per year. Scholar Klaus Zeyringer names it as one of the most interesting and richest literary magazines in German speaking countries. As of 2010 the print run of Literatur und Kritik was around 4,000. Editors in chief were first Jeannie Ebner and eventually Kurt Klinger. In 1991, Karl-Markus Gau√ü became the new editor, together with publisher Arno Kleibel, and designed new characteristics for the magazine. For example, he introduced the new category Cultural Letters with essays and feuilletons covering cultural and historico-cultural topics. He gave more weight to discussion of the literatures of Central Europe and international literature. Additionally he managed to interest a younger generation of writers in collaborating. The 40 Year Anniversary issue gives insight into texts published during the first twenty-five years of the magazine, e.g. by Ilse Aichinger, Ingeborg Bachmann, Italo Calvino, Elias Canetti, Paul Celan, Erich Fried, Alfred Gesswein, Peter Henisch, Friederike Mayr√∂cker, Robert Menasse, Peter Rosei, Peter Turrini, and Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz. Dossiers Most issues of Literatur und Kritik comprise a dossier about special topics of about the literature of a chosen country. Among others, dossiers about Moldavia, Sorbian Literature, Portugal, Ukraine, Guatemala, South Tyrol, Occitanian Literature, Sinti and Roma, Bulgaria, and Yiddish Literature have been published. Cultural Letters The category Cultural Letters was introduced by Karl-Markus Gau√ü. Essays and feuilletons cover cultural topics in a broad sense. Every year, Literatur und Kritik publishes two to three Cultural Letters features. Writers such as Beppo Beyerl, Max Blaeulich, Manfred Chobot, Klaus Ebner, Leopold Federmair, Andrea Grill, Drago Janƒçar, Michael Scharang, Wolfgang Sr√©ter, Daniela Strigl, Christian Teissl, and Manfred Wieninger have written cultural essays for the magazine. Poetry Since 2005, the first double issue of the year has published new poetry. The editors are committed to presenting a broad variety of contemporary poetry. Magazine in Magazine The international concept of Magazine in Magazine allows a literary magazine to present itself via another literary magazine based in another country (and in another language). Chosen texts are translated and speak for themselves in the target country. The original idea stems from the writers group of the magazine Apokalipsa in Ljubljana in Slovenia. Initial projects brought together Literatur und Kritik with magazines in Slovenia, Hungary, Montenegro, Poland and Croatia. Reviews Every issue contains reviews of recently published literary books. As a specialty, the so-called Controversy deserves mention, in which two authors review the same book from different viewpoints. Well-known Germanists such as Waltraud Anna Mitgutsch, Wendelin Schmidt-Dengler, Daniela Strigl and Klaus Zeyringer have written reviews for Literatur und Kritik.

History Quilceda Creek wines, including the 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon that received 100 pts from Robert Parker. Quilceda Creek Vintners was founded in 1978 by Alex and Jeanette Golitzin. Alex Golitzin is a nephew of Andr√© Tchelistcheff, one of the most influential winemakers of Napa Valley, and credits summer trips to visit his uncle in St. Helena, California with developing his early interest in wine. Tchelistcheff began consulting with Washington's largest winery, Chateau Ste. Michelle, in the 1960s, when the Golitzin family also moved to western Washington. With encouragement and advice from his uncle, Alex Golitzin began making one barrel of Cabernet Sauvignon a year as an amateur winemaker from 1974 through 1977. Encouraged by Tchelistcheff's assessment of the results, the family opened the commercial winery in Snohomish in 1978 and produced their first vintage of Cabernet Sauvignon in 1979. The first vintage produced . In 1993, Alex Golitzin's son, Paul, took over responsibilities as chief winemaker.

It preserves the William Allen White House, also known as Red Rocks, which was the home of Progressive journalist William Allen White from 1899 until his death in 1944. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and The property, designated a state historic site in 2001, is operated by the Kansas Historical Society. Description and history Red Rocks is located in a residential area northeast of downtown Emporia, at the southwest corner of Exchange Street and East 10th Avenue. The landscaped property includes the house of William Allen White, the house of his mother Mary, and a small visitors center. The main house is a 2-1/2 story structure, its first floor finished in red sandstone, and the upper levels framed in wood with a Tudor Revival stucco-and-half-timbered appearance. The Mother's House is a 2-1/2 story brick and limestone structure, with Classical Revival styling on what is basically an American Foursquare plan. Construction of the main house was begun in 1887 by Judge Almerin Gillette, but was not completed due to financial difficulties. The stone for the exterior was sourced from the Garden of the Gods area in Colorado. William Allen White and his wife Sallie purchased the unfinished shell in 1899 and finished the interior. The upper floors of the house were gutted by a fire in 1920, and rebuilt to a plan by the Kansas City architects Wight & Wight. The Mother's House was built in 1903 or 1904, and was occupied by White's mother Mary until her death in 1924. The main house remained in the White family (owned by a foundation from 1988) until 2001, when it was donated to the state. William Allen White became a prominent national figure due to his writing for the Emporia Gazette (which he owned and edited), and for his role in organizing the progressive elements of the Republican Party in the first three decades of the 20th century. He helped organize the Bull Moose Party candidacy of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, and was an influential voice representing small- town America.

History The Metrolink extension in 2010 MediaCityUK is a development within Salford Quays, on the site of the former Manchester Docks. When an active port, the quays were served by numerous railway goods lines. The Metrolink's extension into Salford Quays was part of a programme of urban renewal for the area around the Manchester Ship Canal. Plans for a light rail system into Salford Quays have existed since around 1987, initially as far as Broadway; the proposals evolved, with plans for a branch line to serve the Lowry arts centre. The MediaCity extension replaced that proposal. It opened on 20 September 2010, as the terminus of a specially-constructed from the Eccles Line. Services to the station were suspended following an incident at the Harbour City crossover on the second day of operation.

He wrote extensively about Arab musical influences on the European musical tradition and the Islamic legacy to music theory. Farmer was born in Crinkill Barracks, near Birr, Offaly (Kings County), Ireland, where his father, also Henry George Farmer (1848-1900), was stationed with the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment of the British Army. His mother, Mary Ann Harling (1850-1907), was related to Afflecks and Allans of Scotland. Henry grew up in a disciplinarian family and part of an Anglo- Irish community in the Irish Midlands. By age seven he began studying piano, choral singing and harmony. The organist and choirmaster Vincent Sykes (b.1851) tutored him. The Farmers were originally from Berkshire and had several musical connections. In 1888 Henry George visited relatives in Nottingham who owned a music warehouse. An earlier Henry Farmer (1819-1891) had composed popular liturgy - Mass in B-flat and concertos. His nephew was John Farmer (1835-1901), also a music teacher, organist and composer. Farmer represented Britain at the 1932 Cairo Congress of Arab Music and wrote on a wide range of topics from Turkish, Scottish and Irish musical traditions, including British military music. He contributed generously to Grove's Dictionary of Music (fifth edition). He died in Law, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, aged 83. A collection of Farmer's papers is housed at the Special Collections Department of the Glasgow University Library at the University of Glasgow. Books *The Rise & Development of Military Music.

The organisation was founded in 1988 by Don Donnelly, Charles Kerrigan, Suzy Byrne, Kieran Rose and Christopher Robson. \\\\- \\\\- GLEN focused on achieving change in legislation and social policy that would achieve full equality and inclusion for lesbian, gay and bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Ireland, and protection from all forms of discrimination. The board of directors comprised Margot Slattery (chair), Simon Nugent; Muriel Walls, S√©amus Dooley and Dr. Fergus Ryan. In May 2017 it was announced that GLEN was to close.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/gay-and-lesbian-equality-network- to-cease-operations-1.3086744 Official opening On 3 April 2006, then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern performed the official opening of GLEN's new offices in Fumbally Court in Dublin 8. This was a moment of some historical significance as he was the first head of an Irish Government to visit an LGBT organisation. The Taoiseach also launched GLEN's five-year strategic plan entitled \\"Building Sustainable Change\\" which set out the priorities of the organisation going forward, the main one being the enactment of legislation providing for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships. In a speech to assembled guests, Mr Ahern declared that \\"Sexual orientation cannot, and must not, be the basis of a second-class citizenship. Our laws have changed, and will continue to change, to reflect this principle.\\" Staff The current GLEN staff members are: * vacancy ‚Äì Executive Director * Marie Hamilton ‚Äì Administration Manager * Odhr√°n Allen ‚Äì Director of Mental Health * Davin Roche ‚Äì Director of Workplace Diversity * Eimear O'Reilly - Senior Workplace Diversity Lead * Ross Flanagan - Communications and Events Officer  Legal recognition of same-sex relationships  GLEN Director of Policy Change, Eoin Collins, was appointed to a Working Group on Domestic Partnership established by the Government in early 2006. The purpose of the group was to present options regarding the legal recognition of same-sex unions for the Minister for Justice to consider. It was chaired by lawyer and former Progressive Democrats Teachta D√°la Anne Colley. The Colley Report was published in November 2006 and outlined just two options to be considered ‚Äì the opening up of marriage to lesbian and gay couples, which was stated as the full equality option, or full civil partnership which would provide all the rights and responsibilities of marriage. In the May 2007 Irish general election, all of the main political parties committed themselves to legislating in this area if they formed part of the new government. Following negotiations between Fianna F√°il and The Green Party, the two parties produced a Programme for Government in June 2007. The document contained the following commitment on the legal recognition of same-sex unions: \\"This Government is committed to full equality for all in our society. Taking account of the options paper prepared by the Colley Group and the pending Supreme Court case, we will legislate for civil partnerships at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of the Government.\\" GLEN strongly welcomed the commitment to introduce change based on the findings of the Colley Report and looks forward to working with the government to bring about equality for the LGB population in Ireland. The Heads of Bill for civil partnership were published by the Irish government on 24 June 2008 and GLEN strongly welcomed this. Speaking in response to the proposed legislation, GLEN chairman Kieran Rose said, \\"Comprehensive civil partnership, as proposed in the Heads of Bill, is a major milestone towards equality. The goal of GLEN is access to full equality through civil marriage and this Bill is a fundamental step forward towards this goal. The provisions outlined today will resolve many immediate and pressing issues faced by lesbian and gay couples and will also provide a platform for further progress.\\" On 26 June 2009, the Civil Partnership Bill was published by Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern. GLEN again strongly supported this development but also expressed concern about the absence of any provision in the Bill to provide legal support and recognition of the many children being parented by same-sex couples. At this time GLEN published three documents to inform both policy makers and the LGBT community about the Civil Partnership Bill. These were: * A Chronology of Key Events: GLEN's Campaign for Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Relationships and Families * Civil Partnership ‚Äì Your Questions Answered: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Civil Partnership Bill * Civil Partnership: An Overview Following the passage of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 through the lower and upper houses of the Oireachtas, GLEN published the Seanad speeches to celebrate and mark the passage of this historic piece of legislation. At the launch of Seanad Debates on Civil Partnership July 2010, Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern stated, \\"I want to compliment GLEN for the way in which they lobbied to bring us to where we are today. I know it's their view that there is more to be done and that's definitely their view and their wish and I wish them well in that respect. I do want to compliment them on the realistic and reasonable way in which they lobbied all of the political parties and all of the political parties would have had some issues in relation to this particular piece of legislation. But GLEN did it in such a way that I think everyone fully understood that they were being reasonable and they understood the parameters within which we were required to work‚Ä¶ Today is a celebration for all of the people in GLEN and the other organisations who have been lobbying for this. GLEN have done a marvellous job and I want to thank all the people associated with GLEN for the way in which they did their business and particularly thank them for the excellent productions that they have brought forward very quickly as a result of the passing of this legislation.\\" GLEN's support for the Civil Partnership legislation received criticism from some elements of the LGBT community who believed that the Civil Partnership Bill was discriminatory and inadequate. Workplace and economy/ Diversity Champions GLEN launched the Diversity Champions Programme which is Ireland‚Äôs first and only not-for-profit workplace programme designed specifically to assist Irish employers with the inclusion of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) employees. Members include major employers such as Accenture, IBM and University College Dublin, who as members receive a range of benefits and services including a dedicated client account manager, seminars on LGBT issues, networking events for LGBT employees, high quality training, benchmarking and other opportunities for companies to build their brand and reputation on diversity. The Diversity Champions Programme builds on a body of work and engagement between GLEN and major employers, employer organisations and trade unions. This has included: * Development of GLEN‚Äôs Excellence in Diversity resource - www.excellenceindiversity.ie - an on-line toolkit designed to help employers implement and benchmark good practice, and launched by Ernst & Young. It was funded by the Equality Mainstreaming Unit which is jointly funded by the European Social Fund 2007‚Äì2013 and by the Equality Authority; * Launch in 2010 by the then T√°naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the GLEN Guide for Employers on LGBT Diversity, https://web.archive.org/web/20140717042602/http://www.glen.ie/attachments/e518164e-cef4-4073-ac06-92918db2249e.PDF supported by IBEC (the main Irish employers‚Äô organisation), IBM Ireland, Business in the Community, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Equality Authority. * Launch of joint GLEN/Irish Congress of Trade Union guide Being LGBT at Work: A Guide for LGBT People and Trade Unions. https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093020/http://www.glen.ie/attachments/c2e25865-4ee4-4515-91d6-c2c4886349f7.PDF GLEN has also responded to major employers in Ireland ‚Äì Microsoft, Citigroup, Google, PwC and Dublin City University ‚Äì seeking information on civil partnership, which has major implications for employment law and practice. The new law provides for equal treatment between married couples and civil partners in pension provision, workplace benefits and the new equality ground of civil status. GLEN and Dublin City Council worked successfully on a project to build a consensus on the economic case for equality. This culminated in a seminar event, \\"Globalisation, Diversity and Economic Renewal\\", launched by the Lord Mayor of Dublin and featuring Professor Sean Kay, author of Celtic Revival? The Rise, Fall and Renewal of Global Ireland as the keynote speaker. The event also involved prominent speakers from the areas of economic and business policy development. GLEN also published a report Equality, Diversity and Economic Competitiveness. The project was funded by the European Union's PROGRESS Programme (2007‚Äì2013) and the Equality Authority. https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191603/http://www.glen.ie/news- post.aspx?contentid=998&title;=glendublin_city_council_seminar_on_globalisation_diversity_and_economic_renewal Funding GLEN has been a registered charity since 2005. It receives funding from the Health Service Executive (HSE), but also has received funding from Atlantic Philanthropies - GLEN received $4,727,860 between 2005 and 2011. This led to criticism by Breda O'Brien, patron of the largely Roman Catholic Iona Institute pressure group, that it is used funding from abroad to influence legislation and for political campaigning in elections such as during the Marriage Referendum. The Iona Institute had itself been criticised for political campaigning while failing to register with the Standards in Public Office Commission, which monitors political donations. \\\\- It did not do so until the middle of the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum campaign, explaining its change of policy was because it wanted to \\"play a fuller part\\" in the campaign. \\\\- Financial controversies In April 2017, GLEN was directed by the Charities Regulator to provide it with financial records, following an internal review of its corporate governance procedures and a voluntary disclosure to the Regulator. √Åine Duggan stated that irregularities were noticed shortly after she was appointed executive director in October 2016. The issues relate unaccounted for expenses of up to ‚Ç¨60,000,\\"Transactions worth ‚Ç¨60k not recorded correctly in accounts of LGBT charity\\", The Journal, 17 April 2017 the use of Government funding for political campaigns and the use of GLEN credit cards for personal purchases (later reimbursed). GLEN founder and co-chairman Kieran Rose resigned as co-chair in 2016 after it emerged campaign literature for his Seanad election campaign was printed at the charity. While the cost of the printing had been reimbursed, the organisation sought clarification from the regulator in case it had breached rules limiting the involvement of charities in political campaigning. Rose resigned from the board of GLEN in April 2017 as \\"an aspect of Glen's support to him in 2016 is causing a distraction to the work of Glen and to other issues that are under review by the Charities Regulator.\\" The then Minister for Social Protection, Leo Varadkar, highlighted the \\"really important work\\" done by GLEN but said it was very important any issues were fully investigated and that \\"anything that needs to be put right is put right\\". GLEN's board stated that it \\"is satisfied that all grants received have been used for the intended purpose and has no reason to suspect there has been any misappropriation of funds. Following comments by Duggan, Mary Lou McDonald TD, said she intended to raise the issues around financial irregularites at GLEN at the D√°il Public Accounts Committee. GLEN intends appointing an interim Executive Director following the resignation of √Åine Duggan. Bullying allegations Allegations of bullying in GLEN surfaced in 2017. One of two complainants has since resigned. An external examiner has been appointed to look into the allegations.

Paul Taylor is in the centre with his arms outstretched. The 1990 Strangeways Prison riot was a 25-day prison riot and rooftop protest at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, England. The riot began on 1 April 1990 when prisoners took control of the prison chapel, and the riot quickly spread throughout most of the prison. The riot and rooftop protest ended on 25 April when the final five prisoners were removed from the rooftop, making it the longest prison riot in British penal history. One prisoner was killed during the riot, and 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners were injured. Much of the prison was damaged or destroyed with the cost of repairs coming to ¬£55 million. The riot sparked a series of disturbances in prisons across England, Scotland and Wales, resulting in the British government announcing a public inquiry into the riots headed by Lord Woolf. The resulting Woolf Report concluded that conditions in the prison had been intolerable, and recommended major reform of the prison system. The Guardian newspaper described the report as a blueprint for the restoration of \\"decency and justice into jails where conditions had become intolerable\\".  Background  Manchester's Strangeways Prison, which opened in 1868, was a \\"local prison\\" designed to hold prisoners from the surrounding area, mainly those on remand or serving sentences of less than five years.Jameson & Allison, p. 11.Carrabine, p. 128. At the time of the riot, the main prison consisted of six wings connected by a central rotunda known as the Centre. Convicted adult prisoners were held in wings A, B, C and D, and convicted young offenders were held in E wing, which was physically separated from the Centre by gates. Convicted prisoners on Rule 43(a) were held on landings C1 and C2 of C wing, and remand prisoners on Rule 43(a) were held on the fourth landing on E wing. F wing contained administrative offices on the lower floor and the chapel on the upper floor. Remand prisoners were held in wings G, H, I and K of a separate prison, linked to the main prison through workshops and a kitchen. The Certified Normal Accommodation for Strangeways, the number of prisoners the prison was designed to hold, was 970.Jameson & Allison, p. 72. The population of the prison had increased in the months before the riot, from 1,417 in January 1990 to a peak of 1,658 on 27 March.Carrabine, p. 151. On 1 April, the prison contained 1,647 prisoners - about 925 convicted adult prisoners, 500 remand prisoners and 210 convicted young offenders. Prisoners felt their complaints about conditions were being ignored.Carrabine, p. 135. Remand prisoners were only allowed out of their cells for 18 hours per week, and Category A prisoners were locked in their cells for 22 hours a day, and rarely left their cells except for \\"slopping out\\", a one-hour exercise period each day or a weekly shower.Jameson & Allison, p. 35. In March 1990, Dominic Noonan was transferred from Strangeways to HM Prison Hull.Jameson & Allison, p. 29-32. Noonan was the organiser of the Prisoners' League Association (PLA), an organisation formed in 1989 which campaigned for prisoners' rights. Its aims included initiating legal proceedings against prison staff for mistreatment of prisoners, and picketing outside prisons in which prisoners were mistreated. The PLA were active at Strangeways Prison, and Noonan's transfer demonstrates prison officers were aware of rising tensions inside the prison. On 26 March 1990, Barry Morton was taken to the \\"punishment block\\" and strip-searched after being visited by his mother, as prison officers believed she had brought drugs into the prison for him. During a struggle he sustained a black eye and swollen nose, and the following day he was released back into the main prison along with another prisoner, Tony Bush. Later the same day, Bush and Morton climbed onto the roof of the prison and staged a twenty-hour rooftop protest.Carrabine, p. 138. On 31 March there was a 30-minute sit-down protest in the chapel after a film was shown, which ended after a prison officer promised to listen to the prisoners' grievances. The same evening it is reported that a black prisoner was assaulted by prison officers in front of other prisoners, and injected with Largactil - a sedative used to control prisoners, known in prisons as the \\"liquid cosh\\". Prisoners then decided to stage a further protest in the chapel the following day, 1 April.  The riot  = Disturbance in the chapel = Prison officers had advance warning that an incident would occur in the chapel on 1 April, and security was increased.Jameson & Allison, p. 21. Extra prison officers were used to escort prisoners to the service, and fourteen officers were inside the chapel supervising the service instead of the usual total of eight.Carrabine, p. 145. An additional seven officers were also stationed in the vestry outside the chapel. The service was attended by 309 prisoners which was about the usual attendance, but all Rule 43(a) prisoners were prevented from attending as a precautionary measure. A senior prison officer believed the prisoners would attempt another sit-down protest with the possibility of hostage-taking, and instructed staff to evacuate the chapel if trouble began.Carrabine, p. 144. At approximately 11:00 am, a visiting Church of England preacher had just delivered the sermon, and the prison chaplain, Reverend Noel Proctor, stood to thank the preacher when prisoner Paul Taylor took the microphone from him and addressed the congregation.Carrabine, p. 147. Reverend Proctor was recording the service for distribution to a prayer group, and the subsequent events were recorded:Jameson & Allison, pp. 18‚Äì19. As Reverend Proctor was appealing for calm, a prisoner brandishing two sticks shouted out \\"You've heard enough, let's do it, get the bastards\\".Carrabine, p. 148. Other prisoners responded by donning masks and brandishing weapons, and three prison officers started to leave the chapel as earlier instructed. A set of keys was taken from a prison officer when a number of officers were attacked by prisoners wielding fire extinguishers, table legs and fire buckets. A number of prisoners attempted to leave the chapel via the vestry; at the same time, the seven prison officers there attempted to gain entry to the chapel. Once they managed to do so, the officers were attacked by prisoners, and a second set of keys was taken from one of them. Some prisoners helped to get injured officers and Reverend Proctor to a place of safety via the vestry, while others barricaded entrances to the chapel or attempted to gain access to the roof.Carrabine, p. 152‚Äì153. = The riot spreads = Damage caused to B wing of the prison The prison officers guarding the gates outside the chapel abandoned them, and ran towards the Centre. The prison officer in charge of the Centre saw his colleagues running from the direction of the chapel, but due to the presence of scaffolding he was in a poor position to view the upper levels, and mistakenly assumed he saw prisoners running from the chapel.Carrabine, pp. 149‚Äì150. He informed other officers on C1 and D1 of this and, upon hearing that prisoners were in possession of keys, told them and officers on A1 that they should evacuate the prison. Governor Morrison, who was responsible for the main prison, then ordered officers to evacuate the Centre at 11:13 am as he mistakenly believed prisoners had entered the Centre. By this time prisoners had gained access to the roofs of E and F wings, and from there gained access to other wings by making holes in unprotected office ceilings. The prisoners found A and B wings unsupervised as the prison officers had already evacuated, and began to free other prisoners who were still locked in their cells. The prison officer in charge of the first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, and with the help of three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders.Carrabine, p. 154. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners who were being held on the second landing.Carrabine, p. 155. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners.Carrabine, p. 158.Jameson & Allison, pp. 46‚Äì47. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains. At 11:43 am rioting prisoners were seen approaching the remand prison, which was still secure.Carrabine, p. 156. The prison governor, Brendan O'Friel, arrived at the prison at 11:55 am and gave orders to defend the remand prison.Carrabine, p. 157. He later recalled that: > By 12 o'clock when I came in it looked as if we'd lost control of the whole > thing. My first decision was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand > prison to see if we could hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had > it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the > remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming > the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on > duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another > and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of > the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really > bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up > about it, who said \\"You must be joking, is this an April Fool?\\" That's what > happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool. Rioting prisoners gained access to the remand prison at 12:20 pm through the kitchens in G wing, and began freeing prisoners who were still locked in their cells using stolen keys or improvised tools such as iron bars and fire extinguishers.Jameson & Allison, p. 22. At this point the rioting prisoners were in control of all accommodation wings of the prison. A large number of prisoners were on the prison roof, and roof tiles and other missiles were thrown at prison officers on the ground. Rioting inside the prison continued with cells being damaged and fires being started, and at 3:40 pm the Public Relations Department of the Home Office issued a statement:Jameson & Allison, p. 27. > At 11am a disturbance started in the chapel at Strangeways Prison when some > 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the > chapel roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison. > Other prisoners, including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and > staff had to be withdrawn. The perimeter is secure. Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm approximately 800 prisoners had surrendered, and arrangements were made for them to be transferred to other prisons.Carrabine, p. 160. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed that prison officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C&R;) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing.Carrabine, p. 161. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C&R; unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers not to move beyond E wing. Scaffolding poles and other missiles were thrown at the C&R; teams from the roof area above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C&R; teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, and by the end of the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who were not involved in the rioting.Jameson & Allison, p. 25. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.Jameson & Allison, p. 24. = Rooftop protest = At 7:00 am on 2 April, an estimated total of 142 prisoners were still in control of all the accommodation wings of the prison. Some prisoners on the roof gave clenched fist salutes to the crowd watching below.Jameson & Allison, p. 38. Some prisoners were wearing prison officers' hats and uniforms, while others were wearing masks improvised from towels and blankets. A banner was unveiled that read \\"No dead\\", in response to claims in the press that between eleven and twenty prisoners had been killed in the rioting. At 10:00 am, C&R; units entered the remand prison and regained control, with six prisoners surrendering peacefully.Jameson & Allison, p. 39.Carrabine, p. 162. A Home Office statement was released at 11:45 am stating that no bodies had been found in the remand prison, and 12 prison officers and 37 prisoners had received treatment in hospital to date. Further prisoners surrendered the same day, and by 6:00 pm 114 prisoners remained in the prison.Jameson & Allison, pp. 40‚Äì41. On 3 April newspapers published pictures of the prisoners' \\"No dead\\" banner, while still insisting that 20 prisoners had been killed. The prisoners responded with a banner that read \\"Media contact now\\". The Manchester Evening News newspaper was contacted from inside the prison by telephone, and prisoners outlined their demands: * Improved visiting facilities, including the right to physical contact with visitors and a children's play area. * Category A prisoners would be allowed to wear their own clothes and be able to receive food parcels. * Longer exercise periods. * An end to 23-hour-a-day lock-up. At 11:10 am Michael Unger from the Manchester Evening News was allowed into the prison as an \\"independent observer\\". Unger met prisoners who described their grievances to him, which included mental and physical brutality, poor food and conditions, and misuse of drugs in controlling prisoners. While Unger was inside the prison twelve C&R; units attempted to regain control of E wing, in what became known as the \\"battle for E wing\\". Prisoners built barricades and threw scaffolding poles at the C&R; units, and after approximately thirty minutes the C&R; units withdrew without regaining control of the wing.Jameson & Allison, p. 43. By the end of the third day of the riot prisoners still controlled the upper levels of the prison, but prison officers had regained control of the lower level, and a Home Office statement was issued:Jameson & Allison, p. 45. > During the course of the evening prison staff have had access at ground > level to all wings in the main prison. No bodies have been found. Earlier > today prison staff gained access to the main prison building in order to > remove barricades to allow the surrender of inmates who wished to do so. No > inmates were injured during this process. Nine prison staff were taken to > outside hospital for treatment. Two remain overnight for observation. > Negotiations were carried out by prison staff ... 31 inmates surrendered. > All of those who surrendered have been interviewed, medically examined and > fed. They will be transferred to other accommodation as soon as practicable. On 4 April, Governor O'Friel spoke to the press for the first time, describing the riot as \\"an explosion of evil which was quite terrible to see\\".Jameson & Allison, p. 48. Also that day the Prison Officers' Association claimed that Rule 43(a) prisoners were being treated in North Manchester General Hospital for castration wounds, which was repeated by sections of the press despite being categorically denied by the hospital's public relations officer and consultant-in-charge.Jameson & Allison, p. 49‚Äì50. 29 prisoners surrendered during the day leaving 26 prisoners inside the prison, 11 of whom had been identified by the Prison Service.Carrabine, p. 169. Also that day a prison officer died in hospital from pneumonia; he had not been injured during the riot and suffered from a long-standing medical condition. Two more prisoners surrendered on 5 April, the same day as the Home Office announced a public inquiry into the riot headed by Lord Woolf. By this time plans to retake the entire prison by force had been scrapped due to the likelihood of fatalities among prisoners or prison officers.Carrabine, p. 164. That evening the police and prison officers introduced new tactics designed to weaken the resolve of the prisoners and to prevent them from sleeping.Jameson & Allison, p. 51.Carrabine, p. 170. Loud music was played, lights were shone at the roof, and prison officers banged on their riot shields and shouted at the prisoners, including calling them \\"beasts\\", a term commonly used among prisoners at that time to refer to sex offenders. The rooftop protest was watched by a crowd of onlookers and supporters outside the prison.Jameson & Allison, p. 111. Various political groups also attended in support of the prisoners, including anarchist group Class War, the Revolutionary Communist Group, and the Prisoners' League Association.Jameson & Allison, p. 116. On 6 April Paul Taylor attempted to shout out the prisoners' demands to the crowd gathered below, but he was drowned out by police sirens. Taylor and other prisoners responded by unfurling a banner which read \\"We fight and stand firm on behalf of humanity\\". On 9 April, The Sun newspaper called for an end to the riot, saying \\"Jail riot scum must be crushed\\", and former prisoner John McVicar called for the retaking of the prison by force at the earliest possible opportunity.Jameson & Allison, p. 53. By 10 April more prisoners had surrendered, leaving thirteen inside the prison. Three more prisoners surrendered the following day, one of whom, Barry Morton, had taken part in the rooftop protest on 26 March.Jameson & Allison, p. 54. On 16 April, another three prisoners surrendered when they became ill with food poisoning.Jameson & Allison, p. 57. Local businesses were calling for an end to the riot due to the disruption caused, including the closure of roads around the prison.Jameson & Allison, p. 58. A leather-jacket retailer in the vicinity of the prison claimed to have lost ¬£20,000 in revenue since the riot had begun. Greater Manchester Police asked for ¬£2 million to cover the costs of policing the riot, which it described as the \\"most savage incident of its kind ever experienced within the British prison service\\". On 17 April the remaining seven prisoners began negotiations to attempt to bring the rooftop protest to an end. Negotiations took place inside the prison between two Home Office officials and prisoner Alan Lord, who was negotiating on behalf of the remaining prisoners.Jameson & Allison, pp. 62‚Äì63. On 23 April, Lord was captured by a C&R; unit while on his way to meet the negotiators. Mark Williams‚Äîone of the remaining prisoners‚Äîlater described his reactions to the negotiations and Lord's capture:Jameson & Allison, pp. 66‚Äì67. The last five prisoners descend from the roof in a \\"cherry picker\\"‚ÄîMark Williams, John Murray, Paul Taylor, Martin Brian and Glyn Williams. > David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, as if in > a bid to prolong the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he > would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If > it was out of the Home Officer's hands‚Äîthen whose hands was it in? I think > the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest > could help to divert the public's attention from the Poll Tax revolt that > was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being > asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about > ending the protest. Following the capture of Lord, the remaining prisoners agreed that 25 April would be the final day of the protest. Prison officers entered the prison early in the morning and gradually began to occupy the upper landings.Jameson & Allison, p. 68. At 10:20 am one of the remaining prisoners, a seventeen- year-old on remand for joyriding, was captured leaving five prisoners remaining on the roof. When prison officers reached the roof they put up a sign similar to the ones used by prisoners throughout the protest, which read \\"HMP in charge‚Äîno visits\\". At 6:20 pm the remaining five prisoners were removed from the roof in a \\"cherry picker\\" hydraulic platform, giving clenched fist salutes to the press and public as they descended. During the course of the 25-day riot, the longest in British penal history, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners had been injured.Player & Jenkins, p. 2.  Disturbances at other prisons  The Strangeways riot caused a number of protests at prisons across England, Scotland and Wales, described as either solidarity actions or copycat riots.Jameson & Allison, pp. 92‚Äì93. Approximately 100 remand prisoners at HM Prison Hull staged a sit-down protest in the exercise yard on 1 April, after hearing about the Strangeways riot on the radio. Disturbances occurred the same day at HM Prison Gartree, HM Prison Kirkham and HM Prison Rochester, although the Gartree protest had started three days earlier over conditions in the prison. There were minor disturbances at HM Prison Lindholme, HM Prison Low Newton and HM Prison Bedford on 2 April, HM Prison Durham, HM Prison Winchester and HM Prison Wandsworth on 4 April, and HM Young Offenders Institute Glen Parva on 6 April.Jameson & Allison, pp. 94‚Äì95. The weekend of 7 April and 8 April saw protests across the prison system.Jameson & Allison, pp. 96‚Äì97. At HM Prison Leeds there was a sit-down protest after the arrival of over 100 prisoners who had been transferred from Strangeways. At HM Prison Dartmoor, between 100 and 120 prisoners wrecked D wing of the prison, and 12 prisoners also protested on the roof of C wing unfurling a banner that read \\"Strangeways, we are with you\\". 32 prisoners from Dartmoor were transferred to HM Prison Bristol, where there was another major protest following their arrival.Jameson & Allison, pp. 98‚Äì99. Up to 400 prisoners took over three wings of the prison, and held control of them for two days. 130 prisoners at HM Prison Cardiff destroyed cells, a twenty-hour rooftop protest took place at HM Prison Stoke Heath, and disturbances occurred at HM Prison Brixton, HM Prison Pentonville, HM Prison Stafford and HM Prison Shepton Mallet. A second protest took place at HM Prison Hull, where 110 prisoners staged a sit-down protest in the exercise yard. Prisoners smashed windows at HM Prison Verne on 9 April, and 40 prisoners held a prison officer hostage for twenty-four hours after taking over a hall at HM Prison Shotts on 10 April. On 12 April, two teenage remand prisoners at HM Prison Swansea barricaded themselves into their cell for seventeen hours, and on 22 April between 80 and 100 remand prisoners staged an eighteen-hour rooftop protest at HM Prison Ashfield in Pucklechurch.Jameson & Allison, p. 100.  Media reaction  On 2 April newspapers reported a weekend of \\"anti-authority violence\\", as in addition to the Strangeways riot the Poll Tax Riot had occurred in London on 31 March. Reports of the violence at Strangeways included kangaroo courts, hangings, castrations and that between eleven and twenty prisoners had been killed. On 3 April the front page of the Daily Mirror read \\"Prison Mob 'Hang Cop' \\", and claimed a former policeman imprisoned at Strangeways for rape had been killed by prisoners.Jameson & Allison, pp. 104‚Äì105. The newspaper was forced to publish a retraction admitting that \\"reliable police sources\\" had been mistaken, when it transpired that the man was actually alive and imprisoned in HM Prison Leeds. Following the end of the rooftop protest the newspapers condemned the prisoners, with The Daily Telegraph describing the riot as \\"a degrading public spectacle\\", and The Independent describing the rioters as \\"dangerous and unstable criminals enjoying an orgy of destruction\\".Jameson & Allison, pp. 107‚Äì108. The Guardian urged the government to institute reforms, a view which was the prevalent one for a time, stating: > Initially, the riot appeared to increase public support for radical reform > of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been > eroded by the antics of the rioters in the last two weeks, and may be > further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal > prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road > down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions > is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system. In its last act before disbanding in 1991 and being replaced by the Press Complaints Commission, the Press Council produced a comprehensive report into the press coverage during the Strangeways riot. The report stated that \\"many of the more gruesome events reported in the press had not occurred - nobody had been systematically mutilated, there had been no castrations, no bodies had been chopped up and flushed in the sewers. Though there was inter-prisoner violence in the first hours of the riot, torture on the scale suggested by many of the early reports did not take place.\\" It further found that press coverage \\"fell into the serious ethical error of presenting speculation and unconfirmed reports as fact\\".  The Woolf Report  A five-month public inquiry was held into the disturbances at Strangeways and other prisons, beginning in Manchester on 11 June 1990 and ending in London on 31 October.Jameson & Allison, p. 184. In addition to the public inquiry, Lord Woolf and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, Stephen Tumim, also sent letters to every prisoner and prison officer in the country.Jameson & Allison, p. 138. 1,300 prisoners and 430 prison officers responded, with many excerpts from the letters being appended to the finished report. The Woolf Report was published on 25 February 1991, and blamed the loss of control of the prison on the prison officers abandoning the gates outside the chapel, which \\"effectively handed the prison to the prisoners\\". Woolf described the conditions inside Strangeways in the months leading up to the riot as \\"intolerable\\", and viewed a \\"combination of errors\\" by staff and management at the prison and Prison Service as a central contributing factor to the riot.Carrabine, p. 127. He also blamed the failure of successive governments to \\"provide the resources to the Prison Service which were needed to enable the Service to provide for an increased prison population in a humane manner\\". Woolf recommended major reform of the Prison Service, and made 12 key recommendations with 204 accompanying proposals.Player & Jenkins, pp. 8‚Äì9. The key recommendations were: # Closer cooperation between the different parts of the Criminal Justice System. For this purpose a national forum and local committees should be established. # More visible leadership of the Prison Service by a Director General who is and is seen to be the operational head and in day to day charge of the Service. To achieve this there should be a published \\"compact\\" or \\"contract\\" given by Ministers to the Director General of the Prison Service, who should be responsible for the performance of that \\"contract\\" and publicly answerable for the day-to-day operations of the Prison Service. # Increased delegation of responsibility to Governors of establishments. # An enhanced role for prison officers. # A \\"compact\\" or \\"contract\\" for each prisoner setting out the prisoner's expectations and responsibilities in the prison in which he or she is held # A national system of Accredited Standards, with which, in time, each prison establishment would be required to comply. # A new Prison Rule that no establishment should hold more prisoners than is provided for in its certified normal level of accommodation, with provisions for Parliament to be informed if exceptionally there is to be a material departure from that rule. # A public commitment from Ministers setting a timetable to provide access to sanitation for all inmates at the earliest practical date, not later than February 1996. # Better prospects for prisoners to maintain their links with families and the community through more visits and home leaves and through being located in community prisons as near to their homes as possible. # A division of prison establishments into small and more manageable and secure units. # A separate statement of purpose, separate conditions and generally a lower security categorisation for remand prisoners. # Improved standards of justice within prisons involving the giving of reasons to a prisoner for any decision which materially and adversely affects him; a grievance procedure and disciplinary proceedings which ensure that the Governor deals with most matters under his present powers; relieving Boards of Visitors of their adjudicatory role; and providing for final access to an independent Complaints Adjudicator. The Guardian newspaper described the report as a blueprint for the restoration of \\"decency and justice into jails where conditions had become intolerable\\". Home Secretary Kenneth Baker welcomed the Woolf Report and pledged to end \\"slopping out\\" by 1994, and also accepted Woolf's recommendations for more visits, home leave and telephone calls.Jameson & Allison, p. 142. In contrast to his proposed reforms, Baker also proposed the introduction of a new offence of \\"prison mutiny\\" carrying a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment, stating \\"The events of last April marked a watershed in the history of prison service. We cannot, and will not, tolerate the savagery and vandalism in our prisons that we saw then\\".Jameson & Allison, p. 144.  Prosecutions  The first prosecutions in relation to the riot began at Manchester Crown Court on 14 January 1992.Jameson & Allison, p. 145. The trial was conducted amid tight security, including armed police patrolling the area around the court, body searches for spectators and a specially constructed dock with sides made from bulletproof glass.Jameson & Allison, p. 146. Nine men went on trial charged with riot under Section 1 of the Public Order Act 1986, with six of them, including Paul Taylor and Alan Lord, also being charged with the murder of Derek White. On the first day one prisoner pleaded guilty to charges of riot and conspiracy to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony and the possibility that White had died from a pre- existing thrombotic condition.Jameson & Allison, p. 147. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted. Taylor received a ten-year sentence, the maximum sentence the judge had the power to impose.Jameson & Allison, p. 149. The sentences received by the other defendants ranged from four years to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment. By the end of the trial the total cost of the Strangeways riot, including refurbishing the prison and the costs of the police inquiry and court case, had reached ¬£112 million. The second trial began at the same court on 5 October 1992, and dealt with charges relating to the \\"battle for E wing\\" on 3 April 1990. There were fourteen defendants, including Alan Lord and another man who was acquitted in the first trial, both of whom were added to the list of defendants after their acquittals. Two defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder and received four- and five-year sentences, which due to the two years they had spent on remand awaiting trial resulted in them being freed. The remaining twelve defendants pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm with intent and conspiracy to riot. On 7 December 1992 David Bowen and Mark Azzopardi escaped from the prison van transferring them from HM Prison Hull to the court.Jameson & Allison, p. 152. Azzopardi was recaptured, before escaping from the court on 17 February 1993 along with five of the other defendants. At the conclusion of the trial two defendants were acquitted and the remainder found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm with intent, the lesser charge of conspiracy to riot automatically being dropped when guilty verdicts were announced on the first charge. When passing sentence, the judge remarked \\"You had your period of arrogance and violence in front of the world, but now the price must be paid and paid by you\\".Jameson & Allison, pp. 153‚Äì4. The defendants received sentences ranging from four years to ten years imprisonment, although only five defendants were in court to hear the verdict as six defendants were still on the run after escaping and another was being treated at Ashworth Secure Hospital. Following the second trial, a further 26 defendants were still due to be tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder in exchange for the dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment. On 18 March 1994, six prisoners appeared in court on charges of escaping from custody during the second riot trial. Five of them pleaded guilty to escaping from custody on one occasion, and Mark Azzopardi pleaded guilty to escaping on two occasions. Each was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for escaping from Manchester Crown Court, and Azzopardi received an additional two-year sentence for escaping from the van transporting him from HM Prison Hull to the court. In July 1994, David Bowen was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice by attempting to influence the jury in the first riot trial, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Paul Taylor, who had already pleaded guilty to the same charge, also received a three-year sentence.  Aftermath  HM Prison Manchester in 2007 Strangeways was rebuilt and refurbished at a cost of ¬£55 million, and was officially re-opened as HM Prison Manchester on 27 May 1994.Jameson & Allison, pp. 14‚Äì15. The press were invited to view the new prison and talk to the prisoners by new governor Derek Lewis. A prisoner told the visiting journalists: > The better conditions in here are not down to the prison department. But for > the riot, we would still be in the same old jail banged up all day and > slopping out ... The rioters brought this about. These conditions ... should > not have cost the lives of a prisoner, a prison officer and two huge court > trials. They should have done it years ago but it took a riot to get them to > do it. \\"Slopping out\\" was abolished in England and Wales by 1996, and was scheduled to be abolished in Scotland by 1999. Due to budget restraints the abolition was delayed, and by 2004 prisoners in five of Scotland's sixteen prisons still had to \\"slop out\\". \\"Slopping out\\" ended at HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont in 2007, leaving HM Prison Peterhead as the last prison where inmates did not have access to proper sanitation, as 300 prisoners were forced to use chemical toilets due to the difficulty of installing modern plumbing in the prison's granite structure. Peterhead prison closed in December 2013. In 2015, the Daily Telegraph reported that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by other prisoners. The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf from earlier in the year where he described prisoners being kept in intolerable conditions‚Äìas bad as at the time of the riots. Woolf recommended prisons were kept out of politics. A riot involving several hundred prisoners that occurred at Birmingham Prison in December 2016 was described by prison affairs academic Alex Cavendish as \\"probably the most serious riot in a B category prison since Strangeways went up\\". The incident began after a set of keys was stolen from a prison officer while he was trying to lock prisoners in their cells. Prisoners took over four of the jail's blocks and broke into the administration part of the prison, where they smashed computer equipment and set personal records alight. Riot officers entered the jail and secured the blocks after twelve hours of disturbance.  Notes   References   Bibliography  * Eamonn Carrabine (2004).

The author's actual name and identity is unknown. Career Bob Ong started to pursue writing after dropping out of college. His pseudonym came about when the author was working as a web developer and a teacher, and he put up the Bobong Pinoy website in his spare time. The name roughly translates to \\"Dumb Filipino,\\" used fondly as a pejorative term. \\"Although impressed,\\" Bob Ong notes, \\"my boss would've fired me had he known I was the one behind it.\\" When someone contacted him after mistaking him as an actual person named Bob Ong, his famous pseudonym was born. The site received a People's Choice Philippine Web Award for Weird/Humor in 1998, but was taken down after former President Joseph \\"Erap\\" Estrada was ousted after the Second People Power Revolution. According to Nida Ramirez of Visprint, which eventually became Bob Ong's publisher, the author wrote on Bobong Pinoy that he wanted to get a book published. Ramirez, who became a fan of Bobong Pinoy, approached him and started exchanging messages, which eventually led to the publication of ABNKKBSNPLAko?!, Bob Ong's first book, in 2001. The author has since written and published ten more books until 2018. Two of his works have been adapted into film. ABNKKBSNPLAko?! The Movie was released in 2014 directed by Mark Meily. Then in 2016, Lumayo Ka Nga Sa Akin was shown in theaters, directed also by Meily, with Chris Martinez and Andoy Ranay. Both movies were produced by VIVA Films. In addition, Bob Ong also played a part in translating some volumes of the Filipino comic book series Trese by Budjette Tan, which was included by the Philippine Department of Education as supplemental material for use in schools. Pseudonym There have been occasional confusions between Bob Ong and Chinese-Filipino author Charlson Ong. However, Bob Ong himself refutes this in his account in Stainless Longganisa, saying his surname is not \\"Ong\\" and neither is he even Filipino- Chinese. The family name was instead derived from wordplay on the name of his website. In a 2016 interview published in Philippine Star when asked why he chose his pseudonym, Bob Ong explained it as a \\"concept of not embracing celebrity which is foreign to most people,\\" and was never intended to be \\"mysterious\\". The poet Paolo Manalo has also been put forward as Ong, but he has denied this. Bibliography =Non-fiction= * ABNKKBSNPLAko?! (2001) * Bakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro ang mga Pilipino?

It was one of three casinos located in the \\"Casino Strip\\" area, along with Sam's Town and Hollywood Casino. Resorts was owned by Gaming & Leisure Properties and operated by Penn National Gaming. History =Southern Belle Casino (1994-1995)= The casino was developed by Belle Casinos, a company that owned the Biloxi Belle casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and was owned primarily by restaurateur Jim Hasslocher. Construction was budgeted for $30 million, but ran up to $67 million. The Southern Belle Casino opened for a two-day test run on February 19, 1994, and then opened permanently on February 24. It was designed to resemble a Southern mansion, and had facilities including of gaming space, three restaurants, and a 1,500-seat event venue, the River Bend Event Center. The Southern Belle closed on August 31, 1994, as its owners stated that the Tunica market had become overly saturated, with ten casinos in operation. Belle Casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on the same day. They initially planned to move the Southern Belle casino boat to the Biloxi Belle site, but that property closed in January 1995, and they began seeking a buyer for the Southern Belle instead. In July 1995, the property was bought out of bankruptcy for $34 million by a partnership between Harrah's Entertainment and Belz Enterprises, which owned a Harrah's casino about a block away. =Harrah's Tunica Mardi Gras Casino (1996-2004)= Harrah's spent $49 million to add a 200-room hotel and renovate the casino with a New Orleans theme, with three different areas patterned after the French Quarter, the Garden District, and Mardi Gras. The casino reopened on April 8, 1996 as Harrah's Tunica Mardi Gras Casino. The hotel opened two months later. Harrah's continued to operate two casinos in the area for some time, and bought out Belz's stake in the properties in April 1997. A month later, it closed the original Harrah's Tunica to concentrate on the Mardi Gras casino. =Resorts Casino (2005-2019)= In 2004, Harrah's agreed to buy Caesars Entertainment. The combined company would have controlled five of Tunica Resorts' nine casinos: Harrah's, Grand Casino, Horseshoe Casino, Sheraton Casino and Hotel and Bally's Casino. Because of possible anti-competitive domination of the Tunica market, Harrah's agreed to sell the property, along with Bally's, to Colony Capital, who then created Resorts International Holdings to own and operate the casinos (including Bally's Tunica). The casino was renamed Resorts Casino Tunica in 2005. On November 9, 2011, Foundation Gaming Group of Gulfport, Mississippi assumed the management of Resorts Casino and Hotel along with Bally's Casino Tunica. In 2013, management responsibility changed. In May 2017, Resorts and Bally's Tunica were sold in a joint deal, with Gaming & Leisure Properties acquiring their real estate assets for a total of $83 million, and Penn National purchasing the operating assets for a total of $44 million. Penn National announced in April 2019 that Resorts Tunica would close on June 30 because of declining revenues, which were attributed to the expansion of casino gaming in Arkansas.

Most of the settlers came from the nearby states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, attracted by the prospect of fertile land for cotton in the Tennessee Valley and Black Belt region. The plantation system was solidified throughout the first half of the 19th century, and Alabama was one of the first seven states to withdraw from the Union prior to the American Civil War. The U.S. Census taken six months before Alabama's secession showed slaves accounted for 48% of Alabama's population, and free Blacks 3%. Slavery was officially abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment which took effect on December 18, 1865. Slavery had been theoretically abolished by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation which proclaimed, in 1863, that only slaves located in territories that were in rebellion from the United States were free. Since the U.S. government was not in effective control of many of these territories until later in the war, many of these slaves proclaimed to be free by the Emancipation Proclamation were still held in servitude until those areas came back under Union control.

The Udarata Menike begins its eastbound service at Colombo Fort Station and runs east and north past the centers of Ragama, Gampaha, Veyangoda, and Polgahawela. At Rambukkana, the Main Line begins its steep climb into the hills of the upcountry. Between Balana and Kadugannawa, the track clings to the side of sheer cliffs, providing views of Batalegala ('Bible' Rock). The train then continues its climb through the scenic tea country, connecting local market centers at Gampola, Nawalapitiya, and Hatton before reaching Nanu-Oya. This is the connection to the former colonial resort of Nuwara Eliya, still visited for its temperate climate, classic hotels, and British-style gardens.

Malek To Be a Governor of the United States Postal Service , John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters, The American Presidency Project [online]. Santa Barbara, CA: University of California (hosted), Gerhard Peters (database). Business career =Marriott Corp.= In 1975, Malek joined Bethesda-based Marriott Corporation, and was quickly promoted, eventually becoming president of Marriott Hotels. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978.\\"Frederic Malek, Former Nixon Aide, Elected Vice President of Marriott\\", Washington Post, Chapin Wright, March 13, 1978. Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.\\"Malek Brings Cargo of Controversy to NWA\\", Minneapolis-St. Paul CityBusiness, Beth Ewen, October 9, 1989 In early 1989, Malek became a senior advisor to the Carlyle Group. He led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million. He went on to become co-chairman of the company, serving on the board of directors for 29 years, helping to increase the value of the company to over $15 billion. =Northwest Airlines= Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board,\\"Checchi's backers will get about 20% of Northwest\\", Denise Gellene, Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1989. and Malek became president.\\"Labor Upbeat About Change in Management at Northwest\\", AP, September 29, 1989 . In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.\\"Marriott will sell catering unit to one of NWA's buyers\\", Gellene, Los Angeles Times, July 12, 1989. From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae. =Thayer Lodging Group= In 1991, Malek founded Thayer Lodging Group, a private equity firm named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the \\"father of the Military Academy.\\" Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion. Thayer's funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms. On July 1, 2013, Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, \\"we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments.\\" On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management. Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continued to be actively involved as Chairman of Thayer Lodging. =Thayer Capital Partners/Thayer Hidden Creek/HCI Equity Partners= In 1993, Malek also founded and became Chairman of Thayer Capital Partners, a Washington D.C based private equity firm. In 2005 the company merged with Hidden Creek Partners and was renamed to Thayer Hidden Creek. Following the SEC administrative action and a number of other setbacks the company rebranded as HCI Equity Partners, a name it operated under as of 2016.  Fraud  On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit against former Connecticut state Senate Democratic Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.Colbert I. King, \\"Fred Malek, a Dog and the SEC \\" Washington Post March 11, 2006 On May 18, 2007, Thayer was found in negligence of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and was ultimately forced to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, while Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000 for his role in the affair. It was alleged that Malek acted to enrich himself as well as advance his own political and financial interests, in addition to the benefit the fraudulent scheme would bring to him as a significant partner in Thayer. Former Connecticut State Senator and Representative DiBella testified under oath in federal court that his relationship with Malek went beyond the latters official position at Thayer, he testified that his contract obligated him to assist Malek personally with \\"ongoing investor relations.‚Äù and that Malek personally told him \\"I need you for the new treasurer‚Äù (the new treasurer being the incoming Denise Nappier). The scheme moved much of the Connecticut State Retirement and Trust Fund into high-risk, long term, non-liquid private equity funds (such as Thayer's). This unbalanced the investment plan, increasing the risk of a long term failure. =Major League Baseball= Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball, along with George W. Bush and other investors, from 1989 to 1998. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold. Beginning in 1999, Malek led the recruitment of the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C. Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an ultimately unsuccessful investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley. Political career =Nixon administration= Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretaries Robert Finch and Elliot Richardson, as well as special assistant to the president from 1970 to 1973, and deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1973 to 1975. Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972. As a management expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure the White House Personnel Office, and recruited cabinet and sub-cabinet officials.New York Times, November 15, 1972. In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a \\"tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management.\\"RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, p. 624, Richard Nixon, 1990. In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the \\"Responsiveness Program\\", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election. According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to \\"take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies\\" and to \\"supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation.\\"The Senate Watergate Report, Chapter III, 1974, citing Malek memo to Haldeman. In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of \\"substantial risks\\" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would \\"undoubtably backfire\\" if made public; therefore he recommended that \\"to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing.\\"The Senate Watergate Report, 1974, Chapter III, citing December 23, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman. As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency's first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus and his former assistants recall the role of Fred Malik in helping the new agency personnel staff itself with top people, Video , Transcript (see p7). Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973. He served until 1975, when he resigned to re-enter the private sector. In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a \\"Jewish cabal.\\" He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and \\"important Jewish officials\\" at the agency. Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. \\"I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake.\\" Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with \\"Jewish-sounding names\\", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to \\"less visible jobs\\" within the Labor Dept. Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said \\"Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon.\\" But he added, Malek \\"has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere.\\" In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek \\"a man of high principle\\" who \\"has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.\\" On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC. =Bush administration= In February 1988, Malek resigned as president of Marriott Hotels to direct the Republican National Convention for then vice-president, George H.W. Bush. He was said to be \\"on track\\" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned after acknowledging that in 1971, at the request of President Nixon he drew up a list of important Jewish officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Malek, who was a special assistant to Mr. Nixon, emphatically denied that he had engaged in an anti- Semitic act. In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations, with the rank of ambassador, where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event. The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re- election. Malek was \\"responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management.\\" Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.\\"Bush picks commerce secretary; GOP fundraiser to be nominated\\", Bill Mintz, Houston Chronicle, December 27, 1991. Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008. =American Action Network= Malek was a co-founder, former chairman and one of three executive committee members of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security. =Republican Governors Association= Malek also chairs the Executive Roundtable of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors. In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman. Under Malek's leadership, the RGA outpaced the Democratic Governors Association, and republican governors increased from 21 in 2008 to 33 in 2018. =Virginia government reform commission= On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government. Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action. In particular his anti-semitic past was singled out for criticism, less attention was paid to the Connecticut racketeering case. McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past. Philanthropy =West Point= Speaking of his time at West Point, Malek said \\"Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front, but in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.\\" In 2008, Malek was nominated by President George W. Bush to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Malek would go on to become the Chairman of the board in 2011. In addition, Malek was a philanthropic supporter of West Point, leading the largest ever capital campaign to fund the Frederic Malek West Point Visitors Center in 2017. He also underwrote the Malek Tennis Center. =Marymount= On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Malek's wife, Marlene Malek, graduated from the school in 1979 and was a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed \\"Malek School of Health Professions\\" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University. Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals' Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012. =American Friends of the Czech Republic= Malek, of Czech descent, was the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic. Following the April 17, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic. Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover. Personal life Malek was married to Marlene A. Malek. They had two children and lived in McLean, Virginia.Fred Malek is McCain's new moneyman , Washington Examiner, Jeff Dufour, February 12, 2008. Malek was a \\"fitness fanatic\\" who had kept up physically healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling. He had also twice survived cancer. Malek died on March 24, 2019 following complications from hip surgery.

It also defines the recommended mapping between the basic Latin alphabet and digits (e.g., \\"DEF\\" on 3). Uses for this mapping include: * Multi-tap and predictive text systems. * Forming phonewords from telephone numbers. * Using alphabetic characters (e.g. as a mnemonic) in a personal identification number.ISO 9564-1:2011 Financial services  Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security  Part 1: Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems, Annex B.4 Alpha-to-numeric mapping Keypads are specified both in the common 4 √ó 3 and several variations, such as 6 √ó 2 and 2 √ó 5. E.161 also specifies the dimensions and characteristics of the asterisk and number sign, referred to in the standard as star and square, respectively. The standard also recommends that a tactile identifier be placed on the 5 key to make it easier to use the keypad in low-light conditions or by the visually impaired, as well as multiple alternative methods to implement a recall button. ETSI ETS 300 640 and ISO 9995-8 also address keypad layout. Language- specific letters (e.g. √º, √©, √•, √§, √∂) as well as other characters (e.g. ‚Äò‚Ç¨‚Äô or ‚Äò@‚Äô) are not addressed, which has led to a variety of inconsistent solutions for European languages. The E.161 layout is primarily based on the layout used on American telephones since the 1930s for telephone exchange names. Until the 1990s, Q and Z were not included in the standard layout, and since the letters served mainly as mnemonic devices, they were not necessary (Q and Z were not used in phonewords); telephones either omitted them, placed Q and Z onto the 1 key, or included Q and Z on the current locations, with PRS on 7 and with WXY on 9, respectively. The development of text messaging on mobile phones, which required the full range of the alphabet, led to the need to standardize locations for Q and Z on mobile devices. E.161 adopted the current layout in response to this.
