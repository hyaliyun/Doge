He died in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 18 August 1823, after a paralytic seizure, and was buried in Easton Church, Suffolk, where a monument was erected to his memory. Book collector Nassau formed a library, rich in emblem books, early English poetry, and drama. In topography and history his collection comprised many large-paper copies, which had drawings, prints, and portraits added, with rare historical tracts. A particular interest was the history of Suffolk, printed and in manuscript, with portraits and engravings. Nassau employed Michael Rooker, Thomas Hearne, and William Byrne, and Suffolk artists, particularly Thomas Gainsborough, George Frost, and Isaac Johnson. When he died the 30 volumes of Suffolk manuscripts were kept for the family mansion at Easton. Most of Nassau's library was sold by Robert Harding Evans in 1824 in two parts, the first on 16 February and eleven following days, and the second on 8 March and seven following days.

Members of the group believe that recognizing and implementing the rights of nature in law is necessary to begin to reverse what they regard as a trend of environmental degradation, and that current environmental laws have been unable to solve this. Rights of Nature Earth Law Center and partner groups around the world are involved in a movement to recognize the rights of nature. Earth Law Center asserts that the overarching legal system generally treats the natural world as property that can be exploited and degraded, rather than as an ecological partner with its own rights to exist and thrive. They further assert that environmental regulations in turn accept this overarching system and assume that the environment will be protected if humans take from it a little less, and a little less quickly, but that this will simply slow, and never stop, environmental degradation. The rights of nature movement contends that the value and rights of the natural world arise from the fact of its existence. Several notable legal instruments incorporate nature's rights, including the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador, which recognizes the inalienable rights of ecosystems to exist and flourish and allows for citizens to enforce these rights, and Bolivia's Law of the Rights of Mother Earth and subsequent Framework Law on Mother Earth and Integral Development for Living Well, which recognize legal rights for Mother Earth. Activities Earth Law Center works to transform the law to recognize and protect nature's inherent rights to exist, thrive and evolve. The organization does this by building a force of advocates for nature's rights at the local, state, national, and international levels. ELC is a legal advocacy group uniquely focused on establishing Earth Law, including the rights of nature, through two key areas of activity: Legal and Outreach. * Legal work: Consists of securing biodiversity and ecosystem rights for rivers, coastal areas and Marine Protected Areas. * Outreach work: Focuses on advancing Earth Law education, ‚Äúglobalizing‚Äù the rights of nature, and mainstreaming Earth Law through creative forces. 1\\\\. LEGAL PROGRAMS ACHIEVING ECOSYSTEM RIGHTS FOR RIVERS AND OCEANS Rivers ELC has for years served as a leader in protecting the right of waterways to flow in California, primarily through application of the Clean Water Act. The goal of ELC is achieve fundamental rights for waterways, which will ensure their full protection and restoration to health. ELC is building off the success of other jurisdictions that have recently recognized personhood rights for rivers, including the Whanganui River in New Zealand, the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in India, and the Atrato River in Colombia. Oceans The first Marine Protected Area (MPA) was established in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt. ELC is now aiming to incorporate fundamental rights into MPAs and other legal mechanisms. ELC strategies to ensure marine ecosystem rights include: * Securing marine ecosystem rights, through ordinances establishing fundamental legal rights; * Ensuring that international treaty laws reflect the inherent rights of the ocean (such as through the Marine Biodiversity Treaty for the High Seas and Beyond, currently under negotiation); and * Establishing a definition of ‚Äúocean health‚Äù which is based on an ocean's intrinsic rights and needs, and a new ‚Äúocean health index‚Äù based on this holistic definition. SECURING LOCAL AND STATE LAWS ELC has led the passing in Santa Monica of the first West Coast rights of nature ordinance. Nearly three dozen cities in the U.S. have passed ordinances, and Mexico City has amended its constitution, recognizing rights of nature and asserting communities‚Äô rights to self-governance, a healthy environment and sustainable living. These victories will drive ELC's statewide rights of nature wins. ELC strategies at the community level include: * Enforcing existing rights of nature laws, including in Santa Monica; * Creating new rights of nature laws in local communities and major coastal cities (e.g., San Francisco) * Developing toolkits for allies to pass and implement their own rights of nature laws, then leading those allies to local victories. 2\\\\. EDUCATION & OUTREACH PROGRAMS ADVANCING EARTH LAW EDUCATION ELC develops and delivers an Earth Law course at law schools and universities in the U.S. and Canada, including Vermont Law School‚Äîthe top environmental law school in the country. ELC strategies to advance education and outreach include: * Disseminating ELC's Earth Law course to law schools nationwide in order to expand the number of future lawyers that can advocate for and defend rights of nature laws; * Launching a secondary school projects * Expanding rights of nature outreach, including social media, speaking engagements, university organizations and new rights of nature groups. SECURING RIGHTS OF NATURE INTERNATIONALLY ELC advances rights of nature within the United Nations and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ELC ensured that advancement of nature's rights was included as part of the IUCN's 4-year work program, from 2016 to 2020. ELC also helped organize two International Rights of Nature Tribunals, which hear cases on nature's rights violations arising from across the globe. Already, countries such as Ecuador and Bolivia have codified rights of nature in their constitutions, and nature has seen numerous victories as a result, such as the restoration of the Vilcabamba River in Ecuador. ELC strategies at the international level include: * Ensuring presentation and passage of the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth (Rights of Nature) at a session of the UN General Assembly; * Advancing rights of nature within the IUCN, including its World Commission on Environmental Law; * Distributing a Rights of Nature Tribunal Toolkit and increasing the reach of ELC's Co-Violations Report through infographics, social media and other outreach campaigns; * Establishing global partnerships to launch rights of nature legal initiatives; and * Expanding educational programs internationally.

Discovery Innes' star was discovered in 1920 by Robert T. A. Innes in Union Observatory, Union of South Africa, who had discerned its large proper motion and a parallax of 0.337 arcsec. The discovery was published in Circular of the Union Observatory No. 49, hence its discovery name is UO 49, or In UOC 49. However, UO designations should be used with caution since they are often not unique for each star: the number in the name is the number of Circular, so all stars published in one Circular have identical names. So, all other newfound stars, published in the 49th Circular, may be named UO 49 too. Erroneous parallax It is known for the fact that it had once been considered one of the nearest stars to Earth, due to erroneously measured parallax. The estimated distance was less than 10 light- years in the following studies: *In List of stars nearer than 5 parsecs by Ejnar Hertzsprung (1922) its parallax is 0.339 arcsec (distance is 2.95 pc or 9.62 ly), and it is the 4th closest star system after Alpha Centauri ABC, Barnard's Star and Sirius AB; *In A study of the near-by stars by Willem Jacob Luyten and Harlow Shapley (1930) its parallax is 0.337 arcsec (distance is 2.97 pc or 9.68 ly), and it is the 4th closest star system after Alpha Centauri ABC, Barnard's Star and 22 H Camelopardalis (Sirius is further); *In List of stars nearer than five parsecs by Peter van de Kamp (1930) its parallax is 0.34 arcsec (distance is 2.94 pc or 9.59 ly), and it is the 7th closest star system after Alpha Centauri ABC, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius AB and BD-12 4523; *In Stars within ten parsecs of the Sun by Louise Freeland Jenkins (1937) its parallax is 0.34 arcsec (distance is 2.94 pc or 9.59 ly), and it is the 6th closest star system after Alpha Centauri, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185 and Sirius. Its actual distance is 12.667 pc or 41.32 light-years, based on parallax by van Leeuwen (2007) and Gaia DR2Gaia DR2 parallaxes archive: arcsec. Planetary system In 2014, a Mega-Earth or a mini-Neptune GJ 422 b of approximately 10-Earth- masses was discovered in the system of this star, orbiting the star every 20 days and lying at a distance of around 0.11 astronomical units (AU)‚Äî11% of the distance between our Earth and Sun ‚Äî on the inner edge of the stellar system's habitable zone, which for this star has been calculated to lie between 0.11 and 0.21 AU. The discovery of GJ 422 b was confirmed in 2020. Name Innes' Star is one of a few stars named after people ‚Äî named after a scientist, whereas the majority of proper names of stars have ancient origins or medieval, in the main Arabic, ones. Certain stars, found to be nearby due to their large proper motion, also fall into this class and are named after their discoverers: Barnard's Star; Kapteyn's Star; Luyten's Star; van Maanen's Star: van Biesbroeck's Star; and Teegarden's Star. Innes is also known as the discoverer of Proxima Centauri.

Early life and family James Davison was born in Derry, Ireland in 1827. He came to America at the age of three years, with his father, who worked as a weaver in New Jersey. The family returned to Ireland due to his father's health, as well as the failure of a business in New York to which his father had been in consignment. He was thirteen at the time. Aged 19, in 1846, James returned to America. He enlisted in Company G of the 2nd Ohio Infantry. He served under General Winfield Scott, in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After the war, the discovery of gold had become known, and he set out for California. Life in California Upon arrival, Davison engaged in mining for several years. He first mined near Nevada City and afterward on the Trinity River. A day's work gave him as much as $100, and over three years he saved $6,000. After quitting the mines, he engaged in the drug business at Weaverville, with his brother. There, he was also post office clerk under the administration of President James Buchanan. In 1857 he moved to Rabbit Creek (now La Porte), and opened a drug store. He was in business until the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1857, Davison married Agnes M. Waldron, a native of Pennsylvania; the couple had five children. In 1861, Davison enlisted in Company D, 4th California Volunteer Infantry. He was appointed Second Lieutenant, Assistant Quartermaster and Assistant Commissary, and was Commander of the Post at Fort YamHill, Oregon. After this he was promoted to First Lieutenant, Company C, same regiment, serving in Arizona, from where he and his company were sent to Camp Cady, until the close of the war. Having received his discharge he returned to San Francisco and worked in publishing the New Age, which he continued one year. Then he became a teacher for six months. From there he went to Colusa County and took possession of 160 acres of government land. In 1870 he came to Butte County.

Flyer of the Palazzo Salvati as reception center for pelgrims of the Holy Year 1950 History The palace was built in the first half of 16th century by Filippo Adimari, Camerlengo of Pope Leo X, on a plot of land for vineyard owned by Orazio Farnese. It is one of the greatest juvenile works by Giulio Romano. The long fa√ßade is symmetrically divided into five sections by vertical bossages; the big gate in the middle is surmounted by a balcony that lies on big shelves. At the first floor, Giulio Romano also designed a chapel in Bramante's style. In 1552 the palace was sold to Cardinal Giovanni Salviati and soon after its property was transferred to his brother Bernardo Salviati, Prior of the Order of Malta; in 1569 it was refurbished by Nanni di Baccio Bigio, who completed the elevation to its present aspect and enlarged the rear. The edifice was the residence of Cardinal Fulvio Giulio della Corgna, nephew of Pope Julius III, until his death in 1583: in 1571 his famous warrior brother Ascanio della Corgna, coming back from the battle of Lepanto, died in the palace. In 1794 the palace passed to the House of Borghese and, after other transfers of property (Paccanari, Lavaggi), in 1840 it was bought by the Papal State and used as the seat of the city archive and of a botanical garden. After the expropriation on behalf of the Italian State in 1870, the palace housed the military court and the military college. In 1933 the courtyard was closed by a new wing. A shrine commemorates the military institution, now suppressed. During World War II, in the period of the Nazi occupation, the rooms of the military college were used to lock in for some days (from 16 to 17 October 1943) a thousand Jews captured during the roundput in the Roman ghetto, before they were deported. The palace now houses the Istituto Alti Studi per la Difesa, with an important library specialized in military and geopolitical disciplines. In front of Palazzo Salviati formerly rose the Trastevere headboard of the Ponte dei Fiorentini, an iron suspension bridge built in 1863 close to the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini as an additional connection between the historic centre and the new quarter of Prati, then under construction. It was a toll bridge, realised by a French private company, and the toll booth rose close to Palazzo Salviati; the transit costed 20 cents (1 soldo), so the bridge was popularly known as Ponte del Soldino (\\"Bridge of the Little Soldo\\"). It was demolished in 1941 and replaced one year later by Ponte Principe Amedeo Savoia Aosta.About the history of the Ponte del Soldino, see here Bibliography * Gabriele Morolli (editor), Palazzo Salviati alla Lungara, Editalia, Rome 1991. *Touring Club Italiano, Roma, Milan 2004, p. 585  Notes  Category:Houses completed in the 16th century Salviati Category:Mannerist architecture in Italy Category:Rome R.

Biography Born in 1974 in Ho Chi Minh City to Hiep and Lien Nguyen, Nguyen earned a bachelor's degree in Women's Studies and a doctorate in Ethnic Studies from University of California, Berkeley. Her master's degree was in American Studies from New York University. She grew up in Minnesota and relocated to San Diego, California, where she was drawn to the D.I.Y. punk scene. Appointed in Gender and Women's Studies and Asian American Studies, Nguyen earned tenure in 2012 at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. She is a frequent conference keynote speaker or invited panelist, and received the Outstanding Book Award in Cultural Studies from the Association of Asian American Studies, 2014 for her first single-author monograph, The Gift of Freedom: War, Debt and Other Refugee Passages. Nguyen is possibly best known for her compilation zine Evolution of a Race Riot first published in 1997 with a second issue in 2002, in which she and contributors of color challenged racism in the punk scene. She also publishes the zine Slander and is a former Punk Planet columnist and Maximumrocknroll contributor. In June 2013, Sarah McCarry's Guillotine (\\"a series of erratically published chapbooks focused on revolutionary non- fiction\\") released PUNK, a conversation between Nguyen and Golnar Nikpour, which later informed a 2016 exhibition at the Arnolfini called \\"Moving Targets.\\" Nguyen also cofounded a fashion blog with Minh-Ha T. Pham that discusses the politics, history, and aesthetics of beauty and fashion.  Riot Grrrl  Nguyen lists the Riot Grrrl movement as one that is important and yet problematic. In her essay \\"Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival\\", Nguyen discusses the work the Riot Grrrl movement has done in calling attention to how a woman's personal experiences with sexual abuse, heteronormativity, and intimacy with other women are tied up with the political and social. Collectivity among women being one of Riot Grrrl's goals, Nguyen addresses race as an obstacle to that collectivity, highlighting the marginalization of women of color.  Evolution of a Race Riot zine  Nguyen created Evolution of a Race Riot as a compilation zine based in North America. Nguyen originally put out the first flier for zine submissions in August 1995 and the first issue was published in 1997. The entire zine is written by people of color mostly in the punk and Riot Grrrl scene. According to Nguyen in her introduction to the first issue of the zine, most of the submissions are written by mixed race or Asian-American people of color.

Since 2003, she dances with the Paris Opera Ballet, where she is a danseuse √©toile (the highest rank of the Paris Opera Ballet) since 2012.  Early life  Pagliero was born in Buenos Aires, in the Palermo district, to an electrician and a masseuse. At the age of 8, she started classical dance lessons, but it was a disappointment. She switched to jazz, but later went back to classical dance at the suggestion of her teacher. Her new dance teacher suggested she should participate in the entrance competition for the Instituto Superior de Arte of the Teatro Col√≥n. Though it was challenging, she was accepted, then 10 years old. There, Ludmila received training from Olga Ferri, among others. She said in an interview that \\"all [her] dreams of being a dancer were born at the Teatro Col√≥n\\". Career = Before the POB = She was offered a one- year contract at the Ballet of Santiago. This meant that she had to leave her family and move to another country at the age of 16. After some time at the Ballet of Santiago, she was promoted to soloist and danced more difficult roles, for example in The Sleeping Beauty and Theme and variations. In 2003, she participated in the New York International Ballet Competition, where she was awarded the silver medal and the Igor Youskevitch Award, the latter of which secured her a one-year contract with the American Ballet Theatre. Soon afterward, she made a trip to France to participate in an audition for the Paris Opera Ballet. There were 2 full-time contracts at stake, and she placed 5th. However, she later got a call for a temporary contract of three months, when she was already preparing to take the position at the ABT. She accepted the POB's offer. = Since joining the POB = When her initial contract, which was for Ivan The Terrible, ended, her contract was extended to the end of the season. In 2004, she participated in the international auditions a second time, again not winning a full-time position, but she was offered a contract as surnum√©raire, which is a dancer who fills in when someone from the corps becomes unavailable. She had trouble feeling at home, as the vast majority of POB employees join through the Paris Opera Ballet School. In 2005, she participated in the auditions again, this time earning a full-time contract. After that, with the help of Aur√©lie Dupont (training with dancers of higher ranks is a common practice at POB), she moved up the ranks through competing in the concours de promotion, eventually reaching the second-to highest rank, premi√®re danseuse, at the age of 26. Also in 2009, she received the Konex Award in the category \\"classical music\\". In March 2012, there was a planned performance and cinema relay of Rudolf Nureyev's La Bayad√®re, but both Doroth√©e Gilbert, who had been cast for Gamzatti, and the understudy were injured. Pagliero, who had bot performed the role in two years was asked to step in, and only had a quick rehearsal with Josua Hoffalt (Solor) and Dupont (Nikiya). At the end of the performance, the artistic director of the ballet announced Pagliero had been promoted to √©toile, the highest rank of the company, for \\"the talent and artistic courage she had shown.\\" This made her the first-ever South American √©toile. She has been part of international cooperations, such as with the Bolshoi Theatre and the Mariinsky Theatre.

These roles are largely associated with traditional Islamic family structures, wherein women's roles are closely tied to the domestic sphere and men's roles tied to the public sphere (see: Women in Egypt). Gender roles are based on assumed biological differences between the sexes and can lead to dramatically different life experiences as well as opportunities and outcomes for individuals. Consequently, when looking at a number of indicators, women often find themselves disadvantaged relative to men. In 2017, the UNDP's Gender Inequality Index (GII) rated Egypt 115th out of 189 countries, with an overall value of 0.449, where a score of zero represents perfect gender parity according to the metrics used. These indicators suggest strong gender-based disparities in areas of reproductive health, economic functioning, and overall empowerment. Reasons for inequalities are numerous; social norms and attitudes, economic pressures, religious beliefs, and structural forces all help maintain the status quo.  Legal status and marriage law  Marriage is the formal institution wherein women's different legal status is most apparent. Official age of consent for marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys, though child marriage of females still continues in certain areas without legal intervention. Divorce procedures differ by gender, with divorces being more freely granted to men. A man can divorce his wife by saying \\"you are divorced\\" three times. The proceeding is then formalized within 30 days by registering the divorce with a notary. Women are then entitled to financial maintenance for up to two years. Some women, when negotiating with their husbands for divorce, are willing to forfeit the financial assistance in exchange for him initiating the divorce. Women sometimes choose this option because of the legal red tape that is involved in wife-initiated divorce. In the past, women were required to prove the fault of the husband before being granted a divorce. In 2000, the law was amended by \\"The Law on Reorganization of Certain Terms and Procedures of Litigation in Personal Status Matters\\", a hotly contested legal act that broadened women's access to divorce. Under this new law, a woman could pursue a divorce without having to prove the fault of the husband. However, this type of divorce, 'khula', would mean a reduction in the woman's financial rights. The law is somewhat flexible in that it allows for the couple to adhere to conditions of divorce set up in advance. Women are still able to pursue a divorce through the traditional means wherein the fault of the husband must be proven. This method allows women greater financial rights and protections. With Egypt's political upheaval and legal turmoil, the future of women's legal rights within marriage (and other areas) are uncertain. Islamist and conservative groups have raised objections to the Khula Law. These groups also oppose the institutionalization of CEDAW (the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women). Egyptian marital laws also allow for multiple spouses for all Muslim men. The same allowances are not granted for women, though a wife has some say in whether or not her husband takes a second wife.  Political participation  As a group, women have been proportionally underrepresented in parliament and other civic offices. During the final years of Hosni Mubarak's leadership, women held 12 percent of parliamentary seats. While such a figure may be proportionally low, it is the highest level of female inclusion ever reached in Egypt. After the revolution that ousted Mubarak, the number of women in office decreased. The 2013 Human Development Report states that 2.2% parliamentary positions are held by women. As political participants, women have been active in the revolutions of the Arab Spring, as well as subsequent protests and debates regarding the future of their nation. Estimates suggest that as many as 55% of protesters were female and approximately 60% of people voting in the most recent election were female. In early 2014, equal rights and protections for women were included in the newest Egyptian constitution, reversing many of the restrictions imposed by the more conservative Mohamed Morsi regime. Although women are not guaranteed a minimum number of seats in parliament, laws forbidding discrimination based on gender was included. In addition, women are to be given access to higher judiciary positions for the first time. This has provided the legal framework for greater gender equality, though enforcement will determine its effectiveness. In February 2014, Egypt elected its first female political party leader; Hala Shukrallah, a Coptic Christian, was elected to represent the Constitution Party.  Education  Literacy rates for young adults (15- to 24-year-olds) show some gender-based disparity. As of 2011, overall literacy rates were 93.2% of men and 86.5% women. These numbers have increased dramatically over recent years as Egypt has made greater financial investments in this sector. Because of vast improvements in Egypt's education system, younger generations are much more likely to be literate than the older generations. The most disadvantaged group are rural adult women. The 2006 Human Development Report (HDR) estimated that only 15% of female household heads in rural areas were literate. Egypt has made significant progress in narrowing the primary and secondary education gap between boys and girls. As of 2010, the female to male ratio was 0.96. New generations of Egyptians have placed a higher value on female education than in the past. In 2011 it is estimated that of the 2.6 million students enrolled in tertiary education, 51% of them were female. This is significantly higher than the Arab regional and global averages of 24% and 29% respectively.  Employment  Participation in the labor force shows substantial differences between the genders. While unemployment rates are high, evidence suggests a substantial male bias in hiring. As of 2012, women made up 24.2% of the labor force, a percentage that has remained stagnant for no less than two decades. The World Bank reports that women face far more hostility in the overall business environment, citing a finding that showed \\"...female-owned firms in Egypt report needing 86 weeks on average to resolve a conflict through the legal system, compared to 54 weeks for male-owned firms.\\" Unemployment rates are high for all young Egyptians, though it is particularly high for females. A 2010 study showed that only 13.4% of women in the 15‚Äì29 age bracket are employed or looking for work. Although more women are economically active in the upper income quintiles, they are still underrepresented at 35.1% of women with a vocational or post-secondary education. University graduated women are significantly more economically active than women with less education at 46.7%. However, at least 80% of all men in all income brackets are employed or looking for work.  Health  = Life expectancy = Given normal circumstances, women on average outlive men. Life expectancy in Egypt is consistent with this biological reality. Women live an estimated 76.2 years and men 70.82 years. = Reproductive and maternal health = Women's access to contraception and family planning may be limited, with 60.3% of women using contraception of any kind. Younger women appear to be more likely to use contraception than older generations. A 2011 Population Fund survey found that 75% of married women aged 15‚Äì29 have used contraception. Adolescent fertility rates in Egypt were 44 per 1000 in 2012, significantly higher than most economically developed countries and likely a result of early marriage and lack of universal access to family planning services. Between 1992 and 2000 Egypt made tremendous gains in reducing maternal mortality rates - a drop of 52% (174/100,000 to 84/100,000). The rate has since decreased further to 66/100,000. A woman's lifetime risk of dying during childbirth is 1:490. = HIV/AIDS = As of 2012, known HIV infection rates are virtually the same for both sexes at .1%, making it one of the lowest rates in Africa. However, lack of widespread public awareness, discreet testing options, and social stigma may contribute to an underestimation of cases of infection. Despite low infection rates, international organizations like UNICEF are expressing some concern. Young women with comprehensive knowledge about the disease has decreased in recent years from 62% (2005) to 30% (2008). UNICEF also reports that the number of young people aware that HIV infection could be prevented with condoms dropped from 22% to 13%.  Gender-based violence  = Sexual harassment = Most Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment. Frequency of reported incidences vary. However, in one of the most recent studies, an April 2013 UN survey shows that 99.3% of women have experienced sexual harassment. A January 2011 survey of youth stated the 13.5% of women felt that sexual harassment was the most serious risk they face on Egypt's streets on a day-to-day basis. 15.9% felt it was the greatest risk when using bus transportation and 23% felt it was the greatest risk they face when taking the train. This survey was taken before the epidemic of sexual violence that accompanied recent episodes of widespread public unrest. = Sexual violence = Total incidence of sexual violence are difficult to measure as many women are reluctant to come forth due to the social stigma attached associated with sexual victimization. Most cases of rape and sexual assault are not brought to the attention of authorities or prosecuted. Shame, fear of being blamed, loss of face, or in some cases, fear of being a victim of \\"honor killing\\" prevents most women from seeking help. Despite these difficulties, the Egyptian Interior Ministry estimates there are no less than 20,000 women raped annually. With the unrest associated with the 2011 revolution and political strife in Egypt, normal social order has been disrupted. As a result, hundreds of women have been victims of random sexual violence in public. Tahrir Square has been the site of many such assaults, with 150 attacks against women by groups of men reported during the single week of Hosni Mubarak's ouster. Again, during the removal of Mohamed Morsi and the subsequent social unrest and jubilation in Tahrir in 2013, 80 women were subjected to sexual violence by mobs of men in one night. There were a total of no less than 169 cases of such attacks against women during that week. Attacks against women appear to have been carried out in a premeditated fashion by men emboldened with a sense of impunity. Attitudes regarding sexual violence against women provide considerable obstacles in regard to mobilizing public action against it. In early 2012, members of Egypt's upper parliamentary house engaged in victim-blaming, with one representative saying, \\"Women contribute 100% to their rape because they put themselves in that position.\\" While this attitude is not representative of all Egyptians, it is widespread enough to present challenges for women who participate in the political action. Such attitudes toward women and prevalence of sexual violence and harassment against them, contribute substantially to Egypt being named the worst Arab state for women by an extensive Thomas Reuters Foundation study. = Intimate partner/domestic violence = The 2009 UNFPA Violence Against Women Summary Finding confirmed that spousal violence is a significant problem in Egypt. Studies from 1995 to 2005 showed no decrease in prevalence, though some methodological inconsistencies in surveys between those years makes direct comparison somewhat complicated. The study showed that in 2005, 33% of women reported having been subject to some form of physical violence by their current or previous husband. These rates decreased in higher income and education brackets, although approximately one quarter of women in those highest brackets report having been \\"beaten\\" by their husbands at some point during their marriage. = Female genital mutilation (FGM) = Female genital mutilation, also called female circumcision, involves removal of some or all of a female's genitalia. More severe - and far less common - forms involve complete removal of the genitals and sewing up of the vagina until only a very small hole remains for urine and menstrual blood vacate. FGM is commonplace in Egypt, with an estimated 90-97% of women undergoing some version of the procedure. The practice is deeply engrained in the culture and predates both Christianity and Islam. Its main purpose is to preserve chastity, though its social function is very complicated. FGM is seen by all major international human rights organizations as a violation of a woman's bodily integrity and sexual health. Numbers of circumcised females decrease in lower age brackets. Among all females surveyed in a 2011 study of over 15,000 individuals, 75.5% of women aged 10‚Äì29 report being circumcised. The practice appears to be more common in rural areas where 83.7% of females have experienced FGM. While these numbers are lower than older age brackets, they are largely consistent with the 10- to 29-year-old group surveyed in an identical 2008 study. This would suggest that any decline in practice has slowed significantly or stagnated. The same study showed the majority of respondents, both male and female, believed that circumcision was necessary for girls (64%). More men (70.3%) believed it was needed than women (57.6%). Belief in the practice is stronger in the lower income quintiles and considerably weaker in the upper quintiles. FGM was banned in Egypt in 2007. In 2015 the first conviction for performing FGM took place.  The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)  Egypt is a signatory to The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women. CEDAW was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1979. The treaty seeks to define discrimination against women as a human rights issue, create a plan of action to address gender disparities, and to hold nations accountable. Countries that ratify the convention pledge to take strong steps in order to end discriminatory practices and violence against women. To date, 189 countries have signed CEDAW. Egypt, along with a significant number of countries, ratified the convention, spelling out numerous reservations. Egypt made the following reservations: * Women should not have equal rights to determine the nationality of their children. A woman's child in Egypt shall always be the nationality of the father. * Marriage laws, based on sacrosanct religious believes, should remain as is. Women must seek a divorce through the ruling of a judge whereas men have no such requirement. * Egypt is not bound by the section of article 1 (definition of discrimination against females) that requires the submission to any body of arbitration to resolve disputes between the State and the Convention. * Egypt will not comply to any part of the Convention that runs counter to Islamic law. The new constitution, ratified in January 2014, appears to take a different approach to women's rights as they relate to CEDAW. The constitution now states that women have equal right to give pass citizenship to their children. Egypt's intentions to uphold and pursue the goals of CEDAW in general have also been emphasized and codified.

Over the past few years, Teespring has had to make significant reforms to its safety operations in response to criticism over apparel that promoted violence and racist messaging.  Business model  Individuals create campaigns in order to sell custom products on Teespring. Campaign creators are expected to design and market the product themselves. Teespring fulfills orders on campaigns that have reached a minimum sales goal (called \\"tipped\\" campaigns), and ships items to the buyers. Products are printed or manufactured in various screen-printing facilities. Teespring handles distribution of the products and customer service. Teespring offers various apparel such as t-shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, leggings and children's wear.  History  Brown University students Walker Williams and Evan Stites-Clayton first attempted to create a company linking students with internships called Jobzle in 2010. When the popular, student-oriented Providence dive bar Fish Co. appeared to be going out of business in 2011, they designed t-shirts that said \\"FREE FISHCO\\". Unable to pay to print a batch of t-shirts, they created a one-page website where the shirts could be pre-ordered. While they needed 200 orders to cover their costs, they sold over 400 t-shirts, making $2,000 for themselves. After receiving numerous requests from other organizations asking for a custom campaign, Walker and Evan decided to pursue the concept of crowdfunded custom apparel full-time. Rhode Island angel investors Bill Cesare and Mark Weiner invested the first $600,000 in seed funding. The company officially launched in October 2012 in Providence, Rhode Island.  Growth  In October 2012, the company announced they had reached over $500,000 in monthly sales. In March 2013, the company reported $750,000 in monthly revenue and a 50% month-over- month growth rate. In December 2013, Teespring was accepted into the start-up accelerator Y-Combinator which is based in Mountain View, California. Within two weeks of finishing the three-month accelerator, Teespring raised another $1.3 million including $500,000 from Sam Altman, then president at Y-Combinator. In January 2014, Teespring closed a Series A round of $20 million from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Andreessen partner Laars Dalgaard, formerly of SuccessFactors, led the investment, his first with the firm. In November 2014, partner Keith Rabois joined the company's board and the company announced the closure of its Series B funding round with $35 million from Khosla Ventures and also including Andreessen. A new manufacturing facility in Kentucky was expected to create hundreds of jobs and by 2015, Teespring had expanded to around 300 employees in the United States.Perez, Sarah. \\"Custom Apparel Platform Teespring Acquires London-Based Fabrily To Expand Internationally\\". TechCrunch. January 28, 2015. The company had employed 120 workers in Providence before reducing the number to 52 by June 2015. By 2016, the entire Rhode Island staff had been laid off and the company announced plans to close its office there.  Criticism  Teespring has been criticized for creating apparel that promotes violence and includes racist messaging. While the company claims that it monitors designs for offensive content, it has continually gained attention for its controversial designs. =2017= In May 2017, Teespring caused controversy by selling T-shirts that featured the words, \\"Black Women Are Trash,\\" resulting in many Twitter users calling for a boycott of the platform. Teespring's director of seller success, Brett Miller, responded, \\"Once we learned of the error we immediately took steps to remove all content in question and ban the offending seller from our platform. We have since fixed the issue.\\" In August 2017, Teespring was blamed for selling products claiming to \\"reclaim\\" the swastika, considered a symbol of hate. KA Design listed rainbow swastika designs on Teespring in an attempt to rebrand the contested symbol used by the Nazis. Jewish groups called for a boycott of Teespring following news of the controversial products. Another t-shirt offered on the site in October 2017 bore the message \\"Eat Sleep Rape Repeat\\". In November 2017, Walmart removed a shirt bearing the words \\"Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required\\" from its website, following a complaint from Radio Television Digital News Association, a journalist advocacy group. The shirt was listed on Walmart's website through Teespring (as a third-party seller). Time magazine reported that at the time, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, there had been 35 physical attacks on journalists so far in 2017. An analysis by USA Today found that the site was selling t-shirts reading \\"Hitler Did Nothing Wrong\\" and one with an image of Bill Cosby paired with the slogan \\"drinks on me ladies\\". =2018= In April 2018, the company came under fire for providing items for sale that celebrated Dylann Roof, a neo-Nazi mass murderer. In June 2018, an article by Alex Dalbey in The Daily Dot detailed criticism on social media of Teespring for pulling a line of T-shirts featuring the term \\"TERFs\\" (short for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists). The most notable design stated \\"Fuck TERFs\\". Teespring said the T-shirt \\"violates our Hate Speech section of our acceptable use policy\\". In 2018, a Women's March spokesperson told CNN that \\"many of these fake pages are used to sell merchandise, with the proceeds benefiting individuals instead of our movement. The efforts to capitalize on movement work isn't new, but it is frustrating, particularly as we make an effort to only sell ethically sourced and produced merchandise ‚Äî a rule these imposter pages don't abide by.\\" =2020= Following the death of Caroline Flack in February 2020, Teespring received criticism for selling counterfeit versions of the \\"Be Kind\\" t-shirts created by Leigh Francis to raise money for mental health charity The Samaritans. Teespring received criticism for allowing the sale of the counterfeit t-shirts to go ahead, preventing the charity from receiving funds. In August 2020 Teespring reported that the word 'antifa' was in violation of their acceptable use policy.

As a Lutheran, he sided with the Protestant Bohemians at the beginning of the Bohemian phase of the Thirty Years War, when the province was overrun by Imperial forces. As a competent officer his advice was often overlooked, especially at the Battle of White Mountain that took place on November 8, 1620. The battle was a defeat for the Protestant Bohemians by Imperial forces. After the defeat he changed to the Imperial side and became a member of the Imperial War Council. Von Schlick continued fighting for the Imperial forces under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, during the Danish Phase of the Thirty Years War 1626-1628. Von Schlick was at the Battle of Lutter fought on August 26‚Äì27, 1626. Von Schlick was also in command of an Infantry Regiment Schlick, composed of Bohemians. He ended his military career in 1630.

Thatte. 1986. Persistent memory: a storage architecture for object-oriented database systems. In Proceedings on the 1986 international workshop on Object-oriented database systems (OODS '86). IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, USA, 148-159. Often confused with non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM), persistent memory is instead more closely linked to the concept of persistence in its emphasis on program state that exists outside the fault zone of the process that created it. (A process is a program under execution. The fault zone of a process is that subset of program state which could be corrupted by the process continuing to execute after incurring a fault, for instance due to an unreliable component used in the computer executing the program.) Efficient, memory-like access is the defining characteristic of persistent memory.P. Mehra and S. Fineberg, \\"Fast and flexible persistence: the magic potion for fault-tolerance, scalability and performance in online data stores,\\" 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2004. Proceedings., Santa Fe, NM, USA, 2004, pp. 206-. doi: 10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1303232 It can be provided using microprocessor memory instructions, such as load and store. It can also be provided using APIs that implement remote direct memory access (RDMA) actions, such as RDMA read and RDMA write. Other low-latency methods that allow byte-grain access to data also qualify. Persistent memory capabilities extend beyond non-volatility of stored bits. For instance, the loss of key metadata, such as page table entries or other constructs that translate virtual addresses to physical addresses, may render durable bits non-persistent. In this respect, persistent memory resembles more abstract forms of computer storage, such as file systems. In fact, almost all existing persistent memory technologies implement at least a basic file system that can be used for associating names or identifiers with stored extents, and at a minimum provide file system methods that can be used for naming and allocating such extents.

She is the Curtis and Kathleen Marble Professor of Astrophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she is also the Dean of the university's School of Science. She was previously the Associate Head of the university's Department of Physics She was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2010. Mavalvala is best known for her work on the detection of gravitational waves in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, but she has also obtained prominent results on other physics problems that evolved out of LIGO: for example, she has performed pioneering experiments on laser cooling of macroscopic objects and in the generation of squeezed quantum states of light. Personal life Mavalvala was born in Lahore and raised in Karachi, Pakistan. She attended the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Karachi, where she received her O-Level and A-Level qualifications. She moved to the United States in 1986 and enrolled at Wellesley College, where she received a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy in 1990. Before she graduated in 1990, Mavalvala and her physics professor, Robert Berg, co-authored a paper in Physical Review B: Condensed Matter. She also helped set up his lab. She then joined Dr. Rainer Weiss's group in the MIT physics department, and received her PhD in 1997. Born to a Parsi family, Mavalvala was the younger of the two children. Mavalvala's parents highly valued their daughters' educational experiences, and encouraged Mavalvala to pursue higher education overseas. Mavalvala was always interested in math and science as a child, and believed that she was intrinsically good at it, in contrast to the humanities.Nergis Mavalvala: The Karachiite who went on to detect Einstein's gravitational waves.

A lesbian, Mavalvala and her partner have two children and reside in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States. Mavalvala has extended family in Karachi and visited the city in 2010. Being openly lesbian and Pakistani, Mavalvala gets a lot of questions based on her identity and roots. Mavalvala was not aware of her sexual orientation until after college. She stands out as an immigrant of Pakistan who describes herself as an \\"out, queer person of color.\\" VenkatramanJun, V., PainApr, E., PainMar, E., NobeliFeb, I., & PainSep, E.

Retrieved March 25, 2018, from http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2012/06/gravitational-wave-researcher- succeeds-being-herself Mavalvala is frequently questioned about gender roles and how she was able to break through the barrier and was able to pursue the career of her choice. In an interview with the Pakistani newspaper Dawn Mavalvala states, \\"I grew up in a family where the stereotypical gender roles were not really observed.\\" She also speaks about the ability of individuals in Pakistan to break these gender roles and stigmas: \\"Anybody should be able to do those things. And I am proof of that because I am all of those things. With the right combination of opportunity, it was possible for me to do.\\" Mavalvala is often viewed as a role model for aspiring female scientists with roots in the Indian subcontinent. As a young child Mavalvala was always involved in handy work, and was not bound to stereotypical gender roles in subcontinent culture, due to the way her sister and she were raised. Mavalvala states that a lot of her success is accredited to good mentors in both the United States and Pakistan that encouraged her academic ability. In a television interview in 2016, Mavalvala stated that, \\"When everyone has access to education that's when all the other things come into place... [You've] got to do what gives you pleasure, gotta find a way to do it. People should just do what they enjoy most and i think for all of society whether it's in Pakistan or elsewhere we have to create opportunities for young girls to do what they're good at and do what they love to do must cultivate the sense of wonder in a child\\" Neo Tv Network - Exclusive Interview Of Nerjis Mavalvala [Television broadcast].

Retrieved March 25, 2018, from https://tribune.com.pk/story/1046004/scientific-breakthrough-pakistan-born- scientist-played-part-in-discovery/ and then eventually working on the LIGO. Mavalvala mainly focuses on two fields of physics: Gravitational Waves Astrophysics and quantum measurement science. Dr. Mavalvala joined the MIT physics faculty in 2002. In 2017 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. = Detection of gravitational waves = Mavalvala was among the team of scientists who, for the first time, observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves. Mavalvala has been working on gravitational waves since 1991. It was announced to the public on 11 February 2016. The detection confirmed a major prediction of Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity. After the announcement of the observation, she became an instant celebrity scientist in her birthplace of Pakistan. Talking to the press she claimed that \\"we are really witnessing the opening of a new tool for doing astronomy.\\" During an interview with Pakistani newspaper Dawn, after the detection of gravitational waves, she claimed that she was baffled by public interest in her research in Pakistan. She said \\"I really thought of what I want people to know in Pakistan as I have garnered some attention there. Anybody should be able to succeed ‚Äî whether you're a woman, a religious minority or whether you're gay. It just doesn't matter.\\" In a statement by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister praised Mavalvala, calling her a source of inspiration for Pakistani scientists and students aspiring to become future scientists. He also stated that \\"the entire nation is proud of her valuable contribution.\\" On 20 February 2016, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Jalil Abbas Jilani, conveyed the Government of Pakistan's message of felicitation to Mavalvala for her outstanding achievement in the field of astrophysics. He also invited her to re-visit Pakistan, which she accepted. = Laser cooling = Optical cooling of mirrors to nearly absolute zero can help eliminate measurement noise arising from thermal vibrations. Part of Mavalvala's work focused on the extension of laser-cooling techniques to optically cool and trap more and more massive objects, both for the LIGO project and for other applications, such as to enable observation of quantum phenomena in macroscopic objects. Prominent results from her group in this area included cooling of a centimeter-scale object to a temperature of 0.8 kelvins and observation of a 2.7-kilogram pendulum near its quantum ground state. These experiments lay the foundations for observing quantum behavior in human-scale objects. = Quantum states of light = Mavalvala has also worked on the development of exotic quantum states of light, and in particular the generation of light in squeezed coherent states.Dave Reitze, Squeezed Light Experiment a Glowing Success!, LIGO Laboratory News (28 October 2011).Ulrik L. Andersen, Quantum optics: Squeezing more out of LIGO, Nature Photonics: News and Views, volume 7, pp. 589‚Äì590 (2013). By injecting such states into the kilometer-scale Michelson interferometer of the LIGO detectors, her group greatly improved the sensitivity of the detector by reducing quantum noise; such squeezed states also have many other applications in experimental physics. Awards and recognition *2017, Mavalvala won the first Lahore Technology Award launched by Information Technology University *2017, the Carnegie Corporation of New York honored Mavalvala as one of its Great Immigrants awards recipients.

He is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton University affiliated with the Center for Information Technology Policy, and was previously a PhD student in computer science at Stanford University and a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society and the Center for International Security and Cooperation. During his graduate studies he was a consultant at the California Department of Justice. Mayer's research focuses on technology policy, especially concerning computer security and privacy. He was selected as one of Forbes 30 Under 30 in 2014 for his contributions to those areas. Biography Mayer is a Chicago, Illinois, United States, native and attended the Latin School of Chicago. He received his AB from Princeton University in 2009 through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. During his undergraduate studies he was a member of the team competing in the 2007 DARPA Grand Challenge and Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. Mayer began his graduate work at Stanford University in 2009, where he was its first student to pursue both a PhD through the computer science department and a JD at Stanford Law School. Mayer received his JD in 2013. Web browser fingerprinting Mayer's research when at Princeton studied the feasibility of tracking web browsers with partial identifiers like display resolution and extensions. His advisor was Professor Edward William Felten. Mayer's research found that it was possible to fingerprint web browsers, but could not guarantee the global uniqueness of a browser's fingerprint. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's subsequent study reached the same conclusions using a bigger data set. There are businesses now using browser fingerprints in products. Do Not Track In mid-2010, Mayer and another Stanford researcher Arvind Narayanan argued for Do Not Track in HTTP headers. They built Do Not Track prototypes for clients and servers. Working with Mozilla, they wrote the influential Internet Engineering Task Force Internet Draft of Do Not Track. Ultimately the World Wide Web Consortium has begun standardizing Do Not Track through the Tracking Protection Working Group. Mayer was an active and influential participant in this group and has been described as \\"key spokesperson\\" who had a \\"more interesting and productive career as a student than most tenured faculty\\". Mayer's thoughts about Do Not Track have concerned online advertising businesses. Randall Rothenberg, CEO of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, called him a \\"Bolshevik of the Internet world\\" and \\"anathema to anybody who's trying to earn any kind of living using the digital supply chain.\\" At one point, the Senior Director of IAB tried to get Mayer kicked out of his studies at Stanford . On July 30, 2013 Mayer resigned from his job with the W3C working group. His resignation letter faulted advertising members for impeding progress and W3C for bad leadership. Some working group members later tried to bring him back as a leader but this did not happen. Web tracking practices Between 2011 and 2012 Mayer posted on illegal web tracking businesses. His contributions include the following. * Most advertising businesses track users even after users opt out of cookies. * Epic Marketplace has used CSS history sniffing to uncover medical and financial information for advertising purposes. The business contested Mayer's research as \\"bogus\\". However, the Federal Trade Commission later brought complaints against Epic Marketplace, citing Mayer's research. * Microsoft has used ETags to track people and create zombie cookies on some websites. Microsoft stopped this practice after it was brought to their attention. * User websites leak personal information to other websites. In 2012, Mayer found leaks on Barack Obama's and Mitt Romney's election websites even though both candidates claimed that all this information was anonymous.Andy Greenberg, , Forbes, 1/11/12 * Google and other businesses have circumvented Apple Safari cookie blocking, as the 'Wall Street Journal reported on its first page. After this, the Federal Trade Commission fined Google $22.5 million. Google settled with state attorneys general for $17 million. This FTC fine was the largest in that agency's history. Mobile application privacy policies The California Online Privacy Protection Act requires websites to post privacy policies. Attorney General Kamala Harris argued that this law applies to mobile applications as well. Mayer was a consultant for implementing that law on mobile applications. That initiative produced a large settlement with all mobile platforms on February 22, 2012. Mozilla Firefox cookie blocking In December 2012, Mayer proposed that Mozilla Firefox use the same cookie blocking mechanism as Apple Safari. He wrote the code patch as a community contributor and Mozilla adopted it. Representatives from the online advertising business have objected and criticize both Mayer and Mozilla. Businesses also had Congress members write letters to Mozilla. It was expressing false concerns about abducted children and natural disasters.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served on the Philadelphia City Council as a representative of the city's 8th district. Born in New York and educated in Europe, Dallas came to Philadelphia as a teenager. After marriage and raising children, she entered local politics as a reform-minded Democrat. Following an unsuccessful run for City Council in 1947, she was elected in 1951, the first woman to serve in that legislative body. Dallas was elected as part of a coalition between the Democratic Party organization and reforming independents who wished to challenge the Republican city government. The reforms in question focused many on shifting power from the city council to the mayor and in converting the longstanding patronage system to convert to a merit system of city employment. Her reformist tendencies clashed with some of the party organization, and she went down to defeat in 1955. After a second career as a newspaper editor and investment banker, she retired in 1978 and died in 1983. Early life Dallas was born Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the daughter of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Company. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, the daughter of inventor David Brooks, and had served as president of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II. She married George Mifflin Dallas in 1925. They had three children: Constance Hopkins Dallas, Edith Wharton Dallas, and George Mifflin Dallas, Jr. Her husband was descended from a Philadelphia family that included his namesake, George Mifflin Dallas, who was Vice President of the United States from 1845 to 1849, and Alexander J. Dallas, who was Secretary of the Treasury under James Madison. He worked as an executive of the American Briquet Company, and Dallas devoted the early years of her marriage to child-rearing and keeping house, as well as volunteering at Pennsylvania Hospital. Political career =Elections= Dallas became involved in politics in the 1940s. \\"My life in the outside world began after I was 40,\\" she said in a 1979 interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer.. In another interview that year, she said that she was not very interested in politics at the time; though she ran for city council in 1947 she only did so when mayoral candidate Richardson Dilworth assured her she would lose. Democratic ward leaders asked her to run for City Council that year because, according to Dallas, \\"they needed a woman and a Protestant, and they got two for one in me.\\" Dallas was one of two women the Democrats nominated that year. She was nominated in the 6th district which sent four members to City Council under the 1919 city charter. Her first campaign was unsuccessful; in those days, Republicans dominated the city's politics and in 1947 all four of their candidates for councilman in the 6th district were elected. Dallas placed sixth, second among the four Democrats nominated. In 1951, she ran again for city council, and was successful. The election was the first held under the city's new charter, which had been approved by the voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans for the first time in 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi- member council districts). =City Council= Dallas was the first woman on City Council, which brought challenges, not least of which was determining how other council members would treat her. She began by insisting that they not call her \\"Mrs. Dallas.\\" and that they use the title \\"councilman,\\" not \\"councilwoman,\\" since that was how it was written in the city charter. \\"In private life, I'm Mrs. George Dallas,\\" she told a reporter shortly after the election, \\"but in public life I'm Constance H. Dallas. I object to the use of Mrs.\\" The electoral majority that brought the Democrats to power in 1951 combined organization Democrats with reform-minded independents. While successful in winning the election, the coalition started to fray soon after taking office. By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell just short of the two- thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. In doing so, Dallas worked against the wishes of Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr., siding instead with the reform-minded mayor, Joseph S. Clark, Jr. Dallas crossed party leadership in other ways, as well. She sided with the city fire department in voting for an ordinance to allow truck traffic on Henry Avenue. The measure was opposed by John B. Kelly, Sr., the former Democratic City Committee chairman whose house was on that street. She also took a special interest in the city's decrepit prisons, blaming management appointed by the former Republican administration for the prisons' conditions. Dallas's major success in City Council was the passage of the city's first air pollution ordinance, which she sponsored. She also worked to set up the Tinicum Wildlife Preserve in Southwest Philadelphia (now a part of the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum.) Her splits with party leadership contributed to her re-election defeat in 1955. As the Democrats swept to victory in the mayoral race and in the other nine councilmanic districts, Dallas lost to Republican Wilbur H. Hamilton (the brother of her 1951 opponent) by 457 votes, with 520 votes going to a third-party candidate, J. Warren Keel. Speaking later of her electoral defeat, Dallas said \\"I said I couldn't put my organization above my constituents. Now that makes me sound pious and goody-goody, but I couldn't‚Äîso I got defeated.\\" She did not run for elected office again. Later life After her defeat, Dallas worked in private business after her husband suffered several strokes and was forced to retire. Initially, she worked as an associate editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. In 1959, she was hired as an investment banker at Dehaven & Townsend, Crouter & Bodine. As in politics, she was one of a few women working in a male-dominated profession. When her husband died, Dallas moved out of their Chestnut Hill home to a retirement community in Delaware County, but continued working until the age of 76. She also remained active on several charitable boards including serving as a commissioner of Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) and in the nonpartisan watchdog group, the Committee of Seventy. She died on January 13, 1983, and was buried alongside her husband in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.

They are managed by bremenports GmbH & Co. KG, a company of private status in public property. In 2011, in the Ports of Bremen more than 60 million tons of goods were transported, including 6 million containers and 2.1 million cars. Bremerhaven Harbour is the world's busiest port transporting cars.  History  = Medieval harbours = The first port of Bremen was the Balge, a narrow branch of the Weser river. In the mid-13th century, on Bremen city's riverside of the main river, a quay was built, called the Schlachte. For about three centuries, both ports were used in parallel, before Balge harbour stopped being used. = Outer Harbours = Like in many other European regions, the medieval extension of agriculture increased erosion of soil in the Weser basin. Since about 1400, the bed of the lower Weser was choked with sand, dramatically. Laden sea vessels could no longer run upriver to Bremen city. Ships were discharged on riverboats in the open lower Weser. In 1622/23, Bremen's first outer harbour was founded in Vegesack, 20 km downstream of Bremen. Soon it was lacking depth, too. Finding a more durable outer harbour site was difficult, as the neighbouring territorial states preferred to patronize their own ports. Finally in 1827, the state of Bremen succeeded to buy the ground of the relics of Swedish foundation Carlsburg on the mouth of the Geeste river into the Weser estuary. In 1830 the first port of Bremerhaven was opened. = Emigrants = In 1832, Bremen passed a law for human standards for emigrant passengers in overseas traffic. For some decades the ports of Bremen became the most important emigrant harbour of central Europe. = Weser Correction and modern basins = Bremen free port in 1918 After Bremen in 1847 was linked to the Royal Hanoverian State Railways, the Bremish state built its own short railway line from the (Hanoverian) station to the bank of the river Weser near the edge of the old city. The goods station on the new quay, called Weserbahnhof, was one of the most modern links between land transport and sea trade of that age. In the last quarter of the 19th century, a way was found to employ the help of natural powers to use the lower Weser as an efficient waterway for modern sea vessels. Ludwig Franzius, building superintendent of Bremen, recorded the hydrology of the lower Weser for several years. In 1881, he published a convincing project. In 1887 to 1895, works were done under his management. In the meantime, in Bremen city some modern basins were built. When in 1888 the state of Bremen joined the German Customs Union, the Europahafen became a free port that was later enlarged by other new basins. = Since mid 20th century = Converted warehouses in √úberseestadt Over the last decades, the ports of Bremen have seen the same developments as most other ports of the world: * Overseas passenger traffic has switched to air transport. * Mixed cargo has been displaced by container transport. * The increase of the size of sea vessels. The reactions were: * In 1964, Bremen's first container port was opened, the Neust√§dter Hafen. * Since the 1970s, a line of container terminals were built north of the older ports of Bremerhaven, on the bank of the Weser estuary on the edge of the open sea. * The √úberseehafen, which opened in 1906, was taken out of service in 1991. In 1998, the basin was filled up with soil excavated in the maintaining of the shipping lane of outer Weser estuary. This reclaimed land has provided space for a new urban district, called √úberseestadt.

Norwitch was born in Odessa, Russia (present-day Ukraine) in 1894 and emigrated to the United States with his family as a child. Initially settling in Baltimore, Norwitch went to work at a clothing factory from the age of 13. He married Mae Schreiber in about 1917; they had two children, Mildred and Bernard. Norwitch became affiliated with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union and moved to Philadelphia in 1926 to work as a business agent for the Joint Board Cutters and Trimmers Local 110. His union work brought him into local politics, and he became active in the Nonpartisan League, a socialist group, in 1934. He joined the Democratic Party and served as a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where President Harry S. Truman was nominated for a new term. In 1949, Norwitch ran for a seat on Philadelphia's City Council in a special election that followed the death of L. Wallace Egan. Every seat on the Council was, at that time, held by Republicans, but Norwitch emerged the victor in his West Philadelphia district, defeating Republican James H. McHale, Progressive Lillian R. Narins, and independent Democrat Michael J. O'Connor. He and Maxwell E. Seidman, elected the same day, made up the council's entire Democratic caucus. In 1951, Norwitch was reelected to Philadelphia City Council from West Philadelphia's 3rd district, part of a Democratic wave that swept the Republicans from power for the first time in 67 years. In 1954, he successfully opposed the efforts fellow Democrats James Hugh Joseph Tate and Michael J. Towey to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter. The following year, he was reelected with a slightly reduced majority. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed again. Norwitch remained opposed, but the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The referendum failed in a vote that April. That same year, Norwitch sponsored a bill to extend the city's rent control policy. The bill passed, but was struck down by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that December. In 1959, Norwitch ran for a fourth Council term and defeated Republican Abraham Levin with 63.7% of the vote, his greatest margin to date. As chairman of City Council's appropriations committee, Norwitch was involved with decisions about taxation and spending. In the early 1960s, he joined with Council President Tate to oppose the tax hikes called for by Mayor Richardson Dilworth, while continuing to advocate the city worker wage increases the new taxes were intended to fund. Ultimately, Council and the mayor agreed to a budget that was the largest in the city's history, including a wage tax hike from 1.5% to 1.625%. Norwitch defended the deal, noting that city workers' salaries lagged behind the rest of the nation, and that the tax increase was evenly spread between wage and property taxes. Norwitch also voted for increased funding for police and schools. In 1963, Norwitch ran for a fifth term. He had no primary election opposition and easily defeated Republican Mary Jane Ladner, getting 59% of the vote. That same year, Norwitch testified before a grand jury investigating campaign contributions to him by a laundry business while a bill regulating such businesses was before the Council. Norwitch claimed there was no connection between the two, and was never charged. After Tate was elected mayor, Norwitch continued to support him, and clashed with fellow Democrat and City Council President Paul D'Ortona over taxation issues. In a change from his position of a few years earlier, Norwitch held the line on spending, voting to stop proposed pay increases for some city workers. In his attempt at re-election in 1967, Norwitch did not receive the endorsement of the Democratic City Committee, which remained neutral in his race against his primary opponents. He accused party chairman Francis R. Smith of pitting blacks against whites and seeking a \\"racial fight when all Philadelphians should be working hand-in- hand to solve the problems of our big city.\\" Norwitch blamed Smith for redistricting changes that made his 3rd district predominantly black, which had not been the case before. After calling the Democratic machine \\"self- serving\\" and calling Smith's tactics \\"despicable,\\" Norwitch quit the race; the Democratic City Committee then endorsed local attorney and ward leader Charles L. Durham, who went on to win the primary and general elections. After his retirement, Tate appointed Norwitch deputy managing director of the city. Norwitch died of heart failure at Albert Einstein Medical Center in 1973, and was buried in Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Delaware County.

Being skilled in both physics and mathematics, Prince received a full scholarship to study mathematics at Goucher College, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1927. During her undergraduate studies, she was influenced by professor Florence P. Lewis to study astronomy. Prince continued onto graduate school at the University of Michigan, where she received her master's degree in 1932 and her Ph.D. in 1934, both in astronomy. Prince's doctoral thesis was entitled \\"A Study of the Spectrum of 25 Orionis\\". Career and Achievements Prince served as an assistant professor of astronomy at Wellesley College from 1933-1945. Prince spent the summers of 1934 and 1935, at the Maria Mitchell Observatory, where she continued to study the spectroscopy of 25 Orionis. Her findings would later be published in the Astrophysical Journal. During the summers of 1938 and 1939, Prince's interest in solar activity became prominent while researching it at the Paris Observatory. Between 1943 and 1945, Prince worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory, where she made significant contributions to the study of radar.

Smith Salisbury (July 8, 1813 ‚Äì February 1, 1900) was a sister to Joseph Smith and an early convert in the Latter Day Saint movement. Early life Katharine Smith was born in Lebanon, New Hampshire, as the seventh surviving child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack. Later in her life, she recollected that when her brother Joseph brought the golden plates to the family home in Manchester, New York in September 1827, he \\"entered the house running\\", with the plates \\"clasped to his side with his left hand and arm, ‚Ä¶ his right hand ‚Ä¶ badly bruised from knocking down at least three men who had leaped at him from behind bushes or fences as he ran.\\"Andrew H.

Latter Day Saint convert Katharine attended the first meetings of the Church of Christ in 1830, and was baptized as a member in June 1830 by David Whitmer. In 1831, she moved with the Smith family to Kirtland, Ohio, to join the main gathering of Latter Day Saints. On June 8, 1831, she married Wilkins Jenkins Salisbury, a fellow convert to Mormonism, in Kirtland. He was one of the first seventies of the church, but he was excommunicated by the Kirtland high council in 1836 for \\"talebearing and drinking strong liquor\\".Richard Lloyd Anderson, \\"I Have a Question: What were Joseph Smith's sisters like, and what happened to them after the martyrdom?, Ensign, March 1979. The Salisburys settled in Chardon, Ohio, and later followed the Latter Day Saint movements to Missouri and Illinois. In Illinois, they settled in Plymouth, which was forty miles from church headquarters in Nauvoo. Life in Illinois After Katharine's brothers Joseph and Hyrum were killed, the Salisburys moved to Nauvoo to be with the other members of the Smith family. Like the other members of the Smith family, they did not endorse the leadership of Brigham Young and refused to follow him to the Salt Lake Valley; this was based largely on her strong belief that the church should be led by a member of the Smith family.Kyle R. Walker, ‚ÄúKatharine Smith Salisbury and Lucy Smith Millikin's Attitudes toward Succession, the Reorganized Church, and Their Smith Relatives in Utah‚Äù, Mormon Historical Studies 3 (spring 2002): 165‚Äì72. Later, the Salisburys settled in Fountain Green, Illinois, where Katharine would live for the rest of her life. In 1853, Wilkins Jenkins Salisbury died of typhoid fever; they were the parents of eight children.\\"Family of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith: The First Family of the Restoration\\", Ensign, December 2005. On May 3, 1857, she married Joseph Younger; they eventually divorced, though it is not known when this took place. They had no children together. After the divorce, Katharine retained the surname Salisbury for the rest of her life. RLDS Church member In 1873, based on her 1830 baptism, Salisbury was received as a member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), which was headed by her nephew Joseph Smith III. She was an active member for the remainder of her life, often traveling to RLDS Church conferences in Lamoni, Iowa and Independence, Missouri. RLDS Church leaders often invited her to sit on the platform at church meetings because she was regarded as a living link to the early days of the church.Kyle R. Walker, \\"Katharine Smith Salisbury's Recollections of Joseph‚Äôs Meetings with Moroni\\" , BYU Studies 41(3) (2002): 4‚Äì17. Salisbury was the longest-lived sibling of Joseph Smith; she was frequently sought out for interviews and recollections by RLDS Church members and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She died in Fountain Green, Illinois. As of 2005, she had 92 known descendants.

Lough Dromore lies on the north boundary. The land slopes down from there to the River Fergus opposite Ennis. Lough Ballyallia is on the south- western boundary and Lough Cleggan on the western boundary. In 1841 the population was 1,634 in 251 houses. By 1837 the medieval Roman Catholic parish was part of a union with the parish of Doora. It is now part of the parish of Doora Barefield in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. This parish serves the civil parishes of Doora, Kilraghtis and Templemaley, including the village of Barefield. The church of The Immaculate Conception is in Barefield. The Barefield National School is run by the Doora-Barefield parish. St Josephs Doora-Barefield GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. It has its ground at Gurteen. Antiquities The parish appears to be named after the same saint as the parish of Kilmaley, but there are no records that discuss him. As of 1893 his church, which had a very plain architecture, was still in reasonable condition. There were no other ancient ecclesiastical buildings in the parish. There is one holy well dedicated to Ingean Baoth, the patroness of Killanaboy parish. There were three old castles in Templemaley. One at Ballyallia belonged to Dr. James Neylan in 1580.

House with No Steps is now known as Aruma. In 1956, Watts contracted chronic bulbar poliomyelitis which left him with paraplegia.  Career  Having been unable to re-enter the workforce after contracting polio, Watts formed the Wheelchair & Disabled Association of Australia in 1962, later renamed House with No Steps. Watts was the organisation's first president and later Executive Director. Watt's early work with the organisation focused on establishing workshops which provided jobs for people with a disability, a wheelchair factory, and independent living accommodation. In 1968, Watts was invited by U.S. President Richard Nixon to attend the President's Committee on Rehabilitation in Washington, D.C. He attended similar seminars on five other occasions over the next eight years. In 1969, Watts was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of Disabled (ACROD), now known as National Disability Services (NDS). In September 1970, Watts was elected Chairman of ACROD's Architectural Barriers Committee. As Chairman, Watts established committees in all states and headed deputations which led to the provision of amenities such as parking permits for people with a physical disability. In 1979, Watts was elected President of ACROD, the first person with a physical disability to hold this position. Watts remained Executive Director of House with No Steps until 1989. After resigning, Watts still remained heavily involved with the organisation as an Executive Committee Member until his death. Watts died September 2000 after a long illness. Watts was survived by his wife, Dorothy Watts, and two daughters.  Awards and recognition  * In July 1965, the Warringah Shire Council named a 20-acre reserve located opposite the House with No Steps head office in Frenchs Forest, NSW, after Watts. * In January 1968, Watts was awarded a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire - Civil (MBE) in the Queen's New Year's Honours List for his work on physical disability. * In June 1982, Watts received the Order of St Michael and St George ‚Äì Companion (CMG) in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his work in rehabilitation.

This group is likely paraphyletic, and contain conidial as well as sterile fungi that colonize roots intracellularly or intercellularly.Jumpponen, A. 2001. Dark-Septate Endophytes ‚Äì are they mycorrhizal? Mycorrhiza 11:207‚Äì211.Mandyam, K. and Jumpponen, A. 2005. Seeking the elusive function of the root-colonising dark septate endophytic fungi. Studies in Mycology. 53: 173‚Äì189. Very little is known about the number of fungal taxa within this group, but all are in the Ascomycota. They are found in over 600 plant species and across 114 families of angiosperms and gymnosperms and co-occur with other types of mycorrhizal fungi. They have a wide global distribution and can be more abundant in stressed environments. Much of their taxonomy, physiology, and ecology are unknown. Taxonomy Based on analysis of sequences with the small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (18S), all DSE are within ascomycetes and include taxa in the orders Pleoporales, Microascales, Xylariales, Pezizales, Dothideales, Leotiales, Chaetothyriales, Elaphomycetales, Eurotiales, Onygenales, Saccharomycetales, Neolectales, Taphrinales, Mitosporic, and nonsporulating cultures. Natural history =Geographical distribution= Dark septate endophytes have been found in the subantarctic, boreal coniferous forests in Canada, temperate and boreal forests in Northern and Central Europe, exotic pine plantations in New Zealand, temperate grasslands, epiphytic plants in tropical rain forests, alpine environments, and semi-arid environments. Studies in alpine and semi-arid ecosystems have shown that dark septate endophytes are more prevalent than arbuscular mycorrhizae in these environments. =Physiology and function= Different species and strains of DSE have been found to have enzymes including laccases, lipases, amylases, and polyphenol oxidases. They are capable of breaking down many organic compounds including starch, cellulose, laminari, xylan, gelatin, and RNA Caldwell, B.A., Jumpponen, A., Trappe, J.M. 2000. Utilization of Major Detrital Substrates by Dark-Septate, Root Endophytes. Mycologia 92: 230‚Äì232. from detrital nutrient pools. Their nitrogen sources are varied, and dark septate endophytes are able to use amino acids (e.g. alanine, glycine, and arginine) equally as efficiently as ammonium, as well as other sources like guanine and uric acid. Some DSE are also able to hydrolyse organic sulphate. A key characteristic of DSE is that they show high melanin content and appear darkened in morphology. This is hypothesized to protect hyphae from extremes in temperatures and drought and improve their persistence in the soil. =Plant hosts= Dark septate endophytes have been observed across the plant kingdom in Dicotyledoneae and Monocotyledonae (Angiospermae), and Equisetopsida, Lycopsida, Polypodiopsida, and Psilotopsida (Gymnospermae). Their diversity of hosts suggests little or no host-specificity in this group. They are found on plants that are non-mycorrhizal as well as plants with known arbuscular, ericoid, orchid, and ectomycorrhizal associations. =Colonization of host plant= Dark septate endophytes are plant root-colonizing fungi that are often darkly-pigmented, with septate hyphae, and form structures inside plant root cells such as microsclerotia. However, there is great variation in morphology within this group. Dark septate endophytes are observed more frequently in mature parts of the root system. There are four main physiological structures of DSE colonization in plant roots. The runner hyphae are individual, superficial fungal strands following the depressions between epidermal cells. The appressorium is the swollen structure preceding penetration through a host cell wall. The penetration tube is the thin structure penetrating through the cell wall. The microsclerotia are the intracellular groups of hyphae with rounded, thick-walled cells. The frequent inter- and intracellular structures suggest that DSE gain nutrition from the plant host. Ecology =Interaction with other root-associated fungi= Dark septate endophytes frequently co-occur with mycorrhizal fungi such as arbuscular, ericoid, orchid, and ectomycorrhiza. There is some evidence that the different root-associated fungi interact.

Mitigation of antagonistic effects on plant growth due to root co-colonization by dark septate endophytes and ectomycorrhiza. Environmental Microbiology Reports 5(6), 892‚Äì898 =Effects on host plants= Effects of DSE on host plants range from pathogenic to mutualistic, depending on environmental factors as well as both host and fungus genotypes. However, the majority of DSE studied showed that inoculation of DSE increased total, root, and shoot biomass by up to 80%.Newsham, K.K. 2011. A meta-analysis of plant responses to dark septate root endophytes. New Phytologist 190: 783‚Äì793. Dark septate endophyte hyphae are much smaller in diameter compared to plant roots which allows them to access soil micropores unavailable to plants to forage for water and nutrients. Therefore, association with DSE can increase nitrogen and phosphorus content in host plant tissue. In arid ecosystems, DSE in the order Pleosporales are commonly found in both rhizosphere soils and surface biological soil crust communities, which suggests that they may aid in nutrient absorption by plants by linking plant roots and biological soil crusts that fix carbon and nitrogen in hyphal networks, which forms the basis of the Fungal Loop HypothesisPorras-Alfaro, A., Herrera, J., Natvig, D.O., Lipinski, K., Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2011. Diversity and distribution of soil fungal communities in a semiarid grassland. Mycologia 103: 10‚Äì21. The melanized cell walls of DSE may affect heat dissipation or form complexes with oxygen radicals in plant hosts, which can alter host thermal tolerance. Similar to other mycorrhizal fungi, DSE can protect hosts from pathogens or herbivores through the production of inhibitory metabolites, physical exclusion of other microorganisms, or melanized hyphae. Some fungi in the same genus as known DSE are known to produce antibacterial or antifungal compounds.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She is named for Lake Capilano in North Vancouver, British Columbia. The navy intended to name the ship after North Vancouver, however due to possible confusion with , she was named after the lake. Capilano was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943-44 River-class building program. She was laid down on 18 November 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 8 April 1944. Capilano was commissioned into the RCN on 25 August 1944 at Victoria, British Columbia. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After commissioning, Capilano transited to Halifax and worked up initially in St. Margaret's Bay before completing them at Bermuda. In November 1944 she was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-2 as a trans- Atlantic convoy escort. She continued in this capacity until the end of the conflict in Europe at which point she returned to Canada in June 1945 and upon arrival, began her tropicalization refit for possible deployment to the Pacific Ocean. The refit was completed on 10 October, however by this point, Japan had surrendered and on 24 November 1945, she was paid off and placed in reserve at Bedford Basin. Capilano was sold for mercantile use in 1947 and underwent conversion. In 1948 she reappeared as the Panamanian-registered Irving Francis M., owned by Irving Mindel. On 8 December 1953, while under tow from Jamaica to Miami, she foundered off the coast of Cabo Maysi, Cuba. In 2010, a framed photo of the ship and its badge was presented to the City of North Vancouver to mark the Canadian Naval Centennial.

Description The main elements of the sculpture were three sheets of curved metal, linked together to form a static work resting under its own weight, making it what Calder called a \\"stabile\\", as opposed to his famous \\"mobile\\" sculptures. It was reminiscent of a ship's propeller. Like many of Calder's public sculptures, it was painted red. The large work, high, was first installed near the entrance to WTC1 (the North Tower). It was moved in 1970 to a plaza in front of 7 World Trade Center, on the northeast corner of the World Trade Center Plaza by Vesey Street and Church Street. History The sculpture was commissioned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1969 and installed in 1970 at the World Trade Center in New York City. The work was destroyed in 2001 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, crushed under thousands of tons of rubble when 7 World Trade Center collapsed. About 40 percent of the sculpture was recovered from the debris in the following months. With not enough of the original remaining for a restoration, the recovered elements were stored by the Calder Foundation. Today, a portion of the sculpture can be found at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

It was finished in 1917 and was published as a set in the winter of 1917/18.  Composition  The Five Easy Pieces were commissioned by French patroness Eug√®ne Murat in November 1916. The original offer was to publish Stravinsky's Three Pieces for String Quartet, which he refused to do. However, he agreed to publish several short pieces, among them Renard, Berceuses du chat and the soon to be composed Five Easy Pieces under the Geneva-based company run by Adolphe Henn. Stravinsky composed each of the movements of the collection in only one day in his house in Morges. The first movement, Andante was composed on January 4, 1917; the third movement, Balalaika, which was also Stravinsky's favorite piece in the set, was composed on February 6, 1917; the fourth one, Napolitana, was composed on February 21, 1917; the fifth one, Galop, was composed on February 28, 1917. After this, he took a break which took him more than expected, and finished the second piece, Espa√±ola, on April 3, 1917, just one day before shipping all the compositions for publication. All the compositions were published later that same year, and this set was premiered in Paris on February 9, 1918.  Analysis  A typical performance of the compositions lasts approximately five to six minutes. The movement list is as follows: #Andante #Espa√±ola #Balalaika #Napolitana #Galop As with his other twin set, Three Easy Pieces, these five pieces have been acknowledged by scholar and fellow musicians as Gebrauchsmusik, that is, music that was not initially thought to be performed, but which serves one purpose. In this case, both compositions were meant to be used as educational tools for Stravinsky's children. Here, the primo voice is much easier than the secondo, contrary to Three Easy Pieces, in which the secondo was the easy part. For this composition, Stravinsky was inspired by the styles of different regions, cultures, and cultural movements. The first movement, Andante, is a homage to Erik Satie, and accordingly, uses a similar style. The second movement, Espa√±ola, was inspired by Stravinsky's recollections of his visit to Spain on the previous summer. The third movement, Balalaika, presents a strong reminiscence to Stravinsky's Russian roots. The fourth movement, Napolitana, was inspired in his first visit to Italy and tries to imitate the Napolitan style. Some musicians, as fellow pianist Paul Jacobs, have acknowledged an indirect reference (or \\"misquotation\\", as Jacobs said) to the popular song \\"Funicul√¨, Funicul√†\\". Finally, the fifth movement, Galop, tries to resemble a French Can-can and is based on sketches that were first conceived when composing the Three Easy Pieces.  Arrangements  The first four movements were reworked, arranged for small orchestra, and published as Suite No. 1. However, he decided to leave Galop out and arranged it for small orchestra for Suite No. 2, possibly taking into account when it was first conceived. Suite No. 1 was published in 1921, but was first performed in 1926, whereas Suite No. 2 was published in 1925.

Early years Jean Marguerite Tupinier was born in Cuisery, Sa√¥ne- et-Loire, on 18 December 1779. His parents were the deputy Jean Tupinier and Claudine Royer. He was the oldest of their three sons. He entered the √âcole Polytechnique on 13 December 1794 and graduated as a trainee naval engineer on 21 December 1796. He was employed in marine engineering in Brest, Toulon. He was the engineer of the naval squadron that undertook the Santo Domingo expedition of 1801-03. For some time after his return Tupinier was attached to the port of Le Havre. He then became one of the engineers of the fleet assembled at Boulogne to invade England. When this army was broken up he went to Genoa in 1805, then to Venice in 1806. He remained in charge of the Lido dockyard until 1811. In 1813 he returned to Boulogne to monitor the sale or use of military material from the fleet. He was a Deputy Director at the Department of the Navy in 1814, and a Division Chief during the Hundred Days. Bourbon Restoration Tupinier was disgraced at the second Bourbon Restoration and sent to Angoul√™me in the forestry department of the Navy. After eighteen months Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr called him to work at the ministry as deputy director of ports in 1818, and director in 1823. He supervised major improvements to the ports of Toulon, Brest, Rochefort, Lorient and Cherbourg. He was part of the Commission de Paris of 1834 that designed the Suffren-class ship of the line. In 1824 he was appointed Master of Requests at the Council of State. In 1828 he became a state councilor under the Martignac ministry. As Inspector General of Marine Engineering, he presided over organization of the fleet that carried the expeditionary army in the invasion of Algiers in 1830. He suggested the requirements for the Hercule-class ship of the line, launched in 1836-54 to fill the gap between the 90-gun Suffren-class battleship and the 120-gun three-decker ships of the Valmy design. July Monarchy After the July Revolution of 1830 Tupinier was made acting Minister of the Navy, and at once gave the order to hoist the tricolor. He was made a commander of the Legion of Honor. On 2 January 1834 he was elected deputy for the 6th college of Finist√®re (Quimperl√©). He was reelected on 21 June 1834. On 4 November 1837 he was elected deputy for the 6th college of Charente-Int√©rieure (Rochefort), and was reelected for this constituency on 2 March 1839. After the resignation of the Second cabinet of Louis Mathieu Mol√©, on 31 March 1839 Tupinier was made Minister of the Navy in the Transitional French cabinet of 1839, holding office until 11 May 1839. After leaving office he was made a member of the Admiralty Board. He was reelected deputy on 22 June 1839 and 9 July 1842. He was named a Counselor of State. He sat with the majority in the chamber. He was made a Peer of France on 14 August 1846 in recognition of his services. Last years After the February Revolution of 1848 Tupinier returned to private life. He had been made a Knight of St. Louis in 1817, a member of the Order of St. Ferdinand of Spain in 1829 and a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor on 30 April 1840.

Background Omai was a Polynesian visitor to England in the 18th century. From the island of Raiatea, he left the Society Islands with Commander Tobias Furneaux on his ship HMS Adventure. Furneaux's ship had left England in 1772, accompanying Captain James Cook on his second voyage of discovery in the Pacific, and visited Tahiti and Huahine in 1773. After visiting New Zealand, Omai arrived in England on Furneaux's ship in July 1774. Omai was admired by London society, staying with the President of the Royal Society Sir Joseph Banks and meeting King George III, Dr Samuel Johnson, Frances Burney, and other English celebrities. He returned to the Pacific with Cooks' third voyage in July 1776, arriving back on the island of Huahine in 1777. He stayed behind after Cook left in November 1777, and Omai died there in late 1779. Painting Reynolds portrayed Omai as an exotic figure, in an idealised depiction echoing Jean-Jacques Rousseau's concept of a noble savage. He stands barefoot, alone in a rural Arcadian landscape with unusual palm-like trees. He is wearing flowing \\"oriental\\" white robes resembling a toga but perhaps intended to be tapa cloth, and a white turban or headdress of possibly Turkish or Indian inspiration, a style not known in Tahiti. His adlocutio pose was inspired by the Apollo Belvedere; it emphasises the tattoos on his hands, but also makes classical allusions. (Reynolds first used the pose in 1752, after visiting Rome, in a portrait of Commodore Augustus Keppel.) The work measures . It was painted in around 1775, and was one of 12 portraits exhibited by Reynolds at the Royal Academy's eighth exhibition in 1776, to great acclaim. It was praised as a good likeness of the subject. The other paintings exhibited by Reynolds in 1776 included a full-length portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire in a similarly idyllic setting. A pencil preparatory sketch is held by the National Library of Australia as part of the Rex Nan Kivell Collection, and Yale University Art Gallery has an oval oil sketch. The painting was reproduced as a mezzotint by Johann Jacob√©, published by John Boydell in 1780. History Reynolds was not commissioned to paint Omai's portrait, and the work remained in his studio until his death in 1792. It was auctioned by Greenwood's in April 1796, and acquired by the art dealer Michael Bryan for 100 guineas. Bryan sold it to art collector Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, and it was displayed in the Reynolds Room at Castle Howard for 200 years. It was not seen again at a public exhibition until it appeared at the Royal Academy in 1954. The painting was included in the estate of George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe when he died in November 1984. It was put on sale by his son, Simon Howard, to meet the costs of a divorce and to help with the running costs of the Castle Howard estate. Howard offered to sell the work to the Tate Gallery, but its suggested price of ¬£5.5 million was rejected. Auctioned at Sotheby's in September 2001, the painting was bought by London art dealer Guy Morrison. The Antiques Trade Gazette suggested that Morrison had been subject to \\"Auction fever\\", i.e. getting carried away and bidding more than his private client had authorised him to. The hammer price of ¬£9.4 million (sometimes quoted as ¬£10.3 million) was a record for a work by Reynolds and then the second highest amount paid for a painting by a British artist (the record was ¬£10.7 million, paid for John Constable's The Lock in 1990, a level now substantially passed by another sale of The Lock in 2012 and by several sales of work by Francis Bacon, including his Triptych, 1976 in 2008 and his Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 2013). The painting was eventually acquired by Irish businessman John Magnier. He was refused an export licence (see Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art) while the Tate Gallery sought funding to make an offer to acquire the work. An anonymous donation allowed the gallery to make an offer of ¬£12.5 million, but Magnier refused to sell, and in the meantime he refused to allow the painting to be displayed in public in the UK. The British government refused a permanent export licence, but a temporary export licence was granted in 2005 for 6¬Ω years, and the painting went on display at the National Gallery of Ireland. It was included in the Reynolds exhibition at Tate Britain in 2005. In 2012, an application for a second temporary export licence was refused, and the painting returned to the UK. The painting was the centre of a legal case the UK courts in 2014 when the Court of Appeal (upholding an earlier decision of the Upper Tribunal, and overturning the first instance decision of the First-tier Tribunal) held that the work fell within the definition of \\"plant\\", because it was displayed in a part of Castle Howard that was open to the public. An application to the Supreme Court for permission appeal was rejected in January 2015. As a result, it was deemed to be a \\"wasting asset\\" and the sale of the painting was exempt from capital gains tax. The law was changed in the 2015 Budget to close the tax loophole.

In May 1883, Messrs Tooth and Company sold the Eagle Brewery and Sugar Refinery to Mr Huesman and partners for ¬£15,500. In August 1884 at the Brisbane Exhibition, the Queensland Brewing Company Limited won prizes for its draught malt ale, draught XXX ale, draught porter, bottled malt ale and bottled porter. The Queensland Brewery Ltd company appeared to be established in 1888 (its 25th annual report being released in 1913). At some point, it was renamed Queensland Brewery. In 1901, it was producing draught beer as well as two bottled beers known as \\"Silver top\\" and \\"Gold top\\". In 1906, it relocated to Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley (a landmark observed by motorists as they entered the Story Bridge from the northside)., although the bridge did not open until 1940. In the early 1940s, the company built a new headquarters and wine and spirit store at 501 Ann Street in Fortitude Valley. Designed in the Functionalist style with Art Deco motifs, the Queensland Brewery Company Building is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. In 1961, the company was taken over by Carlton & United Breweries in 1961. In 1993 the brewery was relocated to Yatala in 1993.  Bulimba Brewery Challenge Cup  In 1904 the Ipswich and West Moreton Rugby Union senior clubs played for the Bulimba Brewery Challenge Cup. \\"This magnificent silver trophy of rather unique design, with staghorn handles, was on view in Mr. Sam Green's window, Brisbane street, Ipswich.\\" The Cup was won by St Paul's Football Club of the St Paul's Young Men's Society. \\"At a fitting interval Mr. Roots, as captain of the football club, presented to the president, to hold for the society, the handsome Bulimba Cup, won last season.

He is known for his archaeological excavations, which he believed proved that Gautama Buddha was born in Lumbini, Nepal. F√ºhrer's archaeological career ended in disgrace as \\"a forger and dealer in fake antiquities\\", and he had to resign from his position in 1898. Early life Alois Anton F√ºhrer was born on 26 November 1853 in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany, into a German Catholic family. He studied Roman Catholic theology and Oriental studies at the University of W√ºrzburg, ordinated in 1878 and received his PhD in 1879. His Sanskrit lecturer, Julius Jolly, was associated with the Bombay School of Indology. Probably due to him, he was appointed as a teacher of Sanskrit at St Xavier's Institute in Bombay (now Mumbai). In 1882, F√ºhrer was able to publish two lectures about Hindu Law in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. Retrospectively, the lectures have been shown to be almost entirely plagiarized from earlier works: only about one tenth of the content has been shown to be his own. F√ºhrer left the Catholic Church around 1884 and converted to Anglicanism which cost him his job; he returned to Germany, from where he applied for a new job in the museum in Lucknow in India. Appointment in India and archaeological activities Choti Chattar Manzil, initial location of the Lucknow Provincial Museum. =Curator of Lucknow Provincial Museum= F√ºhrer came back to India in 1885 and on his arrival Alfred Comyn Lyall appointed him Curator of the Lucknow Provincial Museum. F√ºhrer started work in March and immediately set about improving the museum. Impressed by the changes, Lyall, the Chair of the Museum's Management Committee, wrote to Calcutta asking whether a part-time job for F√ºhrer could be found with the Archaeological Survey of India., see note 18 citing India Office Records, Archaeology and Epigraphy, Proceedings 4-18, File no. 6 of 1898, but however add Part B. . The same events with some further details in Charles Allen, The Buddha and Dr F√ºhrer (London: Haus, 2008), p. 33 but without supporting references. He thus came to hold a double appointment, one as Curator at the museum and the other as Archaeological Surveyor to the North-Western Provinces. As his Progress Reports show, he was part of the N-W.P. and Oudh Circle of the Archaeological Survey. =Nepal (1886)= In 1886, F√ºhrer was instructed by the government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh and the Government of India to carry out an expedition to Nepal. =Mathura glory (1889-1891)= General view of the excavations in January 1889 at the Jain site of Kankali Tila, Mathura. Later, F√ºhrer carried out very successful excavations at the Kankali Tila site of Mathura between 1889 and 1891 which improved understanding of the history of Jainism and gained him a reputation \\"as the most successful of the professional excavators\\". Still, F√ºhrer's reports continued to be the result of extensive plagiarization, taking especially from the work of his superior Georg B√ºhler at that time, although this is not clear-cut and may only be the result of intensive cooperation between the two. F√ºhrer's reports are also noted for being particularly vague and lacking details. From 1888 started severe lobbying aimed at reducing Government expenses, and at curtailing the budget of the Archaeological Survey of India, a period of about ten years known as the \\"Buck crisis\\", after the Liberal Edward Buck. In effect, this severely threatened the employment of the employees of the ASI, including F√ºhrer, who had just started a family and become a father. These existential threats to his livelihood may have become \\"a motive for misbehaviour\\" on the part of F√ºhrer. =Ramnagar failure (1891)= In 1891, F√ºhrer started excavations at the Ramnagar site of Ahichchhatra.\\"Some years later A. F√ºhrer undertook the excavation of a temple without much result.\\" in The excavations were quite disappointing. Pressured by the need to get results, F√ºhrer started to report invented discoveries, such as ancient dated inscriptions that never existed, and non existent Jain inscriptions. Heinrich L√ºders would later be able to show that the supposed Jain inscriptions were fakes compiled from earlier real inscriptions found in Mathura. In 1912 L√ºders summarized \\"As all statements about epigraphical finds that admit of verification have proved to be false, it is very likely that no inscriptions at all have turned up\\". In 1912, the German Indologist Heinrich L√ºders identified in the Lucknow Provincial Museum forged inscriptions in Brahmi on artifacts belonging to F√ºhrer's excavations at Mathura and Ramnagar, forgeries which he attributed to F√ºhrer himself. Some of the forged inscriptions were direct copies of inscriptions on other objects, previously published in Epigraphia Indica. =Sanchi inscriptions (1891-1892)= F√ºhrer went to Sanchi during the 1891‚Äì1892 season and recovered tens of unpublished donative inscriptions, but these could not have the impact he hoped for. Only a new inscription by King Ashoka, for example, could achieve sufficient impact with public opinion. Meanwhile, Edward Buck announced in 1892 that the Archaeological Survey of India would be shut down and all ASI staff would be dismissed by 1895, in order to generate savings for the Government's budget. The prospect of being fired anyway may have prompted F√ºhrer to act recklessly with his discoveries in a desperate attempt to avoid that fate. A great discovery within the next three years for example might be able to turn public opinion and save the funding of the ASI. =Burma invented inscriptions (1893-1894)= In 1893‚Äì1894, F√ºhrer was on a survey tour to Burma. In 1894, he published in his Progress Reports of the Epigraphical Section in the Working Season of 1893‚Äì94 the revolutionary discovery of three ancient Gupta inscriptions he said he found at Pagan and Tagaung in Burma, which pushed back the epigraphical knowledge of interactions with India by close to six centuries, generating huge acclaim. He elaborated a detailed description of the inscriptions he had supposedly found, without ever producing a drawing or a photographic proof, although he had a draftsman and a photographer with him on the expedition. Large extracts of his report were reproduced in The Indian Antiquary Vol-xxiv (1895). His \\"discovery\\" was taken at face value, and its conclusions repeated by many scholarly works such as the Gazeteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States in 1900, before being adopted by popular works as well: \\"by the early 1900s, anyone with an interest in the archeology of Burma had ample opportunity to read about the Gupta inscriptions in Fuhrer's own words\\". It was only uncovered many years later that the inscriptions were actually inexistent, a fact which was revealed openly by Charles Duroiselle in 1921: \\"This Sanskrit inscription never existed, but was invented in toto by Dr Fuhrer while on a tour in Burma\\". Source analysis shows that he imagined the content of these inscriptions by basing himself on older publications and a list of kings from the Indian Hatthipala Jataka. These events marked \\"a scandalous career of forgery which would, some years later, come to an end in Kapilavastu\\". =Nigali-Sagar pillar of Ashoka (1895)= The Nigali Sagar pillar (also called \\"Nigliva\\" pillar) was initially discovered by a Nepalese officer on a hunting expedition in 1893.\\"In 1893 a Nepalese officer on a hunting expedition found an Asokan pillar near Nigliva, at Nigali Sagar.\\" In March 1895, F√ºhrer inspected the Nigali Sagar pillar, one of the pillars of Ashoka, and identified a Brahmi inscription said to be also from the time of Ashoka. Besides his description of the pillar, F√ºhrer made a detailed description of the remains of a monumental \\"Konagamana stupa\\" near the Nigali Sagar pillar, which was later discovered to be an imaginative construct. Furher wrote that \\"On all sides around this interesting monument are ruined monasteries, fallen columns, and broken sculptures\\", when actually nothing can be found around the pillar.\\"\\"On all sides around this interesting monument are ruined monasteries, fallen columns, and broken sculptures.\\" This elaborate description was not supported by a single drawing, plan, or photograph. Every word of it is false.\\" in In the following years, inspections of the site showed that there were no such archaeological remains, and that, in respect to F√ºhrer's description \\"every word of it is false\\". It was finally understood in 1901 that F√ºhrer had copied almost word-for-word this description from a report by Alexander Cunningham about the stupas in Sanchi. For the time being, the announcement of these great \\"discoveries\\" succeeded in bringing the \\"Buck Crisis\\" to an end, and the ASI was finally allowed in June 1895 to continue operations, subject to yearly approval based on successful digs every year. Georg B√ºhler, writing in July 1895 in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, continued to advocate for the preservation of the Archaeological Survey of India, and expressed that what was needed were \\"new authentic documents\\" from the pre-Ashokan period, and they would \\"only be found underground\\". =Lumbini Ashoka inscription (1896)= In 1896, accompanied by the local Nepalese governor, General Khadga Shamsher, F√ºhrer discovered a major inscription on a pillar of Ashoka, an inscription which, together with other evidence, confirmed Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha. The pillar itself had been known for sometime already, as it had already been reported by Khadga Shamsher to Vincent Arthur Smith a few year earlier. F√ºhrer made his great discovery when he dug the earth around the pillar and reported the discovery of the inscription in a pristine state about one meter under the surface. F√ºhrer claimed that the locals called the site \\"Rummindei\\", which he identified with the legendary \\"Lumbini\\", whereas it was found that the site was only called \\"Rupa-devi\\". The authenticity of the discovery has long been doubted, and was openly disputed in a 2008 book by British writer Charles Allen. Following the discovery of the pillar, F√ºhrer relied on the accounts of ancient Chinese pilgrims to search for Kapilavastu, which he thought had to be in Tilaurakot. Unable to find anything, he started excavating some structures he said were stupas, and was in the process of faking pre-Mauryan inscriptions on bricks, when he was caught in the act by Vincent Arthur Smith.\\"Fuhrer's attempt to associate the names of eighteen Sakyas, including Mahanaman, with the structures, on the false claim of writings in pre-Asokan characters, was fortunately foiled in time by V.A. Smith, who paid a surprise visit when the excavation was in progress. The forgery was exposed to the public.\\" in The inscriptions were bluntly characterized by Smith as \\"impudent forgeries\\". Dealings in forged relics of the Buddha and false inscriptions Around the same time, F√ºhrer was selling fake relics \\"authentified\\" but an inexistent inscription of Upagupta, the preceptor of Ashoka, to Shin U Ma, an important monk in Burma.\\"As pointed out by Smith, in his preparatory note to Mukharji's Report, the inscriptions were 'impudent forgeries', and F√ºhrer had even gone to the extentextent of furnishing as proof fake relics of the Buddha, and a forged inscription of Upagupta, the preceptor of Ashoka...\\" in He wrote to the Burmese monk: \\"Perhaps you have seen from the papers that I succeeded in discovering the Lumbini grove where Lord Buddha was born\\", noting that \\"you have unpacked the sacred relics of our Blessed Lord Buddha which are undoubtedly authentic, and which will prove a blessing to those which worship them faithfully\\". An \\"authentic tooth relics of the Buddha\\" sent by F√ºhrer in 1896 turned out to have been carved from a piece of ivory, and another sent in 1897 was that of a horse. The forgery was reported in 1898 to the British North-Western Provinces Government in India by Burmologist and member of the Burma commission Bernard Houghton, and started an enquiry which would lead to F√ºhrer's resignation on 16 September 1898. =Piprahwa (1898)= In January 1898, F√ºhrer was again involved in a major discovery, that of the reliquaries at Piprahwa, but apparently arrived only after the discovery was made, and apparently did not have time to tamper with the evidence. =Acclaim= These discoveries, at the time they were made, generated fantastic praise for the work of F√ºhrer. According to the New York Post (3 May 1896) the Nigliva discovery \\"seems to carry the origin of Buddhism much further back\\". The Liverpool Mercury (29 December 1896) reports that the discovery that Lumbini (also called Paderia) was \\"the actual birthplace of the Buddha ought to bring devout joy to about 627,000,000 people\\". The Pall Mall Gazette (18 April 1898) related that the Piprahwa discovery \\"contains no less a relic than the bones of the Buddha himself\\". Dismissal from government service in India F√ºhrer's archaeological career ended in disgrace. F√ºhrer came under suspicion from March 1898 following the reported forgeries of the Buddha's relics. =Inquiry= A formal inquiry was launched into his activities, but officials struggled to find a \\"printable\\" reason for F√ºhrer's dismissal. F√ºhrer was officially confronted by Vincent Arthur Smith, who reported the forgeries of the Buddha's relics. F√ºhrer was exposed as \\"a forger and dealer in fake antiquities\\". Smith also blamed F√ºhrer for administrative failures in filing his reports to the Government, and for a false report about his preparations for future publications on his archaeological research: F√ºhrer was obliged to admit \\"that every statement in it [the report] was absolutely false.\\" The false inscriptions supposed to authentify the Buddha relics were not mentioned in the investigations, apparently out of fear of casting doubt on the other epigraphical discoveries made by F√ºhrer. Similarly, the false publication of the ancient Burmese inscriptions, were the object of an institutional cover- up, which would not come to light before 1921, with the revelation of their inexistence made by Charles Duroiselle. F√ºhrer's own report on his discoveries in Nepal, entitled Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birthplace, 1897, was withdrawn from circulation. In 1901, Vincent Arthur Smith, after retirement, chose to reveal the blunt truth about the Nepalese discoveries and published a stark analysis of F√ºhrer's activities, apparently worried that \\"the reserved language used in previous official documents has been sometimes misinterpreted\\". In particular, Smith said of F√ºhrer's description of the archaeological remains at Nigali Sagar that \\"every word of it is false\\", and characterized several of F√ºhrer's epigraphic discoveries as \\"impudent forgeries\\". However Smith never challenged the authenticity of the Lumbini pillar inscription and the Nigali Sagar inscription discovered by F√ºhrer. =Sanctions= Under official instructions from the Government of India, F√ºhrer's resignation was accepted and he was relieved of his positions, his papers seized and his offices inspected by Vincent Arthur Smith on 22 September 1898. Smith's report is given in the appendix to this article and is available here: . F√ºhrer had written in 1897 a monograph on his discoveries in Nigali Sagar and Lumbini, Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birth-place in the Nepalese tarai, which was withdrawn from circulation by the Government. F√ºhrer was dismissed and returned to Europe with his family. He died on 5 November 1930 in Binningen, Switzerland. F√ºhrer was replaced as Curator of the Lucknow Museum by Edmund Smith, previously the Province's Architectural Surveyor. The excavations in the Nepal Terai were entrusted to Babu Purna Chandra Mukherji, who published the results of his investigations in 1903 in A report on a tour of exploration of the antiquities in the Tarai, Nepal the region of Kapilavastu, in which A. Smith included an introduction entitled \\"Preparatory note\\" which details several of the forgeries made by F√ºhrer.The report (criticism of F√ºhrer pages 3-4): Religious life F√ºhrer had an unusual religious career. He served as a Catholic priest, but in 1887 converted to Anglicanism. Following his expulsion from government service in India, F√ºhrer made plans to become a Buddhist monk. Quoting the Ceylon Standard, the Journal of the Mahabodhi Society noted: \\"Much interest has been excited in Buddhist and other circles at the prospect of Dr F√ºhrer coming to Ceylon to join the Buddhist priesthood. The Press notices recently made regarding this gentleman have given rise to grave suspicion. We understand that Dr F√ºhrer will have an opportunity given him of refuting the charges made against him before he is accepted by the leading Buddhists here as an exponent of the religion of Buddha.\\"Anon, Journal of the Calcutta Mahabodhi Society 10.8-9 (December 1901 and January 1902), p. 1. These plans seem to have come to nothing because in 1901 F√ºhrer re-converted to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland and worked as a priest from 1906‚Äì1930.Arx, Urs von (2005).

He spent a period as editor of the Garda Review (the monthly magazine of the national police force), before becoming crime correspondent for the Evening Herald. Rae became acting editor of the Evening Herald in September 2005, before being appointed editor in May 2006. In 2012, Rae was appointed the editor of the Irish Independent, Ireland's largest selling national newspaper. At the Irish Independent he oversaw what became known as the \\"Anglo Tapes\\" investigation which was published in June 2013.Inside Anglo: the secret recordings The investigation which told the inside story of the collapse of Anglo-Irish Bank made international headlines and dominated political debate for weeks. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also commented on the investigation.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-23093988 The investigation won the title a number of awards. He was later promoted to group editor-in-chief. While editor of the Irish Independent, Rae oversaw the ending of its publication as a broadsheet and the development of its online news site which recorded average audiences of 12,000,000 monthly users.

Gardai have launched an inquiry into claims the person was given ¬£30,000 in return for a land rezoning issue.\\" The story which said \\"the probe was ordered after a witness came forward and alleged he was present for the handover of ¬£30,000 to the public representative\\" was one of the first by a journalist into the planning scandal that led to the establishment of the Mahon Tribunal. As editor-in-chief at INM, he reportedly fired journalist Gemma O'Doherty after she made an attempt to interview Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan. at his home at 10pm, April 11, 2013. This was ignored by the mainstream media in Ireland, as noted by media in Great Britain. It was later claimed that Rae himself was among those to have had penalty points annulled. These claims were ignored by the Irish media and only reported either on social media or internationally. On the evening of Saturday 19 July 2014, Rae, in his role as group editor of INM, reportedly ordered the presses to be stopped to amend a column written by Sunday Independent editor Anne Harris, which featured references to Denis O'Brien. He never ordered the presses stopped. He did seek to have included clarified information. Copies of the original article appeared allowing comparisons. Harris originally wrote: \\"Denis O'Brien is the major shareholder in INM. In theory, with 29% of the shares, he does not control it. In practice, he does.\\" The last sentence was deleted and the wording of the next paragraph about O'Brien was also amended. Representatives of O'Brien later demanded a retraction and apology from Ms Harris. A prominent apology to O'Brien from Ms. Harris appeared in the Sunday Independent on August 3, 2014,. Harris left the newspaper in December 2014, with praise from some colleagues.

The church was torn down and replaced around the year 1629. The new church was a timber-framed structure. In the 1870s, the need for a new church was apparent. A new church was constructed immediately southeast of the old building and when it was completed, the old building was torn down. The new church was consecrated on 27 May 1879 by the Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland.

The term was created by Katherine Woodward Thomas in 2009 as a five-step process to support the conscious completion of an intimate relationship and popularized by Gwyneth Paltrow in 2014, who used the phrase to describe her then-recent divorce.  Background  Starting in the early 1940s the word \\"uncoupling\\" became a term for divorce. Sociologist Diane Vaughan proposed an \\"uncoupling theory\\" in 1976. Vaughan saw the process where a relationship reaches a crossroads, when both parties realize that \\"everything went dead inside\\". It usually is followed by lengthy phase, during which one of the partners (the \\"respondent\\") holds on to the failing relationship, in spite of unconsciously knowing that it's coming to the end. p. 81 and p. 218n Vaughan perceived the process of breakup affecting initiator and respondent unevenly. While the breakup initiator 'has begun mourning the loss of the relationship',Vaughan, p. 60 the respondent has not. Vaughan suggests that 'to make their own transition out of the relationship, partners must redefine initiator and relationship negatively, legitimating the dissolution'.Vaughan, p. 154 Vaughan proposed that 'getting out of a relationship includes a redefinition of self at several levels: in the private thoughts of the individual, between partners, and in the larger social context in which the relationship exists'.Vaughan, p. 6 Vaughan sees the uncoupling process as finished when 'the partners have defined themselves and are defined by others as separate and independent of each other - when being partners is no longer a major source of identity'. Usage In 2009 Katherine Woodward Thomas introduced \\"conscious uncoupling\\" as a five-step program which she offered as a calmer alternative to divorce, and began educating people about it worldwide. She also began training and certifying coaches to take people through the conscious uncoupling process. Gwyneth Paltrow popularized the term to describe her divorce from Chris Martin. In 2014, when Paltrow made the news about her divorce public, she invited her doctors Dr. Habib Sadeghi and his wife, Dr. Sherry Sami, to explain the process. Sadeghi described a \\"conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing\\". The process was also labeled as \\"Uncoupling with Clarity\\". In 2015, Conscious Uncoupling: 5 Steps to Living Happily Even After (written by Katherine Woodward Thomas), became a New York Times Bestseller.

She also does WNBA games for ESPN and NBATV, and has been the main play-by-play voice of the Indiana Fever; since 1996. Antonelli has a widespread workload during the basketball season and is in her 30th year. In November and December, she typically calls one to three games per week. Her broadcast duties include South Carolina Gamecocks and Tennessee Lady Volunteers games on Fox Sports South. Once January hits, Antonelli broadcasts three to five games each week. Beginning in January, Antonelli calls women's games in the Big Ten Conference for BTN Mondays. Saturdays are spent calling Conference USA or Big 12 Conference games for FSN. Sundays are with ACC Regional or ESPN calling an ACC or SEC game; and some Tuesdays and Wednesdays are with CBS Sports Network calling games for the American Athletic Conference or the Patriot League. She also serves as one of the three analysts calling games for College Basketball on CBS's January Saturday women's triple header. Early life Antonelli was born and raised in Cary, North Carolina. From 1982-1986, Antonelli played at NC State University for coach Kay Yow at forward, starting in three of those seasons. During her time at NC State, the Wolfpack made the NCAA Tournament four times and appeared in the Sweet Sixteen twice. After graduating from NC State, Antonelli moved on to Ohio University, where she spent the next year getting a master's degree in sports administration. While at Ohio, she served as the women's basketball student assistant coach. After obtaining her Master's from Ohio, Antonelli spent the next four years as Director of Marketing at the University of Kentucky before moving on to a similar role at Ohio State University. Career Antonelli's time at Ohio State paved the way for her broadcasting career today. Upon her arrival, Ohio State did not have any televised women's sports, so Antonelli went to a local station and had them figure out how much it would cost to air eight women's games per season on local TV. Antonelli gathered the needed sponsors to produce those games, and as a bonus, became the play-by-play voice for those games. She did Ohio State women's games for five years while also serving as an analyst for Dayton Flyers men's basketball games for three years. She was also Ohio State's Director of Marketing. Antonelli and Frank were married in 1992. In 1995, her first child, Joey, was born. His birth helped settle her mind on sports broadcasting. Shortly thereafter, she would sign on as a full-time broadcaster. ESPN and CSTV eventually hired Antonelli as an analyst for select games; and the work would continue to grow. When a team hits a ton of three‚Äôs she thinks they can ‚Äúget whatever they want‚Äù when truly the other team is lucky. To this date Antonelli continues to broadcast through the Elite Eight for ESPN's NCAA Women's Tournament coverage. Additionally, Westwood One would hire her to be the analyst for their Final Four broadcasts; a position she has held since 2000. One of her greatest achievements came in 2007 when she won the Women's Basketball Coaches Association Mel Greenberg Media Award which recognizes a member of the media who has best displayed a commitment to women's basketball and to advancing the role of the media in promoting the women's game. Currently, Antonelli lives in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with her husband Frank, and their three children. During the off-season, Antonelli provides basketball camps and clinics for the local community. Her family also run the foundation \\"Frankie and Friends,\\" an organization whose main purpose is to stop bullying in schools.

The program was first revealed in March 2014, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden. MYSTIC operates under the legal authority of Executive Order 12333.  History  The MYSTIC program started in 2009, but reached its full capability to record the content of phone calls in an entire country for 30 days, in 2011. Documents from 2013 say the surveillance program could be extended to other countries.The Washington Post, NSA surveillance program reaches ‚Äòinto the past‚Äô to retrieve, replay phone calls, March 18, 2014 On March 18, 2014, the existence of the program was first revealed by The Washington Post, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden. It was reported that the NSA had the capability to record all the phone calls from an unidentified foreign country. On May 19, 2014, the website The Intercept published the name of one country of which the phone calls were recorded, and also identified three other countries of which only the telephony metadata were collected (see below).  Scope  Under a sub-program of MYSTIC codenamed SOMALGET, the NSA is actively recording and archiving the content of \\"virtually every\\" phone call for thirty days. After thirty days, the recorded calls are overwritten by newer phone calls, although concern was raised that the NSA may start storing collected phone calls indefinitely. Although NSA analysts can only listen to less than 1% of the phone calls collected under MYSTIC, millions of voice clips are forwarded for processing and storage every month. A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) criticized the program, stating that the NSA now has the ability to record anything it wants to. It was also noted that MYSTIC is the first revealed NSA surveillance operation capable of monitoring and recording an entire nation's telecommunication system.  Targets  As of 2013, the NSA collected the metadata of phone calls from five entire countries, according to a report by The Intercept from May 19, 2014: Mexico, the Philippines, Kenya, the Bahamas and an initially unidentified country. For the latter two countries, the NSA not only collected the metadata, but also the content of phone calls. This took place under the SOMALGET sub-program. The NSA documents purport that unlawful mass surveillance of the Bahamas resulted in the apprehension of narcotics traffickers. The US government has also not yet shared information with the Bahamas, despite indicating that it would. = Afghanistan = In March 2014, former NSA Deputy Director John C.

Typhoon Nelson, which developed on August 16, 1985, originated from an area of thunderstorm activity well east of the Philippines. It gradually intensified over the next several days while moving northwest. Nelson reached typhoon intensity early on August 20 and two days later, attained peak intensity before turning west. The cyclone brushed northern Taiwan early on August 23 after weakening slightly. Nelson then briefly restrengthened to peak intensity. During the afternoon of August 23, it made landfall in eastern China before dissipating on August 25\\\\. Nelson brought heavy rains to Taiwan. Approximately 900,000 families were left without power and 100,000 telephone lines lost service. More than 20,000 trees were uprooted. Across the country, five people were killed. Affecting a country already inundated by summer rains, Typhoon Nelson brought additional flooding and significant damage to much of Southern China. There, the storm killed 48 individuals and hurt 329 others. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed while another 6,000 were damaged. Around 2,000 travelers were stranded due to flooding. Throughout China, losses from the storm totaled to $53 million (1985 USD). Meteorological history The origins of Nelson can be traced back to a small and disorganized, but persistent area of disturbed weather, which was first observed on August 15\\\\. At this time, the convection was located northwest of Saipan. Initially, the system was located near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which enhanced the disturbance's convection. The disturbance was also located near a cold core upper-level low and a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT). By 0300 UTC on August 15, the system had become slightly more organized. Three hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system. Thereafter, a dramatic increase in convection occurred over the northeast quadrant of the system. As such, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system early on August 16. Several hours later, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued, even though a Hurricane Hunter aircraft did not locate a surface circulation. Early on August 17, the TCFA was re-issued. That afternoon, the disturbance became more organized, with classifications via the Dvorak technique yielding winds of . Based on this, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Nelson. During the evening, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a barometric pressure of ; however, they noted that the strongest winds were north-northwest from the center. Early on August 18, data from another aircraft also noted that a subtropical ridge had extended west of Nelson; consequently, the JTWC correctly anticipated Nelson to move west-northwest. At midday, the JMA upgraded Nelson to a severe tropical storm. Subsequently, data from the JMA indicated that Nelson began to level off in intensity as the stronger winds remained displaced form the center. However, the JTWC upgraded Nelson to typhoon intensity following Hurricane Hunter reports of a eye, winds of , and a pressure of . At 0000 UTC on August 20, the JMA estimated that Nelson attained typhoon strength, with winds of . Nearing Taiwan, Nelson once again held on to its intensity for 36 hours before strengthening slightly. Late on August 21, the JTWC announced that Nelson reached peak intensity, with , equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Early on August 22, the JMA reported that Nelson attained peak winds of . Shortly after its peak, the storm weakened slightly thereafter as the typhoon passed between the Yaeyama Islands and the Miyako Islands. According to the JMA, the storm re-attained peak intensity at 0000 UTC on August 23\\\\. At this time, the agency assessed the pressure of the system at . Shortly thereafter, Nelson skirted northern Taiwan, passing from Taipei. After entering the Formosa Strait, the storm moved ashore southwest of Fuchou at 1400 UTC on August 23. At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of . By August 25, both the JMA and JTWC had ceased tracking Nelson, as it had moved inland over China. Preparations and impact =Taiwan= Due to the threat of Nelson, a typhoon warning was issued for the island. After the storm battered the island, rail and street traffic in the northern part of the island was halted due to mudslides. Both Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and the Taipei Songshan Airport in Taipei were closed for about 12 hours. Approximately 900,000 families were left without electrical service and 100,000 telephone lines were disrupted. Water supplies in many areas were also affected and about 20,000 trees in Taipei were damaged. As much as of rain fell in some parts of the island of Taiwan. Five people perished in the country. Three men were killed in Taipei, two when they were struck by wind- blown objects and one when a house collapsed. Elsewhere, a fatality was reported because of a landslide in Taichung. Moreover, at least 15 other people were reportedly injured throughout Taiwan. A woman in the harbor city of Keelung was struck in the head and seriously injured by a broken window. =China= Already affecting an area that was inundated by prior flooding partially caused by Typhoon Mamie, Nelson brought additional flooding and significant damage to much of Southern China. The storm was accountable for 48 lives and 329 injuries in the province of Fujian. More than 5,000 dwellings were destroyed; 6,000 others were damaged. Around 2,000 travelers were stranded. A total of 969 fishing boats sunk, and about of crops were lost. Power lines were downed in 11 counties, which included Putian and the provincial capital of Fuzhou. Many highways received flooding. Water and electrical supplies were cut in Putian City. Along Pingtan Island and Fuqing, many houses were demolished and considerable damaged occurred to crops such as sugar cane. The offshore island of Yangtan was the hardest hit, where 15 villages lost power. Typhoon Nelson was considered the worst typhoon to hit China in 16 years, but also helped relieve drought conditions in the southern portion of the nation.

It was built in the early 1930s, under the Reza Shah, and uses mainly elements of Achaemenid architecture to demonstrate Iran's rich culture and history. The construction of the mausoleum as well as its aesthetic design is a reflection of the cultural, and geo- political status of Iran at the time. Background Ferdowsi, the influential Persian poet and author of the Persian epic, Shahnameh died in 1020AD in the Tus, Iran (Persia), in the same city in which he was born. For all his literary contribution, Ferdowsi was not recognized during his life. It was only after his death that his poems won him admiration. For hundreds of years, his resting place was nothing more than a minor dome-shrine erected by a Ghaznavid ruler of Khorasan, without any permanent edifice in place in the garden of his house where Ferdowsi's daughter had originally buried him. In the beginning years of the 20thcentury Iran started to realize his critical role in defining the identity of Iran. One fa√ßade of the poet's mausoleum It was not until 1934 that the Iranian government, then under the control of Reza Shah, first king of the Pahlavi dynasty, recognized the cultural and literary value of Ferdowsi and erected a permanent tomb in his honor. A millennial celebration was also held for the poet, to which were invited scholars from several countries, including Soviet Tajikistan, India, Armenia, and Europe (Germany, France, England). Funds were collected, mainly donations from Parsi scholars, to enable the building of a statue for the poet at his tomb site. The Pahlavi family used Ferdowsi to advance Iran's cultural prestige, but in doing so nearly cost Ferdowsi his tomb since, after the Islamic revolution, frustrations with the Shah of Iran nearly led to destruction of the tomb by the revolutionaries. Panorama of Ferdowsi's tomb, Tus, Iran The tomb was originally designed by the Iranian architect, Haj Hossein Lurzadeh who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 mosques, as well as the private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in Tehran, the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada shrine in Karbala, Iraq. The present design of the structure is credited mainly to Karim Taherzadeh, who replaced the old dome- shaped design by Lurzadeh with a modern cubical design. Ferdowsi's tomb, which resembles the tomb of Cyrus the Great, is built in style of Achaemenid architecture. There is a clear link between this choice of architectural style and the politics of Iran at the time. Four years before Reza Shah came to power in 1922, a group of secular Iranian reformists had created the \\"Society for National Heritage\\" (SNH, or in Persian anjoman-e asar-e meli). Composed mostly of western-educated, pro-reform intellectuals such as Abdolhossein Teymourtash, Hassan Pirnia, Mostowfi ol-Mamalek, Mohammad Ali Foroughi, Firuz Mirza Firus Nosrat al-Dowleh, and Keikhosrow Shahrokh, the SNH was critical in obtaining the funds from the Iranian parliament. Keikhosrow Shahrokh, Iran's Zoroastrian representative to the Iranian parliament, was particularly active in reviving Achaemenid and Sassanid architecture in Iran in the 1930s. Structural details The basic structure of the tomb is rectangular with a large garden surrounding the structure and interacting with the structure in the Persian style of gardening known as Char-bagh (or Chaharbagh translating to four gardens in Persian). In the center of the cross created by the legs of the garden surrounding it, is an edifice made of primarily white marble. The edifice can be divided into a \\"wide chamber\\" that lies at the base and a cubical erection on top, with four pillars surrounding it and scenes from the epic of Shahnameh and text ornating it. The body of the poet is actually interred in the center of the rectangular wide chamber underneath the overlying four pillars cube. There are twelve (12) steps leading from the lowest point of the wide chamber all the way to the level of the cube. The wide base has a total height of 16 m. The edifice has equal dimensions of 30 m on each side. The following are schematic diagrams of the aerial view of the tomb's wide base and edifice section and their topography: File:Wide base.jpgThe aerial and the profile view of the rectangular \\"wide base\\" of the tomb File:The Edifice of Ferdowsi.jpgThe aerial and the profile view of the edifice as it sits atop the wide base File:BAKHTAZMAYI TICKET FERDOWSI TOMB 1924.jpgOne of the first tickets sold for the Ferdowsi millenary clearly shows the layering structure of the tomb A unique feature of the design of Ferdowsi's tomb has been its resemblance to that of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae. Cyrus's tomb also has a rectangular structure seating atop a rectangular, gradually elevating base. This resemblance is intentional as the designer of this edifice intended to revoke the original Achaemenid style of architecture. In fact every other facet of the edifice has a Zoroastrian symbol known as Faravahar. This is not coincidental. There are multiple applications of this in the Achaemenid architecture mainly in Persepolis in Fars province today. The \\"Society for National Heritage of Iran\\" (SNH) heavily relied on the use of Faravahar as this was the symbolic representation of ancient Iran since Achaemenid times. Many construction in the 1930s, including the then National Bank of Iran use Faravahar which is not unexpected considering that the same architect that created Ferdowsi's tomb also created the National Bank of Iran.

File: Persepolis - carved Faravahar.JPG Photo from Persepolis showing Faravahar and also note the flower decoration. Similar if not exact flower decoration is used in Ferdowsi's tomb. A closer look at the edifice points out that there are four columns each at the corner of the rectangular structure with two half-buried columns that protrude as deep friezes on each facet of the structure. Each frieze column has a box, followed by a two horn bull sign which is very much similar if not the exact imitation of the Persepolis column design. The columns are ornated with fluting 3/4 of the way down with the last portion spared. The overall effect is intended to create a grand gesture. The columns are as high as the edifice which is 30 meters high. (the edifice is also 30 m wide). Marble decorations are used to ornate the siding and the floor of the \\"wide base\\" structure as well the wall. Persian flower designs (concentric flower designs composed of a flower with seven (7) ovaloid pellets surrounding a central circle), and hexagonal marble designs are commonly used in the structure.

File:Floor pattern.jpgThis repeated hexagonal pattern is utilized to ornate the floor of the \\"wide base\\". Historical context Reza Shah Pahlavi officially opening the mausoleum of Ferdowsi for public visiting upon conclusion of Ferdowi Millenary conference Iran's history has been closely tied to geopolitical changes that has taken place since the establishment of the Achaemenid empire in Persis all the way to the modern day Iran. Two major events are of critical importance in Iran's history specially its literary history as it pertained to Ferdowsi: Arab conquest of Persia and the Mongolian invasion of Persia. Ferdowsi lived his life as a poor man constantly moving from court to court, and eventually died a poor widower, having lost his only son. Tus, at one point was an opulent city in the greater Khorasan region but it was repeatedly sacked by Oguz Turks, Mongols, and Uzbeks from the steppe. This and the growing influence of Mashad as a political and religious center within Khorasan shaped Ferdowsi's experience and in many way influenced his writing as Tus lost prestige. Additionally, Arabic had found prestige in lands conquered by the Arabs and there was threat of Middle Persian being lost in favor of Arabic. Ferdowsi's role is critical in that using the fewest loan- words he transferred the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) into Modern Persian (Farsi). In the time frame preceding the construction of the mausoleum, nationalistic feelings in Iran were high. There was a renewed sense of national identity partly due to the pressures felt by foreign powers including the constant Anglo-Persian political struggle specially over the issues of oil, and partly due to inability of the Qajar dynasty from protecting Iranian lands in central Asia to the Russians and in the east to the British. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) was an important source of contention for Iranians. One journalist studying during this time period reflects his and his colleagues personal experience: The architecture of Ferdowsi's tomb is also influenced by poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and the lazy king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture. This was in many ways taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh etched into the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum. After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi and even mausoleum of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos. One of the most dangerous threats to the structure was that it would be equated with the late Pahlavi dynasty by the new regime and destroyed. It however was not and was instead embraced by the new local government since Ferdowsi was a devout Muslim. Interior design The tomb of Ferdowsi with the accompanying text. To see the translation, see the text on the left. Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires tales of heroic act by protagonists fighting against their antagonists. In that sense it is a national epic that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts of the history of pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes. The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is Feraydoon Sadeghi who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. Rostam, the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus of the majority of the scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple.

Legacy Today Ferdowsi's tomb is one of the most photographed in Iran. Millions of visitors from various provinces of Iran come to see the tomb every year. Foreign dignitaries, tourists, and other Persian-speaking people from Europe, Asia, and Middle East also visit the site. The most recent was a visit from the Iraqi tourism minister in July 2013. The site has also inspired many Persian poets including Iranian poet Mehdi Akhavan-Sales who is actually physically buried not far from the tomb of Ferdowsi, in his own tomb in the grounds of Ferdowsi's complex. Iranian classical singer Mohammad Reza Shajarian is also buried at the complex.

The series production began in 2013 and was supposed to go on air in the same year but was delayed and premiered on 14 April 2014. Reception Among the cast members, Singh's portrayal of Sakshi Goenka has been well appreciated. A review carried by The Indian Express noted that \\"her attitude and elegance comes across distinctly in her character\\". Mid Day stated, \\"Ek Hasina Thi had a great start. However, despite a good plotline, impressive star cast (Simone Singh, Ayub Khan and Sanjeeda Shaikh and Vatsal Seth) and many awards, it failed to keep up with the initial pace and lost out on viewers.\\" The Indian Express stated the series the series to be more convincing and said, \\"The USP of the show is the fast-paced, gripping storyline and the immensely-talented star cast. But the characters seem edgy most of the time which doesn‚Äôt look very convincing and the performance of the lead actors is not standing out as yet. The most interesting and powerful performance is by Simone Singh. Her attitude and elegance comes across distinctly in her character of Sakshi Goenka. Like Singh‚Äôs, Ayub Khan's role too is well-sketched and projected with ease. The show is well-scripted and has the ability to make a mark but the fact remains that the lead actors will have to put in a lot of effort to make their characters look convincing and believable. The settings, makeup and clothes are the main highlights and strong base of the show.\\" Daily News and Analysis rated two and half stars and praised, \\"The storyline is gripping, fast-paced and slick. It's nice to see a bunch of good looking actors together. The setting in Kolkata, the ambience, the bungalows, the visuals etc speak of high production values. The serial, in short, is easy on the eye.\\" On the other hand they also said, \\"All the characters seem to be on edge, which is annoying. Nobody seems to be what they are. More importantly, whether the serial works or not is completely dependent on the actors' performances, especially since it's not a linear story. And so far, they are falling short.\\" Speaking on cast performance they said, Beautiful and sophisticated Simone plays the shrewd and manipulative Sakshi Goenka with elan. Sanjeeda's character is layered, but it's not coming through in her performance. Even Vatsal lacks the edginess both in terms of looks and performance.\\" Deccan Chronicle criticised, \\"It‚Äôs a tried and tested plot but one that still holds a lot of potential. But the problem here is that there is no thrill in this thriller. Ek Hasina Thi follows the silly, repetitive style of saas-bahu (mother in law-daughter in law) serials, and every teeny-weeny thing gets dragged for a week, making the eventual revenge very tiresome.\\" Adaptations It was dubbed into various national and international languages including in Tamil and Telugu as \\"Durga\\", in Malayalam as \\"Oru shishirathinte ormakku\\" and in Arabic as \\"Laheeb Al-Huqd / ŸÑŸáŸäÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÇÿØ\\" (English: Flames of hatred) on MBC Bollywood. It was also dubbed into Sinhalese as \\"Sulanga Wage Awidin\\" on Hiru TV.

This term is used in logistics and inventory management to describe a way of dealing with product with a limited shelf life such as perishable products, or consumer goods with a specified expiry date. The product with the deadline for the next intake will be the first to be served or removed from stock. Majorly used in Pharmaceutical and Chemical industry where expired dates are calculated based on Batch expired date or Shelf life time. A common example of this treatment is the management of perishable products in a shelf display: Products with deadlines closest consumption should be used before the other. Foods and pharmaceutical drugs can be sold at a discounted price, and, near the expiration date, they can be destinated to humanitarian aids to the neighbours or to the more distant foreign countries. Perishable goods can also be collected through single donations or some charities. The First expired, first out logic is a type of stock rotation that enable organizations to get a distribution process optimization, able to minimize the waste generation of finished and yet marketable products.  Perishable drugs: charity and waste management  Perishable goods (like foods and drugs) lose all their use value after the expiration date and can't be bought nor sold as their commercial price and value falls to zero. As the drug or food expiration date comes forth, any perishable good loses its value day- by-day. Both drugs and foods are equally necessary for the law enforcement of the universal right to life, and, if not reused, they contribute to an expensive waste management form, namely the food waste or the drug waste. Global Trade Item Number barcode (GTIN, the former EAN) and the UPC code get an all-over-the-world unique identifier, respectively for the product type (the part number) and the single product item (a serial number) or its batch unit, with the related expiring date. The GTIN and UPC codes have become an international standard to improve the food traceability or the drug traceability, as well the Net availability of the product data. Although Feeding America supply chain applies the GTIN and EAC codes since 2012, at July 2019 nobody of this charity network seems to manage any pharmaceutical drug product In the United States, it is based also the DrugBank with a comprehensive, freely accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug targets. But however, it doesn't concern about single items data, in order to become a database (a bank) of such perishable expiring products for humanitarian and charitative purposes. The European Fund for Aid to Most Deprived is the European version of the Most Deprived Person programme, with the difference that it is managed by a public authority and not by a charity. Its regulation doesn't mention any possible waste management of other kind of perishable goods, such as the pharmaceutical drugs.

Karan claims innocence to her and sends her a defence attorney to fight her case. The attorney advises her to confess the crime, arguing that there is no proof exonerating her. After being convinced that the judge will give her a light sentence and might even set her free for co-operation, Sarika complies. But, the judge sentences her to seven years hard labour without parole. Sarika then realises that Karan is an associate to the underworld and that he had her framed to keep police eyes away from him.

After knocking him out, she chains him in a cavern infested with rats. As Karan regains consciousness, Sarika tells him how she used to be scared of rats and she chose this spot because she wanted him to go through the pain and suffering that she went through while she was in prison.

Soon the flashlight goes out and Karan loses strength. The rats attack and kill him brutally (shown by dimming of lights and screams). Karan dies a long and painful death.

As a pastoral, nomadic society, they live in numerous nation-states in the Middle East. The Negev Bedouin live in the Negev region of Israel. After Israel's Establishment in 1948 and the occupation of Palestinian lands including Negev dessert, many of the Bedouin original settlers who remained in the area were relocated to towns. Israel has built seven official Bedouin townships, and approximately half of all Negev Bedouin live in these towns. The remainder live in unrecognized, unplanned townships which are officially illegal. The Israeli government does not provide infrastructure assistance or other services to those Bedouin who live in the unrecognized towns. As a minority group within Israeli society, the Bedouin are a marginalized group. Within this culture, women are said to be marginalized twice. They are marginalized once for being a Bedouin and a second time for being a woman. Marginalization as a Bedouin is common to both men and women, as members of a minority group. The marginalization as a woman stems from traditional gender norms and expectations within Negev Bedouin society. This marginalization manifests itself in employment, educational, and health care outcomes. Cultural status Traditionally, the Bedouin society was nomadic, pastoral, and agricultural based. Within this system, labor was divided along gender lines. Women were traditionally in charge of the agricultural activities, which included herding, grazing, fetching water, and raising crops, while men were in charge of guarding their land and receiving visitors. Bedouin culture, especially as it relates to gender norms, developed around this economic structure. In accordance with these traditional economic roles, women in Bedouin society did not interact with strangers, especially unfamiliar men. Bedouin men mediated most of the interactions their families have with the larger society. As such, Bedouin culture became highly patriarchal. Within this traditional system, the men have held most of the power, but the vital economic roles of the women granted them significant degree of influence over the household decision-making. However, the larger societal context of Bedouin culture is changing, particularly in the Negev. For the past several decades, the policy of the Israeli government has been to move the Negev Bedouin from the desert to official settlements. This has had several significant effects on Negev Bedouin society. Significantly, the move from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one has displaced the Bedouin women from their previously critical economic roles. Moreover, the shift to a sedentary lifestyle means that wage labor has largely replaced agriculture as the main economic structure for the Negev Bedouin. Traditionally, women in Negev Bedouin society were not allowed to work outside the home. This expectation is still in place today. As the Negev Bedouin have shifted away from agriculture, the productive responsibilities have shifted to the men. Meanwhile, the patriarchal system that developed around the traditional economic structure has been maintained. Ultimately, this has resulted in a loss of power within the household for Bedouin women. It is still considered culturally inappropriate for women to interact with strangers (especially strange men), and the men of the family still mediate their families' interactions with society as a whole. The loss of their economic capabilities has meant that Negev Bedouin women are increasingly excluded from decision-making within the household. As a result, the overwhelming majority of important household decisions are made by men. Employment Negev Weaving project by bedouin women in Lakiya to create employment opportunities Reliable statistics concerning Bedouin women's participation in the labor force are difficult to find. The same gender norms that limit women's employment outside the home also prevents women from registering as unemployed at the unemployment offices. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that in 2007, only 11.4% of Bedouin women were employed outside of their homes. However, this estimate did not distinguish the types of work Negev Bedouin women engaged in outside of the household. Several factors contribute to Bedouin women's lack of participation in the labor force. A study conducted by economist Aamer Abu-Qarn determined that the most significant barriers to women's employment are lack of education, lack of experience, and poor infrastructure in Bedouin towns. Surprisingly, factors that were not found significant by the model included the presence or number of children, the health of household members, and the level of modernity. Other factors that explain the relative underrepresentation of Bedouin women in the labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men in the labor force, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls are much more likely to drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option. This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men. Statistics describing the types of employment Negev Bedouin women engage in are virtually non-existent. In many instances, such data are simply not reported in employment surveys. Even the most encompassing studies often fail to fully account for women's employment, especially the disaggregated types of employment. Education =Primary and secondary education= In general, Negev Bedouins have one of the highest school dropout rates in Israel. Between grades one and twelve, 85% of girls and 71% of boys drop out. As with many other areas, poor infrastructure (especially pronounced in the unrecognized villages, but also in the official towns) is a significant obstacle. The physical conditions of school buildings are often substandard, with many lacking in basic facilities, such as libraries, gyms, cafeterias, and heating and cooling systems. Under Israeli law, education is compulsory for all students between the ages of six and thirteen. However, indifference at the government level has meant that this law has not always been enforced with regards to the Negev Bedouin. Moreover, the government will not support infrastructure developments to schools in the unrecognized villages, as the official policy is to incentivize the relocation of the Bedouin into towns. As the building and maintenance of schools is a municipal matter, there are relatively fewer Bedouin schools (compared to the rest of Israeli society), and schools are often further away from most households. Bedouin girls face additional obstacles to their education. Among the biggest problems is the nature of the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl's father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters. Another important issue for the education of Negev Bedouin girls is the relative dearth of female teachers. Especially in the post- primary schools, male teachers significantly outnumber female teachers. Of the female teachers, very few are themselves Negev Bedouin. This lack of female teachers means that female students are unable to form relationships with their teachers (as these teachers are male, such a level of interaction would be considered culturally taboo). This shortage of female teachers severely limits girls‚Äô scholastic opportunities, as well as deprives them of potential role models. =Higher education= The high dropout rate is among the biggest obstacles to higher education for both Bedouin men and women. Of the students that do remain in school, only about 30% pass their matriculation exams. These exams are taken at the end of high school (typically around age 17) and are required for enrollment at Israeli universities. Moreover, Bedouin students studying at Israeli universities face a significant language barrier (instruction is generally in Hebrew or English, not Arabic). Finally, most Negev Bedouin men are employed as wage laborers, not as white-collar or blue- collar workers. In the face of this fact, it often does not seem a reasonable investment to attain higher education. Among the biggest obstacle to higher education for women is the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted to make the trip if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university is a very different cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced cultural difference is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their fathers (or other male guardians) or their husbands. Finally, the lack of female employment opportunities means that studying at a university does not seem to be a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited. Access to healthcare Bedouin women face many of the same problems in terms of accessing health care as do Bedouin men in the Negev. To begin with, infrastructure in Bedouin towns is often underdeveloped or non-existent. In addition to restricting access to health care, this has the potential to create its own health problems, especially in the unrecognized villages. For example, in many unrecognized townships, the absence of a waste disposal system means that trash is deposited into a large, open-air pit. This can cause a myriad of health problems stemming from improper sanitation. Moreover, Bedouins often face both a cultural and a language barrier when seeking medical attention. A relative dearth of Arabic-speaking doctors (and even fewer Arabic-speaking specialists) means that medical attention is often given in Hebrew. Not all Negev Bedouin speak Hebrew, and those that do speak it as a second language. This is especially problematic for those requiring more specialized or intensive care, which often requires strict adherence to certain guidelines. When those guidelines are not fully understood, further health complications can arise. Finally, there are simply not enough doctors to fully serve the needs of the Bedouin population. In the seven recognized Bedouin towns in the Negev, there are a total of seven private pharmacies and 27 family health clinics operated by the Ministry of Health. In 2009, the total population of these towns was near 120,000. In addition to these problems, Bedouin women have additional obstacles to accessing care. Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. In circumstances where the clinic is further away from the settlement, a male relative must accompany the woman (often forfeiting a day's wage in order to do so). Moreover, higher school dropout rates and lower employment levels among Bedouin women mean that they are less likely to speak Hebrew. If the medical practitioner does not speak Arabic, the women must often rely on their male relatives for translation, thus forfeiting any right to medical privacy. When surveyed, Bedouin women cited lack of childcare (in addition to prohibitive distances and poor infrastructure) as a top barrier to accessing health care.

A technical support scam refers to any class of telephone fraud activities in which a scammer claims to offer a legitimate technical support service, often via cold calls to unsuspecting users. Such calls are mostly targeted at Microsoft Windows users, with the caller often claiming to represent a Microsoft technical support department. In English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, such cold call scams have occurred as early as 2008. The scammer will typically attempt to get the victim to allow remote access to their computer. After remote access is gained, the scammer relies on confidence tricks, typically involving utilities built into Windows and other software, in order to gain the victim's trust to pay for the supposed \\"support\\" services. The scammer will often then steal the victim's credit card account information or persuade the victim to log into their online banking account to receive a promised refund, only to steal more money, claiming that a secure server is connected and that the scammer cannot see the details. Many schemes involve convincing the victim to purchase expensive gift cards and then to divulge the card information to the scammer. Operation Fake Blue Screen of Death pop-up tricking the victim that their computer has a \\"system crash\\" and can no longer operate safely unless they call the toll-free number to \\"resolve\\" the issues. Technical support scams typically rely on social engineering. Scammers use a variety of confidence tricks to persuade the victim to install remote desktop software (often by informing the victim that the scammer is connecting the computer to a \\"secure server\\"), with which the scammer can then take control of the victim's computer. With this access, the scammer may then launch various Windows components and utilities (such as the Event Viewer), install third-party utilities (such as rogue security software) and perform other tasks in an effort to convince the victim that the computer has critical problems that must be remediated, such as infection with a virus. The scammer will urge the victim to pay, with a credit card or gift card, so the issues may be \\"fixed\\". =Initiation= Screenshot of a Recent Changes page from a MediaWiki site affected by customer support scammers promoting their \\"help lines\\" through unethical means such as spamming. Technical support scams can begin in a variety of ways. A scam most commonly begins with a cold call, usually claiming to be associated with a legitimate-sounding third party, with a name like \\"Microsoft\\", \\"Windows Technical Support\\" or \\"HP Support\\" . Scammers have also lured victims by purchasing keyword advertising on major search engines (with ads triggered by phrases such as \\"Microsoft live chat\\", \\"Facebook support\\", or \\"Outlook login help\\"), though both Bing and Google have taken steps to restrict such schemes. Other techniques include email spamming and cybersquatting to lead potential victims to web pages containing scammers' phone numbers.\\"Despite Crackdowns, Tech Support Ads In Search Are Still Cause For Consumer Confusion\\" . Search Engine Land, Ginny Marvin on August 5, 2014 Some scams have been initiated via pop-up ads on infected websites instructing the potential victim to call a number. These pop-ups often closely resemble legitimate error messages such as the Blue Screen of Death. =Remote access= While normally following a script, the scammer usually instructs the victim to download and install a remote access program, such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk, LogMeIn, GoToAssist, etc. With the software installed, the scammer convinces the victim to provide them with the remote access software's credentials or other details required to initiate a remote-control session, giving the scammer complete control of the victim's desktop. =Confidence tricks= After gaining access, the scammer attempts to convince the victim that the computer is suffering from problems that must be repaired, most often as the putative result of malicious hacking activity. Scammers use several methods to misrepresent the content and significance of common Windows tools and system directories as evidence of malicious activity, such as viruses and other malware. Normally the elderly and other vulnerable parties, such as those with limited technical knowledge, are targeted for technical support scams. * The scammer may direct users to Windows' Event Viewer, which displays a logfile of various events for use by system administrators and expert users to troubleshoot problems. Although many of the log entries are relatively harmless notifications, the scammer may fraudulently claim that log entries labeled as warnings and errors are evidence of malware activity or that the computer is becoming corrupted, and that the errors must be \\"fixed\\". * The scammer may present system folders that contain unusually named files, such as Windows' Prefetch and Temp folders, and claim that the files are evidence of malware on the system. The scammer may open some of these files (especially those in the Prefetch folder) in Notepad, where the file contents are rendered as mojibake. The scammer claims that malware has corrupted these files, causing the unintelligible output. In reality, the files in Prefetch are typically harmless, intact binary files used to speed up certain operations. * The scammer may misuse Command Prompt tools to generate suspicious-looking output, for instance, the \`tree\` or \`dir /s\` command, which displays an extensive listing of files and directories. The scammer may claim that the utility is a malware scanner, and while the tool is running, the scammer will enter text purporting to be an error message (such as \\"security breach ... trojans found\\") that will appear when the job finishes, or into a blank Notepad document. * The scammer may misrepresent values and keys stored in the Windows Registry as being malicious, such as innocuous keys whose values are listed as not being set. * The \\"Send To\\" Windows function is associated with a globally unique identifier. The output of the command \`assoc\`, which lists all file associations on the system, displays this association with the line \`ZFSendToTarget=CLSID\\\\{888DCA60-FC0A-11CF-8F0F-00C04FD7D062}\`; this GUID is the same on all versions of Windows. The scammer may claim that this is a unique ID used to identify the user's computer, or claim that the CLSID listed is actually a \\"Computer Licence Security ID\\" that must be renewed. * The scammer may claim that the system's problems are the result of expired hardware or software warranties, for example, Windows product keys, and coax the victim into paying for a \\"renewal\\". * The scammer may run the obscure \`syskey\` utility and configure a startup password known only to the scammer, thereby locking the victim out of their own system after the computer is rebooted.Woodchip computers:Have you been caught by the \\"I am Windows Support\\" scam? As \`syskey\` is only present in Windows versions previous to Windows 10, the scammer may force the user to become locked out by installing a keylogger and changing the user's account password and/or setting a PIN login requirement if the victim's computer runs on Windows 10. * The scammer may delete Windows critical files and folders such as \`system32\`, making the computer unusable until the operating system has been reinstalled. *The scammer may use their remote access software to surreptitiously download or delete confidential files or documents from the victim‚Äôs system while employing distraction techniques or while the victim is away from the computer procuring payment. * The scammer may block the victim from viewing their screen, claiming that it is the result of malware or of a scan being run, and use the time to search the user's files for sensitive information, attempt to break into the user's accounts with stolen or stored credentials or activate the webcam and see the user's face. * The scammer may run the \`netstat\` command in a terminal/command window, which shows local and foreign IP addresses. The scammer then tells the victim that these addresses belong to hackers that have intruded the computer. * The scammer may claim that a normal Windows process such as \`rundll32.exe\` is a virus. Often, the scammer will search the web for an article about the Windows process and will scroll to a section saying that the process name can also possibly be part of malware, even though the victim's computer does not contain that malware. =Objectives= These tricks are meant to target victims who may be unfamiliar with the actual uses of these tools, such as inexperienced users and senior citizens‚Äîespecially when the scam is initiated by a cold call. The scammer then coaxes the victim into paying for the scammer's services or software, which they claim is designed to \\"repair\\" or \\"clean\\" the computer but is actually malware that infects it or software that causes other damage, or does nothing at all. The scammer may gain access to the victim's credit card information, which can be used to make additional fraudulent charges. Afterward, the scammer may also claim that the victim is eligible for a refund, and request the user's bank account information‚Äîwhich is instead used to steal more money from the victim, rather than providing the promised refund. Alternatively, a scammer may attempt to request payment using gift cards for online platforms such as Amazon.com, Google Play, and iTunes Store. Some technical support scammers may surreptitiously open the victim's webcam in order to see what their victim looks like. They may also configure TeamViewer or other remote access clients for unattended access to the user's computer, so that they may return later and try to harass or intimidate a victim. Unlike legitimate companies, if their targets show resistance or refuse to follow the scammer or pay them, the scammer may become belligerent and insult, threaten or even blackmail the user into paying them. Canadian citizen Jakob Dulisse reported to CBC that, upon asking the scammer why he had been targeted, the scammer responded with a death threat; 'Anglo people who travel to the country‚Äô (India) were \\"cut up in little pieces\\" and thrown in the river.' In an investigation conducted by Symantec employee Orla Cox, it was revealed that after Cox paid for the fee for the scammer to remove the nonexistent \\"malware\\" infections, the scammers would then merely clear the log in the Event Viewer and disable Windows' event logging feature. This merely means that errors would no longer appear in the Event Viewer, i.e. had malware actually existed on Cox's computer, it would remain intact. Unethical and fake \\"support\\" companies The great majority of the complaints and discussion about companies that cold-call and offer \\"technical support\\" report them as being not merely incompetent or ineffective, but actively dishonest, doggedly trying to convince the victim of non-existent problems by trickery and, when possible, damaging the computer to which they gain access. Computer-support companies advertise on search engines like Google and Bing, but some are heavily criticised, sometimes for practices similar to those of the cold callers. One example is the India-based company iYogi, which has been reported by InfoWorld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software. In December 2015, the state of Washington sued iYogi's US operations for scamming consumers and making false claims in order to scare the users into buying iYogi's diagnostic software.Washington state sues firm, alleges tech support scam , Associated Press, 16 December 2015 iYogi, which was required to respond formally by the end of March 2016, said before its response that the lawsuit filed was without merit.Lawsuits Cloud iYogi Remote Tech Support Reputation , 11 Jan 2016 In September 2011, Microsoft dropped Comantra, a Gold Partner, from its Microsoft Partner Network following accusations of involvement in cold-call technical-support scams.Microsoft Drops partner accused of Cold-Call Scams , 22 February 2016 In December 2014, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against a California-based company operating such scams for \\"misusing Microsoft's name and trademarks\\" and \\"creating security issues for victims by gaining access to their computers and installing malicious software, including a password grabber that could provide access to personal and financial information\\". In an effort to protect consumers, Microsoft-owned advertising network Bing Ads (which services ad sales on Bing and Yahoo! Search engines) amended its terms of service in May 2016 to prohibit the advertising of third-party technical support services or ads claiming to \\"provide a service that can only be provided by the actual owner of the products or service advertised\\". Google Search followed suit in August 2018, but went further by banning any advertising related to technical support, regardless of source, citing that it had become too difficult to differentiate legitimate providers from scams. Scams from India As a result of the country formerly being a territory of the British Empire, as well as a strong presence of English taught as a second language, India has millions of English speakers who are competing for relatively few jobs. One municipality had 114 jobs and received 19,000 applicants, and it is not uncommon for these unemployed youth to riot.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/02/the-scammers-gaming-indias- overcrowded-job-market This high level of unemployment serves as an incentive for tech scamming jobs, which can be lucrative. Many scammers do not realize they are applying for tech scam jobs, but many often stay and continue to scam people even after they realize what they are doing. When one tech scammer was asked why she continues to work for scammers she replied, \\"You think because the people who run these call centres are making so much money every day, you might as well make some of it while you are here.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/02/the-scammers-gaming-indias- overcrowded-job-market When the BBC interviewed another tech scammer in India and asked why he victimized people he replied, \\"It was easy money,\\" and then went on to detail how he bought fancy cars and designer clothes.https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-51753362 Scammers in India often convince themselves that they are targeting wealthy people in the West, and that this justifies their theft.https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-51753362 In March 2020 the BBC published a joint string operation with grey hat scambaiter Jim Browning, in which they managed to get access to a scam call center located in the Gurugram suburb of Delhi. Browning managed to hack the security cameras of the scam call center and recorded the internal functions of the operation, including a meeting that the owner, Amit Chauhan, held with associates in which they discussed the details of their criminal activities.https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-51753362 Scam baiting Tech support scammers are regularly targeted by scam baiting both online and offline, with individuals seeking to raise awareness of these scams by uploading recordings on platforms like YouTube, cause inconvenience to the scammers by wasting their time, and by disabling the scammer's computer systems by deploying RATs, distributed denial of service attacks and destructive computer viruses. Scam baiters may also attempt to lure scammers into exposing their unethical practices by leaving dummy files or malware disguised as confidential information, such as credit/debit card information and passwords, on a virtual machine for the scammer to attempt to steal, only to himself or herself become infected. In November 2017, a company called Myphonesupport initiated a petition seeking the identities of John Doe defendants in a New York case involving a telephonic denial-of-service attack against its call centers. The case has since been disposed. In March 2020, an anonymous YouTuber under the alias \\"Jim Browning\\" successfully infiltrated and gathered drone and CCTV footage of a fraudulent call centre scam operation through the help of fellow YouTube personality Karl Rock. Through the aid of the British documentary programme Panorama, a police raid was carried out when the documentary was brought to the attention of assistant police commissioner Karan Goel, leading to the arrest of call centre operator Amit Chauhan who also operated a fraudulent travel agency under the name \\"Faremart Travels\\". Kitboga is an American scambaiter who regularly streams videos on Twitch and uploads highlights on YouTube. He began baiting in mid-2017 after he found out that his grandmother was a victim of many types of scams designed to prey on the elderly, both online and in-person. To misdirect scammers away from his real identity, as well as for viewer entertainment, Kitboga often acts as a number of characters during his videos, including an 80-year-old grandmother named Edna, a valley girl named Nevaeh, or sometimes even a competing technical support scammer named Daniel. In his videos, Kitboga engages in scambaiting several types of scammers, a majority of whom operate call centers in India. Besides technical support scammers, he also engages with refund scammers, IRS scammers, and others.

The outer bailey of Pyrmont Castle (Germany). Veve≈ô√≠ Castle in the Czech Republic with its outer bailey. An outer bailey or outer ward is the defended outer enclosure of a castle.Friar, Stephen (2003). The Sutton Companion to Castles, Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2003, p. 22. It protects the inner bailey and usually contains those ancillary buildings used for the management of the castle or the supply of its occupants. These domestic buildings could include workshops, livestock stalls and stables; storage facilities such as barns, sheds and granaries, as well as quarters for servants such as maids, farm workers, and even the castle governors or castellans. In many cases there was also a brewery, a bakehouse and a kitchen, if the latter was not located in the hall or palas. An outer bailey was often called a base court in England. Depending on topography it could also be referred to as a lower bailey or lower ward, the keep being in the upper bailey or ward. Chepstow Castle has lower, middle and upper baileys. The domestic buildings of the continental schloss, often a stately home or palace, may also be referred to as an outer ward (German: Vorburg). These frequently contained a carriage house or a cavalier house, buildings that were not common in medieval castles. Large castles often have more than one bailey; examples include Monschau and B√ºrresheim. At some larger castles, markets were held in the outer bailey (c.f. suburbium). Outer baileys were usually enclosed and protected by a ring wall and separated from the actual living area of the castle ‚Äì the inner ward and keep ‚Äì by a moat, a wall and a gate. In lowland castles, the outer bailey is usually arranged in a half-moon shape around the main castle. In the case of hill castles, the topographic features of the terrain had to be taken account of, with the result that the outer bailey was usually slightly lower than the inner ward, hence the alternative names of \\"lower bailey\\" or \\"lower ward\\". Rudelsburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt is one of the rare cases of a hill castle where both baileys are at the same level. In many cases the main entrance to the inner living quarters led through the outer bailey, which thus formed a kind of defensive buffer and often also served as refuge for the villagers who lived outside the castle walls. This explains why the castle chapel was often found in the bailey: it served as the parish church for the commoners.

He rose to prominence as a recipient of the Cultural Center of the Philippines' Thirteen Artist Awards in 1994, and his works have since become one of the most widely exhibited and most sought-after at auctions among Southeast Asian artists. He is married to fellow artist Plet Bolipata. Style When asked about his visual approach, Borlongan describes his style as figurative expressionism. Art curator Ditas Samson expounds on this, describing a typical Borlongan canvas as \\"dominated by the human figure - often disorted in shape, in unreal hues.\\" Borlongan's early work is known for its usage of figures in urban settings, in stark contrast to the idyllic rural settings of the earlier generation of Filipino artists, such as Fernando Amorsolo. Later works by Borlongan, after his move from the streets of Manila to the provincial settings of Zambales, increasingly featured people in rural settings as well, but imbued with the same tense energy which characterizes his urban-setting figures - a thematic contrast which has been described as a prominent characteristic of Borlongan's later corpus. Education and early influences =Family, early art education, and roots of social consciousness= Borlongan was born at 7:25 AM on January 7, 1967 at De Ocampo Memorial Medical Center in Santa Mesa, Manila to chemist Pascual Garcia Borlongan of Calumpit, Bulacan and Dolores Pido Misa of Mandaluyong, and grew up in the Nueve de Pebrero area of Mandaluyong City. His father Pascual encouraged Borlongan's artistic pursuits at a very young age, encouraging him to draw everyday objects from various angles. He began his formal art education in 1978, at the young age of eleven, taking up Fernando Sena's art classes offered under the auspices of Children‚Äôs Museum and Library, Inc (CMLI). Recalling Sena's influence in a 2012 interview, Borlongan recounts: :\\"It was the painter Fernando Sena who introduced me to the art world. While I was studying under him at the Children's Museum and Library, Inc. (CMLI) in 1978, he would open the pages of the encyclopedia and show in class the works of his favorite Dutch painters Rembrandt and Frans Hals. :[Fernando Sena...] taught me the basics of drawing and painting. It was a solid foundation to prepare me to the direction of where I want my art to proceed. All of his students imitated his style to understand the techniques he was teaching. It was up to the individual to find his own identity.\\" Sena also contributed to Borlongan's artistic development by convincing him to enroll in a fine arts course instead of taking up architecture as he had originally planned. Borlongan's exposure to the poor areas in Tondo in Manila and in Montalban and Antipolo in Rizal province where he apprenticed under Sena during workshops would help provide Borlongan with much of the imagery that would become the subjects of his later works. Borlongan came of age in a period of significant social tumult in the Philippines - contributing to the social awareness inherent in Borlongan's work. 1970 saw the beginning of the so-called \\"First Quarter Storm\\"; 1971 saw the Plaza Miranda Bombing; September 1972 saw Ferdinand Marcos' proclamation of Martial Law; 1983 saw the assassination of Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr.; and 1986 saw the overthrow of the Marcos government via the so-called EDSA revolution - just a year shy of Borlongan's graduation from college. =Undergraduate period at the University of the Philippines Diliman= Borlongan enrolled at the University of the Philippines' College of Fine Arts in 1983 and majored in Painting. Here Borlongan became a founding member of the famed Grupong Salingpusa, initially an informal group of young student artists which would later become significant voices in the Philippine contemporary art movement, including such figures as Joy Mallari, Karen Flores and Manny Garibay. A subset of Grupong Salingpusa, consisting of Borlongan, Mallari, Flores, Mark Justiniani, and Federico Slevert, later came together to form the Sanggawa Art Collective in 1994. In his second year in college, Borlongan was selected as a delegate to the ASEAN Youth Painting Workshop and Exhibition, which was held at the National Art Gallery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \\"Being a delegate exposed me to new developments in Southeast Asian art,\\" Borlongan recalls. The Filipino delegates later held a homecoming exhibit at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Borlongan got his bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, major in Painting, in 1987. Early work By the time of Borlongan's graduation, the Philippines' socioeconomic and political climate was still tumultuous. 1987 saw the national trauma that was the Mendiola massacre, and numerous coups d'√©tat threatened the new government of Corazon Aquino from 1986 to 1989. Massive destruction from natural disasters took the form of the 1990 Luzon earthquake and the 1991 Mt Pinatubo Eruption, and crippling power outages dampened the Philippine economy. Borlongan immediately found himself using his art to engage the Filipino's social awareness. Borlongan recalls: :\\"My classmate Manny Garibay asked me to help him finish a mural for Lean Alejandro's funeral procession. It was an eye-opener for me on the ills of Philippine society. I eventually joined the activist art collective ABAY or Artista ng Bayan along with another classmate Mark Justiniani. We were prolific in doing street murals, effigy, posters, banners, streamers, illustrations and comics for cause-oriented groups. Giving art workshops and organizing students were also a part of our activities.\\" Borlongan's career got a jumpstart when his painting \\"Rehimen\\" won the second prize in the Metrobank Annual National Painting Competition in 1988, giving his works significant exposure and positioning him as an up-and coming artist. In 1989, he went to Paris as a member of the Philippine delegation to the International Conference on Human Rights and Democracy, along with the members of Bukluran ng mga Musikero para sa Bayan (Buklod) and artists from the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA). Borlongan recalls being inspired by speakers, most notably the Chinese pro-democracy activists from Tiananmen Square. Another work, \\"Tampuhan\\", again won him the second place in the Metrobank Annual National Painting Competition in 1992. 1993 saw a return to the University of the Philippines Diliman campus for Borlongan. He and Roberto Feleo were artist delegates to the 2nd ASEAN Workshop, Exhibit, and Symposium on Aesthetics in Manila, and as part of the workshop the two were given working studios in UPD. Rise to prominence and marriage to Plet Bolipata The relative success of the Philippines 2000 platform instituted by president Fidel V. Ramos in 1992 created an environment where young artists like Borlongan could find more opportunities. But the platform's thrusts towards industrialization and economic liberalization presented causes for concern - themes which continued to find their way into the themes of Borlongan's work. In 1994, the Cultural Center of the Philippines recognized Borlongan with the Thirteen Artists Award, an award that honors artists who \\"take the chance and risk to restructure, restrengthen, and renew art making and art thinking.‚Äù The following year, 1995, Borlongan agreed to serve as Artist-in-Residence at CASA San Miguel, San Antonio, Zambales. Here, he met Plet Bolipata, whose brother, acclaimed violinist Alfonso ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù Bolipata, had founded the art center. In 1996, he took up a posting as Artist-in-Residence in ARCUS Ibaraki, Japan. Borlongan received a lot of exposure during the 1998 Philippine Centennial celebrations, notably being part of \\"At Home and Abroad: 20 Contemporary Filipino Artists\\", a centennial celebration exhibit that opened first at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and then moved to the Houston Art Museum and the East-West Center Museum in Honolulu before finally closing at the Metropolitan Museum in Manila. In the same year, Borlongan married Plet Bolipata, and the couple settled in the Borlongan family property in Mandaluyong City. Borlongan exhibited widely in the late 1990s and around the early 2000s, with shows in Tokyo, New York, Sydney, Singapore, Irvine, Brisbane, Honolulu, and Kuala Lumpur, among others. Zambales period In 2002, the Borlongan couple decided to move from their residence in Nueve de Pebrero, Mandaluyong, and settled in San Antonio, Zambales. The move had a significant influence on the art of both Borlongan and Bolipata. Bolipata noted in 2014: :\\"The mango trees, mountains, and sea opened and brightened up our canvases, and widened our view of the world. It is a gift to each other to create in two separate studios. We move freely, without marital ties that bind, uncompromising in our own worlds. Emong's studio is bursting with Rock and Roll music and mine is deeply ensconed in silence. We each have a sacred space to thresh out our ideas and experiences, mindful only of what we individually need to express.\\" For Borlongan, the move also meant an expansion in terms of figurative subjects - where once his work featured people in mostly urban settings, his works from this later period began to feature people from the countryside as well. This contrast between \\"City\\" and \\"Country\\" has since become a touchpoint whenever Borlongan works are exhibited together, such as in 2011's \\"Kariyanan\\" at the Pinto Art Gallery in Antipolo, Rizal, and at 2014's \\"Elmer Borlongan In City and Country (1992-2012)\\" at the Ayala Museum. Illustrator and designer Lisa Ito, writing in 2011 about this transition, notes: :\\"In terms of style and subject matter, the transition from Manila to Zambales is evident to those who are familiar with his earlier works. There are subtle shifts, from urban to rural themes (as well as subjects treading the hazy line dividing these two in the Philippine context), as well as lighter tonal changes in his palette and the freeing up of background space compared to his earlier works.\\" Other activities While a student at the UPD, Borlongan was the guitarist for a rock band called Is It Safe?, playing punk-influenced sets in a bar in Malate.

At the urging of Georgia's proprietor, General James Oglethorpe, and his fellow colonial trustees, the British Parliament formally codified prohibition in 1735, two years after the colony's founding. The ban remained in effect until 1751, when the diminution of the Spanish threat and economic pressure from Georgia's emergent planter class forced Parliament to reverse itself. Background Having envisioned the Georgia colony as a haven for debtors and reformed prisoners, Oglethorpe was uncomfortable with the prospect of Georgians attaining immense wealth and coalescing into a planter aristocracy (akin to that across the border in South Carolina) through the exploitation of slave labor. Oglethorpe shared his preference for an austere ethic of hard work with his fellow trustees of the colony, who believed that their preeminent social goal ‚Äì moral reform through individual economic autonomy ‚Äì would be undermined by the introduction of slavery. The ban on slavery had practical military implications as well. During the mid 18th century, the Spanish maintained a foothold in North America through their colonial presence in Florida, which borders Georgia to the south. London envisioned Georgia as a buffer colony to stem Spanish expansion in the Southeast and protect the more profitable colonies to the north. The Spanish tactic of recruiting American slaves to military service in exchange for their emancipation buoyed Oglethorpe's experiment by providing a strategic incentive to minimize the slave presence in Georgia. Implementation Believing that the anticipated agricultural output of Georgia ‚Äì mostly low-labor intensity products such as silk ‚Äì will lend itself better to small-scale farming by white Europeans, the trustees expected the early colonist to acquiesce their vision of the colony free of slave labor. Yet Oglethorpe underestimated the colonists' disinclination toward the intensive labor requisite for agricultural output, especially by comparison to their much wealthier and far more leisurely counterparts in South Carolina. In addition, in the interest of furthering their holdings into George‚Äôs plentiful farmland, some South Carolinian plantation owners lobbied Georgians to flout the trustees' wishes. Sensing that he could not hold the ban in place through sheer force of will, Oglethorpe sought and received Parliamentary backing when the House of Commons passed legislation codifying the prohibition on slavery in Georgia in 1735. Resistance The fiercest opponents of the Georgia Experiment were a group known as the Malcontents, led by Patrick Tailfer and Thomas Stephens. Unlike those rescued from the English debtors' prison for the colonial proprietors, the Malcontents were overwhelmingly Scottish and received no financial assistance from the trustees to aid their relocation to Georgia. Stephens and Tailfer organized numerous publications and letter- writing campaigns, the most prominent which netted some 121 signatures in 1738. When Oglethorpe and the trustees proved recalcitrant in the face of this public pressure, the Malcontents lobbied the House of Commons directly, including junkets by the leadership to London. However, Parliament was unmoved by their arguments so long as Spain remained of military threat to the British colonies. Repeal In 1742, Oglethorpe won a resounding victory over the Spanish of the Battle of Bloody Marsh, effectively ending Spanish expansionism in North America. It was Oglethorpe's greatest military victory that sealed the fate of his prized Georgia Experiment, as the removal of the Spanish threats substantially decreased incentive for the House of Commons to continue the promulgation of an increasingly unpopular ban on slavery. By 1750, the trustees acquiesced to Georgia's demand for slave labor and in that year Parliament revised the act of 1735 to allow slavery as of January 1, 1751. Aftermath Once the Georgia experiment was formally abandoned, the colony quickly caught up to the regional neighbors in the acquisition of slaves. A decade after the repeal, Georgia boasted one slave for every two freemen, and slaves made up about one-half of the colony's population on the eve of the American Revolution. By virtue of increased production of staple products (particularly rice and indigo) as a result of the importation of slave labor, Georgia had the economic luxury to support a dramatically growing population: between 1751 and 1776, the colony's population increase more than tenfold, to a total of about 33,000 (including 15,000 slaves). However, not all white Georgians were unambiguous beneficiaries. Low‚Äìskilled white labor and white artisans commanded drastically reduced wages due to the competition of slave labor. The growing chasm between the ascendant planter class and a large contingent of small farmers, independent artisans, and unskilled white laborers sharply factionalized the colony both before and during the Revolutionary War. Georgia's lackluster performance in the war effort has been linked to the uncertain leadership of this comparatively new and rootless aristocracy.

It was built between 1548 and 1551 by the government of Edward VI to protect the islands against French attack. Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the anchorage of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse would have housed a battery of two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed on the side of the gun platform. During the interregnum following the English Civil War, the Old Blockhouse was occupied by the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651. Blake's naval guns out- ranged those of the fort, and, after fierce fighting, the blockhouse was taken. A battery of guns was maintained at the blockhouse until at least the 1750s, but by the end of the 18th century the fortification was disused and in ruins. After 1922 the blockhouse was placed into the guardianship of the state by the lessee of the island, Arthur Dorrien-Smith, and in the 21st century it is controlled by English Heritage and open to tourists. It is protected as a scheduled monument under UK law. History =16th century= The Old Blockhouse was built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the Scilly Isles against French attack.; Tensions with France had grown during the reign of Henry VIII and spilled over into war in 1538. Henry initially responded by fortifying the coasts of England, constructing new artillery forts designed to defend against the longer-range cannons that were becoming common in the 16th century. Henry's son, the nine-year-old Edward VI, inherited the throne in 1547, facing renewed war with France. Edward Seymour was made the Lord Protector to the King, and he appointed his brother, Thomas, as England's Lord Admiral. Thomas inspected the Scilly Isles personally and concluded that they were vulnerable to a French invasion. Old Blockhouse, viewed from the south-west As a result of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, supported by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.; The Old Blockhouse was built as part of this programme of work. The blockhouse was positioned on high ground to protect the Old Grimsby harbour, overlooking both the harbour and the nearby anchorage of St Helen's Pool.; When complete, it would have held a battery of two to three guns, which could have fired on targets attempting to enter the harbour, or engaged ships approaching the Scilly Isles from the north-east.; Edward Seymour fell from power in 1549, and after his removal a new survey was carried out by Captain William Tyrell, in part to confirm that the new fortifications were suitably located across the islands. Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552. The Old Blockhouse appears to have been completed, but the Crown's resources had become badly stretched and the decision was taken at the end of 1552 to curtail further expenditure on the Scilly Isles. Between 1548 and 1552, a total of ¬£3,123 had been spent on improving the fortifications on the islands; a 1579 survey suggested that, with the cost of the garrisons, the project had come to a total of ¬£6,000. Edward's successor, Queen Mary I, intended to establish a garrison of 150 soldiers on the islands, but it is uncertain if these numbers were ever achieved. =17th century= The blockhouse, viewed from across Old Grimsby harbour The Old Blockhouse saw military action in 1651 during the interregnum after the end of the English Civil War, making it one of the very few of England's coastal defences to have ever seen actual fighting. The Scilly Isles were supporters of Charles I during the civil war, and after a short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648.; Tresco formed a base for Royalists privateers and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold they could then use against England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake in charge of a naval task force to retake the islands. Blake arrived at St Helen's Pool in April 1651 and set about taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse.; Blake deployed a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island and had to be recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back.; Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's. The blockhouse remained an important fortification after the invasion. Parliament invested ¬£1,050 in the islands' defences and carried out a survey in 1652, calling the blockhouse the \\"Dover Fort.; In 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne and Edward Sherburne was sent to the Scilly Isles to inspect the defences; he recommended that repairs be carried out to the Old Blockhouse. =18th-21st centuries= The Crown, in the form of the Duchy of Cornwall, leased the islands in 1687 to the Godolphin family, followed by August Smith in 1831. The blockhouse was inspected by Christian Lilly in 1715, on the orders of the Duke of Marlborough; he reported that it was \\"very much decayed\\", with only the walls standing, but recommended that it be repaired at a cost of ¬£28. The antiquary William Borlase noted during his 1752 visit that there was a battery of guns at the Old Blockhouse, guarding the harbour, but by the time that the writer John Troutbeck saw the site at the end of the century, the guns had been removed.; ; The blockhouse walls remained in good condition, however, and Troutbeck considered that it would still have military utility if brought back into service. In 1922, the lease passed to Arthur Dorrien-Smith, who agreed to pass several properties on Tresco, including the blockhouse, into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works.; In the 21st century, the blockhouse is controlled by English Heritage, the successor to the ministry, and open to tourists. It is protected as a scheduled monument under UK law. Architecture Plan of the Old Blockhouse: A - earth bank; B - small room; C - gun platform; D - rocky outcrop The Old Blockhouse comprises a paved, square gun platform, approximately by , with thick, low granite walls, which were probably somewhat taller when they were first built.; ; It is built on top of a rocky outcrop, which forms part of the lower courses of the walls, and is reached by a flight of stairs. The platform originally had embrasures on the north-west and north-east corners, with the walls probably forming a parapet, although it is possible there may also have been a roof to the platform. In the south-west corner of the platform is a lean-to, which may have been either a powder locker or a shelter for the blockhouse watch; a compartment in the south wall might have also been used to store ammunition.; ; A small room, by , was added on to the west, after the construction of the main building, possibly during the English Civil War. This was equipped with windows and a fireplace, and would have formed living quarters for the troops. An earthwork bank defends the landward side of the blockhouse, described variously as between around and high, similar to those found around forts of this period along the Thames River in England.; ; There are also the remains of a defensive stone wall on the seaward side of the blockhouse, although much of the wall has been destroyed by coastal erosion. The design of the blockhouse is conservative for the period, and echoes that of the forts built during the reign of Henry VIII.; This is in contrast to the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built at the same time as the blockhouse, but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions.

Educated at the √âcole Polytechnique, Talabot started his career building canals. Inspired by George and Robert Stephenson's steam railways in England, he built a line to transport coal from the coal mines at La Grand- Combe to the Mediterranean at N√Æmes, which opened in 1839. He visited England and became friends with Robert Stephenson, with whom he surveyed a route for a Suez Canal in 1847. The French Revolution of 1848 was followed by a financial crisis, and Talabot formed a company in 1852 to take over the struggling railway between Lyon and the Mediterranean; this merged with the Paris to Lyon Railway in 1857 to become the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e. In 1862 Talabot became its first Director General and he died on 21 March 1885. Biography =Early life= Paulin Talabot was born on 18 August 1799 in Limoges in western France.Annales His father, Francois Talabot (1764‚Äì1839), was a lawyer, and his mother was Marie Agathe Martin-Lagrave. He had seven siblings: Pierre Auguste (1790‚Äì1867); L√©on Joseph (1796‚Äì1863); Francois Jules (1792‚Äì1868); and Jean-Baptiste Edmond (1804‚Äì1832). He studied at the √âcole Polytechnique from 1819; Talabot is said to have become a follower of the Saint-Simonianism movement, but according to Ernouf this is because is he is confused with his younger brother, Edmond. chapter 1 =Career= In 1821, he started work building canals in Brest, and then in 1829 he moved to Decize, a coal mining area, chapter II to rebuild the canal between Aigues-Mortes and Beaucaire. chapter III Learning of the success of the railways in England that were being built by George and Robert Stephenson, Talabot formed the Compagnie des Mines de la Grand‚ÄôCombe et des chemins de fer du Gard, which planned to build a railway to take the coal from the mines at La Grand-Combe to the Mediterranean at N√Æmes. The railway was approved 20 June 1833, but the scheme failed to raise the necessary funds until the government backed the scheme in 1837. chapter V Talabot visited England and befriended Robert Stephenson, who later visited Talabot in France. The first section of line from N√Æmes to Beaucaire, opened on 15 July 1839, and a train covered the in 32 minutes using steam locomotives from Newcastle in England hauling carriages built in France. A second section opened in August 1840 and the line was fully opened in 1841. chapter VI Between 1838 and 1840, Talabot surveyed a railway between Avignon and Marseille via the Rhone Valley. Permission was granted in 1843 for the difficult line that included the bridge over the Rhone chapter VII and the Nerthe tunnel, longer than anything in England at that time. chapter VIII In 1846, Talabot became a member of the Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes du Canal de Suez in 1846, and the following year had accompanied Robert Stephenson and Alois Negrelli to look at the feasibility of a Suez canal. The British opposed a canal and other countries could not agree on the route. In 1854 he and his brother were listed as founders of the Suez Canal Company by Ferdinand de Lesseps. In 1855 Talabot published Le Canal des deux mers, d'Alexandrie √† Suez; moyens d'ex√©cution. chapter IX He later built railroads in Algeria, where he was also involved with maritime transportation and mining (with the Compagnie de Mokta el Hadid).

He lost to Prosper Allemand, who won 14,212 votes against 7,412 for Talabot and 3,755 for Arthur Picard. A fall fractured his kneecap, and an overdose of the chloroform he used to treat the pain made him blind. He retired from the PLM in 1882, accepting the title of Honorary Director General. Talabot died on 21 March 1885. Legacy A bust of Talabot was placed at N√Æmes railway station in 1997.

Its existence was confirmed by the discovery of several inscriptions mentioning Taita, king of Palistin. Relief image of King Taita (right side of the central panel), Hadad temple, Aleppo citadel History Palistin was one of the Syro- Hittite states that emerged in Syria after the Late Bronze Age collapse. OUP Oxford, 2012 It dates to at least the 11th century BC and is known primarily through the inscriptions of its king Taita and his wife. The kingdom emerged some time soon after the collapse of the Hittite Empire, of which it is one of the successor states, and it encompassed a relatively extensive area, stretching at least from the Amouq Valley in the west, to Aleppo in the east, down to Mhardeh and Shaizar in the south. Prof. Itamar Singer proposes that it was the predecessor state that, once it disintegrated, gave birth to the kingdoms of Hamath, Bit Agusi and Pattin (shortened form of Palistin).Before and After the Storm: Crisis Years in Anatolia and Syria between the Fall of the Hittite Empire and the Beginning of a New Era (ca. 1220-1000 BC), A Symposium in Memory of Itamar Singer, University of Pavia, 2012, pp. 7‚Äì8. =Archaeological evidence= The excavations at Tell Tayinat in the Turkish Hatay province which might have been the capital of Palistin, revealed two settlements, the first being a Bronze Age Aegean farming community, and the second an Iron Age Syro-Hittite city built on top of the Aegean farming settlement. Palistin is attested as Walistin in an inscription discovered in 1936 at the site. Palistin (\\"Watasatina\\") is also attested in the Sheizar Stele, which is the funerary monument of Queen Kupapiya, the wife of Taita. Another stele, discovered in Meharde, might well be the funerary monument of King Taita. Both stelae mention the name of Taita, and invoke a \\"divine Queen of the Land\\", possibly the goddess Kubaba. Most importantly, in 2003 a statue of King Taita bearing his inscription in Luwian was discovered during excavations conducted by German archeologist Kay Kohlmeyer in the Citadel of Aleppo. Possible link to Philistines While Hittitologist John David Hawkins initially gave two transcriptions of the Aleppo inscriptions, Wadasatini and Padasatini, a later reading suggests a third possible interpretation: Palistin. The similarity between Palistin and names for the Philistines, such as the Ancient Egyptian Peleset and the Hebrew ◊§÷∞÷º◊ú÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊™÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù Pli≈°tim, have led archaeologists Benjamin Sass,Benjamin Sass, Taita, King of Palistin: Ca 950-900 BCE?, University of Tel Aviv, 2010. and Kay Kohlmeyer to hypothesize a connection. It has even been suggested, for instance, that the area around Kunulua (Calno; Tell Tayinat) may even have been part of a Philistine urheimat.Julia Fridman, 2015, \\"Riddle of the Ages Solved: Where Did the Philistines Come From?\\", Haaretz (10 February 2016). Gershon Galil suggests that King David halted the Arameans‚Äô expansion into the Land of Israel on account of his alliance with the southern Philistine kings, as well as with Toi, king of ·∏§amath (mentioned in the Bible), who is identified with Taita II, king of Palistin (the northern Sea Peoples).The History of King David in Light of New Epigraphic and Archeological Data haifa.ac.il 2012 According to Galil, there are now eight inscriptions recently discovered at different sites indicating that a large kingdom named Palistin existed in this area, which included the cities of Hamath, Aleppo and Carchemish.The History of King David in Light of New Epigraphic and Archeological Data haifa.ac.il 2012 The proposed Palistin-Philistines link remains controversial. According to Hittitologist Trevor Bryce, the connection between the biblical Philistines and the kingdom of Palistin remains a hypothesis and further excavations are needed to establish such a connection. The Shaizar and Meharde inscriptions apparently preserve the ethnonym Walistin and there is no clear explanation for the alternation between a character signifying Wa- in the Shaizar and Meharde inscriptions and one signifying Pa- in the Aleppo inscriptions. If it was the case ‚Äì as has been proposed by some theories concerning the Sea Peoples ‚Äì that they originated in the Aegean area, there is no evidence from the Syro-Hittite artefacts at Tell Tayinat, either pictorial nor philological, to indicate a link to known Aegean civilizations. On the contrary, most of the discoveries at Tell Tayinat indicate a typical Luwian state. To cite two examples: firstly, the Syro-Hittite inhabitants used predominantly red slipped burnished ware, which is totally different from the Aegean-type pottery used by the early farming inhabitants. And secondly, the names of the kings of Palistin and the kings of the successor state of Pattin are also Hittite, even though there is no evidence of a direct link between Taita and the old Hittite royal house. It has since been proposed, based on material evidence and epigraphical parallels, that some Philistines did in fact settle in Kinalua, living alongside the indigenous inhabitants before assimilating into the Luwian population of what became a typical Neo-Hittite state in all but its name, which was all that remained of the Early Iron Age Sea Peoples settlers.Emanuel, Jeffrey P. \\"King Taita and His Palistin: Philstine State or Neo-Hittite Kingdom?\\" Antiguo Oriente 13 (2015), 11‚Äì40 (link).T.

DeLong is an American neurologist and professor at the Medical School of Emory University. His research has advanced the understanding and treatment of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tremor and other neurological movement disorders. DeLong attended Stanford University (AB 1962), Harvard Medical School (MD 1966), completed his internship at Boston City Hospital and his residency training at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and subsequently joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. Since 1990, he has been a member of the faculty at Emory University, where he has been the William Patterson Timmie Professor of Neurology since 1993. He is a member of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiative. In 1968, DeLong began five years of research training in the laboratory of Edward Evarts at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1971, he and Russell T. Richardson did experiments with monkeys to find out first groups of neurons (nucleus basalis), which are involved in the pathogenesis conditioned learning and they revealed the role played by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.z.B. Timeline Behaviourist Approach, Matt Jarvis, Psychology Review, pdf. At the NIH, DeLong recorded the reactions of single brain cells in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. At that time, it was known that the basal ganglia were involved in movement, and were the part of the brain most significantly affected in Parkinson‚Äôs disease. However, little was known about how the basal ganglia affected movement, or how disease of the basal ganglia caused the movement disorders seen in Parkinson's disease. In meticulous experiments over several years, DeLong measured the firing of specific cells in the basal ganglia of awake monkeys when they performed specific trained movements. Based on this work, and the work of others, DeLong and his colleagues identified a series of separate circuits that connect the basal ganglia with the cerebral cortex and thalamus. These circuits allow parallel processing of emotions, thoughts, and movement. In the 1980s, DeLong and his colleagues began to study monkeys with an experimentally-induced disease much like Parkinson‚Äôs disease. He discovered that neurons in a part of the basal ganglia called the subthalamic nucleus were firing excessively, and that destroying (ablating) the subthalamic nucleus greatly improved the symptoms. Shortly thereafter, neurosurgeon Alim-Louis Benabid discovered that the same improvement could be achieved by placing a wire into the subthalamic nucleus, connecting it to a battery and delivering an adjustable high-frequency stimulation to the tip of the wire‚Äîa technique called deep brain stimulation. Today, this technique is used to improve symptoms and the quality of life in patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease who are not responding adequately to pharmacologic treatment. Ablation or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has transformed the lives of many people with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. For his work in understanding the circuits connecting the basal ganglia to other parts of the brain, and in applying that knowledge to develop a technique that has eased the suffering of many people with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, DeLong was honored in 2014 with the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.Laureates The same accomplishments were recognized by his receipt (with Benabid) of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award.

Life A younger son of William Newenham, of Coolmore, County Cork, and Dorothea, daughter and heiress of Edward Worth, he was born on 5 November 1734. He was appointed collector of the excise of Dublin in 1764, but was removed in 1772, apparently for political reasons. In the Irish Parliament Newenham represented Enniscorthy from 1769 to 1776, and the county of Dublin from 1776 to 1797. He was a man of moderate political views, but a reformer of Parliament, within the limits of the constitution, and on strictly Protestant lines. He induced Parliament to add a clause to the Catholic Relief Bill of 1778 for the removal of nonconformist disabilities; but it was opposed by government, and struck out by the English privy council. Also he was personal and ardent writing friend to George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. He met Franklin, John Jay and the Marquis de Lafayette whilst on a European Tour with his immediate family during the year of 1782. Francis Wheatley depicting the Dublin Volunteers on College Green. Newenham is the figure to the immediate left of the Duke of Leinster, who is positioned centrally, in front of the statue of King William. A noted \\"Duelist\\" 3 times over, one of these duels, was over a dispute in parliament. This duel took place on 20 March 1778 between Newenham and John Beresford, in which, neither was wounded. On the revival of the Catholic emancipation question in 1782 he spoke against further concessions. He disapproved of Henry Flood's renunciation agitation, on the ground that he did not make his amendments at the proper time, and in parliament supported Flood's Reform Bill. He took part in the volunteer convention on College Green in 1779, in charge of his \\"Liberty Volunteers\\". This coincided with a painting by Francis Wheatley (right), depicting this epic event. Sir Edward is noted in this painting, along with the \\"Dublin Volunteers\\" (Duke of Leinster) and the \\"Liberty Artillery\\" headed by one of Sir Edward's allies, the Pre-United Irishman - James Napper Tandy. Sir Edward's lifestyle and forethought of his wealth, blindsided him. He did not have budgeting skills on the homefront, leaving massive debts in his wake. In order to pay for one debt, he had to borrow money, thus leaving him continually in debt. Part of this was from his children's marriage settlements, but also the misjudged his Aunt's estate that he was to inherit. One of his prized possessions, Belcamp Hall (Henry Grattan's Birthplace), had to be sold to pay for debts. His finances spiralled out of control, when Sir Edward sought exile in England. Eventually Sir Edward was held up by 4 baliff's that carried him back to Ireland, to face a ¬£500 debt, where he had to front up that he couldn't pay it. He was therefore placed in to \\"debtors prison\\" under the very jail he sought to be built many years before - that was \\"Kilmainham Jail\\". Sir Edward's son, Edward Worth would not come to the aid of his father, rather Sir Edward had to seek \\"clemency\\" from Lord Castlereagh to secure a release. He eventually was released. During 1785 Newenham suffered from ill-health. He continued to advocate moderate reforms; but as time went on he lost much of his old enthusiasm. The constitution, he said in 1792, required some improvement, but the times were unpropitious to the experiment. He did not sit in the last parliament before the Acts of Union 1800, but he was known to support them. He initially rejected the Act of Union, but at the last minute changed his mind to support it, in consequence of the rising Catholic movement. His later ideals seem to also follow John Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare's viewpoint Newenham died at Retiero, near Blackrock, Dublin, on 2 October 1814. Family Newenham married Grace Anna, daughter of Sir Charles Burton and granddaughter of Alderman Benjamin Burton, on 4 February 1754. They had issue of eighteen children, though only 12 survived infancy. His son, Robert O'Callaghan Newenham, was author of Picturesque Views of the Antiquities of Ireland, London, 1830, 2 vols.

Conducted on the banks of the Pearl River outside Humen Town, Dongguan, China, the action provided casus belli for Great Britain to declare war on Qing China. What followed is now known as the First Opium War (18391842), a conflict that initiated China's opening for trade with foreign nations under a series of treaties with the western powers.  Background  Opium imports into China, 1650-1880 A reduction in import duty by the British government on Chinese tea from 110 per cent to an average of 10 per cent in 1784 caused a surge in domestic demand, which in turn led to a huge silver deficit for the East India Company (EIC), who were the sole importers of the commodity. Silver was the only currency the Chinese would accept in payment for their tea and to redress the balance in 1793 the EIC acquired a monopoly on opium production in India from the British government. However, as it had been illegal to sell the drug in China since 1800, consignments were sent to Calcutta for auction whereafter private traders smuggled the opium to the southern ports of mainland China. In 1834 the EIC lost its trading monopoly in China and instead Queen Victoria appointed Lord Napier as first commissioner of trade for the country. Napier's first visit to the southern port of Canton (now Guangzhou), where the rigid Canton System controlled all trade with China, failed to convince the Chinese authorities to open up further ports for trading. In 1837, the Qing government, having vacillated for a while on the correct approach to the problem of growing opium addiction amongst the people, decided to expel merchant William Jardine of Jardine, Matheson & Co. along with others involved in the illegal trade. Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi Deng Tingzhen and the governor of Guangdong along with the Guangdong Customs Supervisor (Á≤µÊµ∑ÂÖ≥ÈÉ®ÁõëÁù£) issued an edict to this effectCanton Free Press, 14February 1837; reprinted in The Times (London), 31March 1837 although Jardine remained in the country. Former Royal Navy officer Charles Elliot became Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China in 1838, by which time the number of Chinese opium addicts had grown to between four and twelve million. Although some officials argued that a tax on opium would yield a profit for the imperial treasury, the Daoguang Emperor instead decided to stop the trade altogether and severely punish those involved. He then appointed respected scholar and government official Lin Zexu as Special Imperial Commissioner to enforce his will.  Lin and the foreign traders  Soon after his arrival in Canton in the middle of 1838, Lin wrote to Queen Victoria in an appeal to her moral responsibility to stop the opium trade. The letter elicited no response (sources suggest that it was lost in transit), but it was later reprinted in the London Times as a direct appeal to the British public. An edict from the Daoguang Emperor followed on 18March, emphasising the serious penalties for opium smuggling that would now apply. On 18March 1839, Lin summoned the twelve Chinese merchants of the Cohong who acted as intermediaries for the foreign opium traders. He told them that all European merchants were to hand over the opium in their possession and cease trading in the drug forthwith. The commissioner went on to call the Cohong \\"traitors\\" and accuse them of complicity in the illegal trade; they had three days to persuade the foreigners to forfeit their opium or two of them would be executed and their wealth and lands confiscated. Howqua, the leader of the Cohong passed Lin's orders to the foreign merchants who subsequently convened a meeting of their Chamber of Commerce on 21March. After the meeting, Howqua was told that Lin's move was a bluff and his threats should be ignored. In fear for his life, the merchant then suggested that surrendering at least some contraband might assuage Lin. Lancelot Dent of Dent & Co. agreed to surrender a small quantity of the drug and others followed suit, even though the amounts offered represented only a tiny fraction of the foreign merchants' total stock, which was worth millions of pounds. The commissioner then backed down on his promise to execute members of the Cohong and instead invited the top foreign merchants including Dent to his residence for interview. Dent was warned by his friends that in 1774 an individual who had heeded such a summons ended up garroted so he instead asked Howqua to tell Lin he would meet him provided he received a guarantee of safe conduct. Dent further stalled by sending Robert Inglis, one of his partners, to a meeting with Lin's subordinates. Charles Elliot then ordered all British ships in Canton to head for the safety of Hong Kong island before he himself arrived at the foreign factories on 24March, 1839, three days after the expiry of Lin's deadline. After raising the Union Jack, the British superintendent of trade announced that all foreign merchants were henceforth under the protection of the British government. Chinese soldiers then sealed off access to the factory area and began a campaign to intimidate the foreign residents trapped inside. Elliot read out a petition stating that all opium was to be handed over, promising compensation from the British government for the costs of the merchandise, with a deadline of sixpm on 27March. By nightfall, British traders had agreed to surrender around 20,000 chests of opium (approximately 1,300 long tons (1,321 t)) with a value of 2,000,000 British pounds. Even though Lin believed that the British had surrendered all their supplies, the factories remained in a state of virtual siege as the commissioner demanded that the Americans, the French, the Indians and the Dutch hand over a further 20,000 chests in total. This would have been impossible; the French were absent from Canton at the time, the Indians and Americans claimed that any opium they held belonged to others while the Dutch did not deal in the drug.  Destruction of opium  Lin's initial plan called for the transport of the seized opium under Chinese guard to Lankit Island (Longxue Island), some south of the Bogue forts and from Canton. However, he agreed that men assigned by Elliot could instead carry out the task. Deng Tingzhen together with Lin arrived at the Bogue on 11April. According to a Chinese account of events, at this point Lin offered three catties of tea for every one of opium surrendered. The Jardine Matheson clippers Austin and moored in the river and began the transfer of opium in their holds but rough waters forced them to relocate to Chuanbi Island further down river and close to the Shajiao Fort () outside Humen Town. By 21May 1839, 20,283 chests had been unloaded at Chuanbi. Pleased with the outcome, Daogguang sent Lin a roebuck venison to symbolise an imminent promotion and a hand-written scroll inscribed with the Chinese characters for good luck and long life. On 24May, all foreign merchants previously involved in the opium trade received orders from Lin to leave China forever. They departed in a flotilla under the command of Charles Elliot, who by now had become persona non grata with the British government for his acquiescence to Chinese demands. Lin then set about destroying the seized opium. After encircling the site with a bamboo fence to prevent theft, three stone pits, lined with wood, were dug into which was poured the seized opium along with lime and salt. A minor interruption occurred when one man was caught trying to remove a quantity of the drughe was beheaded on the spot. Once the pits had been filled with sea water, labourers tramped the mixture to ensure the drug's destruction. The residue was then flushed through a channel into the South China Sea. The work commenced on 3June 1839 and took a total of 23 days When the task was finished, the American missionary, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, who witnessed events, commented: \\"The degree of care and fidelity, with which the whole work was conducted, far exceeded our expectations ...\\"  Aftermath  Once the opium had been destroyed, Elliot promised the merchants compensation for their losses from the British government. However, the country's parliament had never agreed to such an offer, and instead thought that it was the Chinese government's responsibility to pay reparations to the merchants. Frustrated that any repayment for the destroyed opium seemed unlikely, the merchants turned to William Jardine, who had left Canton just prior to Lin's arrival. Jardine believed that open warfare was the only way to force compensation from the Qing authorities and in London he began a campaign to sway the British government, meeting with Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston in October 1839. The following March, in the face of strong opposition from, among others, the Chartists, the pro-war lobby eventually won 271 to 262 in a House of Commons debate on whether to despatch a naval force to China. In the spring of 1840 an expeditionary force of sixteen warships and 31 other ships left India for China, which would become involved in multiple Sino-British battles in the First Opium War that followed.  Legacy  The \\"Lin Zexu Memorial\\" to commemorate destruction of the opium opened outside Humen in 1957 and in 1972 was renamed \\"Anti-British Memorial for Humen People of the Opium War.\\" It later became the \\"Opium War Museum\\" with additional responsibility for administration of the ruins of the Shajiao and Weiyuan Batteries. A further \\"Sea Battle Museum\\" on the site opened to the public in December 1999.

The term is derived from a lunar cycle. While yue guang translates directly to \\"moonlight\\", it is also a pun derived from the combination of its individual words, yue (Êúà; month or moon) and guang (ÂÖâ; 'empty, used up, or light'). Zu ('clan, race') refers to a group of people who shares this characteristic. In the United States, a comparable notion is referred to as \\"living paycheck to paycheck\\". \\"Moonlight clan\\" is a relatively new Chinese neologism to describe young workers who spend their salaries faster than they earn it. Opposite of the Western definition of the word \\"moonlighting,\\" which means to take on more than one job to earn more money. The Moonlite (people of Moonlight clan) are generally younger generations. They are different from their parents' diligent and thrifty consumption concepts. To chase new trends and have fun, they don't care about the cost as long as they like. Material life is what they yearn for, but also the motivation to earn money. The older generation believes that \\"saving is more significant than spending\\", and they are very upset about their behavior; however, their motto is \\"spending can lead to make more money\\". The Moonlite are companies' favorite group of consumers, since they have strong purchasing power from desires; more importantly, they have the ability to make money and have money to spend. Categories =Type 1: People who have a relatively high income= This group of people can not only meet the basic needs but can also pursue a higher standard of living. Members of this group include white collar workers and the middle class. Behavior and lifestyle Members of the Moonlight Clan who earn a relatively high income tend towards economic materialism. Most of them lack financial discipline (i.e. overspending) and fail to plan for the future. People earning a relatively high income are usually brand-loyal consumers who pursue pleasure-seeking and luxurious lifestyles. They tend to have strong consumption confidence. =Type 2: People who can barely make ends meet and possibly rely on welfare= This group of people struggle to meet basic needs, thus having a lower standard of living in comparison to Type 1. This group is mainly constituted by low socio-economic groups including people who are paid low hourly wages minimum wage, such as blue-collar workers. Behavior and lifestyle Lower-income consumers spend mostly on necessities and rent as they are burdened by the rising cost of living. They do not have extra money for expensive pleasure-seeking activities and luxurious goods.  Characteristics  * No career planning and Uncertainty of goals Most of the Moonlite have no plans for their own careers. They don't have any goals. Moreover, such people are not serious about their work and have no desire to make progress. People with plans generally do better than those who just muddle along. * Lazy to work and Addictive to play thumb They spend more time and energy on entertainment. For them, work is to complete a task. By doing work, they will have more money to spend. Such people seem to be very chic every day, but actually, they feel empty inside. They cannot enrich themselves compared to those who work hard. Psychologically, those people are more likely to have a lazy vicious circle. * Dare not face difficulties and stress Because the Moonlite can't get enough financial support, they will not dare to face difficulties afterwards. However, in fact, the problem still exists, and the more they accumulate, the more difficult it is. People whose financial income is guaranteed and have plans for their own funds should have a rational life. While facing difficulties, they will not be inferior to solve it. Accumulated problems could lead to life pressures. Causes =Low income and high cost of living= With reference to the 2011 Population Census in Thematic Report: Youth, the median income monthly of teenagers aged from fifteen to twenty-four remained at HKD $8,000 unchanged for 10 years since 2001. The median monthly income of the whole population had increased to HKD$9,000 over the past ten years. The Consumer Price Index of Hong Kong increased by thirteen percent, from 96 to 109 index points, during 2001 and 2011. The lower income group could hardly afford the progression of standard of living of the society. As a result, the high cost of living leads to an increase in the number of Moonlight Clan members. =Poor money management= Lacking knowledge in money management, personal budgeting and saving, people seldom track their spending habits and savings to review their expenses. According to a survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong, less than one third of the respondents would save their income before spending, or even spend more than what they are earning in a month. =Consumer culture= Being bombarded by commercial advertisements, people with relatively high incomes feel compelled to pursue personal wellbeing and happiness through material possessions. An easy access to a variety of entertainment and activities may be the reason for the increase in consumerism for Moonlight Clan as they tend to spend and enjoy the present instead of saving for the future. =Advanced technology and convenience= By using credit cards, people can spend money they have not earned. In recent years, the credit card industry has been burgeoning, making credit cards available for almost everyone with insufficient screening. In Hong Kong, the credit card rates are rising and the debt they are carrying is 30% or above for annualized interest. Furthermore, online buying is becoming more and more popular. People can frequent online shopping and auction sites like Amazon.com, Taobao.com, eBay.com, and make online payments via acquirers like PayPal. This may affect their financial discipline and foster overspending behavior, becoming one of the underlying causes of compulsive or obsessive consumerism. = Family = The average Moonlite have a relatively wealthy backup from their families. There is not much life pressure. They do not need to consider supporting parents or other folks. It is enough to just work and support for themselves. They haven't experience too much difficulties. After getting paid, they only think of buying goods and services, instead of planning for saving.  Benefits  Everyone's attitude towards life is different. Some people would like to live a stable life, save their wages for the urgent needs in future; some people pay attention to timely pleasure, feel that the money they earn should be spend soon without concerns. No matter which lifestyle has its own benefits. Many people may think that the Moonlight clan is equal to the black sheep. In fact, the Moonlight clan has its own value. It is undoubted that the Moonlite's attitude towards life in a timely manner which can promote economic development. They also enjoys what others can't enjoy. Population = Mainland China = A survey in 2011 on Guangzhou youth aged fifteen to thirty-five revealed that thirty-five percent of interviewees were part of the Moonlight Clan. Their average expenditure is two-thirds of the average income. Moreover, there are approximately three hundred million people earning less than $2 a day. These people constitute the main part of the moonlight clan of the low income group. In the middle of 2019, the People's Bank of China released the \\"2019 Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Report\\" which is a comprehensive analysis of the financial literacy of Chinese consumers from perspectives of attitude, behavior, knowledge and skill. Among the 18,600 samples surveyed, most consumers paid more attention to personal credit score. The willingness to delay consumption declined slightly. 79.03% of consumers disapproved of being \\"moonlight clan\\" and only 17.80% of \\"strongly agree\\" or \\"considerable\\". =Hong Kong= In 2012, MassMutual Asia Ltd commissioned the Public Opinion Programme of the University of Hong Kong to conduct a telephone survey about post-80s and post-90s. The survey findings revealed that one out of seven respondents represented the Moonlight Clan, as they spent as much as they earned monthly, or even spent more than they earned. In 2017, one in every six people in Hong Kong, aged 18 to 35, doesn't have any money spare to save each month. That is worse than in 2013 when one in every seven people didn't save. Hong Kong was frequently voted as the most expensive city to live in globally. However, young people in this city would rather spend their money on travel and the latest gizmos rather than save it, which is why for many of them, owning a property in the city is not a priority.

Life and career He was born Elias Oberstein in New York City, the son of Ella and Morris Oberstein, a police officer of Russian Jewish descent, and grew up in the Bronx. By 1920 he was working as a clothing salesman, before taking a job as a salesman under Ralph Peer at Okeh Records. In 1928, after Peer had joined the rival Victor Records, Oberstein joined him there as a salesman and accountant. By 1930 he had begun overseeing recording sessions, and that year also set up his own company, Crown Records, increasing his influence. After Peer left RCA Victor in 1932, Oberstein began recording country musicians around the Southern states. \\"Eli Oberstein- A & R Man for Bluebird\\" Bluegrass Messengers. Retrieved 27 March 2014 He is also credited with establishing the Bluebird record label in the early 1930s, as a 35-cent low priced subsidiary of Victor. The label became successful during the Depression era, and established the reputations of many country and blues musicians including The Delmore Brothers, Ernest Tubb, Big Bill Broonzy, and Roosevelt Sykes. In 1936, he became head of popular Artist & Repertoire at RCA Victor.Donald Clarke, \\"OBERSTEIN, Eli and Maurice\\", Donald's Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Retrieved 27 March 2014 He signed Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey to RCA Victor, also adding Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw to the roster at Bluebird. As a record producer, Oberstein pioneered the practice of making deals with songwriters, music publishers and others, which eventually developed into what became known as \\"payola\\". In 1939, he was abruptly fired with no explanation by RCA Victor. His Crown record company soon went bankrupt, and he set up new labels including Royale and Varsity, based in Scranton, Pennsylvania; however, none of the leading musicians he had produced followed him, and the labels again folded. Oberstein then set up the Imperial Record Company, with the Elite label subsidiary. He recorded Bunny Berigan's final sessions, and began acquiring smaller companies and exchanging masters with Savoy Records. He circumvented the 1942-43 \\"Petrillo Ban\\", which stopped recordings being made by union members in the US, by making and distributing recordings that he claimed had been made in Mexico. He also reissued many older recordings made for labels such as Crown, Gennett and Paramount; the legality of his business methods in acquiring and re-selling the recordings sometimes came into question.

Oberstein also established the Hit record label, which found chart success with Louis Prima's \\"Angelina\\" in 1944. Oberstein was described as \\"a colorful wheeler-dealer\\". In 1945 he sold his recording studio, pressing plant and master recordings to the Majestic radio company, and helped them set up the record label of the same name. He was briefly re-hired by RCA Victor before he was again fired, and then relaunched his Varsity label. In 1948 he bought back the rights to the Majestic label, which had been sold to Mercury Records, and, after a period with Columbia Records, he acquired the rights to the Allegro classical music label in the early 1950s. He set up the Royale label through which he sold acquired recordings at budget prices. He and Ervin Litkei bought the Rondo label in the mid-1950s. They based the label in Union City, New Jersey, as part of their group of companies which they called \\"Record Corporation of America\\" in the apparent hope that clients and customers would confuse it with the much larger RCA (Radio Corporation of America) Victor company.

Note the large bustle area for the autoloader, as well as the configuration of the grenade launchers. The post‚ÄìCold War era is the period in world history from the collapse of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991 to the present. During the Cold War (1947‚Äì1991), the Soviet domination of the Warsaw Pact led to effective standardization on a few tank designs. In comparison, France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom had previously developed their own tank designs, but now tried to standardize their designs, while the smaller nations of NATO purchased or adapted these designs. The fall of the eastern bloc brought changes as the United States Military cut much of its expenditure, though the level rose again to comparable heights after the War on Terror started in 2001. After the Cold War, tank development continued into a third-generation main battle tanks and because of the effectiveness of antitank weapons, the technology advanced dramatically as well. Tanks became more survivable and their armour became thicker and much more effective. Overview A M1A1 Abrams in the Taunus Mountains north of Frankfurt during Exercise Ready Crucible in February 2005. The main battle tank became the standard as a necessity, as it was realized that smaller medium tanks could carry guns (such as the US 90 mm, Soviet 100 mm, and especially the British L7 105 mm) that could penetrate any practical level of armor at long range. An increasing variety of anti-tank weapons and the perceived threat of a nuclear war prioritized the need for additional armor. The additional armor prompted the design of even more powerful cannons. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Developments in Post Cold War An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad In 1974, the United States initiated an impressive programme to modernise its existing tank fleet and start real mass production of the M60A1, and later the M60A3; at the same time the M1 was developed. Budgets for tank design and production picked up during the administration of president Ronald Reagan, following tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. In response to infantry-portable and vehicle-mounted ATGMS, ever more capable defences were developed. Spaced armour, composite, explosive reactive armour, and active protection systems‚Äîlike the Russian Shtora, Drozd, and Arena‚Äîwere added to old and new tanks. Despite these improvements the larger missiles remained highly effective against tanks. This was demonstrated in 1991 during the Gulf War when during a friendly fire incident, Hellfire anti-tank missiles disabled several M1 Abrams tanks. Some of the most successful second-generation Cold War tanks are still in service, indeed, some are still being built! However, they have been extensively upgraded and in some cases overhauled repeatedly and even completely rebuilt during the ensuing decades with layers of enhanced modern armor, newer guns, electronics and brand new and very different engines. Notable examples would be the T-72, Merkava and M1 Abrams. Sometimes these complete overhauls are given a new name, like the Polish Army's PT-91 Twardy based on the T-72M1 (upgrade) which derives from the T-72. So when you see an older tank model listed as current equipment for a modern Army that is still in front-line operational service, check to see if it has a series of numbers and initials after the name. If so, it is probably a tank brought up to third-generation status with little in common to the original other than the shape and the name. =Gulf War/Iraq war= US Army recognition poster of T-54/55 series tanks The Gulf War saw the US Marines still charging in with their M60 Pattons while the rest of the tank forces had Abrams. The Iraqi forces were initially regular army units, equipped with tanks such as T-54/55 tanks and T-62s. The Coalition main battle tanks, such as the U.S. M1 Abrams, British Challenger 1, and Kuwaiti M-84AB were vastly superior to the Chinese Type 69 and domestically built T-72 tanks used by the Iraqis, with crews better trained and armoured doctrine better developed. 3rd Armored Division along the Line of Departure. The majority of Iraq armored forces still used old Chinese Type 59s and Type 69s, Soviet-made T-55s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some poor quality Asad Babil tanks (domestically assembled tank based on Polish T-72 hulls with other parts of mixed origin). These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders, and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and sabot rounds used by the Coalition tanks. This equipment enabled them to engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from more than three times the range that Iraqi tanks could engage coalition tanks. The Iraqi crews used training rounds against the U.S. and British tanks. These rounds (purchased in great number during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War due to their cheap price) had soft steel penetrators and thus no hope of penetrating the advanced Chobham Armour of the Coalition tanks. In the Iraqi war in 2003, an Iraqi division the 6th Armored Division of the Iraqi Army.Lee, R. J. Key Components of the Iraqi Ground Forces, 2002 which was equipped with T-55s and BMP-1s defending the control of key bridges over the Euphrates River and the Saddam Canal at Nasiriyah, were decimated by US Marines with M1 Abrams, and the division as a unit rendered incapable for combat during the Battle of Nasiriyah in March 2003, during the invasion. An Asad Babil abandoned after facing the final US thrust into Baghdad In addition to the T-54/55 and T-62 tanks that Iraq had, the most feared to US armoured forces were the T-72 tanks in the Iraqi forces. Only Republican Guard divisions were equipped with Iraqi- modified T-72s. Many of the Iraqi T-72s were dug-in or hidden in groves, and then used to ambush the US or British tanks. In the war, the Iraqi T-72s were the preferred target for Apache helicopters and A-10s, in an attempt to diminish the combat power of Republican Guard divisions. The only chance for the Asad Babil T-72s against American tanks was to lure them to close range combat, or trying to ambush them from dug-in positions.Scales, page 269: \\"As TF 1-37th Armor crossed over the ridge into the heart of the Iraqi defensive zone, the Iraqi commander's carefully disposed rear-slope defense stripped Dyer's tanks of their range advantage. Within 1,000 meters, a row of dug-in T-72s and BMPs suddenly appeared below the crest. All were hull-down in prepared positions behind thick dirt walls (thus disproving the much-quoted u.s. truism that soviet tanks had difficulties in achieving 'hull down' position). Now the Americans were well within Iraqi killing range, and although the Soviet-made night sights were markedly inferior, things could still get very dicey.\\" But even in those conditions, the M1s usually prevailed, as proven in circumstances like the Battle of Baghdad, and the drive to the capital, where dozens of Iraqi MBTs were obliterated,Scales, page 270: \\"After the war they (TF 1-37th) returned to count the burned-out hulks of 76 T-72s, 84 BMPs, 3 air defense artillery pieces, 8 howitzers, 6 command vehicles, 2 engineer vehicles, and myriad of trucks.\\" or near Mahmoudiyah, south of Baghdad, April 3, 2003, (Iraqi Freedom) when US tanks engaged their counterparts from just 50 yards, shattering seven enemy T-72s without losses.Conroy & Mars, p. 158 The Lion of Babylon T-72 was utterly outclassed by the M1 Abrams, the Challenger and by any other contemporary Western main battle tank during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Post Cold War Main Battle tanks  = T-80 = Russian T-80BV at the Victory Day Parade 2005 Russian T-80U The Russian T-80 is a third-generation main battle tank (MBT) designed and manufactured in the Soviet Union. A development of the T-64, it entered service in 1976 and was the first production tank to be equipped with a gas turbine engine for main propulsion. The T-80U was last produced in a factory in Omsk, Russia, while the T-80UD and further-developed T-84 continue to be produced in Ukraine. The T-80 and its variants are in service in Belarus, Cyprus, Kazakhstan,Kolekcja Czo≈Çgi ≈öwiata, Issue 8 Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, and Ukraine. The original T-80 design uses a 1,000 horsepower gas turbine instead of a 750-horsepower diesel engine, although some later variants of the T-80 revert to diesel engine usage. The gearbox is different, with five forward and one reverse gear, instead of seven forward and one reverse. Suspension reverts from pneumatic to torsion bar, with six forged steel-aluminium rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, with the tracks driven by rear sprockets.Foss (2005), pp. 89‚Äì90. The glacis is of laminate armour and the turret is armoured steel. The turret houses the same 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore gun as the T-72, which can fire anti-tank guided missiles as well as regular ordnance. The tracks are slightly wider and longer than on the T-64 giving lower ground pressure. The main gun is fed by the Korzina automatic loader. This holds up to 28 rounds of two-part ammunition in a carousel located under the turret floor.Warford (1995), pp. 18‚Äì21. Additional ammunition is stored within the turret. The ammunition comprises the projectile (APFSDS, HEAT or HE-Frag) plus the propellant charge, or the two part missile. The autoloader is an effective, reliable, combat tested system which has been in use since the mid-1960s. The propellant charge is held inside a semi-combustible cartridge case made of a highly flammable material ‚Äì this is consumed in the breech during firing, except for a small metal baseplate. A disadvantage highlighted during combat in Chechnya was the vulnerability of the T-80BV to catastrophic explosion. The reason given by US and Russian experts is the vulnerability of stored semi-combustible propellant charges and missiles when contacted by the shaped charge jet from the penetration of a HEAT warhead, causing the entire ammunition load to explode. = Leopard 2 = Leopard 2A5 of the German Army (Heer) Austrian Army The Leopard 2 is the German main battle tank (Kampfpanzer) developed by Krauss- Maffei that replaced the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the German Army. Various versions have served in the armed forces of Germany and twelve other European countries, as well as several non-European nations. The Leopard 2 first saw combat in Kosovo with the German Army and has also seen action in Afghanistan with the Danish and Canadian ISAF forces. Turkey employed the Leopard 2 for its military operations in Syria. Minor modifications and the installation of the gunner's thermal sight were worked into the second batch of 450 vehicles Leopard 2 designated the A1; 248 by Krauss-Maffei (Chassis Nr. 10211 to 10458) and 202 by Mak (Chassis Nr. 20173 to 20347). Deliveries of the 2A1 models started in March 1982 and ended in November 1983. The two most notable changes were the modification of the ammunition racks to be identical to those in the M1 Abrams, and redesigned fuel filters that reduced refuelling time. The most widespread version of the Leopard 2 family, the 2A4 models included more substantial changes, including an automated fire and explosion suppression system, an all-digital fire control system able to handle new ammunition types, and improved turret with flat titanium/tungsten armour. All the older models were also upgraded to 2A4 standard. The 2A4 was also license manufactured in Switzerland as the Panzer 87 \\"Leopard\\" or Pz 87. This version included Swiss-built 7.5 mm Mg 87 machine guns and communications equipment, and featured improved NBC protection system. Switzerland operated 380 Pz 87 tanks. At the turn of the century, Germany and the Netherlands found themselves with large stocks of tanks they had no need for after the end of the Cold War. These tanks were sold to NATO or friendly armies around the world. Among these were Austria, which received 114 vehicles. Canada (107), Chile (140), Denmark (51), Finland (139), Greece (183), Norway (52), Poland (247), Portugal (37), Singapore (96), Spain (108), Sweden (160), and Turkey (339) were among the buyers of the surplus tanks. = Challenger 2 = British Challenger 2 Tank of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Squadron D). The Challenger 2 is the British main battle tank (MBT) currently in service and was designed and built by the British company Vickers Defence Systems (now known as BAE Systems Land and Armaments). Challenger 2 is an extensive redesign of the Challenger 1. Although the hull and automotive components seem similar, they are of a newer design and build than those of the Challenger 1, and fewer than 3% of components are interchangeable. Challenger 2 replaced Challenger 1 in service with the British Army and is also used by the Royal Army of Oman. It has seen operational service in Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq. In June 1991, after competition with other tank manufacturers' designs (including the M1A2 Abrams and the Leopard 2 (Improved)), the MoD (Ministry of Defense) placed a ¬£520 million order for 127 MBTs and 13 driver training vehicles. An order for a further 259 tanks and 9 driver trainers (worth ¬£800 million) was placed in 1994. Oman ordered 18 Challenger 2s in 1993 and a further 20 tanks in November 1997. Challenger 2 entered service with the British Army in 1998 (with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment in Germany), with the last delivered in 2002. It is expected to remain in service until 2035. It serves with the Queen's Royal Hussars, the King's Royal Hussars - which will convert to the General Dynamics Ajax shortly -- and the Royal Tank Regiment, each of which is the tank unit of an armoured infantry brigade. = K-2 Black Panther = The K-2 Black Panther model on display The South Korean military introduced the K-2 black panther as the South Korean MoD felt it required a more advanced tank to cope with the growing threat of North Korea; especially in terms of ground combat. The K-2 is one of the most expensive tanks in the world costing at around US$9 million per unit. The South Korean military already fielded the K1/K1A1 tank which was a domestically produced tank and could already dominate North Korean tanks such as the T-55 and the Type 59. However, the K-2 was seen as a development which would see the ROK forces securely dominate the North Korean forces in ground combat. Unlike the K1 series, the K-2 series is a completely different design. It looks much lighter and mobile and carries a wide range of modern technology that can match and often beat other MBTs out to date. Furthermore, it has many advancements in suspension such as the In-arm suspension which gives it characteristics such as kneeling and crouching which increases its survival rate in combat. As of 2014, 100 K-2s are already being fielded by the ROK armed forces and a further 106 are set to be completed by 2017. Furthermore, the South Korean MoD agreed to sell the Turkish Armed Forces development details worth US$540 million to aid in their own project in developing the Altay MBT. As of now, the South Korean military are set to begin development of the K-2 PIP which is to be an upgrade of the current K-2 model with further advancements in aspects such as armour, weaponry and optics such as a hard-kill APS. = Merkava Mark III and IV = Merkava IIID Baz fires ‚Äì the Baz Fire-control system increases the Merkava's accuracy and lethality The Israel Defense Forces Merkava Mark III was introduced in December 1989, and had upgrades to the drivetrain, powertrain, armament, and electronic systems. The most prominent addition was the incorporation of the locally developed IMI 120 mm gun.. This gun and a larger diesel engine increased the total weight of the tank to , but the larger engine increased the maximum cruising speed to . The turret was re-engineered for movement independent of the tank chassis, allowing it to track a target regardless of the tank's movement. The next development was the Israel Defense Forces Merkava Mark IV tank which is the most recent upgrade of the Merkava tank and has been in development since 1999. The upgrade's development was announced in an October 1999, however, new Merkava Mark IIIs continued to be produced until 2003. The first Merkava IVs were in production in limited numbers by the end of 2004.. The model has a new fire-control system, the El-Op Knight Mark 4. Removable modular armor, from the Merkava Mark IIID, is used on all sides, including the top and a V-shaped belly armor pack for the underside. This modular system is designed to allow for damaged tanks to be rapidly repaired and returned to the field. The tank carries the Israeli Elbit Systems Battle Management System and an active protection system. Tank rounds are stored in individual fire-proof canisters, which reduce the chance of cookoffs in a fire inside the tank. The turret is \\"dry\\"; no active rounds are stored in it. Some features, such as hull shaping, exterior non-reflective paints, and shielding for engine heat plumes mixing with air particles to confuse enemy thermal imagers, were carried over from the IAI Lavi program of the Israeli Air Force to make the tank harder to spot by heat sensors and radar. The Mark IV includes the larger 120 mm main gun of the previous versions but can fire a wider variety of ammunition, including HEAT and sabot rounds like the APFSDS kinetic energy penetrator, using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. It also includes a much larger 12.7 mm machine gun for anti-vehicle operations (most commonly used against technicals). = Type 90 tank = Japanese Type 90 tank The Japanese Type 90 tank, main battle tank (MBT) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) was designed and built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as a replacement for all deployed Type 61 and Type 74 tanks, and entered service in 1990. With the exception of the 120 mm smoothbore gun, which is made under licence from Rheinmetall of Germany, the Type 90 and its subsystems are all designed and built in Japan, leading to higher per unit costs for comparable models from NATO countries such as the M1 Abrams and the Challenger 2. The profile of the Type 90 is similar to the original German Leopard 2 without the sloped armor, (Leopard 2 to 2A4) but unlike the Leopard 2, the Type 90 uses modular ceramic and steel composite armor,Photo of Type 90 common in contemporary post-1990s tank designs. The adoption of modular composite armor design facilitates the upgrading and exchange of the armor, and its frontal armor is tested to be effective against JM-33 120 mm APFSDS projectiles from the L44 gun, while the side armor of the turret is capable of defeating up to 35 mm APDS (Armor penetration of 90 millimeters of RHA at one kilometer) projectiles. The Type 90 is smaller than most main battle tanks with a height of 2.33 meters, a width of 3.33 meters, and weighing in at 50.2 tonnes. = Type 10 = JGSDF Type10 Tank of the 1st Armored Training Unit The Japanese is a 4th generation main battle tank produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF). Compared with other currently-serving main battle tanks in the JGSDF, the Type 10 has been equipped with enhancements in its capability to respond to anti-tank warfare and other contingencies.Introduction of the aircraft Type 10 tank -Japanese Ministry of Defense, Japan Defense Focus No.33 Column, Oct 2012 http://www.mod.go.jp/e/jdf/no33/column.htmlThe tank is smaller and rather light for a modern MBT being in the 40+ ton class; specifically designed not to over stress the many bridges one encounters and allow it to maneuver on the small roadways in Japan. The Type 10 is to replace the existing 40-year old 2nd generation Type 74 and/or complement the heavier 3rd generation Type 90 main battle tanks that are currently in service. Development began in the 1990s, with a prototype revealed in February 2008. In January 2012, thirteen Type 10 tanks entered JGSDF service. The vehicle's armor consists of modular components which significantly improves the side armor compared to the Type 90. While the Type 10 uses a smoothbore gun barrel of the same 120 mm diameter and L44 length as the Type 90's license-built Rheinmetall Rh-120 gun, the Type 10's gun is a brand new indigenous design which is also made by Japan Steel Works. This is the only gun capable of firing Japan's newly developed APFSDS type of tank round, known as the: Type 10 APFSDS. The Type 10 tank gun is capable of firing the existing: JM33 APFSDS, as well as all standard 120 mm NATO ammunition. However, the newly developed Japanese: Type 10 APFSDS ammunition, is specifically designed for and can only be fired by the Type 10's gun.Japanese MOF report = AMX Leclerc = The AMX Leclerc is the French main battle tank (MBT) built by GIAT, now Nexter of France. It was named in honour of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque who led the French element of the drive towards Paris while in command of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division (2√®me DB) in World War II. A Leclerc Main Battle Tank on manoeuvres. The Leclerc is equipped with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120 mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120 mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system in order to avoid the problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50 km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity. The Leclerc is also equipped with a 12.7 mm coaxial machine gun and a remote-controlled 7.62mm machine gun, whereas most other NATO tanks use 7.62mm weapons for both their coaxial and top machine gun mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun and two top-mounted machine guns, one 7.62mm and one 12.7mm. The Leclerc has the GALIX combat vehicle protection system from GIAT, which fires a variety of smoke grenades and infra red screening rounds, as well as anti-personnel grenades. The hull and the turret are made of welded steel fitted with modular armour, which can be replaced easily for repair or upgraded over the years. The French army in the late seventies rejected Chobham armour as being overly specialised in its optimisation to defeat hollow charge-weapons; it therefore opted to develop their own composite arrangement to defeat both hollow charge and sabot round. Due to the introduction of modernized threats, the batch 3 has a new armour package, including composite armor, titanium insert and on the sides of the turret, ERA blocks. In service only since 1992 (after the Persian Gulf War), the Leclerc has no notable experience in true warzone environments, but has seen deployment on multiple low-intensity conflicts, including 15 Leclerc stationed in Kosovo (KFOR) and others in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in the context of UN peace- keeping operations, where their performance was judged satisfactory by French officials. Until 2010, 13 Leclerc were deployed in the south Lebanon for a peacekeeping mission with UNIFIL. = C1 Ariete = Italian Ariete main battle tank of the Italian Army The C1 Ariete is the main battle tank of the Italian Army, developed by a consortium formed by Iveco-Fiat and Oto Melara (aka CIO, Consorzio Iveco Oto Melara). The chassis and engine were produced by Iveco, while the turret and fire-control system were produced by Oto Melara.The Ariete is mounted with a 120 mm smoothbore Oto Melara cannon, autofrettaged and stress-hardened to increase durability over extended periods of fire, allowing the use of APFSDS and HEAT rounds. The Ariete's armour is a steel and composite blend, similar to the British Challenger 2 and the American M1 Abrams. The Ariete features two side-mounted, electronically fired grenade launchers. Each launcher consists of four barrels which can be intermixed with either smoke or chaff grenades. The smoke grenades are capable of shrouding the tank from visual or thermal detection, while the chaff grenades disperse the tank's radar cross section. The tank is fully NBC protected.Aero Sekur = Arjun = Indian Arjun main battle tank The Arjun (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡•Å‡§®) is India's third generation main battle tank developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), for the Indian Army. The tank is named for Arjun, a character in the Indian epic, Mahabharata. The Arjun features a 120 mm main rifled gun with indigenously developed APFSDS ammunition, one 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, and a 12.7 mm machine gun. It is powered by a single MTU multi-fuel diesel engine rated at 1,400 hp, and can achieve a maximum speed of and a cross-country speed of . It has a four-man crew: commander, gunner, loader and driver. Automatic fire detection and suppression and NBC protection systems are included. All-round anti-tank warhead protection by the newly developed Kanchan armour is claimed to be much higher than available in comparable third generation tanks. = Al-Khalid = Pakistan main battle tank Al-Khalid MBT on display in November 2012. The Al- Khalid tank (‚Äî, lit. The Immortal Tank) and MBT-2000 refers to the main battle tank of Pakistan of jointly developed variants made by Pakistan and China during the 1990s. About 300 Al-Khalid tanks were in service with the Pakistan Army as of 2009. 44 MBT-2000 is in service with Bangladesh Army from 2011. Operated by a crew of three and armed with a 125 mm smooth-bore tank gun that is reloaded automatically, the tank uses a modern fire-control system integrated with night-fighting equipment and is capable of firing many types of anti-tank rounds as well as guided anti-tank missiles. Al-Khalid is named after the 7th-century Muslim commander Khalid bin al-Walid (592‚Äì642 AD). An evolution of Chinese and Soviet tanks, the design is considerably smaller and lighter than most Western main battle tanks. It is based on the Chinese Type 90-II, which combined technologies from several Soviet and Western tanks. The Al-Khalid is unusual in that it was designed to be adaptable for manufacture, so that it can be easily integrated with a variety of foreign engines and transmissions. The current production variant of the Al-Khalid uses a diesel engine and transmission supplied by the KMDB design bureau of Ukraine. The first production models entered service with the Pakistan Army in 2001. = Type 99 = Chinese Type 99 tank The Chinese Type 99 tank (), also known as ZTZ-99 and WZ-123, was developed from the Type 98G (in turn, a development of the Type 98), is a third generation main battle tank (MBT) of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is made to compete with other modern tanks and is currently the most advanced MBT fielded by China. Small-scale production of the Type 98 was begun in time for the tank to be featured in the PRC's National Day parade in 1999. Following the completion of the Type 98, research into improved versions of the tank continued within the Chinese government. These programs produced the Type 98G, a refined iteration of the Type 98 with a better reliability record. At the end of 2001, the first batch of 40 Type 98G tanks entered service with the regular Army. The Type 98G eventually gave rise to what is now known as the Type 99, which was officially revealed by the government in 2001. The final version of the Type 99 included a 1,500-horsepower engine, as opposed to its immediate predecessor's 1,200-horsepower powertrain. Also added were a Leopard 2A5-style sloped-arrow armor plate on the front of the turret, and additional composite armor layers on the sides. In part due to its high cost, the tank is not expected to be deployed in large numbers, unlike earlier Chinese designs such as the Type 59. Because of the limited nature of its production, the Type 99 is currently only operated by the PLA's most elite divisions. = Altay = The Turkish Altay is a main battle tank, designed and developed by Otokar of Turkey for the Turkish Army and export markets. It is named in honor of Army General Fahrettin Altay (1880‚Äì1974) who commanded the 5th Cavalry Corps in the final stage of the Turkish War of Independence. The Altay was designed from 2008 until 2012. Weighing in 65 tons it is one of the most heavy MBTs in service. 4 are actually in service and a total of 1,000 MBTs are planned to be produced in four separate lots of 250 units. The Altay needs a crew of 4 ‚Äì commander, gunner, loader & driver. No autoloader is present. This machine features ROKETSAN (armour package) composite armour and the Aselsan/STM Volkan III assisted MKEK 120 mm 55 caliber smoothbore gun capable of firing standard NATO ammunition. The Altay will compete on the Turkish army contract estimated at $2B for a batch of 250 tanks. Three more similar batches are expected. = Karrar = Karrar MBT The Iranian new MBT. The tank was announced on 12 March 2017. At the announcement, it was stated that it possessed an electro-optical fire control system, a laser rangefinder, ballistic computer and could fire at both stable and mobile targets in day or night. Main armament of the Karrar consists of one 125mm smoothbore gun fitted with a fume extractor and a thermal sleeve. A remotely operated weapon station armed with a 12.7mm machine gun is mounted on the roof of the turret. The main gun is able to fire anti- tank laser-guided missiles. = Oplot = The newest Ukrainian main battle tank (MBT) and most sophisticated version of the T-84 is an upgraded version of the \\"T-84 Oplot\\" mounting more advanced armor, new electronic countermeasure systems, and others from KB Yugnoe. One visible feature is the new PNK-6 panoramic tank sight. It has been used since 2014 in the war against Russia in territories annexed from the Ukraine by Russia. It is believed a very effective tank against old ex-soviet tanks.

It originated in Hong Kong in the 1960s and has become a representative of Hong Kong culture. Because the nylon canvas is known of its light, firmness and durable usage, it is commonly used as hand carry luggage and transport between Mainland China and Hong Kong.  History  The Red-White-Blue was made by nylon canvas, which was invented by Japan, then exported to Taiwan and eventually come to Hong Kong. The canvas was originally used as the shelter for construction sites, temporary roof in squatter areas, and as protection for farmland. It was presented as bags since 1960s by a tailor Lee Wah, who created the bag by the canvas from a Taiwan company. There were only blue and white in the first place, red color was added to the fabric to represent lucky and fortune in its color combination. These days the Red-White-Blue bag is made of plastic woven fabric, from either polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP). And there are different colors appearing in the market, such as black, green and orange.  Material and structure  Material for making the bags is mainly the polyethylene. This fabrics are being knitted horizontally and vertically, and it is tightly knitted to create characteristics of being windproof and waterproof. Although the fabric is highly durable, the zippers easily break.  Culture  Victoria Park, Hong Kong After the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, Red-White-Blue bag has been part of Hong Kongers' collective memory and used to represent some of Hong Kong's core values and beliefs. It is believed to be a material that express the localness of Hong Kong, because the bags have been very popular in Hong Kong since the 1950s. The material has been used to represent the industrious life of Hong Kong people in the 1950s and 1960s. Despite the cheapness of the material, it is very adaptable and durable to different scenarios as it was used for weatherproofing in the 1950s. The adaptable feature of the bag also symbolised Hong Kong people's resilient spirit and hardship. Artist Stanley Wong began the Red White Blue artwork series in 2001, culminating in an exhibition in the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in 2004-5 which was said to have set the tone of subsequent discourse in the use of the red-white-blue motif in Hong Kong public art. Sam Hui, a Hong Kong Cantopop musician and songwriter, who is famous for performing Cantonese songs that relates to Hong Kong's lifestyle and culture, wore a red- white-blue costumes to symbolize the Red-White-Blue bags and the Hong Kong spirit during his concert in 2004. In 2006, Louis Vuitton adapted the Red- White-Blue-bag and redesigned into handbags with their logos printed on it. Although the designer of the bag claimed that the use of color is to represent the national flag of France, the bags immediately received favorable reviews for its showing of cheapness. Chinese critics considered the bag a failed attempt to convert their ‚Äúrural worker‚Äôs bag‚Äù to high culture. Hong Kong lifestyle design and retail brand company Goods of Desire (G.O.D.) remodelled the red-white-blue bags and adapted the color design to their products targeting the younger generation.

In Hong Kong, some of them are about social satire; some talk about daily lives of Hong Kongers; some caricaturists also talk about past lives of Hong Kong in order to recall a collective memory, etc. McDull is the first well-known society-related comic. McDull was created by two local caricaturists, Alice Mak and Brian Tse. They use a hilarious way to express the core value, diligence. Purpose and platform Society-related comics are often seen in different social media such as Facebook, Twitter, blogs and Instagram. In contemporary society, social media has become one of the most powerful and accessible channels for people to share and get new information. As social media has become more specialized, like Instagram, which focused on pictures, and Twitter, which set a limited word count for every post, society- related comics have become an alternative way for people to post what they want to share. And on average, a post which has a society-related comic or drawing uses relatively fewer words. It is also common to read society-related comics in newspapers. The editor aims to make a dig at a social issue but does not want to make it directly, so they use comics to convey the message in a humorous way. The typical example was the comic talking about unauthorized building work of Henry Tang Ying-yen. And, society-related comic books can be found in bookshops. Ideas for stories included in such comics books always come from everyday life and social phenomena. For example, in a book It Is Just A Work („ÄäÊâì‰ªΩÂ∑•Âï´„Äã) written by Aken Leung, the idea behind the stories is office politics. As the ideas are connected with daily experiences, this kind of book can always resonate with readers. Famous examples One of the famous cartoonists is called Malone (È¶¨Èæç). He started to draw themed comics in 1984 and his drawing style and theme were based on political humor. Malone chose the pseudonym Ma Sing (È¶¨Êòü) and started to draw the children's comic strip series White Cat Black Cat („ÄäÁôΩË≤ìÈªëË≤ì„Äã).Ho, Andrew. \\"Cover story\\" (Archive). Junior Standard (student-oriented version of The Standard). 24 January 2011. p 02\\\\. Retrieved on June 14, 2015. Another Hong Kong cartoonist, Zunzi (Â∞äÂ≠ê),Siu, Sai-wo. \\"A purrfect evening with cartoonists\\" (Archive). The Standard. December 31, 2012. Retrieved on June 14, 2015. formerly known as Wong Kei-kwan (ÈªÉÁ¥ÄÈàû), is keen on drawing political cartoons. He has worked for Ming Pao, Apple Daily and Next Magazine. The old muddled series („ÄäËÄÅÊáµËë£Á≥ªÂàó„Äã) is another key example. Famously ironic, it was launched by \\"sub-culture hall\\" in 2000. It is a political comics series. The cover of the comics depict a seemingly old Tung sitting naked on the toilet. It is so extremely sarcastic. The comics used irony to depict the first SAR Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's perceived failure to manage the society. Moreover, Bi Bi Pig is a popular Facebook fan page in which almost all posts have consisted of society-related comics since the start of 2014. Bi Bi Pig is the main character of all those comics and the drawings that describe his adventures always have theme such as ‚Äúthe things that drive you crazy‚Äù or ‚Äúmy childhood memory‚Äù. As Bi Bi Pig is set to be a Hongkonger, his memories and experience are often shared by other Hong Kong people as well. In addition, I Am An Airline Stewardess uses Facebook as its platform but it is more job-oriented. All the comics posted in that page are about the work of airline stewardesses. By reading those pictures, everyday people can learn more about that profession. Other examples of society-related comic books include Fell In Love With Mr. Depression, by Lucia (2008), and There Is No Young Master In The Air written by Master E (2010). Also, SiuTung Illustration is another example of blogs with society- related comics. Influence Teenagers are perhaps the most influenced by society-related comics. Firstly, social networking sites play a key role in their leisure activities and they can get information from surfing the internet easily. During adolescence, most people do not actively read up on social issues. However, society-related comics have made social affairs seem more interesting and funny for teenagers to read and investigate. It is common to see teenagers sharing these comics on Facebook. Led by the creation of those comics, more teenagers are willing to engage in social affairs activities. Besides, society-related comics help to develop social cohesion. As the content is about the society of Hong Kong, it reflects common concerns. For example, in Bi Bi Pig, there is a comic called \\"My Childhood‚Äôs Candies\\" and nearly twenty two thousand people liked it. They bring a significant connection of Hongkongese with each other. In addition the comics have been used in education. Liberal Studies is an integral part of the New Senior Secondary curriculum in Hong Kong. In this course, the Hong Kong Examinations Assessment Authority have used society-related comics as topics of examination. Students need to interpret the content of the comics and theme that reflects the comics. With the popularity of society-related comics, the assessment authority prefers to use comics instead of a long article for the examinations.

The new Milan venue of the Fondazione, conceived by architecture firm OMA‚Äîled by Rem Koolhaas‚Äîexpands the repertoire of spatial typologies in which art can be exhibited and shared with the public. The complex, which is the result of the transformation of a former distillery dating back to the 1910s, is articulated by an architectural configuration which combines preexisting buildings with three new structures, named ‚ÄúPodium‚Äù, ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù and ‚ÄúTorre‚Äù. The hallmark of the new venue is the so-called ‚ÄúHaunted House‚Äù, a 4-story building, clad in 24 carat gold foil, where pieces from the permanent collection of art of the Fondazione Prada are permanently on display. Located in Largo Isarco, in the South of Milan, the compound has a gross surface area of 19,000 m2/205,000 ft2, of which 11,000 m2/118,000 ft2 is dedicated as exhibition space. The entrance building welcomes visitors to two new facilities, developed through special collaborations: a kids' area designed by a group of students from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'architecture de Versailles, and a bar where director Wes Anderson has recreated the typical mood of old Milan caf√©s. On the occasion of the opening of its new Milan venue, Fondazione Prada presented a wide range of activities.

Even though he admits that the humanities have taken their share of hits in recent years, like cuts in funding and an increasing emphasis on science and technology within society and the academy, Lambert is optimistic about the future of the humanities.

Its main purpose is the promotion and research on literatures and cultures of the Lusophone countries. Today, CLEPUL is one of the largest research centres in Portugal, being home for more than 500 researchers, and the research unit with more young researchers in projects and positions of responsibility. Due to its established protocols, CLEPUL is part of an institutional network of cooperation for research in several areas of literary science and history of culture, including Portuguese institutions in Lisbon, Porto, Algarve and the Atlantic Islands, namely Madeira, and international institutions, such as in Australia and Canada, while keeping privileged relations with Lusophone countries, namely Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Guinea-Bissau. CLEPUL currently publishes six periodicals, to disseminate its scientific research results: the Letras Com Vida magazine, making available several previously unpublished and exclusive material from authors and researchers, being part of the Letras Com Vida Movement, which also includes literary gatherings; the Revista Lusitana, a journal on popular traditions established in 1887 by Jos√© Leite Vasconcelos; the online publication Machina Mundi; the poetry and literature magazine Golpe d'Asa;http://www.correiodominho.com/noticias.php?id=58523 the IberoSlavica annuary, dedicated to iberian-Slavonic studies; and the Navega√ß√µes journal, dedicated to Luso-Brazilian studies. CLEPUL's ideary is: To assert itself, a society needs a consistent project for culture and science. Manuel Antunes Institutional history CLEPUL is one of the oldest Portuguese research units dedicated to literary studies, with the same age as Democracy in Portugal. It was established in 1975 by Jacinto do Prado Coelho. Since 2010, it's integrated in the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, and funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), previously known as the National Board of Scientific Research (JNICT). It's the first national research unit to be directed by a Researcher (from the \\"Science\\" Program 2008), Jos√© Eduardo Franco, since 2012.http://www.jornaldamadeira.pt/artigos/madeirense-eduardo- franco-%C3%A9-o-novo-director-do-clepul Since its establishment, CLEPUL has been a pioneer in the research of Lusophone literatures, also contributing to its integration in the Portuguese academia as an area of specialization. It was also innovative in the way it combined the filological studies tradition with the newness of the structuralist proposals and sociology of reading. Its initial projects dealt with the study of the different Lusophone literatures, such as Portuguese literature, with special emphasis on studies regarding Camilo Castelo Branco, as well as African literature and Brazilian literature, and matters regarding sociology of reading, in a project directed by Jacinto do Prado Coelho. This established route was continued by the centre's following directors and coordinators (Fernando Crist√≥v√£o, Maria L√∫cia Lepecki, Manuel Ferreira, Alberto Carvalho and Maria de Lourdes Ferraz), establishing CLEPUL in the field of Portuguese R&D; units. At the beginning of the new millennium, with the transformation of European cultural policies, and under the direction of Annabela Rita, continued today by Jos√© Eduardo Franco, CLEPUL sought to answer to the new challenges by transforming its research horizons: from Literature to Arts, Sciences and Culture in general, from Lusophony to Europe, from essayistic to its articulation with literary and artistic creation, repositioning its scientific and cultural policy strategy and its critical mass. The initial research in Portuguese literature was maintained, with emphasis on Camilo Castelo Branco, E√ßa de Queir√≥s and Father Ant√≥nio Vieira, among other great Lusophone authors,http://www.circuloleitores.pt/catalogo/1061674/padre-antonio-vieira through the publishing of previously unavailable sources and reference works, including complete works of the great figures from the History of Portuguese culture. The interchange of knowledge between Lusophone and European cultures has also been expanded, giving rise to interartistic studieshttp://www.wook.pt/authors/detail/id/17273 (coordinated by Annabela Rita), to the imaginary of cultural studieshttp://www.wook.pt/ficha/o-mito-de- portugal/a/id/95116 (coordinated by Jos√© Eduardo Franco), to the studies on interculturality of the iberian world and the Slavonic worldhttp://www.esferadocaos.pt/pt/catalogo_detalhe_biblioteca_ibero_Eslava114.html (coordinated by B√©ata Cieszynska), to the studies on the didactics of literature, the work in oral and traditional literatures, and to reflections on entrepreneurship,https://www.incm.pt/portal/loja_detalhe.jsp?codigo=102373 regarded as one of the drivers of innovation in Portuguese culture. In 2011, CLEPUL changed its name to Centre for Lusophone and European Literatures and Cultures of the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, while keeping its acronym, in order to preserve its history while embracing its new scientific landscape.

It was aired on March 26, 2014. The episode was written by Paul Corrigan, Brad Walsh, and Bill Wrubel and directed by Gail Mancuso. The episode is notable for its overlapping story arcs between the characters as they each seek to find their ideal experiences in Las Vegas. This was the first episode of the show to feature only the parent cast. Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter, Nolan Gould, Rico Rodriguez, and Aubrey Anderson-Emmons do not appear in this episode. Plot All the family, except the kids, arrive at Las Vegas for the weekend. Jay (Ed O'Neill) sold the owner of Mandalay Bay, Burt (Ray Laska), some closet space and Burt gave him free access to the three main adult contingents at the hotel's platinum level rooms in return. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) runs into an old boyfriend of his, Langham (Fred Armisen), who is there with his partner Tim (Jeffrey Nicholas Brown) for their bachelor party. The two of them invite Mitchell and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) to their party but Mitchell declines the offer since he just wants to spend some time at the spa relaxing. Cam goes with Mitchell but when Mitchell has his massage, he leaves to go to the pool party of Langham and Tim and gets back in time so Mitchell won't notice his absence. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) and Jay take a walk and Gloria sees Rebarka, the female version of Barkley, the butler dog that Jay bought from Las Vegas on a previous trip of his and she hates. She knows that when Jay sees it, he will want to buy it and she does everything she can so Jay will not see it. She manages to send Jay to their room to bring her a jacket while she gets into the store to buy Rebarka so they will take it out of the store window. On his way to the room, Jay discovers that their rooms are not at the top floor as they told him and he wants to make sure they will all move to the \\"Excelsior Plus\\" level. Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) wanted to go to Las Vegas for their own reasons. Phil wants to attend an underground magic society meeting, that is headed by Ducky (Patton Oswalt), so he can perform his magic trick of \\"metamorphosis\\", while Claire wants to gamble so she can recoup the money she had lost on a previous trip to Las Vegas, a few years back. Phil's appointment does not go as he was expected and returns disappointed at the hotel while Claire manages to win the money she wanted and she is satisfied. Gloria and Jay return to their room with Jay telling Gloria that they have to convince Burt to give them rooms at the \\"Excelsior Plus\\" level. Gloria opens the door and finds Rebarka there (the store delivered it instead of keeping it as she asked them). She immediately tells Jay to order some fine cigars for Burt and sends him away again so she can get rid of the dog. She takes it to Phil and Claire's room that is right next to theirs. In the meantime, Claire takes Mitchell to play blackjack. At the beginning he is negative to the idea, he eventually likes it and wins some money. Langham sees him, and while they are talking, Mitchell accidentally leaves his room key at the table before he leaves. Langham thinks that he did it on purpose and takes it so he can join Mitchell in his room later. Mitchell gets to the room and orders the butler, Higgins (Stephen Merchant), to prepare a special bath for him and Cam while he goes to get some ice. Langham comes into the room while Mitchell is not there and Higgins thinks that he is Mitchell's partner and sends him to the bathroom telling him that Mitchell is waiting for him. All the family members are back on the floor and a sequence of events takes place leading to misunderstandings. Higgins believes that when Phil talks about his wife, he means Rebarka the dog; Mitchell tells Cam that he prepared something special for the two of them but when Cam finds Langham in the tub he misunderstands Mitchell's intentions; Langham thinks the same as Cam and asks them to join him in the tub while he also reveals that Cam was at the bachelor party; Claire gets into the room while Mitchell and Cam fight and tells them she has a surprise for them; Langham gets out of the bathroom in a robe, making Claire think she interrupted something, and Mitchell sends Langham to Jay's room because Langham's fianc√© knocks on the door; Jay sees Langham and believes he is Burt, but Gloria tells him that he is not Burt; Langham leaves and goes to Phil's room where Higgins sees him and believes that he is \\"Claire\\" that Phil is awaiting; Phil escorts Langham out of the room while Gloria enters from the mid-room door to get something, but the towel she is wearing gets snagged in the; Phil runs into Ducky who came to tell him that he would like to give him a second chance for his magic trick but before they get into the room, Gloria runs to the bathroom naked; Phil takes Rebarka in the bathroom before he performs his trick while Jay meets with Burt; Ducky is not impressed with Phil's trick but when Gloria gets out of the bathroom dressed as a maid (she wore Rebarka's clothes) he believes that the transformation of the fake dog to a hot maid was part of the trick and he gets excited; Gloria returns to her room dressed as the maid at the exact moment when Jay tells Burt that he ordered him a Cuban (meaning a cigar); Claire reveals her surprise to Mitchell and Cam, the \\"Kilty Pleasures\\" (an all-male revue of half naked men dressed in kilts reminiscent of the Chippendales dancers) but instead of going to Cam and Mitchell's room, the dancers went to Jay's. All these have as a result Jay getting what he wanted, rooms at the \\"Excelsior Plus\\" level, only to discover a little bit later that there is one more floor above the \\"Excelsior Plus\\" level, the \\"Excelsior Ultra\\" level. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Las Vegas\\" was watched by 10.09 million; up by 0.7 from the previous episode.

(+64%). =Reviews= \\"Las Vegas\\" received critical acclaim, with many critics praising the farcical elements incorporated into the episode's final act. This episode was also well received by fans of the show, with \\"Las Vegas\\" holding an accumulated score of 9.2 on IMDb, making it the second highest rated episode of the series.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3508788/ Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club gave an A rate to the episode saying that it was an interesting episode for a variety of reasons. \\"'Las Vegas' is the first episode of Modern Familys fifth season that I had especially high hopes for [...] [it] surpassed my expectations. [...] The satisfying crescendo was once Modern Familys bread- and-butter, but the most recent examples haven't worked as well as they once did. That is, until 'Las Vegas,' which boasts a third act that is like a master class in controlled chaos.\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode 5/5 stars and said that the episode was \\"epic\\". \\"[Las Vegas] is one of the ones people will be talking about for years to come. [...] The craziness that was bred between the three rooms in the second half of the episode was the perfect melee to show ol' Burt and get an upgrade. Of course, none of it could have been done without the mix-ups between the rest of the cast.\\" Madina Papadopoulos from Paste Magazine rated the episode 8.5/10 and described it as a farce. \\"The farce is an old form of comedy, and regardless of its age, low- brow humor and predictability, it's still an effective way to make us laugh. [...] It takes talented writers to pull off a farce, and Modern Familys execution this week showcased those writers.\\" Christopher Lawrence of Las Vegas Review Journal gives a positive review and suggests a spin-off based on the episode's butler, Higgins. \\"Overall, it's a fairly standard episode of Modern Family, full of misunderstandings, sneaking around, bigger misunderstandings, wordplay and giant misunderstandings. But it does, most likely unintentionally, lay the groundwork for a Vegas-based spinoff that would be full of potential. There‚Äôs no telling what sorts of trouble Merchant‚Äôs Higgins or his clients could get themselves into on a weekly basis, especially if the producers could convince Oswalt to stick around.\\" References  External links  \\"Las Vegas\\" at ABC.com Category:Modern Family (season 5) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Las Vegas Category:Emmy Award- winning episodes ","title":"Las Vegas (Modern Family)"},{"id":"42333398","text":"Pomacea vexillum is a South American species of freshwater snail with gills and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Ampullariidae, the apple snails.

Confederate cavalry under Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest, numbering between 200 and 300, attacked, encircled and defeated a Union force of 500 under Major Eli H. Murray which had been watering south of the town after moving across the bank of the Green River. Though exact casualty information is disputed, with differing accounts from each side, several eyewitnesses attested to the personal courage of Forrest, and the Confederate commander was praised by his superiors for his bravery. The engagement was one of the earliest of Forrest's career as a commander of the cavalry, and it featured several examples of tactics and traits which would become hallmarks of his military career, including the division of his forces, outflanking and encirclement, concealment, and personally leading cavalry charges. It was also an early battle for Brigadier- General Stovepipe Johnson, who was then a private. The Union force was decisively routed, and the battle became known as \\"Forrest's First Fight\\" and is annually re-enacted by local residents. Prelude Both the Union Army and the Confederate forces recruited and drilled within Kentucky, as the state's population \\"displayed divided loyalties\\" during the early stages of the Civil War.Davison and Foxx (2007) p. 34-37. Confederate Major-General Leonidas Polk began taking Kentucky villages in September 1861 with the blessing of Jefferson Davis, despite the protests of Confederate commanders Simon Bolivar Buckner and Leroy Walker. Union Brigadier-General Ulysses S. Grant approached using the Ohio River and stationed himself at Paducah, arriving to face newly appointed Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston. By October, with both armies maneuvering in an attempt to gain the upper hand, Forrest's battalion was ordered to Kentucky from Memphis, Tennessee, reporting to Colonel Adolphus Heiman. Heiman was charged with constructing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson and had requested a unit of cavalry to support him. Forrest had with him eight companies recruited from Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas. Drilled for close combat, the majority of the force was armed with shotguns. He quickly established himself in the region, laying an ambush for a Union gunboat on November 20 and forcing it back. He continued to skirmish with gunboats for the remainder of the month, captured a Union supply center on November 24 - narrowly avoiding a sniper's bullet that instead took the life of his surgeon - and received reinforcements of two new companies from Huntsville, Alabama. The battle On the morning of the battle, Forrest and his cavalry corps were approaching Sacramento when they were informed by a sympathizer named Mollie Morehead that the Union force led by Eli H. Murray was watering their horses nearby.Davison and Foxx (2007) p. 36-41. Forrest, who had been wintering in camp near Hopkinsville with his family since Christmas, had already taken scouting reports that morning which stated that the enemy force had been nearby moving along the banks of the Green River, and was keen to attack. Despite cold weather and light rain, Forrest led his forces in pursuit. Morehead rode alongside Forrest, and the latter would later remark that \\"her untied tresses, floating in the breeze, infused into my arm and kindled knightly chivalry in my heart.\\" File:Eli Houston Murray.jpg  Major Murray File:NathanBedfordForrest.jpg  Colonel Forrest Forrest led two hundred cavalry troopers divided into three groups: one dismounted to attack from the front while concealed by bushes and fences, while two - one of thirty men and one of sixty - remained mounted to outflank the Union forces, which were five hundred strong. The Union forces were at first unsure as to the identity of the arriving troops, however they returned fire once Forrest had fired the opening shot himself. He then led the cavalry charge personally, signaled it with a cry to the bugler of \\"blow the charge, Isham.\\" The outflanking forces then became embroiled in hand-to-hand combat with the now fleeing Union troops. An eyewitness account by Confederate Private James Hammer noted that Forrest personally killed nine enemy soldiers, despite having his horse shot out from under him. Many of Forrest's officers, who had not seen him fight before, were surprised by his aggression that replaced his \\"usually mild\\" demeanour. Union and Confederate sources disagree on the number of casualties, with Union accounts recording the deaths of two officers and eight men, with thirteen prisoners. Confederate sources state that \\"closer to a hundred\\" were killed, and thirty-five captured. Forrest himself suffered a dislocated shoulder after being dismounted by a collision with two riderless horses. The battle was Forrest's first combat victory,Axelrod (2011) p. 85-86.Allardice and Hewitt (2008) p. 160. and during it he demonstrated several tactics for which he would later become known: in particular, the division of his forces into groups, employment of deception and encirclement, and leading the cavalry charge personally. The battle is often nicknamed \\"Forrest's First Fight\\",Battle of Sacramento. Main page. and his superior at the time, Brigadier-General Charles Clark, took note of his \\"skill, energy and courage.\\" Clark wrote to his government that \\"I am assured by officers and men that throughout the entire engagement he was conspicuous for the most daring courage; always in advance of his command. He was at one time engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict with 4 of the enemy, 3 of whom he killed, dismounting and making a prisoner of the fourth.\\" The battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, and the battle is annually re- enacted by local residents.

It was launched on 5 March 2013 on the Facebook social media platform and on 5 September on iPad. Pearl‚Äôs Peril is Wooga‚Äôs sixth game, and was the company‚Äôs fastest growing game at the time. Wooga also released a soundtrack to the game. Gameplay Pearl‚Äôs Peril is a hidden object (sometimes known as hidden picture) game. Players are given a list of items to find within a static scene. They then receive points for each item found, and score multipliers for completing the task quickly. Players can also use a hint feature to highlight items that they find difficult to see. In between many of the levels, puzzle levels require players to find and assemble specific items linked closely to the story. Pearl‚Äôs Peril also has an isometric building metagame, in which players must construct buildings on an island. Some items offer rewards, such as ‚Äòprestige‚Äô, which is used to unlock further chapters in the game. Players must also expand their island by exploring, which requires three in-game currencies, namely coins, cash and compasses. The story was created by Steven- Elliot Altman, the former games director at Acclaim Games, and later continued by veteran game writer Will Hiles (NCsoft), and Johanna Fischer. New chapters of the story are written every week. Narrative Pearl‚Äôs Peril is set in the 1930s, and opens with the titular adventurer, Pearl Wallace, receiving news of her father Samuel's suicide. Shocked, she goes back to Artemis Island, her childhood home and home of all the Wallace clan, with her friend Iris Hillman by her side; Pearl cannot believe her father committed suicide. Her suspicions turn out to be true when her grandfather Edwin Wallace, who was believed to have died several years ago, shows up during Samuel's funeral feast proclaiming one of the attendants killed Samuel and he is going to find out who did it. Pearl joins in her grandfather's efforts and soon finds out that a mysterious society named the Chaos Veil was behind Samuel's death, and that the family friend and groundskeeper of Artemis, L√©on, is involved with the Chaos Veil. Pearl swears to avenge her father's death and bring the killer to justice. Pearl starts a path full of adventures, deceit... and peril. Monetization Pearl‚Äôs Peril is a free-to-play game, using the freemium model of monetization. Players can use real-life money to buy in-game coins and cash.

Background  In 1941 the area had been occupied by Italian forces trying to attack Greece. On 1 November 1941, the Supreme Command of insurgent forces began planning to attack Pljevlja. On 15 November, the Regional Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party for Montenegro, Boka and Sand≈æak ordered all insurgent forces in the region to begin preparing for the assault. According to Arso Jovanoviƒá, the Italians had prepared for an entire month before the battle, with forces from Brodarevo and Bijelo Polje being redeployed to Pljevlja.  Involved forces  General Arso Jovanoviƒá commanded the 4,000 partisan troops which were split into several groups: the Kom, Zeta, Lovƒáen and Bijeli Pavle detachments, the Piva battalion and the Prijepolje company. The Italian garrison in Pljevlja belonged to the 5th Alpine Division Pusteria; it was led by General Giovanni Esposito and had a strength of 2,000 men.  Battle  In the evening of 30 November the partisans cut the phone lines linking Pljelvja to Prijepolje and ƒåajniƒçe, thus isolating the Italian garrison. At 2:15 on 1 December the first partisan attacks on Italian outposts around Pljevlja began, and at 2:50 the general assault was launched. After suffering heavy losses, at 5:00 the partisans managed to capture an old Ottoman fort located on a hill known to the Italians as the \\"Fortino\\" (‚Äúsmall fort‚Äù) and to penetrate the town; the officers' mess and the depots of the 11th Alpini Regiment were then captured, whereas an attack on the headquarters of the 11th Alpini Regiment was repelled. Another group of partisans stormed the jail, freeing three prisoners, and another one attacked the power station, capturing the ground floor and the first floor after fierce fighting; the Italian detachment guarding the power station, however, barricaded itself on the second floor, and managed to hold on until the arrival of a relief group of fifty engineers forced the partisans to withdraw.Carlo Piacentino, Paolo Formiconi, Alpini in Montenegro, p. 5, Storia Militare n. 243 (December 2013). After securing the \\"Fortino\\" and the jail, the partisan attacked the Italian artillery positions, which were nearly overrun; the artillerymen, however, repelled the attack with small arms fire and hand grenades. In the southern sector, an attack on the Italian outpost guarding the road to Nik≈°iƒá was likewise repelled; in the eastern sector, the partisans pressed their attacks against the Italian outposts guarding the roads to Prijepolje and Golubinje, capturing the latter. Between 3:35 and 3:40 the partisans occupied the high school, the Orthodox church, the movie theater and the houses surrounding the divisional headquarters, which was thus isolated. At 4:30 the partisans attacked the divisional headquarters, but were repelled; half an hour later they occupied the divisional hospital, capturing 34 soldiers from the medical corps, and surrounding the headquarters of the 5th Alpine Artillery Regiment. An attack on the latter, however, was repulsed.Carlo Piacentino, Paolo Formiconi, Alpini in Montenegro, p. 7, Storia Militare n. 243 (December 2013). As the defenders of the divisional headquarters were short on ammunition, a relief group of thirty men carrying ammunition was sent to their help, but they were almost completely killed or wounded by partisan fire. At 5:15 the partisans launched another attack on the divisional headquarters, but were repelled again; at 7:00 another partisan group attacked the headquarters of the 5th Alpine Artillery Regiment, using captured Italians as human shields, but were likewise forced to retreat, abandoning the prisoners they had captured. At 7:20 two Italian squads stormed the Orthodox church, whose bell tower had become a partisan sniper's nest, and set it on fire.Carlo Piacentino, Paolo Formiconi, Alpini in Montenegro, p. 8-9, Storia Militare n. 243 (December 2013). At dawn the Italians started their counterattack; the 145th Alpini Company and a platoon from the 144th attacked the \\"Fortino\\" and recaptured it by 9:00, and at 10:30 Italian artillery began shelling the partisan-occupied depots and officers' mess. In the meantime, two machine gun squads were sent in another relief attempt of the besieged divisional headquarters; despite heavy casualties caused by heavy gunfire from partisans occupying the movie theater, the attempt was successful, after which an Italian 75/13 mountain gun was brought into position and destroyed the movie theater. At 15:30 the siege of the divisional headquarters was lifted, and Italian squads set out to eliminate snipers still holding out in the surrounding buildings. Several partisans were captured and executed on the following day, along with seventeen civilians who had been hiding them. The headquarters of the 5th Alpine Artillery Regiment was still under siege; an Italian relief attempt was repelled by partisans barricaded in a group of nearby buildings, and nightfall brought the battle to a stop.Carlo Piacentino, Paolo Formiconi, Alpini in Montenegro, p. 10-11, Storia Militare n. 243 (December 2013). Operations resumed at 8:00 on 2 December, and at 9:00 the siege of the 5th Alpine Artillery headquarters was lifted. The last partisan holdouts were eliminated during the morning. In the early afternoon of 2 December, the battle was over; the partisans had failed to capture Pljevlja and retreated with heavy casualties, some 203 were killed and 269 were wounded.Carlo Piacentino, Paolo Formiconi, Alpini in Montenegro, p. 13, Storia Militare n. 243 (December 2013).  Aftermath  Following the battle, many partisans deserted their units and joined the pro-axis Chetniks. In order to reinforce the defense of Pljevlja, the Italian units had abandoned Nova Varo≈°, ƒåajniƒçe, Foƒça and Gora≈æde. Nova Varo≈° was taken by the Partisans a few days later, while the other three towns were captured by the end of January 1942 after the local Chetniks were driven out. Partisan forces began plundering nearby villages and executing captured Italians, party \\"sectarians\\" and \\"perverts\\". The communists killed Orthodox priest Serafim D≈æariƒá who was Archimandrite of Monastery of the Holy Trinity of Pljevlja and director of the town's gymnasium Dobrosav Miniƒá. As a reprisal for the attack, Italian forces, along with Muslim militia in the area, burned and plundered the houses of insurgents.Lakiƒá 2009, p. 371 The defeat of the partisans at Pljevlja and the terror campaign conducted by left-wing elements of the partisan movement, led to further conflict between the two groups. The various ideologies of the partisan factions in Montenegro eventually led to civil war. The leader of the resistance movement in occupied Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, disapproved of the attack. When he received word of the planned assault, Tito issued two orders not to attack Pljevlja. On 7 December 1941, Mo≈°a Pijade wrote a letter to Tito and requested an investigation into the defeat at Pljevlja. The Battle of Pljevlja was the last major action of the Uprising in Montenegro and resulted in the expulsion of partisan forces from the region. On 21 December 1941, the Kom, Lovƒáen, Bijeli Pavle and Zeta detachments were incorporated into the 1st Proletarian Brigade. After the battle, the command of Montenegrin Partisans called for the recruitment of women, issuing an announcement which invited the sisters of deceased insurgents to join partisan forces.  Legacy  The Serbian novelist, Mihailo Laliƒá, wrote about the battle in one of his works, in which he emphasized that local Muslims committed war crimes during this action. On 1 December 2011, the 70th anniversary of the battle, a ceremony was held at the monument to the fallen Partisans on Stra≈æica Hill overlooking Pljevlja, which was attended by Montenegrin President Filip Vujanoviƒá. He stated that 236 Montenegrin Partisans were killed during the battle, along with another 159 people from Pljevlja and the surrounding area. The monument commemorates the deaths of 412 Partisans and other victims of World War II.

On 15 January 2018 Carillion was put into compulsory liquidation amidst widespread condemnation of its debt position and approach to risk in large contracts. Green said his responsibility was \\"full and complete, total ‚Äì no question in my mind about that. Not necessarily culpability but full responsibility\\". Green was one of a number of former Carillion Directors described as \\"delusional characters\\" by House of Commons Select Committee Chairs Frank Field (Work and Pensions) and Rachel Reeves (Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy). After further documentation and correspondence was published by the select committees, Carillion directors bosses were described by MPs as \\"fantasists\\" chasing \\"a pot of gold\\", with chairman Philip Green described by Rachel Reeves as having \\"either a woeful lack of leadership or no grip on reality,\\" having advocated an \\"upbeat\\" messaging strategy five days before a profits warning. In the final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, published on 16 May 2018, Green was described as \\"delusional.\\" The report concluded: :\\"He interpreted his role as to be an unquestioning optimist, an outlook he maintained in a delusional, upbeat assessment of the company‚Äôs prospects only days before it began its public decline. While the company‚Äôs senior executives were fired, Mr Green continued to insist that he was the man to lead a turnaround of the company as head of a ‚Äúnew leadership team‚Äù. Mr Green told us he accepted responsibility for the consequences of Carillion‚Äôs collapse, but that it was not for him to assign culpability. As leader of the board he was both responsible and culpable.\\" The report also recommended that the Insolvency Service should consider whether the former Carillion directors, including Green, could be disqualified from acting as a director. The parliamentary process and findings have been questioned as lacking in objectivity and thoroughness, treating a highly complex situation in an incomplete manner. Former Carillion CEO Richard Howson (whose letters were published by the select committees on 12 July 2018), contends that Carillion was a victim of its public sector clients and that \\"any analysis as to the causes of the failure of Carillion is not complete without looking at the way in which government and the wider public sector procured services from Carillion and failed to administer payments.\\" Honours Green was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to business and charity in the UK and South Africa.

The cars used the name V√©loto which reflected aspects of their light-weight design, notably in respect of the spoked wheels which would not have looked out of place on a bicycle.\\"V√©lo\\" is one of the words for a \\"bicycle\\" in French. V√©loto production ended in 1980 when Jean Bellier founded the Bellier company and started to manufacture vehicles badged with his own name.  Origins  Bel Motors International had manufactured a number of products, including children's pedal cars, before progressing to automobile manufacture.  The cars  The manufacturer's first car was the Super V√©loto, described as a \\"quadricycle\\" with an auxiliary motor. The motor was a rear-mounted twin cylinder air-cooled 50cc engine from Motob√©cane which powered the rear wheel via a V-belt and chain linkage. Front suspension was a minimal affair involving rubber rings: suspension at the back was non-existent. Comfort was not a priority and nor was noise suppression in respect of the engine. There were no brakes at the front, but the rear wheels had drum brakes fitted: these were controlled using a hand-lever. The thick leather-look steering wheel was generously padded and provided a contrast with the minimalist approach applied to the rest of the design. When empty the Super V√©loto weighed just 150 kg. The car was long and sat on a wheelbase. The Super V√©loto's first public outing was at the 63rd Paris Motor Show in October 1976. Some observers spotted a retrospective character in the vehicle which sported simple technical solutions recalling the V√©locar of the early 1940s. The light weight design meant that it could legally be driven by people too young to qualify for a driving licence. Its appeal to young people will have been enhanced by a retail price advertised by the manufacturer in October 1976 of 5,950 francs, although this had risen to 6,850 francs by June 1977. By the autumn of 1978 there were two version of the Super V√©loto' advertised. The \\"Type A\\" had a listed price of 7,600 francs and the \\"Type B\\" was offered at 9,300 francs. The principal difference was apparent when starting the engine. On the \\"Type A\\" the driver was required to pedal hard and then connect the engine so that it could be started using the momentum of the movement built up through pedaling. The \\"Type B\\" came with an electric starter controlled using an ignition key. The V√©loto C-10 S followed in 1979. In 1980 the Minoto was exhibited. This featured polyester bodywork strengthened with aluminium, supported by a conventional steel frame, but nothing more was heard of this vehicle. The name Minoto did, however, return on a lightweight vehicle produced by the aluminium Arola during their final two years of independence, 1982 and 1983, but the Arola Minoto was not technically related to the earlier Minoto design from Bel Motors.

The Tower is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Belmont Mansion registration and is prominently featured in the university logo. The current Belmont University Tower and Carillon chimes each hour from 9:00am‚Äì8:00pm. Description The Belmont University Tower and Carillon is located approximately 528 feet south of the Belmont Mansion on Belmont University's campus in Nashville, Tennessee. Located on the former summer estate of Colonel Joseph and Adelicia Acklen, the tower was constructed circa 1850 to be used as a water tower for the Belmont Mansion and gardens. In 1864 during the Battle of Nashville union troops led by General T.J. Wood used the structure as a signal tower. When a carillon of twenty-three bronze bells was installed at Ward-Belmont College in 1928, it became the first carillon in Tennessee and one of the first twenty-five carillons in North America. The original carillon bells were exchanged for an electronic carillon in 1951, shortly after the property became Belmont College. In 1986, a second carillon of twenty-three bells was installed. A gift of nineteen more bells was given to Belmont University by The Massey Foundation and other beneficiaries and installed in November 2002 by Meeks, Watson and Company. The addition of a low D-sharp bell completed the carillon in 2005. The largest bell weighs 1,188 pounds, and the smallest bell weighs twenty-two pounds. The total combined weight of the forty-three bells amounts to 7,477 pounds. The bells were cast by royal bellfounders Petit and Fritsen, in Aarle-Rixtel, Netherlands and installed by the I.T. Verdin Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Tower currently houses a total of forty-three bells and is one of only five carillons in the state of Tennessee. The present carillon is played by Dr. Richard Shadinger, Professor of Music in Belmont University's School of Music. Design Belmont Water Tower circa 1900 with adjacent greenhouse.Design of the tower is credited to famed architect Adolphus Heiman with lesser mention of William Strickland. The tower design is based on the Lighthouse at Alexandria, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and it is the largest surviving antebellum water tower constructed for private use in the United States. The brick water tower stands 105 feet tall and was originally surrounded by a moat and bridge at the entrance. Inside the five- story tower lies an original cast-iron staircase leading to the second floor of the tower. The staircase is an exact replica of the staircase in the Green- Meldrim House in Savannah, Georgia. The first floor of the tower was renovated into a prayer chapel in 1974, which is currently open to visitors day and night. The second floor houses the music library. The third floor holds a practice carillon. The fourth floor houses the keyboard control mechanism for the carillon bells. The bronze bells are located behind screens on the fifth level of the tower.

The theory poses that the continuum of negative energy states, that are solutions to the Dirac equation, are filled with electrons, and the vacancies in this continuum (holes) are manifested as positrons with energy and momentum that are the negative of those of the state. The discovery of the positron in 1929 gave a considerable support to the Dirac hole theory. While Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli were skeptical about the theory, other physicists, like Guido Beck and Kurt Sitte, made use of Dirac hole theory in alternative theories of beta decay. Gian Wick extended Dirac hole theory to cover neutrinos, introducing the anti-neutrino as a hole in a neutrino Dirac sea.

These were used by the Nobel Prize winner Dorothy Hodgkin in Oxford. Beevers‚ÄìLipson strips were a computational aid for early crystallographers in calculating Fourier transforms to determine the structure of crystals from crystallographic data, enabling the creation of models for complex molecules. They were used from the 1930s until computers with enough power became generally available in the 1960s. The technique was developed by C. Arnold Beevers (1908‚Äì2001), reader in crystallography at the University of Edinburgh, and Henry Lipson CBE FRS (1910‚Äì1991), Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. The approach converted the sizable calculations of multi-dimensional Fourier summations needed in crystallography analysis into sums of more manageable one-dimensional values. The folded card strips with numbers were typically stored in two wooden boxes, one for sines and one for cosines. Previously it was necessary to consult sine/cosine tables, a time-consuming process. The approach was used by the Nobel Prize winner Dorothy Hodgkin OM FRS (1910‚Äì1994). The technique is still used in modern computer programs.

Life and career C. Arnold Beevers was born in Manchester, England. His family moved to Liverpool and he attended the University of Liverpool, gaining a BSc degree in Physics in 1929, and a DSc degree in 1933. At Liverpool University, Beevers was influenced by Professor Lionel Wilberforce. After he graduated, Beevers was invited to work on X-ray diffraction, together with Henry Lipson. The two scientists often visited the University of Manchester to seek advice from Lawrence Bragg. Subsequently, Beevers moved to a post at Manchester. Beevers explored the structure of the crystal Beta Alumina with Marion Ross at Manchester. They noted there were 'problem' sites in the areas occupied by mobile sodium ions. Subsequently, the presence of these ions was discovered to make this crystal an efficient fast-ion conductor. As a tribute to their discovery, the locations of these ions are now known as Beevers‚ÄìRoss sites and anti-Beevers‚ÄìRoss sites. Beevers then had short appointment at the University of Hull, but in 1938 he became Dewar Fellow in Crystallography at the University of Edinburgh, a post that was jointly associated with the Departments of Physics and Chemistry. Beevers was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh later in the same year. Beevers remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life and was Reader in Crystallography at the University. His notable students included Douglas M. C. MacEwan FRSE.https://www.rse.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/macewan_douglas.pdf Arnold Beevers was a Quaker and this influenced his approach to life and science. He was involved with disabled people and this was important in his development of Beevers Miniature Models (now operating as Miramodus Ltd.), ball-and-spoke molecular models used for education purposes, largely made by disabled workers, first produced in 1961. Beevers‚ÄìLipson strips Beevers developed Beevers‚ÄìLipson strips with Henry Lipson CBE FRS (1910‚Äì1991), Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (England). The approach converted the large calculations of multi- dimensional Fourier summations needed in crystallography analysis into sums of more manageable one-dimensional values. The folded card strips with numbers were stored in normally wooden boxes, one for sines and one for cosines. Previously it was necessary to consult sine/cosine tables, a time-consuming process. Legacy Beevers Miniature Models continued to be produced by Miramodus Ltd. at the University of Edinburgh. The British Crystallographic Association administers an Arnold Beevers Bursary Fund.

He graduated in 2009 from the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, University of Oxford, England and in 2007 from the Academy of Contemporary Music in England.  Biography  His background in both music and fine art led to an early interest in the relationship between sound and space, particularly the voice and architecture. He has translated his research into fascinating performances in which spectators take part by the mere fact of their presence, and he makes sculptures and videos that embody, literally or metaphorically, the plastic expression of this subtle relationship and the way the human body experiences it. Within and alongside his work with sound, Oliver Beer creates subtle and diverse sculptural, installation and film projects whose provenance sometimes seems biographical; but in which his play with universal ‚Äì often intimate ‚Äì concerns draws on shared emotions and perceptions. Oliver Beer's work has been the subject of many screenings as well as solo and group exhibitions, notably at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham; the Palais de Tokyo, Fondation Vuitton and Centre Pompidou, Paris; the Mus√©e d'art contemporain, Lyon; Modern Art Oxford; WIELS, Brussels; the M√©nagerie de Verre, Paris; the Hebbel Theater, Berlin.

The large Federal style mansion house was built c. 1808 for Francis Gardner, a lawyer and state legislator. From 1817 to 1830 it was the home of Stephen Rowe Bradley, a Vermont lawyer, judge, and politician, who played a significant role in Vermont's entry into the United States as the fourteenth state, representing the independent Vermont Republic in negotiations over its boundaries. This house is the only known surviving location associated with Bradley's life. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Stephen Rowe Bradley House is located on the south side of Westminster Street on the west side of Walpole's village center; the road was one that historically led to the nearby bridge over the Connecticut River, but is now dead ended before reaching New Hampshire Route 12. The house is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, two interior brick chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main block is extended to the rear by a single-story kitchen ell and a two-story servants' wing. An early 19th-century barn stands behind the house. The house has fine Federal period styling, including pilasters on the main facade at the corners and flanking the central bay. The main entrance is flanked by engaged columns and is sheltered by a portico supported by slender round columns. A Palladian window is set above the entrance. The house was built about 1808 for Francis Gardner, a local lawyer and politician. It was purchased in 1817 by Stephen Rowe Bradley, and remained his home in the later years of his life. Bradley was a three-time United States Senator from Vermont, and played a critical role in Vermont's entry to the United States, serving as the attorney general for the Vermont Republic during negotiations in the 1780s. The house is the only surviving building left with significant personal association to him, and was (as of its listing on the National Register in 2005) still in the hands of his descendants.

The brick house was built c. 1825, and is a well-preserved example of vernacular Federal and Greek Revival styling. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The Buckminster-Kingsbury Farm is located in a rural setting of northwestern Roxbury, at the northern end of Houghton Ledge Road, a dirt road running north from near the Granite Gorge Ski Area. The farm occupies about of land, which is mostly wooded except for a cleared area where the cluster of farm buildings is found. The c. 1825 farmhouse is the dominant element of the property, with a 19th-century barn standing nearby; other elements of historic interest on the property include foundation remnants of older buildings, and a 19th-century wellhead. The farmhouse is a brick building, 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof. Attached to it are two single-story wood frame ells, which are believed to predate the construction of the main block by several years. The town of Roxbury was incorporated in 1813 out of portions of neighboring communities. Its early settlement had been in the 18th century, mainly by veterans of the French and Indian War who had received land grants in the area. William Stoddard Buckminster, the son of one of Roxbury's first selectmen, purchased land in this area from his father Solomon in 1820. It is believed that one of the ells of the house was the first structure built on the property. Buckminster's son David operated the farm until the 1860s, when he moved to Keene, and sold it in 1878 to Elbridge Kingsbury. The Kingsburys were also from a family of early settlers, and operated the farm until 1919. In the 1920s and 1930s they rented the property for use as a summer camp, and it was sold out of that family in 1946.

It is the second most powerful phased array radar system in the US Air Force's fleet of missile warning and space surveillance systems. PARCS was built by General Electric as the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), part of the US Army's Safeguard Program anti-ballistic missile system. PAR provided early warning of incoming ICBMs at ranges up to , feeding data to the interceptor station, equipped with a shorter-range radar. The PAR and other systems were collectively known as the Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex. With the signing of the ABM Treaty in 1972, the U.S. was limited to a single ABM base protecting missile fields, and a second partially completed PAR in Montana was abandoned in-place. In 1975 the House Appropriations Committee voted to close Mickelsen and shut down Safeguard, which occurred in July 1976. After Mickelsen was shut down, the Air Force's Aerospace Defense Command took over the PAR site and re-activated it in 1977 in the early warning role. It was later transferred to Strategic Air Command. The site was known as the Concrete Missile Early Warning System (CMEWS) after the nearby town of Concrete, but when that town's post office closed in 1983 it became the current Cavalier Air Force Station. The satellite tracking role was later added, and in that mission PARCS monitors and tracks over half of all earth- orbiting objects. PARCS was initially slated for closure in 1992, but was instead upgraded with newer electronics to become EPARCs. EPARCS is operated by the 10th Space Warning Squadron, 21st Space Wing, and maintained by Summit Technical Solutions, LLC. In addition to contractors, NORAD has U.S. and Canadian military members assigned to the facility. Description =Radar= PARCS seen from the north-west. The main antenna is centred. The radome on the roof protects a satellite communications antenna. The buildings on the right are the power plant. The PAR could originally acquire an object the size of a basketball at , e.g., a warhead from a submarine-launched ballistic missile launched in Hudson Bay; and the resolution at similar range was enhanceable to less than . Original PAR equipment included: *a Beam Forming Network (BFN), the phased array of 6888 elements‚Äîoriginally 6144 GE crossed-dipoles of beryllium copper mounted on the building's sloping wall. Each element consists of a support rod and two crossed dipoles, bent back at 45 degrees to form an arrow head shape. *a \\"phase shifter platform\\" was inside of the PAR Building's sloped wall,https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/nd0078.photos.199429p/ Under computer control this shifted the phase of the current feed to the individual antenna elements, allowing the beam to be instantly pointed in any direction.

A small \\"antenna measuring radar\\" with radome was on the building's top which was later replaced by a satellite communications antenna.http://srmsc.org/par2010.html EPARCS also includes an electrical substation and heat sink. The PAR Data Processor‚Äîwith Central Logic and Control including redundant Processor, Program Store, and Variable Store units‚Äîprovided missile/satellite track data for communications equipment to transfer to NORAD, etc. and was listed as a separate procurement item from the Perimeter Acquisition Radar by the Congressional Record. For the Advanced Data Communication Control Procedure, the ADCCP communication processor invented in the 1980s by Lynn O Kesler \\"translates messages between\\" the PARCS data transmission controller and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. History =MAR= The PAR design traces its history to the Nike-X ABM program of the early 1960s. Nike-X was at attempt to address problems with the earlier Nike Zeus ABM system, which could only attack three or four missiles at a time due to its use of mechanically steered radars. The Weapons Systems Evaluation Group predicted that the Zeus system could be penetrated with a 90% probability simply by firing four warheads at it, a small cost to destroy a base that would hold as many as a hundred missiles. Bell Labs proposed replacing the Zeus radars with a phased array system in 1960, and were given the go-ahead for development in June 1961. The result was the Zeus Multi- function Array Radar (ZMAR), an early example of an active electronically steered array radar system. MAR was made of a large number of small antennas, each one connected to a separate computer-controlled transmitter or receiver. Using a variety of beamforming and signal processing steps, a single MAR was able to perform long-distance detection, track generation, discrimination of warheads from decoys, and tracking of the outbound interceptor missiles. MAR allowed the entire battle over a wide space to be controlled from a single site. Each MAR, and its associated battle center, would process tracks for hundreds of targets. The system would then select the most appropriate battery for each one, and hand off particular targets for them to attack. One battery would normally be associated with the MAR, while others would be distributed around it. Remote batteries were equipped with a much simpler radar whose primary purpose was to track the outgoing Sprint missiles before they became visible to the potentially distant MAR. These smaller Missile Site Radars (MSR) were passively scanned, forming only a single beam instead of the MAR's multiple beams. =PAR= The cost of the MAR system was so great that it could only realistically be used at high-value sites like large cities. Smaller cities would be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept. Starting in 1965 some effort was put into the concept of an autonomous Sprint base using a cut-down MAR, TACMAR. Further work led instead to an upgraded MSR, TACMSR. The MSR didn't have the range needed to alert the base in time to respond, which led to the spring 1965 idea of a very long-range early warning radar whose primary purpose was to alert bases around the country. The system had only rudimentary tracking capabilities and no decluttering system, these tasks would be handed off to the radars the PAR alerted. This allowed the radar to have a relatively low resolution, which in turn allowed it to be built using conventional and inexpensive VHF electronics. As the radar would be used only during the opening phases of the attack, it was not hardened against explosions, greatly lowering construction costs. As the cost of deploying Nike-X began to grow with the increase in Soviet ICBM numbers, the Army and Bell began exploring smaller deployments with more limited missions. Among these was the idea of a much lighter Nike-X system consisting solely of autonomous MSRs and early-warning PARs. This led to contractor studies for the PAR system. Bell Labs completed a specifications document in October 1966, and General Electric won the following development contract in December. Under this model the PAR would not only be used for initial detection, but also help generate accurate tracks so the MSRs would know precisely where to look for their assigned targets. This demanded higher resolution than the original VHF design, although not as high as the MAR's microwave frequencies. In April 1967 the decision was made to move to UHF frequencies. This would not only allow a reasonably sized radar to offer the required resolution, but also helped with a serious problem known as nuclear blackout, which would render large areas of the sky opaque to radar. This was acceptable for early warning; by the time the warheads were going off the PAR would already have served its purpose, but this would not be acceptable under the cut-down MSR model. It was known that the effect lasted for shorter periods at higher frequencies, so by moving to UHF the PAR would have a clear view more rapidly, without the expense of the microwave-frequency MAR. Experiments at the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory suggested that this would also improve performance in the presence of aurora. However, due to a number of technical factors, this also meant that four times as much power would be required to reach the same detection performance. Some of this cost was offset by the move from separate transmit/receive arrays used on the MAR and early PAR to a single array, a possibility due to the frequencies being used. = Nike-X becomes Sentinel= As data from high- altitude nuclear tests carried out in 1962 were studied, a new type of anti- warhead attack was developed. Outside the atmosphere the massive amount of X-rays generated by a warhead's explosion can travel long distances, whereas at low altitude they quickly interact with air molecules within a few tens of meters. When these X-rays strike metal they rapidly heat it, causing a shock wave to form that can cause the heat shield on a reentry vehicle to break up. The advantage to this approach is that the effect works over an area on the order of several kilometers, which allows a single missile to attack an incoming warhead in spite of it being protected by a cloud of decoys. In contrast, Sprint and the even earlier Nike Zeus had to explode within about a hundred meters of the target to be effective, which was extremely difficult to arrange at long range, even without decoys. This led to new studies on systems using an upgraded version of Zeus, originally known as Zeus EX but later renamed Spartan, with range on the order of . These could offer protection across the entire US from a much smaller number of bases than a defense based on Sprint alone. This concept emerged as the Sentinel program, which was effectively, a less-dense, less-expensive, long-range version of Nike-X. In this system, PAR was not only used for early detection and track generation, but was now responsible for long-range guidance of the Spartan as it passed out of the range of the MSRs, requiring further upgrades and making them even more important in the overall battle. The system as a whole also had to have greatly improve data communications as targets would be handed off from radar to radar. In the end, PAR looked a lot like a less-capable version of the original MAR it had intended to replace. In September 1967, General Electric was given the go-ahead to begin development of a production PAR system. =Sentinel becomes Safeguard= As strategic balance and budget issues continued to weight on the decision to deploy an ABM, Sentinel was itself cancelled. On 14 March 1969 President Richard Nixon announced it would be replaced by the Safeguard Program, which would deploy a small number of Sprint-heavy sites around the Air Force's Minuteman missile bases. The idea now was to provide protection to the bases against any attempted sneak attack, ensuring the Minuteman missiles would survive and thus present a credible deterrent force. The decision to deploy the first two of potential twelve sites passed in the Senate in August 1969 by a single vote, that of vice president Spiro Agnew.Safeguard, FAS Sites were selected for the first two phases of Safeguard deployment, Phase I at Malmstrom AFB in Montana and Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, and Phase II at Whiteman AFB Missouri and Warren AFB Wyoming. Only the Phase I sites required PAR, the Phase II sites would use the Phase I PARs for their early warning. GE released the PAR design for manufacture in early 1970, and the North Dakota site was selected to act as the R&D; site for PAR. =Construction and closure= Construction on PAR-1 in North Dakota began in April 1970, and PAR-2 in Montana in May. Extensive testing was carried out over the next year at GE's Syracuse offices, while the Army Corps of Engineers installed the heavy equipment. Work continued until August 1972 when the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreements were signed. As part of SALT, the ABM Treaty limited each country to only two ABM sites, one protecting the nation's capital, and one protecting a missile field. Work on PAR-2 in Montana stopped, and the partially complete building stands to this day. Major construction on PAR-1 was completed on 21 August 1972 and test operations commenced. Antenna alignment was completed in August 1973, and the first successful tracking of a satellite and a radio star took place that month. The test period ran for two full years before the official Equipment Readiness Date was declared on 27 September 1974. Through this period, construction on the MSR and missile batteries was continuing, and the entire Mickelsen base reached its Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in April 1975. The complex was declared fully operational on 1 October 1975. The very next day, the House Appropriations Committee voted to shut down Mickelsen and end the Safeguard program. A follow-up bill in November allowed funds to continue operations at PAR-I. The MSR was shut down in February 1976 and the missiles began to be removed. = CMEWS = PAR was leased to the Air Force in September 1977, who began operations in October 1977. The USAF designated the base as the Concrete Missile Early Warning System (CMEWS) after the nearby community of Concrete. When the post office in Concrete closed in 1983, the base was renamed as Cavalier Air Force Station and the radar itself became PARCS. Assigned in 1983 to pass \\"tactical warning and attack assessment data\\" from the PARCS to Cheyenne Mountain was the 1st Space Wing's Detachment 5 (1986 10th Missile Warning Sq, 1992 10th Space Warning Squadron). =Enhanced PARCS= The Enhanced Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (EPARCS) was established by 1989 (the \\"AN/FPQ-16\\" had become a Major Defense Acquisition Program) and was planned to be closed in September 1992. Instead in 1993, ITT Federal Services took over operations and maintenance from PRC, Inc. An Historic American Engineering Record was prepared and deposited with the Library of Congress. Since receiving a $6.7 million operations, maintenance, and logistics contract in 2003, BAE Systems has maintained the radar and other EPARCS subsystems (an extension was granted in 2012). Deployment of the Solid State Phased Array Radar System (SSPARS) replaced BMEWS and upgraded AN/FPS-115 PAVE PAWS with solid state power amplifiers (e.g., with a 1987 AN/FPS-120 at Thule); but for the EPARCS with \\"obsolete radar technology\\" in 1994 and for Cobra Dane in Alaska, L-3 Communications was contracted to supply 2004-9 TWTs.

It is located at 111 Main Street, in a fine Victorian Romanesque Revival building erected in 1891, funded by a bequest from Winchester resident Ezra Conant. The building's design, by Springfield, Massachusetts architect, J. M. Currier, is based on his design of the 1886 library building in Brattleboro, Vermont, and is one of the most architecturally distinguished buildings in Cheshire County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Architecture and history The Conant Public Library stands in the town center of Winchester, just south of town hall on the east side of Main Street. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with trim of granite and buff brick, and covered by a gable-on-hip roof. The main facade has a centered projecting entry section with a gabled roof, with the entrance deeply recessed under a large rounded arch. The projecting section is flanked by paired round-arch windows, with granite sills and with arches of alternating soldier bricks in buff and red. Similar windows are found on the building sides, and on the rear extensions. Above the main entrance is a band of four sash windows, topped by transom windows that are shaped to form a broad segmental arch. Winchester's early library was a private circulating collection called the Washington Library Association, which donated its collection to the town in 1876. This collection was first housed in a commercial building on Main Street, which was soon deemed to be inadequate for the purpose. The town received a bequest in 1889 from Ezra Conant, a Winchester native who had made his fortune in the leather business, for $50,000 to cover the cost of a new library building. The terms of the bequest required the construction of a building separate from the town hall, whose construction had been planned to include a library space. The building was largely completed in 1891, but did not formally open until April 1892.

They are very similar to Morlet wavelets. They are also closely related to Gabor filters. The important property of the wavelet is that it minimizes the product of its standard deviations in the time and frequency domain. Put another way, the uncertainty in information carried by this wavelet is minimized. However they have the downside of being non-orthogonal, so efficient decomposition into the basis is difficult. Since their inception, various applications have appeared, from image processing to analyzing neurons in the human visual system.  Minimal uncertainty property  The motivation for Gabor wavelets comes from finding some function f(x) which minimizes its standard deviation in the time and frequency domains. More formally, the variance in the position domain is: : (\\\\Delta x)^2 = \\\\frac {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} (x-\\\\mu)^2 f(x)f^{*}(x) \\\\,dx} {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)f^{*}(x) \\\\, dx} where f^{*}(x) is the complex conjugate of f(x) and \\\\mu is the arithmetic mean, defined as: : \\\\mu = \\\\frac {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x f(x)f^{*}(x) \\\\,dx} {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)f^{*}(x)\\\\,dx} The variance in the wave number domain is: : (\\\\Delta k)^2 = \\\\frac {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} (k-k_0)^2 F(k)F^{*}(k) \\\\, dk} {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(k)F^{*}(k) \\\\, dk} Where k_0 is the arithmetic mean of the Fourier Transform of f(x) , F(x) : : k_0 = \\\\frac {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k F(k)F^{*}(k) \\\\,dk} {\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(k)F^{*}(k) \\\\,dk} With these defined, the uncertainty is written as: : (\\\\Delta x)(\\\\Delta k) This quantity has been shown to have a lower bound of \\\\frac12 . The quantum mechanics view is to interpret (\\\\Delta x) as the uncertainty in position and \\\\hbar (\\\\Delta k) as uncertainty in momentum. A function f(x) that has the lowest theoretically possible uncertainty bound is the Gabor Wavelet.  Equation  The equation of a 1-D Gabor wavelet is a Gaussian modulated by a complex exponential, described as follows: : f(x) = e^{-(x - x_0)^2/a^2}e^{-i k_0(x-x_0)} As opposed to other functions commonly used as bases in Fourier Transforms such as \\\\sin and \\\\cos , Gabor wavelets have locality properties, meaning that as the distance from the center x_0 increases, the value of the function becomes exponentially suppressed. a controls the rate of this exponential drop-off and k_0 controls the rate of modulation. It is also worth noting the Fourier transform of a Gabor wavelet, which is also a Gabor wavelet: : F(k) = e^{-(k - k_0)^2 a^2}e^{-i x_0(k-k_0)} An example wavelet is given here: A Gabor wavelet with a = 2, x0 = 0, and k0 = 1  See also  * Gabor transform * Gabor filter * Morlet wavelet  References   External links  *MATLAB code for 2D Gabor wavelets and Gabor feature extraction Category:Wavelets ","title":"Gabor wavelet"},{"id":"42334633","text":"In accounting, a financial condition report (FCR) is a report on the solvency condition of an insurance company that takes into account both the current financial status, as reflected in the balance sheet, and an assessment of the ability of the company to survive future risk scenarios. Risk assessment in a FCR involves dynamic solvency testing, a type of dynamic financial analysis that simulates management response to risk scenarios, to test whether a company could remain solvent in the face of deteriorating economic conditions or major disasters. Dynamic solvency testing may involve both deterministic projections, based on known risks, and stochastic projections that include random risk events. FCRs are a part of the statutory reporting requirements for life insurance companies in Pakistan, Australia, Ghana and non-life insurance companies in Canada. FCRs are also required in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 and in Ireland. While many consider FCRs a type of compliance report, they can also be useful for corporate management to identify weaknesses in risk strategy, to test diversification of risk through, e.g., reinsurance, and to set fair market pricing for options.

Life  Ata Tadakage was a son of Izaku Yoshimichi. He was a distant relative of Taira no Suemoto, who founded the Shimazu Estate in the 1020s. His name was first attested in a contemporary source in 1138. At that time he was the governor of Ata District, Satsuma Province. He killed his eldest brother Kawanabe Michifusa and banished Michifusa's son Michihira from Satsuma. Fragmentary sources show that he gradually expanded the sphere of his influence in Satsuma. He gained the title of Provisional Governor of Shimotsuke Province in 1150. A document, dated 1162, suggests that he had power to influence the neighboring ≈åsumi Province. It is presumed that he was affiliated with Minamoto no Tametomo, a legendary warrior from the Minamoto clan, who stayed in Ky≈´sh≈´ from 1151 to 1155. His daughter is said to have married with Tametomo. Ata Tadakage drew attention from historians and archaeologists in the 1990s when the Mottaimatsu Site was excavated. The archaeological site is located on the northern bank of the Manose River, which served as Ata District's southern border. It was at its peak from the middle 12th century to the first half of the 13th century. It is considered to have served as a trade center connected to Hakata‚ÄìDazaifu of northern Ky≈´sh≈´ and to the Southern Islands since it had a huge variety of goods including Kamuiyaki, a large number of Chinese ceramics such as Longquan celadon and Tong'an celadon, and in smaller quantity, sue wares from eastern Harima Province and Tokoname-yaki from Owari Province. The profitable trade was probably the source of his power. Ata Tadakage's rise to power was seen as a rebellion by the central government, which was then controlled by Taira no Kiyomori. Around 1160, probably after the Heiji Rebellion, an imperial decree was issued to crack him down. The punitive expedition was led by Taira no Iesada, a retainer of Taira no Kiyomori. Tadakage fled to an island named Kikai-ga-shima. Due to high waves and strong winds, Iesada was unable to track Tadakage down, and he disappeared from history. Kikai-ga-shima has often been identified as I≈çjima, an island located about 110 kilometers south of Ky≈´sh≈´. However, historian Nagayama Sh≈´ichi identified it as Kikai Island of the Amami Islands. He argued that since I≈çjima had been used as an island of exile by the central government, it could not be a safe haven for Tadakage.  Aftermath  Ata Tadakage was succeeded by Ata Nobusumi, who married with Tadakage's daughter. Nobusumi survived Taira no Kiyomori's domination. Kiyomori controlled the Shimazu Estate, which covered a large portion of Satsuma Province, while he appointed his younger brother Tadanori as Governor of Satsuma Province. It is likely that the Taira clan's domination of southern Ky≈´sh≈´ was aimed at controlling Japan's trade with Song China. After the Genpei War, the newly established Kamakura shogunate seized Ata Nobusumi's territories in 1192 for his affiliation with the Taira clan and gave Ata District to Samejima Muneie. However, Tadakage's relatives continued to prosper as Samejima Muneie married with a daughter of Tadakage's younger brother and adopted son Tadayoshi. In 1187, the future first sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoritomo dispatched Amano T≈çkage and Utsunomiya Nobufusa to drive enemies out from Kikai-ga-shima. After initial failures, they successfully pacified the island in 1188. Archaeologist Takanashi Osamu noted that the Gusuku Site Complex on Kikai Island ceased to function in the first half of the 13th century although it re-emerged, albeit on a smaller scale, in the second half of the 13th century. Takanashi conjectured that Yoritomo's expedition to Kikai Island had effectively destroyed the Gusuku Site Complex's function as the trade center of the Southern Islands.

He named the subdivision \\"Ortona\\" after the coastal town in Italy, where he was born. Hoping to attract grape growers to his development, Attanasio reported to the Moore Haven Times, in 1924, that he was impressed with the growth of 500 rootstock Carmen Grape on his six acres of land. The original settlers were \\"squatters who moved in and out. Members of the Townsend family visited, stayed awhile, then moved on.\\" After the Depression, all land developers left except Williams, Storter, Hicks, Komer, and Rivers families. Afterward, settlers moved into Ortona, along the Caloosahatchee River, living in \\"houses built of cane poles and roofed over with cabbage fan palms,\\" buying five to ten acre tracts of land. Lonnie Williams, with other members of the community, went to Fisheating Creek to collect cane poles to build the Ortona Holiness Church, featuring a \\"cabbage fan roof.\\" The palm frond roofs lasted up to three years. The community helped each other build their homes. The settlers lived in a \\"cluster,\\" fishing, hunting and farming, together. Everyone had access to sugarcane. Though all neighbors helped each other grind sugarcane for syrup; \\"everyone had a stand of cane,\\" all supplies and tools had to be bought. Tom and Amanda Williams, grandparents of Vance Storter, brought him to Ortona from Naples at four- years-old. They traveled from Naples to Fort Center after their daughter died of typhoid fever. With hogs bought from the Seminole, they finally moved to Ortona. The first Ortona school was located by the O'Bannion's saw mill, according to Storter. A larger school was built by the county on two-acres of land \\"behind Mr. Komer's house to accommodate the increased enrollment.\\" Teachers were known for \\"leaving abruptly,\\" according to Marvin Williams, \\"one with a nervous breakdown.\\" The first consistent teacher was \\"Mr. Ketring\\" who \\"kept the boys at their school work.\\" Focusing on school work was hard for the local students; \\"with plenty of hunting, fishing and chores, it was difficult to be very concerned about book learning.\\" Steamboats from Fort Myers came to load \\"cordwood\\" supplied by the J.F. \\"Bud\\" Cross family after contracting and cutting down woodland areas and delivering the wood to the boats. Nailed to a tree was a coffee mill, accessible to everyone to grind their coffee beans. Afterward, the area was named Coffee Mill Hammock, including a road by the same name. Without local fencing laws in the 1920s, cows grazed freely and dairy products were free, \\"if one had the determination and a drawdy pole.\\" \\"The drawdy pole was long with a loop of rope firmly attached to the end. The loop was hooked around the cow's horns, and the pole twisted to tighten the grip of the horns. Finally, the cow could only move in a slight semi-circle, and it could be milked.\\" There was no supplemental feed; the cows were free- range. Fourteen to twenty cows provided enough milk for a family. There was \\"sweet milk for drinking, sour milk for bread, butter, and other milk by- products.\\" Hogs were raised and sold to the locals and hauled to Fort Myers. \\"At that time, the cattle were too scrawny to be slaughtered, and the price wasn't nearly as good as for hogs.\\" Thirty-two acres of land was used for the Ortona Cemetery in 1921. The first caretaker was Clive Hicks. A train depot was built after Chihi, a railroad crossing, was finished. The first bridge tender at the railroad was Eugene Walker, who \\"bought the cane mill from an outlaw for $112\\" and was still the owner in 1985. The depot was used as a refuge for flooding for those in lower areas around Ortona's ridge. Owned by Don Melcer, Meadowlark Campground featured a two-story building, with workers living near the camp. Currently, it's called the Meadowlark Shores 55+ RV Park. Ken Bracken started the River Oaks subdivision located west of Meadowlark Shores. Turkey Creek was created by Eurgene Walker, the location of O'Bannion's saw mill, which kept a dragline onsite; \\"a horse couldn't get through the thick brush, but the dragline dug through.\\" In 1985, Ghands and Baker owned one sandmine while one was leased to E.R. Jahna, though operated by John Bruner. Paul and Wheeler planted 1,000 acres of young citrus groves in 1979.

Inst. Metals. (1880 ‚Äì 2 April 1921) was a British metallurgist and army officer. An Army Ordnance Corps member, in 1906 he was stationed on Guernsey, where he wrote a novel, Diverse Affections: a Romance of Guernsey. Garland rose to become Superintendent of Laboratories at the Cairo Citadel, Egypt by 1913 and received a grant from the Chemical Society, of which he was a fellow, to conduct research into ancient Egyptian alloys. The outbreak of war saw him commissioned as a Special List officer with the Arab Bureau. Garland developed explosives for the army, including the Garland grenade and was, in September 1916, assigned to train T. E. Lawrence and the fighters of the Arab Revolt in explosives. His mines were used against the Hejaz Railway and may have been involved in the first derailing of a moving train by explosives. Garland commanded the desperate defence of Yanbu in which he forced an attacking superior Ottoman force to withdraw with almost no bloodshed. Awarded the Military Cross and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Garland became director of the Arab Bureau after the war and was involved in the post-war negotiations for the future of Arabia. Returning from Egypt because of poor health, Garland died within days of setting foot in England.  Early career  Garland was born in Sheffield in 1880. In 1906, he published a novel, Diverse Affections: a Romance of Guernsey, written whilst stationed on the island with the Army Ordnance Corps. Garland was later transferred to Khartoum, Sudan and by the outbreak of the First World War was Superintendent of Laboratories at the Cairo Citadel, Egypt, where he had received a grant from the Chemical Society to research ancient Egyptian alloys. He was elected a fellow of the society the same year. He was one of the first to study the crystalline structures of metals by polishing, etching and examination by microscope. He had three papers published in the Cairo Scientific Journal in 1913-4 entitled Ancient Egyptian Metal Tools, Outlines of Metallography and Some Physical Properties of Tin.  First World War  A surviving Garland Trench Mortar Initially involved with the development of new weapons, Garland devised the Garland grenade in 1914 174,000 of these weapons were produced and supplied to the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force during the war and Lawrence's forces used them in their campaign to disrupt the Hejaz Railway. He also developed the Garland Trench Mortar, a 65mm calibre improvised device that was trialled by Australian forces at Gallipoli. Garland, who spoke Arabic, was assigned to British Intelligence's Arab Bureau and was posted to Hejaz in September 1916. There he applied his practical knowledge of explosives to developing mines, teaching T. E. Lawrence and the Arab rebels to use them during their guerilla campaign and contributing to the British capture of Damascus and the eventual downfall of the Ottoman Empire. One of his initial tasks was to help fortify the town of Jiddah, recently captured by Arab forces. On 2 and 3 December 1916 Garland commanded the Arab forces inside the town during the Battle of Yanbu. The Arabs numbered no more than 1,500 men and the Ottomans were expected to descend upon the town imminently. Garland saw to it that a defensive trench was dug by the townsfolk, barbed wire entanglements were established, machine gun positions were correctly sited and the towns' 300-year-old coral walls were strengthened. He even brought into service an old Turkish cannon that, in Garlands words, was \\"apt to fire astern instead of forward\\". With the supporting gunfire and searchlights of five Royal Navy vessels he held off advancing Ottoman forces in a relatively bloodless victory that ensured the continuance of the Arab Revolt. The searchlights were thought by one of Garland's men to have been key to winning the battle, being used to discourage an Ottoman attack by highlighting the coverless plain that had to be crossed prior to reaching the town. The Hejaz railway which Garland sought to disrupt One of Garland's contact mines derailed an Ottoman locomotive in 1917, in what some consider the first such attack on a moving train. During the Siege of Medina he served as military advisor to Abdullah I of Jordan. In the final days of the war in Arabia Garland was sent to Medina to oversee the surrender of that town to the allies. As a temporary captain on the Special List he was awarded the Military Cross on 3 June 1917. Garland was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 3 June 1918. He received permission to accept the fourth class award of the Order of the Nile on 26 November 1919 and the third class of the Order of El Nahda on 16 January 1920. Garland was also appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and mentioned in dispatches several times.  Post-war  Garland transferred to the General List of officers on 6 May 1920 with the grade of a class FF staff officer (equivalent to staff captain), but without pay or allowances. He relinquished his commission on 14 May that year, but received permission to retain his rank. He was later appointed major and became director of the Arab Bureau in Cairo, under the High Commissioner to Egypt Lord Allenby. Garland's main task was to resolve the post-war state of the Arabian Peninsula which the war had left in the hands of a number of competing Arab tribes and to tackle the delicate matter of the ending of lavish subsidies from the British treasury to Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca. In 1921 Garland left Egypt on health grounds, returning to England on 28 March. He died suddenly on 2 April of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and was buried in Gravesend. His notes were published posthumously in 1927, as Ancient Egyptian Metallurgy, having been written up by Charles Olden Bannister, Professor of metallurgy at Liverpool University. Garland's papers are archived at the Imperial War Museum, London, having been donated by his daughter, Mena.

The district includes Lake Roland Park (formerly named Robert E. Lee Park,) as well as a cluster of largely vernacular dwellings between the park and Falls Turnpike that was built mainly in the 19th century.  Overview  The Maryland Historical Trust (MHT) describes the district as follows: : The Bare Hills Historic District, covering approximately 275 acres, takes its name from the geological formation it in part encompasses, a promontory of Serpentine (‚Äúcopper rock‚Äù) around which the Jones Falls flows on its way to Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay. The Bare Hills Historic District represents a community's development from its industrial beginnings in milling and mining into a transportation corridor along the Falls Turnpike, and finally to residential area after rail services enabled commuting into Baltimore. The district includes 90 properties which provide: * The 19th-20th century African American Scott Settlement‚Äîone of the earliest free-black communities in Baltimore County. * Late 19th and 20th century residential development along the railroad and Lake Roland. * Lake Roland Park (so-named since 28 September 2015) Originally named Robert E. Lee Park, the portion included in the historic district encompasses a wooded landscape on the side of the undeveloped 1898 Sorrento subdivision The MHT description also states: : Visually, the Bare Hills Historic District is characterized by the integration of various sizes, types and styles of construction spanning almost a century and a half of development. Within the wooded environment, most of the houses are of frame construction, many of them gable fronted, with wood-shingled walls, porches, and with foundations constructed of the local Serpentine stone. The majority of houses and their support buildings date from 1890 to 1920, but there are significant examples both earlier and later, such as the individually National Register-listed Gothic Revival Bare Hills House built in 1857, the 1881 serpentine stone Bare Hills School, and the Mid-Century Modern Hooper House II, designed by Marcel Breuer and constructed in 1959-60.  Geology  Situated on a serpentine barrens, its thin and unfertile serpentine soil defined the Bare Hills area. H. H. Hayden documented the discovery of the area's mineral value: : Until the year 1808 or 1810, little was known of the mineralogical character of these hills, and little else was obvious to the traveler besides their repulsive aspect. About this time, the chromate of iron, in small irregular or rolled masses, was discovered in one of the deep ravines, by Mr. Henfrey, a gentleman who it is believed, was the discoverer of chrome, titanium, and several other interesting minerals, in this part of the country. Subsequently, and particularly since the commencement of regular operations for obtaining chromate of iron, this district has excited, especially among mineralogists, a degree of interest not surpassed, perhaps, in the case of any locality in the United States. The discovery occurred on Jesse Tyson's farm. Tyson's son Isaac Tyson, Jr. successfully mined the Bare Hills for chromite and identified other serpentine barrens in Maryland as chromite sources, including the Soldiers Delight area in western Baltimore County. His acumen established Maryland as the world's leading producer of chromium until the middle of the 19th century. All extraction at Bare Hills ceased by 1833. The Bare Hills rock formation forces Jones Falls into an approximately 2.5 mile half-circle detour to the East before it resumes its south-southeasterly flow.The MHT description notes only that the rock formation causes the detour. A WP contributor approximated the detour's length using Google Maps. See the Bare Hills talk page.  History  Bare Hills is also notable as the site of one of the earliest free African-American communities in Baltimore County, established about 1830 by Aquila Scott. Per the registration document for Bare Hills in the National Register of Historic Places: : Aquila (Aquilla) Scott, a blacksmith by trade as well as a Methodist preacher, arrived in the Bare Hills area by 1830. Descended from a St. Mary's County freed-slave named Tobias Scott, Aquila Scott was among a growing population of free blacks in Maryland. In 1833, Scott was named among the five trustees of a small congregation of the Bethel Episcopal Methodist Religious Society in a deed from Mary and Elijah Fishpaw. The deed was for land in the northeast corner of the Hopyard tract on which to build a church, later called St. John's Church. Though the church was located on the east side of the Jones Falls and the B&S; (Baltimore and Susquehanna) Rail Road, Aquila Scott purchased two acres of land in 1839 from Johnzee Hook on the summit of the Bare Hills. The parcel fronted onto the Falls Turnpike and there Scott established his blacksmith shop and dwelling house. As Scott's family often children grew and eventually started their own families, they built their houses on the two-acre tract and the community became known as \\"Scott's Settlement.\\" Aquila Scott died in 1858 while preaching in the church he helped establish and was buried on his Bare Hills property. Note. Scott's original log church burned in 1876. Its replacement, built in 1886, remains standing. The church site lies on the opposite side of Lake Roland, outside of this historic district. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. It includes the previously-listed Bare Hills House.

Besides the actual competition, the Cybathlon offers a platform to drive forward research on assistance systems for everyday use, and to promote dialogue with the public. The first Cybathlon organised by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) took place in the Swiss Arena in Kloten north of Zurich in Switzerland on 8 October 2016 and was the first international competition of this kind. 66 pilots from 25 nations competed in front of a stadium with approximately 4600 spectators. The next Cybathlon takes place on 13‚Äì14 November 2020 in a new format at the teams' home base instead of in the Swiss Arena in Kloten, Zurich as it had been planned. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic which requires measures such as social distancing to be adhered. Termed the \\"Global Edition\\", teams will set up their infrastructure for the competition at their home base and capture their races on video instead of competing physically next to each other in Zurich. Cybathlon officials will supervise the pilots which will start individually. On the first day the qualification rounds will take place, with the finals on the second day. Just like at the premiere, there will be an attractive supporting programme, wherein the visitors can try out the disciplines for themselves and understand the issues surrounding disability in a practical way. Background Robert Riener, head of the professorship for Sensory-Motor Systems at ETH Zurich, initiated the Cybathlon in 2013 as a platform for the development of everyday-suitable assistance systems. The Cybathlon comes out of a collaboration with the Swiss National Center of Competence in Robotics Research, which intends to use the competition to promote the development and widespread use of bionic technology. The event organised under the umbrella of ETH Zurich is supported financially as well as ideologically by partners and through patronage. Whereas other international competitions for disabled athletes, such as the Paralympics, only permit competitors to use unpowered assistive technology, the Cybathlon encourages the use of performance- enhancing technology such as powered exoskeletons. Teams can compete in six different disciplines. A team always consists of a pilot (person with a disability that meets the inclusion criteria of the respective discipline) and a technology provider (university or company) who work closely together. Currently, the split is about 70% with a university and 30 % with a company background (e.g. manufacturers of commercially available prostheses).  Disciplines  The six disciplines of Cybathlon 2016 remain the same for Cybathlon 2020 - however, there will be new challenges. Teams compete on courses designed to test how well suited a given technology is to helping its user with everyday tasks, for example climbing stairs or opening doors. In each discipline several pilots compete simultaneously. The tasks and rules are defined in detail for each of the six disciplines. Most important is that the pilots complete the tasks correct, safe and secure. Time comes in as a secondary factor. * Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Race: In the BCI race, pilots with quadriplegia use brain-computer interfaces to control avatars in a computer game. The aim of this technology is to control devices such as wheelchairs for people with limited ability to move. * Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Bike Race: The FES race is for pilots with paraplegia. Functional electrical stimulation is enabling them to perform a pedalling movement on a recumbent bicycle. * Powered Arm Prosthesis Race: In this race, pilots using an arm prosthesis on one or both sides can compete. The prosthesis has to include the wrist and can be navigated with any kind of control. * Powered Leg Prosthesis Race: In this race, pilots using a leg prosthesis on one or both sides, including a knee joint, have to perform various movements. They can use any kind of active or passive prosthetic device. * Powered Exoskeleton Race: In this race, pilots with complete thoracic or lumbar spinal cord injury can compete using an exoskeleton. This wearable, powered support enables them to walk and master other everyday tasks. * Powered Wheelchair Race: In this race, pilots with severe walking disability using a powered wheelchair can compete. The wheelchairs feature novel technologies to overcome obstacles such as stairs or doors. Cybathlon 2016 Medals were awarded to both the athletes themselves and to the companies or institutions that create their bionics. Competitions were organized in such a way that the participants could demonstrate not only their own skills, but also the distinctive qualities of bionomic tools. For example, in the category of \\"hand prostheses\\", competitors attempted several food- related fine motor tasks and in the category \\"Neuro\\" the participants managed avatars in a specially designed computer game.Cybathlon: Battle of the bionic athletes, BBC The winners: *Brain-Computer Interface Race: Numa Poujouly - Team Brain Tweakers (Switzerland) *Functional Electrical Stimulation Bike Race: Mark Muhn - Team Cleveland (US) *Powered Arm Prosthesis Race: Robert (Bob) Radocy - Team Dipo Power (Netherlands) *Powered Exoskeleton Race: Andre Van Ruschen - Team ReWalk (Germany) *Powered Leg Prosthesis Race: Helgi Sveinsson - Team Rheo Knee (Iceland) *Powered Wheelchair Race: Florian Hauser - Team HSR Enhanced (Switzerland) = Video links = BCIBrain-Computer Interface race FESFunctional Electrical Simulation bike race Powered arm prosthesis race Powered leg prosthesis race Powered exoskeleton race Powered wheelchair race References External links * and YouTube channel *\\"Cybathlon 2016: first 'Olympics' for bionic athletes\\".

History Built in 1955, the Federal Building was first proposed in the 1930s to host the Government of Canada's federal offices in Western Canada. The building's construction was put on hold until 1955, as the Great Depression, and World War II occurred. During this time, the building's blueprints were expanded, and the building's size was doubled. The building was completed in 1958, and was opened by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker on March 8, 1958. It hosted federal government staff until 1988, when they were relocated to the newly built Canada Place building, located in downtown Edmonton. The Government of Alberta purchased the building in 1983, for the sum of $20.5 million, originally to house provincial offices, however, the Federal Building sat vacant until 2010, when the Government of Alberta announced that the Federal Building would house offices for both the provincial and federal governments, as well as recreational space for the general public. The building is LEED Gold certified. https://www.alberta.ca/federal-building-history.aspx Design The Federal Building was designed in 1939 by George Heath MacDonald. One of the few Art Deco buildings in Alberta, it takes inspiration from buildings like the Empire State Building, and the Chrysler Building, both located in New York City.http://www.infrastructure.alberta.ca/3562.htm Renovation In 2010, the Government of Alberta started construction to renovate the Federal Building. Renovations done to the building include a new glass pavilion, and a new underground parking garage was built to replace existing above ground parking lots. The glass pavilion also has a living roof, as well as a living wall. The living wall won the 2016 North American Cities Alive Conference's Interior Green Wall Award of Excellence. A granite plaza was also built to extend the Legislature grounds to 99 Avenue. Water fountains and additional green spaces were also added during the renovations, increasing public spaces at the Legislature grounds.

Biography Born Richard Mthetwa in Gyani, Limpopo, Nozinja has since moved to Soweto and spent time running a string of successful mobile phone repair shops before noticing the size of crowds at local Sowetan Shangaan dances and becoming the producer, artist, video director and promoter of the Shangaan style for which he is now known. Shangaan electro was born in Soweto, however takes its name from the Shangaan people who moved to Soweto largely for work, including Nozinja, also known simply as 'Dog'. The 'shangaan electro' sound has found a particular kinship with electronic producers and DJs such as Caribou, Ben UFO, Mount Kimbie and Pearson Sound consistently championing the style. A high- profile series of 12\\"s on Honest Jon's capitalised on this with Theo Parrish, Rashad & Spinn, Ricardo Villalobos, Hype Williams and others remixing Shangaan tracks, which were subsequently compiled on the 'Shangaan Shake' double CD. 2013 saw the release of 2 brand new Nozinja cuts (under various pseudonyms) on Dan Snaith's Jiaolong label. A year after announcing that Nozinja had signed with the UK's Warp Records, a debut full-length album was announced with the title Nozinja Lodge. The album track list features ‚ÄòTsekeleke‚Äô which was also released separately on 24 April 2014.
