Life  Polak was born in Prague, Czech Republic on September 11, 1914. He fought in WWII and was wounded in the Prague Uprising on May 5, 1945. Polak then left Prague and walked to then West Germany and found a job as a U.S. Army motor pool mechanic. Eventually moving to New York City, Polak opened a repair shop in 1951. In 1958 Polak moved to Hermosa Beach, California and through contact with Dr. Ferry Porsche, whom he had known in Europe through motorsport contacts, opened the first exclusive Porsche dealership in the United States in 1959. Polak would later on also become a franchised dealer for Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Saab, and Subaru in Hermosa Beach. Polak married Anna Maria Littlejohn in 1983. She died from breast cancer in 1993. Polak in response donated $2 million to fund a treatment center for breast cancer at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. Vasek Polak died on April, 17 1997 from cardiac arrest resulting from complications due to an accident on the German Autobahn one month earlier. He was driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S when he crashed at speeds in excess of 110 mph, breaking both of his arms and legs. After a month of recuperation Polak was returning to California in an airplane fitted with an intensive care unit, however when refueling in Great Falls, Montana he went into cardiac arrest and died.  Motorsports  A 1976 Vasek Polak Racing Porsche 934 Vasek Polak owned a machine shop in the 1930s and started constructing race engines for motorcycles which he then raced in European enduros. Finding success in motorcycle racing, He won the Czechoslovakian 250cc National Championship. In 1947 he moved to automobile racing with a custom built, aluminum bodied Fiat GT race car. When he opened his Hermosa Beach shop in 1958, Polak focused less on driving and more on preparing racing cars and engines for his clientele. Becoming well known in the sports car racing world, he prepared machines for Jack MacAfee, Ken Miles, Jerry Titus, Roger Penske, Bob Holbert, Jean Behra, Jo Bonnier, and Wolfgang Von Trips. In 1966, Vasek took a Porsche 911 from his dealership inventory and prepared it for racing. With Polak as the entrant, Jerry Titus took the car to the SCCA D Production championship. This was the start of his role as a car owner. As well as this, Polak was asked by Porsche to work on their factory racing team during The 12 Hours of Sebring. He campaigned a Porsche 917 for the 1971 through the 1974 Can Am seasons and entered Porsche 934 and Porsche 935 models in the Trans Am Series. In 1976, George Follmer won the Category 2 Drivers' Championship of the Trans Am series in a Porsche 934 under Vasek Polak Racing.

Currently, she is taking her master's degree in the same university. Ms. Batalla-Laforteza is also the daughter of the artist and musician from Cabuyao, Domingo M. Batalla.  Early life  Maria Rita Teresa Batalla-Laforteza (Born Maria Rita Teresa Herce Batalla) was born on August 3, 1960 in Cabuyao, Laguna. She is the daughter of Dr. Virginia Herce Batalla (acupuncturist) and artist and composer Domingo M. Batalla. She grew up in a small town in Cabuyao, Laguna and still resides there. She has attended numerous schools throughout her education, including the Canossa School in Laguna and the Philippine Women's University. But mostly, her education has been in the University of Sto. Tomas having had her pre-school, college and graduate school years there. As a child, Laforteza initially dreamed to be a doctor like her mother. But as time passed, she grew to love the arts, learning how to draw at a very young age. During elementary, she would make handmade designer stationary that she would then sell to her schoolmates. She would also participate in various art related school activities like school plays (in which she would be the production designer), booths in school fairs, drawing competitions and the like. Come college years, she chose to apply to the University of Sto. Tomas under the College of Science. She did not finish her course, however, and shifted soon to the then College of Architecture & Fine Arts (now the College of Fine Arts & Design) under the course of Painting. She has since developed her artistic ability and honed her skills using the style of impressionism under the watchful mentoring of her professor and another famous Filipino artist, Danilo Santiago.  Career  Laforteza started to make a name for herself in the art industry when her Thesis work entitled \\"The History of Medicine\\" gained popularity as it was praised by her jurors and many art enthusiasts. Said thesis work was even published in numerous print media including The Vision Magazine and Bulletin Today. She was the only outstanding female during her batch's Thesis Deliberation. She made her Thesis artwork exactly 1 week before her deliberation, choosing to focus more on her Thesis book. On the day of the deliberation, she had a high fever and was advised by her mother not to go through with it. But, with the support of her father as well, she pushed through and faced her three jurors: artists Danilo Santiago, Glory Rogers and Leonardo Hidalgo (son of famous artist Felix Hidalgo). She also had her adviser, Antonio Austria, present. With this, she received Top Thesis and was praised for her work. On September 25, 1982 she embarked on her first exhibit for her Thesis work. After this, she focused more on her schoolwork, and didn't join an exhibit until later on in 1995. She joined The Chairman of Research & Documentation historical exhibit along with other artists. It was held on April till September of the year 1995. On 1996, shortly after the exhibit, she joined an On-the-spot Painting Competition. Both events are for the celebration of the 60th Anniversary of the College of Architecture and Fine Arts. She joined as an alumni. December 1996, she was one of the exhibitors in the 5th National Eucharist Congress and UST \\"Masters of the Arts for the Eucharist\\" Painting Exhibition that was held at the GSIS Building. Come 1999, she became a chairman in the Committee on Invitations and Documentations for CITIES 2000, an international convention hosted by her alma mater. Throughout 1999-2000 she joined various kinds of summer art and sports workshops. From 2005 to 2007, she has been in various positions in different committees for the University of Sto. Tomas College of Fine Arts & Design. During August 2006, she participated in helping to break the record Longest painting on Continuous Canvas for the Guinness World Records & International Mid-decade Celebrations of UNESCO for a Culture of Peace & Non-violence for the children of the world. August 2009, three years later, she was an exhibitor for the SI KAD: CFAD Pahid Kulay Art Exhibition, along with her co- faculty members. In the same year, she held her first ever solo exhibit in the gallery of her alma mater, University of Sto. Tomas. She was also an exhibitor last May 2010 for the Lakan Sining Bulacan SM Art Center and 2011 for the Quadricentennial Exhibition of the University of Sto. Tomas. During 2012, she was an exhibitor for the UST Atelier Group Exhibit in Siguada Gallery and September of the same year in the Vignettes and Variations exhibit at the Beato Angelico Gallery for the AAP UST CFAD Junior Chapter. She has since participated in various joint exhibits. A few of these are the Ika 2 Yugot at Galeria de las Islas, Magloyuan, L. E. (2013 November 23). Ika 2 Yugto at Galeria De Las Islas. [Online].

She has stated that, in doing her paintings, she keeps thing organized. She has said that, \\"I have a cabinet at home that contains all my materials. My brushes and paints are in order. I like to be organized,\\" and emphasizes that organization is very important to her because it saves her time and makes it easier for her to start with her works. The longest she has ever painted was 24 hours, but it usually takes her 4–6 hours to finish at artwork, depending on the size and subject of her work. In doing her works, she sometimes gets ideas and starts one on impulse. At other times, however, she researches first on the subject before making a composition and proceeding with doing her work. Music is also a big influence on her, choosing to listen to various tunes while creating her works. She has said that, \\"You have to have an idea first and then let the music enhance that. You can't depend on it. You can't say that you have to listen to music before you start your work. That leads to you being dependent on it, which will not be good in the future. You have to have the idea created in your head first, and then while making your work, you let the music be your support and you let it enhance your artwork and help you finish it. That's the right way to do it,\\". She believes that one should be taken by the emotions through the music, not by the music itself.  Future projects  Her future projects include a wide array of activities, which include: Mural paintings for the University of Sto. Tomas Alumni Center, group exhibitions in Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and a group exhibition for the Philippine Embassy in Los Angeles, California in the United States.

ABS was located at a high-altitude site in the Atacama Desert of Chile as part of the Parque Astronómico de Atacama. ABS began observations in February 2012 and completed observations in October 2014.  Instrument  The ABS telescope imaged the sky at a frequency of 145 GHz (2 mm wavelength), in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, where the CMB emission is at its maximum. The CMB is expected to be weakly polarized, and the ABS instrument is designed to measure this very faint signal. The camera consisted of 240 polarization-sensitive pixels, with two transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers per pixel. This TES array was cooled to a temperature of 0.3 Kelvin to reduce thermal noise in the detectors. The optics consisted of two 60 cm mirrors that were kept at a temperature of 4 K. At the frequencies relevant for measuring the CMB, emission from water vapor in the atmosphere can be a strong contaminant. The high altitude of the site (5200 m above sea level) and its very dry climate resulted in less signal contamination from the atmosphere than would be obtained from most other sites on Earth. Nearby sites have been chosen by other observatories for the same reason, including ACT, ALMA, APEX, ASTE, CBI, Nanten, and POLARBEAR/Simons Array. The ABS experiment was designed for rapid deployment by being built in North America into a standard shipping container. Upon arrival in Chile, the telescope was raised out of a special hatch in the roof of the shipping container for observations. Compared to other similar experiments, ABS was unique in using an ambient-temperature half-wave plate to quickly modulate incoming polarization. This allowed the instrument to \\"lock in\\" to the polarized signal of interest and reject the atmosphere, which is largely unpolarized.  Science goals  The observations made by ABS tested the theory of inflation. Inflation is the leading theory of the very early universe; however, observational evidence for inflation is still inconclusive. Inflationary models generically predict that a gravitational-wave background (GWB) would have been produced along with the density perturbations that seed large-scale structure formation. Such a GWB would leave an imprint on both the temperature and polarization of the CMB. In particular it would leave a unique pattern of polarization, called a B-mode pattern, in the CMB polarization. A measurement of B-mode polarization in the CMB would be important confirmation of inflation and would provide a rare glimpse into physics at ultra-high energies.  Results  Based on an analysis of data from a 2400 deg2 primary observing patch (roughly 6% of the full sky), the ABS experiment measured the expected polarization of the CMB from density perturbations in the early universe, but found no evidence for a GWB from inflation. The ABS experiment also demonstrated the ability to use a half-wave plate as a fast, front-end polarization modulator for measurement stability and control of systematic errors. The ABS project was supported by funding from the NSF, NASA, and CONICYT. Major collaborating institutions included Princeton University, the Johns Hopkins University, NIST, and the Universidad de Chile.

It is an absurdist family comedy/drama. Synopsis The play tells a complex story of Mother, who has an intimate relationship with Doctor, and who has problems telling her 28-year-old sons apart. Part of the problem may be that she has named her two sons “OTTO” and “otto”—an example of what the Doctor calls “symmetry, yes, but not logic”.Albee, Edward. ‘’Me, Myself and I’’. Dramatist Play Service 2011ISBN 0822224992 The play begins when OTTO tells his mother that he’s leaving home to become Chinese and that his brother no longer exists. This upsets otto, who has been searching for some kind of confirmation that he is alive. Maureen, otto’s girlfriend, becomes drawn into this. Word games and semantics, ideas about the various meanings and aspects of love, along with riffs on various cultural references, abound in this play.Goldberg, Isa. “Edward Albee on his new play” FT Magazine. 4 September 2010 Piepenburg, Erik. “But Can Their Moms Tell Them Apart?” New York Times. 15 September 2010 Production history Me, Myself and I was first produced in 2008 at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey. It was directed by Emily Mann with set design by Thomas Lynch and costume design by Jennifer von Mayrhauser. The cast consisted of Tyne Daly (Mother), Michael Esper (OTTO), Brian Murray (Dr.), Charlotte Parry (Maureen), Stephen Payne (the Man) and Colin Donnell (otto). Ben Brantley, in a 2008 review for The New York Times, wrote that Me, Myself and I is “in the tradition of Mr. Albee’s mid- and late-career works like The Marriage Play and The Play About the Baby: fragmented philosophical vaudevilles that turn the most fundamental questions of identity into verbal soft-shoes. It also harks back to his early exercises in absurdism (including the one-acters The Sandbox and The American Dream), coal-black comedies from a time when brash young writers reveled in toppling theatrical traditions.\\"Brantley, Ben. “Ta-ta!

In 1793 he was chosen, together with two other East Lothian farmers to survey the West Riding of Yorkshire for the county agricultural reports of the Board of Agriculture. Shirreff attempted agricultural improvements, including a threshing-machine, worked by wind, and a bone-mill. He tried without success to introduce into Scotland the use of bone-dust as fertiliser.

Its title refers to the cassation, a genre similar to serenade, which was popular in the late 18th century. Sibelius structured the work in five \\"episodes\\". Although his opus numbers were already in the forties, he assigned the unused number Op. 6 to this work, implying an earlier composition date. ' was first performed in Helsinki on 8 February 1904 by the Orchestra of Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer. Another substantial work, also introduced in that concert, was Tulen synty (The Origin of Fire), while a review by Oskar Merikanto evaluated ' as \\"fairly insignificant\\". Sibelius revised the work in 1905, but left a note \\"Bör omarbetas\\" (Must be revised). The beginning of the music, in a chromatic \\"suspense-filling way\\", has been compared to the similar opening of Monty Norman's Dr No, the first James Bond film from 1962. Rob Barnett notes in a review of a recording by the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Osmo Vänskä as part of a complete recording of the composer's works: \\"Sibelius must have had a sense of humour to call this work a 'cassation'\\". He describes it as a ballad for orchestra, beginning \\"stern, relentlessly insistent, ferocious and triple forte\\". He points out a \\"Balakirev-style clarinet solo\\", an \\"Elgarian serenade\\", and a \\"chaste oboe solo\\", concluding: \\"The piece is played and recorded with wit, rapacious energy and gripping concentration.\\"  Literature  * Tomi Mäkelä: \\"Jean Sibelius und seine Zeit\\" (German), Laaber-Verlag, Laaber 2013  References  Compositions for symphony orchestra Compositions by Jean Sibelius 1904 compositions ","title":"Cassazione (Sibelius)"},{"id":"48717600","text":"Warsaw is an unincorporated community in Jefferson County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

The body acted as the buyer of banks for the Nigerian Government by acquiring the non-performing loans (NPL). The original book value of the acquired NPLs was ₦4.02trillion at a price of ₦1.76trillion with a commensurate issue of Zero Bond for the NPL acquired. Background As a result of global financial crisis and domestic events, the federal government of Nigeria through the operation of Central Bank of Nigeria conceptualized the idea for the establishment of a body that will prevent the looming financial crisis in the country. At the time of the establishment of this corporation, the body identified 10 banks with crisis in system asset and responded by the injection of ₦736 billion liquidity to buy up their assets. Among the 10 banks only three banks were unable to meet up and were finally acquired by AMCON and tagged as Bridged Banks: Mainstreet Bank, Keystone Bank and Enterprise Bank. In 2013, the management of the International Monetary Fund through their report advised the Federal Government of Nigeria to stop the operations of AMCON in order to avoid future financial challenges. The founding Managing Director of the organisation was sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari because the presidency believed that sales of acquired banks lack transparency Operations The Act establishing the body permits, as part of its operation to set aside a sinking fund with an annual ₦50 billion contribution by the Central Bank of Nigeria and 0.3% of total asset value of all the commercial banks over the useful life of the corporation. The money from this fund would be used to purchase FG securities and the returns from this investment will be returned to the account and then redistributed among the contributing commercial banks.

He is also a painter, and his work has been featured in modern art exhibitions. Shvelidze's most famous design work includes Robert Sturua's productions of \\"Kvarkvare\\", \\"Richard III\\", and \\"King Lear\\".  Early life  Unlike many artists, Shvelidze was not immersed in art and design from an early age. His father was an average working-class man and his mother was a housewife; neither had any particular passion for art. During his childhood, his brother played the violin and his sister played the piano. Mirian, however, took an interest in drawing, which was not viewed as highly as musical pursuits at the time. He joined a small art club at school, through which he was able to interact with like-minded students. His father died when Mirian was 12 years old. From then on, his mother and grandmother raised him and his two siblings alone in a one-room home. The family ate beans five times a week because they could not afford anything else.  Education  After completing school, Shvelidze applied to the painting faculty at Iakob Nikoladze Art College, where he would study from 1962–65. Because admission to the painting faculty was highly competitive, he started in the graphic design faculty. When he was eventually admitted to the painting faculty, he found that he was restricted to painting compositions, peasants, or constructions. When he observed an older generation of theatrical artists, he noticed that they had more freedom. He switched to the art faculty and started working on independent themes. In 1971, Shvelidze graduated from the Tbilisi Art Academy.  Rustaveli Theatre  One day while still at university, Shvelidze was visited by friends who were artists at the Rustaveli Theatre. Upon seeing some of the works he had created for his dissertation, these friends offered him a position as an artist at the theatre. Had it not been for this chance meeting, Shvelidze has said, he might have pursued a different type of art.

He was the third son of Maldeo Rathore, who broke the Rajput tradition of primogeniture by naming Chandrasen as his successor. Chandrasen followed his father's policy and stayed hostile to the ruling foreign powers in India. He defended his kingdom for nearly two decades against relentless attacks from the Mughal Empire. In 1562 Chandrasens elder brother Ramchandra took the aid of Akbar and invaded Jodhpur. Chandrasen Rathore was reluctant to fight as his fathers ashes had not been immersed. Ramchandra occupied Jodhpur and was recognized as its raja by Akbar. Chandrasen waited till the mourning period had passed. He then led an army towards Jodhpur and defeated Ramchandra. Chandrasen Rathore crowned himself in Jodhpur and ousted his brothers, Udai Singh and Ramchandra out of Marwar. Akbar took advantage of these internal disputes and with the help of Raja's from Bikaner and Amer fought Chandrasen in several battles.Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II By Satish Chandra pg.106 In 1564 Hussain Quli Khan-i-Jahan captured Jodhpur.

Synopsis Angela (Sarah Smyth) used to work at a doctor's office that was shut down after its doctor was shot to death by anti-abortion protester Abraham Baarker (James Wilson), who was arrested soon after. Undeterred, Angela decides to open a home clinic where she provides basic services – something that puts her at odds with the rest of the Baarker family, who believes that she is performing abortions. They also believe that she's to blame for recent infant deaths (implied to be due to water pollution), which they see as a sign of God's disapproval.

Bucher was married twice. Both his wives, like his mother, were born with the surname \\"Durrer\\". (17 January 1834 – 6 October 1906) was a Swiss hotels pioneer and magnate. Bucher was an energetic entrepreneur who attracted anecdotes reflecting his original and direct approach. He is also remembered as a railway pioneer. Life Early years Bucher was born in Kerns, Obwalden, a small town roughly 22 km (15 miles) south of Lucerne. His father, Sébastien Bucher, was a farmer and local councilor. The boy attended the school in Kerns and then went on to college in the cantonal capital, Sarnen, a short distance further up the valley to the south. After some years working as a herdsman and farmer he teamed up with Joseph Durrer, his future brother in law to form, in 1864, the business \\"Bucher & Durrer\\". In 1868 the two of them opened a factory on the edge of Sarnen, at Kägiswil, where they constructed timber flooring, soon moving on to become constructors of timber barns and houses. The hotelier In 1869/70 \\"Bucher & Durrer\\" built their first hotel, the \\"Sonnenberg-Hotel\\" in Engelberg. They sold it at a profit after a year. In 1871 Bucher purchased the lakeside \\"Trittalp\\" meadow located on a ridge on the Bürgenstock (mountain). Here he built the 220 bed \\"Grand Hotel Kurhaus\\", subsequently renamed \\"Grand Hotel Bürgenstock\\",Odermatt, Frey-Fürst: Das Buch vom Bürgenstock, 1948 which opened in 1873. Bucher oversaw the construction himself. The luxury hotel was a success, which led to expansion. Between 1887 and 1905 the Bürgenstock Hotel grew into a substantial hotel resort-complex. In order to improve access to the inherently inaccessible mountaintop hotel, a funicular railway, claimed to be the first electric railway in Switzerland, was opened in 1888. After early technical challenges had been overcome, the funicular became a highly effective tourist magnet. The Bürgenstock also featured electric lighting and electric elevators many years before these features became mainstream, and long before public power supplies became the norm. Bucher built a hydro-electric generating plant, which came into operation in 1886/87, for the growing complex. An additional use for the power supply came with the construction in 1905 of the remarkable Hammetschwand Lift / Elevator, an outdoor device that carries visitors up a vertical distance of more than 100 meters on order to access a look-out position with views across Lake Lucerne. During the 1880s the business activities of Bucher and his partner Joseph Durrer diverged, with Durrer focusing on timber based building and construction, while Bucher concentrated on the hotel business. However, it was only in 1895 that the business of \\"Bucher & Durrer\\" was formally split. Bucher's portion of the business was renamed \\"Schweizerische Hotelgesellschaft\\", which by the start of the twentieth century had become the largest hotels undertaking in the world, as Franz Josef Bucher, supported by his growing family, constructed a succession of luxury hotels in and beyond Europe. Particularly high profile creations included the Hotel Quirinal in Rome and the Hotel Palace Luzern. The last hotel he created was the Hotel Semiramis in Cairo, where it is reported that he simultaneously employed 300 European construction workers together with a further 1,000 Egyptians: Bucher himself died shortly before the Semiramis opened in 1906. Sources differ as to whether by his two marriages, Bucher had 14 or 15 recorded children. Six of his sons took leading positions in his hotels business and which also employed his sons-in-law and many remoter kinsfolk. Following his death his sons Fritz and Arnold took over leadership of the business. The railway pioneer It was on Bucher's personal initiative that \\"Bucher & Durrer\\" constructed the Stansstad–Stans electric tramline, connecting the paddle-steamer quay at the southwestern end of Lake Lucerne with the base station for the Stanserhorn funicular railway, which was also constructed by Bucher's firm. The railway opened in 1893 and attracted much interest due to its technical innovations, notably in respect of the braking system (Zangenbremsen). Further railways constructed by the firm included the Monte San Salvatore funicular opened on the edge of Lugano in 1890, the short but steep funicular in Lugano linking the city to its mainline station (1886), the Reichenbach Falls funicular (1899) and the Vevey–Chardonne–Mont-Pèlerin funicular (1900). Bucher's railway building was not restricted to Switzerland. In Genoa he built the funicular at the Mura delle Chiappe (1896) and an electric tramline, necessary to provide adequate access to his newly purchased hotel in the city. On its completion, he sold the tramline to the municipality for one million Swiss francs, which he insisted on receiving in cash. This he placed in a large linen sack which he took back to Kerns, proudly showing fellow villagers his first million and buying drinks for many. He also had himself photographed in his garden at home, accompanied by the cash, his wife, and two of their children, using a new medium to provide visual evidence of his enhanced credit-worthiness. Asked why he had nevertheless, as usual, traveled home in a third class railway carriage, he is said to have explained that the Gotthard Railway did not offer a fourth class. Having celebrated his triumph with his neighbours he set off with his bag of cash for Rome, where he used it to buy the Hotel Quirinal. This was not the only time that Josef Bucher drew attention with his unconventional business methods. The quirky magnate Despite commercial success, Josef Bucher always retained an underlying humility. He never ate with the guests in his hotel dining rooms, but insisted on eating with the hotel personnel. Various legends circulate in this connection. On one occasion he noticed that only one of the tables in the staff canteen had a tablecloth on it. He was given to understand that the table with the cloth on it was set aside for senior staff, whereupon he seized one end and pulled the cloth, together with the contents of the table, onto the floor. Although he did business in many countries across two continents, Josef Bucher never bothered to master foreign languages. Instructions were habitually delivered in the pithy dialect of his home canton. Despite the importance within his hotels empire of Ticino, Rome and Genoa, it was said that the only word of Italian that he uttered with any frequency was \\"Avanti!\\". Public office Josef Bucher was a local councillor in Kerns, also serving, between 1884 and 1896, on the Cantonal Council. He was an instigator, co-founder and board member of the Cantonal Bank.

The ’paper started as a list of the town's influential and well-to-do visitors but soon added news, mostly local, and adverts which traditionally adorned the front page. It was published by Richard Mason from 1853 to 1860. In 1907 The ‘Tenby Observer’ became a pioneer of press freedom when the then editor, Frank B. Mason (founder of the Tenby estate agents now known as fbm) protested through the law courts his being excluded from a Tenby Borough Council meeting. He lost the case, highlighting a deficiency in British law. As a result, the Admission of the Press Act was passed in 1908. Thanks to the dedication of its staff, even in lean times, the ‘Tenby Observer’ has never missed an issue. In 1978 the ’paper, which was being printed under the title ‘West Wales Weekly Observer’ was saved from having to close when it was acquired by Sir Ray Tindle, who encouraged a more localised approach to news reporting, “reporting on strictly local news and events which are important to the community.” To this day the ‘Tenby Observer’ is one of the titles owned by Tindle Newspapers Ltd. The newspaper currently enjoys great success, with a print and online readership of about 24,000 per week. As well as providing an invaluable news resource to a large area of South West Wales, it is also popular with Tenby exiles and people who have made Pembrokeshire their “second home.” Thanks to Newsplan 2000 and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Tenby newspaper archives from 1853 to 1950 were committed to microfilm and are housed in the ‘Observer’ offices; the remaining archives are stored in their original format at Tenby Library, Greenhill Avenue, Tenby. On 31 July 2003 Prince Charles visited Tenby and the ‘Tenby Observer’ to mark the paper's 150th Anniversary. He also visited Tenby Museum and Art Gallery to mark the 125th anniversary of the museum's opening. Also under the ‘Tenby Observer’ banner are the ‘Narberth and Whitland Observer’, established 1906, the ‘Pembroke and Pembroke Dock Observer’, established 2011, a yearly Summer Holiday Guide, the monthly nostalgic ‘Tenby Times’ (now a supplement), ‘Tenby Times Annual’, two Wedding Planners each year, an event guide for Ironman Wales and a Local Directory featuring local businesses and skilled services. Current ‘Observer’ offices are situated at the bottom of Warren Street, Tenby, near the Railway Station. In addition to the General Manager and Editor there are four members of staff for reception, sales and advertising, and two reporters.

In the anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 94. The Sanskrit text is one of the 22 Samanya Upanishads, part of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy literature and is attached to the Atharva Veda. The Upanishad comprises 23 verses. The Pranagnihotra Upanishad's title literally means Hotra (sacrifice) offered to the Agni (fire) of Prana (breath, life force).\\" The text asserts that universal soul (God) is within one self, all Vedic gods are embodied in the human body giving one various abilities, eating is allegorically a sacrifice to the gastric fire, and life is a ceremony to the God within. The Upanishad suggests that even if one does not perform external rituals such as the Vedic Agnihotra and one lacks the knowledge of Samkhya or Yoga philosophy, one can nevertheless achieve moksha (liberation, freedom) by realizing that the God is within one's body, and the universal soul in the individual self represents the all pervading Brahman. This realization makes a person sail through all suffering and vicissitudes of life. The Upanishad in its final passages states that virtuous duty of non-violence, compassion, patience and memory unto others is an act of worship to the God within. It concludes by re-asserting that \\"all the gods are enclosed in this body here\\". The text is also known as Pranagnihotropanishad (). Etymology Pranagnihotra is a compound Sanskrit word, composed of Prana (soul-life force, breath of life, vital breath and energy), Agni (fire) and Hotra (oblation, sacrifice).Monier Monier-Williams (2002), A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 6, 705 The title of the text, states Paul Deussen, means the Upanishad of \\"fire offering made to the Prana\\" (life force), or the \\"sacrifice offered in the Prana-fire.\\" The term Pranagnihotra (or prana agnihotra) appears in many ancient Sanskrit texts, and has been generally interpreted in two ways, states Bodewitz.Henk Bodewitz (1997), Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa I, 1–65: Translation and Commentary, Brill Academic, , page 220, also 221–227 First, as \\"the fire-sacrifice to the breaths\\"; and second, as \\"the sacrifice in the fires which are the breaths\\". In the context of the Pranagnihotra Upanishad, the allegory focuses on treating human body as a temple and individual self (soul) as identical with the universal soul (Brahman). Anthology The Pranagnihotra Upanishad text is also listed in at sr no. 17 in the list of 30 minor Upanishads in the Bibliothica Indica of Professor Ramamaya Tarkaratna with Narayanabhatta's commentary. In Colebrooke anthology of 52 Upanishads popular in north India, the text is listed at number 11. The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 11. It finds mention in the anthology of Upanishads popular in South India.Patrick Olivelle (1998), Upaniṣads, Oxford University Press, , pp. xxxii–xxxiii Foundation and structure The Pranagnihotra Upanishad, states Paul Deussen, builds upon the foundation presented in the ancient Principal Upanishads wherein the soul within the individual is identified with all-encompassing universal soul, and various old Vedic nature gods are envisioned to be aspects of human body, sensory organs and powers of abstraction. In Pranagnihotra, the internal gods replace the external gods of Agnihotra. The text adopts the ideas from the more ancient texts such as the Chandogya Upanishad of human body as the holistic city where Brahman (universal soul) resides, where Surya (sun deity) is envisioned as eyes to see light, Vayu (wind deity) as nose for breathing air, Indra as hands, Vishnu as legs, Kama or Prajapati as sexual organs, and other organs work together with Atman.Paul Deussen (1908) The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Oxford University Press, , pp. 263–280 It then maps the external yajna sacrifice of worldly rituals such as Agnihotram offered to Vedic gods, to internal introspection and offerings to one's own body. The purification rituals of a yajna, for example states the text, are same as washing one's hands and rinsing one's mouth before and after eating. The idea that public rituals and sacrifice to gods in nature are equivalent to personal rituals and offerings to gods within oneself, is already present in section 1.5 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and chapter 5 of Chandogya Upanishad, two of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism. The Pranagnihotra Upanishad proceeds to map, in its four parts, all inner aspects of human body and human life to the outer observed aspects of a public ritual, including calling all of the external world as witness and attendants to the ceremony of human life just like a public ritual has witnesses and attendants.Shantha Nair (2009), Echoes of Ancient Indian Wisdom, Pustak Mahal, , p. 276 The premise behind the second part of the Pranagnihotra Upanishad is, states Deussen, in Maitri Upanishad chapter 6, while Chandogya Upanishad and Mahanarayana Upanishad are at the foundation of its part three and four. Part three is structured as a set of questions, and part four as answers to these questions. In this part of the Upanishad, human intellect is envisioned as one's inner wife, mind as the chariot, and one's soul to be the God within. The text states that in the inner ritual of worship, virtues towards others is an act of worship to one's inner wife (Patni-samyajas) and the God within, and that the four most important virtues are: non-violence (Ahimsa), compassion, patience and memory. The text, notes Deussen, mentions Ahimsa twice, once as Samyajas (virtuous duty and offering) and another as Iṣṭis (desired object).

Part 1 In the first part, the Upanishad opens its thesis with the declaration that liberation (freedom) is possible without the ritual of Agnihotra, the knowledge of Samkhya and Yoga philosophies. In the first seven verses the Upanishad defines \\"the hymn of food\\" as a feeding ceremony, after perceiving food as integral to one's body, and invokes the Vedic gods; sun denoting eyes, vayu or wind personifying breath and so forth. This offering is made to prana, meaning life-force, which satiates the needs of the sensory organs with the related internal gods also satisfied. After placing the food on the ground as per a set procedure, three mantras are recited invoking Brihaspati and Soma (Moon) to protect us (all living beings) from fear, to protect them from evil spirits, to give food that is wholesome and rich in energy and give progeny to all bipeds and quadrupeds. The verse 8 states the unity of Atman (individual soul) and Brahman (universal soul) as follows, In verses 9, 10, and 11 the Upanishad states the sanctity of water in purifying everything on the earth, requesting that she (goddess of water) purify the one offering the prayer of food. The Upanishad declares that water is ambrosia. The verses offer the benediction that may she purify \\"whatever uneatable I eat without knowing, whatever misdeeds I did without knowing, may she nourish the life-force\\". With the water accepting and purifying whatever is offered to it, then oblation is offered reciting Om to the five fires in the body, with the prayer that \\"may myself be in the Brahman\\" in verse 10 of the Upanishad. The five fires, the text states are Prana (fire of breath, intake, life-force), Apana (fire of elimination, outtake, removal of waste products from the body), Vyana (fire of circulating energy), Samana (fire of assimilation), and Udana (fire of sound, speech, ascending consciousness). Verses 11 and 12 are a juhoti (offering) with open hand to self, where each of five fingers are mapped to the five fires, with a hand gesture made with the use of tips of fingers and the thumb of the right hand. The first offering as svaha is to prana by holding the little finger or Kanishtika and the thumb together; the second offering is with the ring finger or anamika and the thumb held together to Apana; with the middle finger and the thumb held together to Vyana; with all fingers together to Udana; and with the forefinger and thumb together to Samana. The offerings are made as stated in the Upanishad once to prana (the sun, head), twice to apana (the mouth), once to dakhsinagni (the southern fire, heart), once to the garhapatya (family fire, navel), and once to pryashchitta (for repentance, below navel) fire. The person, states Deussen, then rinses his mouth with water, and murmurs, \\"the highest Atman gives peace to all the creatures! I shall not be born any more! You are all, all-human, multiform! You sustain the universe born out of you.\\" Part 2 In Part 2, the Upanishad asserts that while one is offering purifying water as oblation to self, one must, states Deussen, meditate on Atman (one's soul) and think, \\"I make him a fire-sacrifice, because he is a foster-child of all\\" and \\"may all sacrificial offerings fuse into you (soul)\\", equating it to be the \\"immortal Brahman (universal soul, God)\\", and asserting it to be present in everyone. The text remarks in verses 16–17 that eating and circulation of food within the temple of body is yajna, a homa sacrifice in circulation. In verses 18 to 20, the Pranagnihotra Upanishad maps the five external fires into internal fires, asserting them to be sun fire in the Ekarsi of head, optic fire or the Ahavaniya-fire of mouth, gastric fire overseen by heart, intestinal fire that cooks and digests in the navel, and all atonement fire in the body below the navel that is threefold – two of which remove waste and one which procreates by means of moon-light. Part 3 Part 3 consists of one verse, the verse 21, which is a long series of questions. It asks, that in this sacrifice offered inside one's body, who is the sacrificer?, who is his wife?, who is the Ritvij (chief priest)?, other priests?, assistants?, what is the utensil?, Ida (milk offering)?, which are the hymns? what is the altar? what is the reward? how does it conclude? among many other questions. Part 4 Part 4 consists of two verses, with verse 22 answering the questions in Part 3 (see table mapping the features of agnihotra with equivalent aspect in a pranagnihotra). The significant answers include the assertion that virtuous duty of non-violence, compassion, patience and memory unto others is an act of worship of one's soul (God within). In the last, 23rd verse, the Upanishad states, The verse 23 then adds that liberation from samsara comes to one who dies in Benares (Varanasi), and one who reads this Upanishad.॥ प्राणाग्निहोत्रोपनिषत् ॥ Sanskrit text of Pranagnihotra Upanishad, SanskritDocuments Archives (2009) Significance and relation to other Hindu texts The Pranagnihotra is, states Bodewitz, an internalized direct private ritual that substituted external social public Agnihotra ritual. The idea of Pranagnihotra duty to oneself as a substitute for a social ritual are rooted in Vedic texts,Henk Bodewitz (1997), Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa I, 1–65: Translation and Commentary, Brill Academic, , pp. 328–329 and Pranagnihotra rites are found in post-Vedic texts such as Grihyasutras,Henk Bodewitz (1997), Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa I, 1–65: Translation and Commentary, Brill Academic, , pp. 302–303, 254–258 and in various Dharmashastras. The idea of gods (Deva) referring to the sense organs within one's body found in Pranagnihotra Upanishad, similarly, has ancient roots. It is found in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad section 2.2,Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 96–97 Kaushitaki Upanishad sections 1.4 and 2.1–2.5,Kausitaki Upanishad Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 302–303, 307–310, 327–328 Prasna Upanishad chapter 2,Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pp. 381The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), pp. 118–119 and others. The idea is also found and developed by other minor Upanishads such as the Brahma Upanishad which opens by describing human body as the \\"divine city of Brahman (universal soul)\\".Patrick Olivelle (1992), The Samnyasa Upanisads: Hindu Scriptures on Asceticism and Renunciation, Oxford University Press, , pp. 147–151 Bodewitz states that the development of pranagnihotra is significant as it reflects the stage in ancient Indian thought where \\"the self or the person as a totality became central, with the self or soul as the manifestation of the highest principle or god\\". This evolution marked a shift in spiritual rite from the external to the internal, from public performance to performance in thought, from gods in nature to gods within, and this shift accompanied a shift in the focus of philosophies as well as methods of Puja. Klaus Witz states that the specific details of pranagnihotra offers an introduction to water rituals and mouth rinsing observed among some Hindus before a meal.Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upaniṣads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 285–287, 313–314 with footnote 222 Heesterman describes the pranagnihotra sacrifice significance to be that the practitioner performs the sacrifice with food without any outside help or reciprocity, and this ritual allows the Hindu to \\"stay in the society while maintaining his independence from it\\", its simplicity thus marks the \\"end station of Vedic ritualism\\".JC Heesterman (1985), The Inner Conflict of Tradition: Essays in Indian Ritual, Kinship, and Society, University of Chicago Press, , pp. 93–94, It urges man, states Heesterman, to \\"emancipate himself from the mundane bonds and to realize the transcendent exclusively by himself and in himself\\".

It may be identical with the see of Marmaritzion, mentioned in a single Notitia Episcopatuum of the 11th century as a suffragan of the Metropolis of Larissa. Following the Fourth Crusade, the episcopal lists of the Roman Catholic Church included it as Valacensis or Lavacensis, but the see probably remained vacant, whether by Greek Orthodox or by Latin Catholic bishops, from the early 13th century on. The see remains a titular bishopric of the Catholic ChurchGCatholic since its nominal restoration in 1933, as \\"Marmarizana\\". It is long vacant, having had a single incumbent of the lowest (episcopal) rank: Thomas O’Beirne (1739.08.26 – 1739.09.16), later Coadjutor Bishop of Ardagh (Ireland) (1739.08.26 – 1739.09.16), succeeding as Bishop of Ardagh (1739.09.16 – 1747.01).

Initially, efforts to effectively liberalise education to reflect the new economic order were hampered by the civil war that raged between 1991 and 1997, and the resulting economic collapse. Tajikistan has since received aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), adopting a number of educational reforms with mixed results. Post-independence In the decade following independence, Tajikistan’s market institutions, economic structures, tax system, and levels of incomes and savings were not adequate for the new market economy (OECD, 2004). This meant that education was “underfunded, inequitable, ineffective, and riddled with continuing tensions”. The erosion of real wages for teachers as a result of civil strife and economic downturn led to a brain-drain of qualified personnel working in public service, and many turned to religious educational institutions instead. However, throughout the 1990s, foreign aid from bilateral donors and development banks flooded into the newly independent Central Asian nations. By the turn of the century, “all segments of the donor community were represented, their agendas set, and contours of educational development clearly discernable”. Reform In 1998, the Tajik government accepted a three-year financial agreement with the IMF’s Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the WB’s Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC). This involved adopting a government restructuring program to respond to increased economic liberalisation and improve public services. By 2004, Tajikistan was developing market infrastructure, appropriate legal institutions and economic management. Because of common Soviet history, Central Asian states shared most of their education policies at independence. Consequently, the post-socialist education reform packages employed by the WB, ADB and other UN organisations in these countries was very similar. The features most directly affected by the new liberal economic strategy were the “decentralization of educational finance and governance”, the “privatization of higher education”, the “reorganization (or “rationalization”) of schools\\" and the “liberalization of textbook publishing”, although many other facets of education were also indirectly affected. In 2013, a joint statement was released by the Tajik representative office of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), claiming that the World Bank would support Tajikistan’s second-generation reforms in education and emphasising the importance of the private sector in driving development, and the need to further improve the investment climate. Ideological basis The economic liberalisation pursued by the WB and IMF resulted in education reform policies emphasising the development of a knowledge economy. It was thought that education should be seen as providing human capital, which underpins this economy. The “benefits of direct business involvement in state schooling”, was advocated too, “both in the interests of emerging private sector edubusiness, and in conforming schooling to business agenda.” Benefits GDP had plummeted in excess of 60% by 1997, after the civil war. One of every five schools in Tajikistan was destroyed and the conflict cost around $7 billion. Furthermore, because of Tajikistan’s economic frailty and the loss of Soviet funding, imports and export markets, the Republic desperately needed capital. Economic liberalisation meant that there was an influx of NGOs and international donor money, including roughly $900 million from the WB in grants and loans since 1996. With donor money, issues in education such as infrastructure, education quality and lack of resources are being addressed. Over the past 15 years, Tajikistan has exhibited growth in its new market economy and begun to drag people out of poverty. As it does so, it becomes more suited to the post-socialist educational model as more people have become able to afford the costs of education. There has also been a reduction of other prohibitive factors such as poor health or poor nutrition that stop people attending school. Drawbacks Money brought into Tajikistan’s education sector by external agencies afforded these agencies influence, and this has often brought them into discord with local authorities and educators. This is highlighted in the selection and production of textbooks. Further, education policies adopted in Central Asia that are part of the “Western reform agenda” have often been “hijacked” by policy-makers and “used for their own purposes nationally”. International organisations have often failed to involve local Tajik education stakeholders in education policy development, claiming that local policymakers lack the skills to make good policy. Because Tajikistan lacks the institutions (e.g. legal and social) necessary to ensure successful relationships between government, NGOs and international donors, the efficiency and effectiveness of NGO-led education programmes is limited. Bahry highlights the need for effective dialogue between local authorities, external donors and important stakeholders. During the Soviet era, education and the “necessities of schooling” (e.g. textbooks, travel) were provided free of charge in Tajikistan. Since independence, and the privatisation of many educational institutions, enrollment and attainment rates have suffered significantly. Many have claimed that the informal costs of education are too high, even in subsidised education, with parents often asked for donations to prop up teacher salaries and maintenance budgets. Some claim that the new democratic society has allowed more people to opt out of sending their kids to school. This has disadvantaged less privileged youngsters. In the Post-Soviet era, the attainment rate gap has widened between men and women, and between those living rurally and in urban settings.

Early years  Edward Brooke Lee was born on October 23, 1892, at the Blair-Lee House in Washington, D.C. His parents were Francis Preston Blair Lee and Anne Clymer (Brooke) Lee. Blair Lee represented Maryland in the U.S. Senate. E. Brooke Lee's great-grandfather, Richard Henry Lee, signed the Declaration of Independence and represented Virginia in the U.S. senate. E. Brooke Lee's great-uncle was Montgomery Blair, who served as postmaster general during Abraham Lincoln's presidency. E. Brooke Lee attended the Pomfret School in Connecticut, and he graduated in 1912. Lee went on to attend Princeton University, but he left in good standing during his sophomore year in 1916 in order to act as his father's legislative assistant in the Senate. Lee then graduated from George Washington University Law School in 1917. On April 13, 1914, Lee married Elizabeth Somerville Wilson, the daughter of Maryland Senator Joseph S. Wilson. They had three children.  Military career  The Silver Spring Armory in 1917, constructed by E. Brooke Lee Lee joined Maryland National Guard F Company, 1st Maryland Infantry of Hyattsville in 1912. Lee and Frank L. Hewitt, another businessman and real estate investor, helped build an armory and organize a new Maryland Guard company, Company K, located in Silver Spring in 1914. (The armory was later remodeled and now houses the Silver Spring Volunteer Fire Department.) Lee advanced through the ranks to first lieutenant. Company K was activated into federal service on June 28, 1916, to Eagle Pass, Texas. Lee commanded Company K and helped General John J. Pershing pursue Mexican revolutionary and bandit Pancho Villa, who had been running border patrols along the Rio Grande River into New Mexico. Company K continued its federal service until June 28, 1916. Lee was promoted to Captain, Infantry, National Guard of Maryland on January 29, 1917. Soon thereafter, the United States entered World War I, and Company K was again mustered into federal service in June 1917. Lee and Company K encamped at Blair Lee's field west of Georgia Avenue and north of Kalmia Road in the District of Columbia. The National Guard unit of 150 men was sent to Camp McClellan, near Anniston, Alabama in August 1917 for a period of ten months of training, emerging as Company K of the 115th Infantry, 29th Division of the American Expeditionary Force. From 1917 to 1918, Lee served in France during World War I as part of the 115th Infantry Regiment, 29th Division, American Expeditionary Forces. While commanding of a raiding party against the Central Powers Balschwiller, France, on the morning of August 31, 1918, Lee led soldiers' advance through the enemy wire. Lee was the last person to leave the opposing forces' trenches, and he carried wounded soldiers back through the counter-barrage. Lee spent the entire day of August 31 in a shell hole in no man's land because he wanted to help all wounded soldiers return to the American line. For this, Lee was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star Citation. Lee received a promotion to the rank of major. He twice received the French Croix de Guerre. Lee also received the Belgian Order of Leopold. In June 1918, Lee was discharged from active duty with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and he was generally considered a war hero. After the war, Lee became chief of staff of the 29th Infantry of the Maryland National Guard.  Political career  In 1919, a group of influential Maryland Democrats approached Lee to encourage him to run for political office in Maryland. Lee was reluctant to jump into state politics so soon after World War I. The group wanted Lee to run for Maryland Comptroller. Lee repeatedly turned them down. The Democratic candidate for Maryland governor, Albert Ritchie, begged Lee to run. Recalling this time in a 1977 interview, Lee said, \\"I had an interesting experience when the transport got into Norfolk harbor or Newport News harbor. They threw the Baltimore Sun on board, and the Baltimore Sun edition that they threw on board said, 'Senator Smith Favors Young Lee for Comptroller.\\" Lee campaigned on the ticket of Governor Albert Ritchie as the 25th Comptroller of the State of Maryland. In 1921, Lee co-founded United Democratic Clubs of Montgomery County, and he served as its treasurer. In 1923, Lee was the Secretary of State of Maryland, and he served in that position for two years. He represented Montgomery County in the Maryland House of Delegates between 1927 and 1930, during which time he also served as the Speaker of the House of Delegates. In 1933, Governor Ritchie appointed Lee to the Committee on Public Works. Lee served as the State Roads Commissioner in 1934.  Development of Montgomery County and Prince George's County  Lee set up the first land-use and zoning system for Montgomery County, Maryland. Lee strongly advocated for using zoning laws to plan suburban growth in the county. In 1916, Lee helped establish the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission to control the development of regional water and sewer systems that were necessary for the county's growth. In the early 1920s, Lee began to purchase large tracts of farming land and founded the North Washington Realty Company to develop those properties as racially restricted suburban communities. These restrictive covenants forbid the purchase or reselling of these properties by people of \\"African descent\\" and remained in effect until 1948 when the Supreme Court in Shelley v. Kraemer ruled they were unenforceable. Lee continued to defend racially restrictive covenants well into the 1960s, claiming that \\"since law-enforced opening of homes and home communities is only aimed at White owned homes and White occupied communities, the law-enforced open housing statutes are Anti-White laws\\" in a letter to the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Advertiser in March, 1967. In December 1926, Lee proposed a tax on certain parts of Montgomery and Prince George's counties in order to pay for street construction, lighting, garbage collection, and ash collection. In January 1927, Lee proposed the creation of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, led by three commissioners appointed by the governor. The Commission would be funded by taxes on residents in Montgomery and Prince George's counties.  Farming and cattle-raising  E. Brooke Lee Old Gartrell Farm Polled Hereford Calf Lee spent the last 30 years of his life at the Old Gartrell Farm, located on Sweepstakes Road in Damascus.

Although mosasaurs went extinct millions of years before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with mosasaur fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a mythological lens. Myths about warfare between serpentine water monsters and aerial thunderbirds told by the Native Americans of the modern western United States may have been influenced by observations of mosasaur fossils and their co-occurrence with creatures like Pteranodon and Hesperornis. The scientific study of mosasaurs began in the late 18th century with the serendipitous discovery of a large fossilized skeleton in a limestone mine near Maastricht in the Netherlands. The fossils were studied by local scholar Adriaan Gilles Camper, who noted a resemblance to modern monitor lizards in correspondence with renowned French anatomist Georges Cuvier. Nevertheless, the animal was not scientifically described until the English Reverend William Daniel Conybeare named it Mosasaurus, after the river Meuse located near the site of its discovery. By this time the first mosasaur fossils from the United States were discovered by the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the first remains in the country to be scientifically described were reported slightly later from New Jersey. This was followed by an avalanche of discoveries by the feuding Bone War paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh in the Smoky Hill Chalk of Kansas. By the end of the century a specimen of Tylosaurus would be found that preserved its scaley skin. Later Samuel Wendell Williston mistook fossilized tracheal rings for the remains of a fringe of skin running down the animal's back, which subsequently became a common inaccuracy in artistic restorations. The 20th century soon saw the discovery in Alabama of a strange mosasaur called Globidens, with rounded teeth suited to crushing shells. Mosasaur remains were also discovered in Africa and California. In 1967 Dale Russell published a scientific monograph dedicated to mosasaurs. Embryonic remains in the 1990s confirmed that mosasaurs gave live birth like in ichthyosaurs. The 1990s also saw a revival and escalation of a debate regarding whether or not some supposed mosasaur toothmarks in ammonoid shells were actually made by limpets. By the end of the century, the evolutionary relationship between mosasaurs and snakes as well as the possible involvement of mosasaurs in the extinction of the aforementioned ichthyosaurs became hot button controversies. The debates regarding snakes, toothmarks, and ichthyosaurs spilled over into the early 21st century. These discussions were also accompanied by the discovery of many new taxa, including new species of Globidens, Mosasaurus, and Tylosaurus as well as entirely new genera like Yaguarasaurus and Tethysaurus. In 2013, Lindgren, Kaddumi, and Polcyn reported the discovery of a Prognathodon specimen from Jordan that preserved the soft tissues of its scaley skin, flippers and tail. Significantly, the tail resembled those of modern carcharinid sharks, although the bottom lobe of the tail fin was longest in the mosasaur whereas shark tails have longer upper lobes. Prescientific A 19th century restoration of the life of the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway depicting a mosasaur attacking a Pteranodon. The basking behavior of the other marine reptiles is inaccurate as neither mosasaurs nor plesiosaurs were capable of leaving the water. * One legend told among the Delaware Indians describes the discovery of a fragment of bone left by a monster that had once been killing people near modern Philadelphia in either Pennsylvania or eastern New Jersey. When the hunting party brought the piece of bone back to the village, a wise man encouraged them to set out and find more of the monsters remains. He said that smoking fragments of the bone with tobacco in a small clay spoon could grant wishes like good health for one's children, longevity, or successful hunting. Fossils of the mosasaur Tylosaurus have been found in the area, but dinosaurs and Cretaceous crocodiles are also possible sources. This legend likely predates European contact and may have originated prior to 1500. The bones being burnt in the \\"clay spoon\\" is a reference to a primitive kind of clay pipe that the local people had abandoned in favor of a design with a deeper bowl by the 17th century. The general lack of any sign of influence by European culture on the tale is also suggestive of its great antiquity. * The Cheyenne people of Nebraska believed in mythical thunderbirds and water monsters that were in endless conflict with each other. The thunderbirds were said to resemble giant eagles and killed both people and animals with arrows made of lightning. The fossils of the Niobrara Chalk may have been influential on these stories. The pterosaur Pteranodon and marine reptiles like mosasaurs are preserved in Niobrara Chalk deposits and associated remains may have been interpreted as evidence for antagonism between immense flying animals and serpentine aquatic reptiles. Observations of similar fossils in the past may have been seen as further evidence for thunderbird-water monster conflict. The Cheyenne believe that there were many different kinds of water monsters that lived not only in lakes, rivers, and springs but also high bluffs and hills. The locations given as water monster habitat are similar to the locations where local marine fossils can be found as fossils often erode out of hillsides or stream banks. The Cheyennes feared the water monsters, because they could be dangerous predators or capsize their canoes. Even in modern times, tradition-minded Cheyenne sometimes take pains to avoid sleeping too close to springs due to fears of water monsters. * The Crow people also believed in water monsters. These were said to be alligator- like creatures living in the Little Bighorn, Rosebud, and Tongue Rivers. These myths may have been based on discoveries of marine reptile fossils such as mosasaurs and crocodilians eroding out of the river banks. The Crow also believe there were similar alligator-like monsters in the Missouri River. These were called Bulukse'e or Buruksam Wurukce, names meaning \\"large meat- eater\\" but commonly translated as \\"giant lizard or alligator\\". * When the Sioux people lived around the Great Lakes, they imagined their mythical Water Monster Unktehi as a large aquatic buffalo-like mammal. This image was likely derived from early observations of large Pleistocene mammal fossils such as mammoths and mastodons eroding out of the banks of local lakes and rivers. As some groups of Sioux began moving west into the regions that includes Montana their depictions of Unktehi tended to converge on the characteristics of local fossils. Although Unktehi continued to be described as horned, it gradually became imagined as reptilian rather than the mammalian portrayals of the Sioux in the Great Lakes region, like the dinosaurs and mosasaurs of the region's Mesozoic rock. Unktehi was described as a snakelike monster equipped with feet, like the elongate sinuous mosasaurs who had four short limbs. Its back was described as ridged and saw-like, a configuration similar to the appearance of a fossil vertebral column eroding from rock. 18th century Illustration of the type specimen of Mosasaurus 1760s 1764 *The first documented mosasaurid skull is found in the chalk quarries of the St Pietersberg near Maastricht, the Netherlands.Mulder, E.W.A., 2004, \\"Maastricht Cretaceous finds and Dutch pioneers in vertebrate palaeontology\\". In: Touret, J.L.R. & Visser, R.P.W. (eds). Dutch pioneers of the earth sciences, pp. 165-176. Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Amsterdam. 1766 *The skull was acquired by lieutenant Jean Baptiste Drouin. 1770s 1772 * Around 1772, limestone miners discovered a second skull of a bizarre animal deep underground near Maastricht. The owner of the land containing the mine, canon Theodorus Joannes Godding, displayed it in his country house. Army surgeon John Leonard Hoffman observed the fossil, corresponding with various naturalists about it.Rompen, P. 1995. Mosasaurus hoffmanni: De lotgevallen van een type-exemplaar. Thesis, University of Maastricht 1780s 1784 * Drouin sold the first St Pietersberg mosasaur skull to the Teylers Museum at Haarlem where it is still curated today under the catalogue number TM 7424. 1790s Silhouette of Adriaan Gilles Camper 1795 * The French revolutionary army took over both Maastricht and Goddin's astonishing fossil. The French misplaced the fossil for a period, before rediscovering it and sending it to Paris for further study. 1798 * Adriaan Gilles Camper recognized that the unusual animal resembled a giant monitor lizard, and wrote to Georges Cuvier in Paris stating such. 1799 * Camper continued his correspondence with Cuvier and reiterated his opinion that the remains from Maastricht belong to a giant monitor lizard. 19th century Meriwether Lewis (left) and William Clark (right) 1800s 1804 September 10th * The Lewis and Clark expedition reportedly found the skeleton of a gigantic snake in an island on the Missouri River in territory now belonging to the state of South Dakota. These remains actually probably belong to a mosasaur, possibly Mosasaurus missouriensis. Some of the bones were sent back to Washington, D.C.. 1810s 1818 * Mitchell reported the discovery of mosasaur fossils in the Navesink Formation of New Jersey. These were the first North American mosasaur remains to be documented in the scientific literature. 1820s William Conybeare 1820 * Samuel von Sömmerring described the new species Lacerta gigantea for fossils discovered in a Bavarian iron mine, mistakenly believing them to be additional remains of the same kind of animal that was discovered in Maastricht. These remains belonged to an animal that was actually more closely related to modern crocodiles and is now known as Geosaurus. 1822 * Reverend William Daniel Conybeare formally named the animal from Maastricht Mosasaurus after a river located near the discovery site. 1829 * Major Benjamin O'Fallon discovered a mosasaur in what is now South Dakota, near the Great Bend of the Missouri River. He brought it home to St. Louis and later sold it to Prince Maximilian of Wied. * Gideon Mantell applied the species epithet \\"hoffmanni\\" to the Mosasaurus type species. 1830s Skull of Mosasaurus missouriensis 1830 * Richard Harlan came into possession of the snout of O'Fallon's mosasaur, but mistook it for an ichthyosaur and described it at Ichthyosaurus missouriensis. 1839 * \\"Ichthyosaurus\\" missouriensis was \\"officially\\" reclassified as Mosasaurus missouriensis. 1840s 1845 * August Goldfuss described the new species Mosasaurus maximiliani for the mosasaur, naming it after the Prince. 1850s The Mosasaurus from the Crystal Palace 1850 * Robert Gibbes reported the presence of teeth and vertebrae now recognized as mosasaurian in origin from a limestone deposit in Alabama. 1853 * Paul Gervaius creates the family Mosasauridae. Originally included genera are Mosasaurus, Liodon, Onchosaurus (later recognised as a batoid fish), Oplosaurus (later recognised as a sauropod dinosaur), Macrosaurus (a historical wastebasket taxon) and Geosaurus (later recognised as a thalattosuchian). 1860s 19th century life restoration of Tylosaurus 1868 * Edward Drinker Cope described a variety of new mosasaur taxa from Kansas, including species in the genera Clidastes, Liodon, Mosasaurus, and Platecarpus. 1869 * Cope described the species Macrosaurus proriger. This was the first mosasaur to be reported from Kansas. * Cope erected the new order Pythonomorpha in which to classify the mosasaurs because of shared traits with modern snakes. He also described the new species Clidastes propython from Alabama. * Othniel Charles Marsh described the species Halisaurus platyspondylus. 1870s Photograph of O. C. Marsh's 1872 field crew 1870 * Marsh led an expedition into Kansas on behalf of Yale University. November * Marsh's crew discovered the first mosasaur specimen to preserve its hindlimbs in Kansas. 1871 * Marsh published a preliminary report about his fossil discoveries in Kansas. * Betts published the first mention of a nearly complete Clidastes specimen discovered by Marsh's crew in Kansas. * Marsh described his Kansan mosasaur discoveries in more detail, including the aforementioned Clidastes. 1872 * Marsh erroneously reported the presence of \\"dermal scutes\\" in mosasaurs. * Marsh renamed Macrosaurus proriger Rhinosaurus proriger. * Marsh renamed Rhinosaurus proriger Tylosaurus proriger. Fossil skin impression of Tylosaurus 1874 * Cope described the new species Clidastes planifrons and Tylosaurus nepaeolicus. 1878 * Francis H. Snow reported the first skin impressions of any mosasaur preserved with the Kansan Tylosaurus specimen KUVP 1075. The impressions revealed the presence and shape of its keeled, diamond-shaped scales. 1880s Skull of Hainosaurus bernardi 1885 * Louis Dollo described the new species Hainosaurus bernardi. 1889 * Dollo described the genus Phosphorosaurus. 1890s Skull of Platecarpus coryphaeus prominently exhibiting the sclerotic ring in its eye 1891 * Samuel Wendell Williston found that the supposed dermal scutes reported in mosasaurs by Marsh were actually sclerotic ring bones. 1892 * Georg Baur published a paper on mosasaurs. 1894 * John C. Merriam described the new species Platecarpus clidastoides. 1895 * Between 1880 and this date as many as 52 partial-to-complete Mosasaurus skeletons were found in the Ciply Phosphatic Chalk near Ciply, Belgium. Portrait of Samuel Wendell Williston Life restoration of Tylosaurus proriger 1897 * Williston published notable early observations on mosasaur biostratigraphy. He reported the first known mosasaur fossils from the Pteranodon beds and the apparent absence of Clidastes from the Rudistes beds of the lower chalk. 1898 * Williston published a review of paleontology's understanding of mosasaurs. He bemoaned the taxonomic confusion caused by Cope and Marsh because their Bone War race for the honor of naming as many species as possible produced a large number of spurious taxa. Williston considered as many as four out of five named mosasaur species named at the time to be completely worthless. He noted that some of the differences used by Cope and Marsh to distinguish their putative mosasaur species resulted from distortion by geologic forces rather than biological variation. One notable taxonomic revision Williston made in this publication was his referral of Cope's 1874 species \\"Clidastes\\" planifrons to the genus Platecarpus. Williston also discussed mosasaur life appearance and behavior. He compared mosasaur scales to those of monitor lizards and misinterpreted some fossilized cartilage as evidence for a fringe of soft tissue down mosasaurs' backs. He hypothesized that mosasaurs left the safety of the water to lay eggs on land. The paleobiology of individual mosasaur taxa also received Williston's attention. He thought the genus Clidastes as an inhabitant of near-surface waters. In contrast, Williston interpreted Platecarpus as a \\"deep diver\\" and thought Tylosaurus fed primarily on other marine reptiles. He also elaborated on his earlier research into mosasaur biostratigraphy. He observed that Tylosaurus ranged throughout the Smoky Hill Chalk but went extinct around the time the Fort Pierre Shale was deposited. Platecarpus was also only known from the Niobrara Formation. Clidastes was only known from the upper Niobrara. * Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized fossilized cartilage in a Tylosaurus specimen as the remains of tracheal rings. * Williston first reported the mosasaur specimen now catalogued as KUVP 1001 and classified in the species Platecarpus tympaniticus to the scientific literature. 1899 * Osborn reported the first evidence for a bend in the mosasaur tail in Tylosaurus proriger. 20th century Outdated life restoration of Mosasaurus with a dorsal fringe Skeletal mount of Plioplatecarpus 1900s 1902 * Williston publicly acknowledged that the supposed fringe running down the back of a mosasaur he had reported was actually misidentified tracheal rings. 1904 * Dollo reported the presence of the remains of a large turtle preserved in the stomach of Hainosaurus. 1905 * Fossil hunters Dennis Halvorson and Mike Hanson discovered the largest known specimen of Plioplatecarpus in the Pierre Shale of North Dakota. The skeleton was about 70% complete. 1907 * The excavation of the North Dakota Plioplatecarpus specimen concluded. 1910s The \\"Bunker\\" Tylosaurus skeleton Jaw and teeth of Globidens Life restoration of Clidastes 1911 * The \\"Bunker\\" Tylosaurus specimen was discovered in Kansas. At almost 45 feet in length it was one of the largest specimens ever classified in the genus and is the largest mosasaur skeleton in the United States to have been mounted for a museum exhibit, which is on display at the University of Kansas museum. 1912 * Charles Whitney Gilmore described the new genus and species Globidens alabamaensis. This unusual mosasaur had rounded teeth specialized for cracking shell and probably fed on the abundant ammonites of the Cretaceous seas. * Robert Broom described a new Tylosaurus species, T. capensis from Pondoland, South Africa. 1914 * Williston interpreted the mosasaur Clidastes as inhabiting the waters near the surface of its marine home. 1917 * Charles Sternberg discovered a skeleton left behind by a 25 foot long Tylosaurus in Kansas with preserved skin. He observed that the skin was \\"covered with small, overlapping scales\\". 1918 * Charles and Levi Sternberg excavated a Platecarpus and a Clidastes sternbergii specimen in Kansas, which were sold to the Paleontological Museum in Uppsala, Sweden. * A Tylosaurus specimen was discovered in Logan County, Kansas. 1920s 1920 * Carl Wiman described the new species Clidastes sternbergii. He noticed evidence for tail bends in the species Halisaurus sternbergi and Platecarpus tympaniticus. He compared them to the tail bend in ichthyosaurs that support their tail flukes. In one figure, he restored the mosasaur's tail with an upper lobe like ichthyosaurs have. This prescient observation would be confirmed in the early 21st century. 1922 * Sternberg reported the remains of a young polycotylid plesiosaur preserved in the remains of the 1918 Logan County Tylosaurus specimen. 1930s Life restoration of Goronyosaurus 1930 * W. E. Swinton described the new species Mosasaurus nigeriensis from Nigeria. 1935 * Otto Zdansky reported that eight species of mosasaurs had been discovered in Egypt and ten species were known from Africa overall. 1937 * A high school student named Allan Bennison discovered the future type specimen of Plotosaurus bennisoni in Moreno Formation rocks of the San Joaquin Valley in California. * Another major mosasaur discovery occurred in California when a rancher named Frank Paiva and a Fresno State College professor named William M. Tucker discovered the future type specimen of Plotosaurus tuckeri. 1939 * Robert Leard discovered the future type specimen of Plesiotylosaurus crassidens in Moreno Formation rocks of the Panoche Hills in California. 1940s Life restoration of Plotosaurus 1942 * Charles Camp described the new genera Kolposaurus and Plesiotylosaurus, although the genus Kolposaurus had already been used for a different kind of animal and Camp would later rename the mosasaur Plotosaurus. Along with describing the genus itself, Camp named two \\"Kolposaurus\\", \\"K.\\" bennisoni and \\"K.\\" tuckeri. At least one specimen of these species was found to have fish preserved in its stomach. Camp observed that Plotosaurus was a very evolutionarily advanced mosasaur with an especially stiff torso and powerful tail. Plesiotylosaurus Camp found to be very similar to the original Tylosaurus. * George Gaylord Simpson reported that the possible mosasaur fossils discovered by the Lewis and Clark expedition had been lost. 1945 * Rainer Zangerl of the Chicago Field Museum led an expedition to collect fossils from the Selma Formation of Alabama and acquired several mosasaur specimens. 1950s 1951 * Camp renamed the mosasaur genus Kolposaurus to Plotosaurus because the former name had been used previously for a nothosaur. 1960s Fossil shell of the ammonoid Placenticeras, showing putative mosasaur toothmarks 1960 * Erle Kauffman and Robert Kesling reported a fossil ammonite of the genus Placenticeras exhibiting damage they interpreted as tooth marks from a mosasaur, probably a platecarpine. 1963 * George Sternberg discovered a mostly complete mosasaur specimen with skin impressions near WaKeeney, Kansas. The specimen is now recognized as the best preserved specimen of the genus Ectenosaurus. 1967 * Dale Russell published a monograph on American mosasaurs. This monograph contained significant taxonomic revisions for the family. Among these were his conclusion that Platecarpus coryphaeus and Platecarpus ictericus were likely junior synonyms of P. tympaniticus while P. planfirons was too poorly preserved to be classified confidently at all. Russell also dismissed the species Tylosaurus dyspelor described by Cope as a dubious probable-synonym of Tylosaurus proriger. Russell also published additional information and speculation on mosasaur biostratigraphy. He reported the presence of mosasaur vertebrae up to 90 million years old among the Turonian fossils curated by the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Another of this work's significant contributions to mosasaur biostratigraphy concerned the mosasaurs of the Smoky Hill Chalk. Russell devised two biostratigraphic zones based on the Chalk's mosasaur fossils. The lower zone was characterized by Clidastes liodontus, Platecarpus coryphaeus, and Tylosaurus nepaeolicus. The upper was home to Clidastes, Platecarpus ictericus, and Tylosaurus proriger. He regarded Platecarpus and Tylosaurus as deep water animals but concluded that the biostratigraphic evidence from the Smoky Hill mosasaurs suggested that the Chalk's depositional environment was becoming shallower and nearer to the ancient coastline over time. Russell also argued that by the end of the Late Cretaceous, mosasaurs were converging on the body plan that characterized the first ichthyosaurs during the Triassic period and gradually replacing these older marine reptiles. 1969 * A University of Florence team embarked on a fossil hunting expedition to Nigeria. This expedition would discover a large quantity of mosasaur fossils in the Dukamaje Formation. 1970s Holotype jaws and teeth of the species Globidens alabamaensis from the Selma Group of Alabama 1970 * Russell published a paper on the mosasaurs of the Selma Formation, including those collected by the Zangerl expedition in 1945. The paper contained several taxonomic advances including the description of the new species Tylosaurus zangerli and the reclassification of \\"Clidastes\\" sternbergii in the genus Halisaurus. Russell considered the Mosasaurus species M. lemonnieri and M. conodon to be synonyms. Overall he concluded that the known mosasaurs of the Selma Formation were Clidastes propython, Halisaurus sternbergi, Globidens alabamaensis, Platecarpus, Prognathodon, and T. zangerli. He noted that the biostratigraphic distribution of mosasaurs in the Selma Formation were different than the mosasaurs of the Smoky Hill Chalk. * The University of Florence team continued searching for mosasaur fossils in Nigeria. 1972 * Azzaroli and others erected the new genus Goronyosaurus for the species \\"Mosasaurus\\" nigeriensis. 1975 * Russell claimed that unlike all other mosasaurs, Globidens dakotensis didn't have teeth on its pterygoid, although this claim has been subsequently dismissed. 1977 * Martin and Stewart argued that some fossils discovered in Cenomanian rocks in Kansas represented the oldest known mosasaur fossils. 1980s 1980 * Joan Wiffen described the new genus Moanasaurus. 1982 * Sankar Chatterjee and Zinsmeister reported the discovery of mosasaur fossils from islands off the coast of Antarctica. 1985 * Suzuki described the new species Mosasaurus hobetsuensis. 1986 Skull of Platecarpus * Bell and SHeldon reported the discovery of subadult mosasaur fossils. 1987 * Judy Massare studied the anatomy of mosasaur teeth and its implication for their diet. She argued that the \\"slender\\", recurved teeth of Platecarpus were adapted to feeding on relatively small, soft prey like squid. * James Martin and Phillip Bork reported the fossilized stomach contents of a Tylosaurus proriger skeleton discovered in South Dakota: a bony fish in the genus Bananogmius, Hesperornis, a lamnid shark, and Clidastes. Fossils of Ectenosaurus * Rothschild and Martin looked for evidence that mosasaurs suffered from the bends as a result of their diving and ascent activities. Avascular necrosis resulting from the bends was completely absent in fossils of the genus Clidastes, suggesting that it preferred to stay near the surface. In contrast, Rothschild and Martin observed avascular necrosis in nearly every specimen of Platecarpus and Tylosaurus that they surveyed. The presence and ubiquity of the avascular necrosis is consistent with the idea that these were deep diving animals. * Russell described the new genus Ectenosaurus for the species \\"Platecarpus\\" clidastoides. Type specimen of Selmasaurus russelli 1988 * Kenneth Wright and Samuel Shannon described the new genus and species Selmasaurus russelli from the Mooreville Chalk near Selma, Alabama. * Lingham- Soliar reexamined Goronyosaurus from Nigeria. * Betsy Nicholls described a new species of Hainosaurus, H. pembinensis, from a Pembina Mining Company mine in the Pierre Shale of Manitoba, Canada. * Massare concluded that mosasaurs were slow swimmers that had to hunt by ambushing prey rather than chasing it down directly. * Stewart disputed Russell's 1967 mosasaur-based biostragraphic scheme for the Smoky Hill Chalk because he had observed fossils preserved outside of their purported \\"zones\\". 1989 * Martin and Rothschild interpreted Clidastes as an inhabitant of shallow waters, while Tylosaurus may have been the Cretaceous paleoecological equivalent to a sperm whale, diving deep in the Western Interior Seaway to hunt the giant squid that lived there. * Russell suggested that mosasaurs may have reproduced by laying eggs on remote island beaches. 1990s Life restoration of Eonatator 1990 * Wiffen described the new genus Rikkisaurus. * Michael Everhart discovered two Platecarpus skulls that had been \\"co-mingled and partially digested\\". * Stewart used a recently proposed biostratigraphic scheme for the Smoky Hill Chalk to propose stratigraphic ranges for its mosasaur taxa. Life restoration of Opetiosaurus. 1991 * Lingham-Soliar rejectd the idea that \\"Halisaurus\\" sternbergi belonged to the genus. However, he thought that the genus Phosphorosaurus should be sunk in that genus. He also dismissed the supposed Mosasaurus species M. nigeriensis as a chimera of multiple mosasaur species. * Lingham-Soliar attempted to reconstruct how mosasaurs swam by studying their vertebral column. He found that the front part of column was stiffened and only the rear portion flexed during swimming. This more similar to the way a modern Alligator swims rather than snakes, which many previous researchers had put forth as mosasaur analogs. 1992 * Robert Carroll and Michael DeBraga published a discussion about aigialosaurs and their evolutionary affinities. They noted that aigialosaur skulls are virtually indistinguishable from those of primitive mosasaurs. However they found the vertebrae in their back and their limb bones to more closely resemble those belonging to the precursors of living monitor lizards. * Lingham-Soliar regarded the question of how the Hainosaurus reported in 1904 by Dollo to contain a turtle in its stomach could have swallowed a prey item of that size as mysterious. * Lingham-Soliar hypothesized that Plioplatecarpus marshi \\"flew\\" underwater primarily using its powerful fore-flippers rather than using its tail like other mosasaurs due to P. marshi's well-developed shoulder region. He argued that this unusual style of swimming increased its maneuverability, allowing this species to flourish in shallow habitats. * Nathalie Bardet published a discussion of the possible causes for the extinction of the ichthyosaurs. She expressed doubt that ichthyosaurs were replaced by mosasaurs because they would not be in direct competition with each other. Instead she posited a connection to an extinction event that affected cephalopods at the boundary between the Cenomanian and Turonian ages. She proposed that the disappearance of these many cephalopod species may have deprived ichthyosaurs of their food source and caused their extinction. Skull of Prognathodon currii 1993 * According to Russell, by this time at least 1,823 mosasaur specimens had been recovered from the Niobrara Chalk of Kansas alone. * Phosphate diggers in the Negev Desert of Israel discovered the remains of a 40-foot mosasaur that was sent to Copenhagen, Denmark for preparation. This mosasaur was nicknamed \\"Oronosaurus\\" after the phosphate field in which it was discovered, but would be formally named as a new species of Prognathodon, P. currii, in 2002. * Lingham-Soliar re-examined the mosasaur genus Leidon. * Schumacher published additional research on mosasaur biostratigraphy based on Stewart's 1990 paper. 1994 Life restoration of Plioplatecarpus * Lingham-Soliar published a review of Turonian mosasaur fossils that were discovered in Angola. Commenting on the evolutionary origins of the mosasaurs, he remarked that while aigialosaurs had the correct anatomy to be the ancestors of the mosasaurs they were only known from rocks of the same age as the mosasaurs themselves. Until the presence of aigialosaurs earlier in the Cretaceous could be confirmed, Lingham-Soliar noted that there would be room to doubt this hypothesized connection even if it seemed plausible. *Stewart and Bell argued that the supposed oldest known mosasaur fossils reported by Martin and Stewart from Kansas were not even the remains of mosasaurs. Instead, they attributed the fossils to several kinds of ichthyodectiform fishes. * Judy Massare observed that mosasaurs exhibited adaptations for rapid acceleration and probably employed this capability as ambush hunters. * Lingham-Soliar reported the presence of abundant mosasaur remains in Angola and Zaire and observed that Africa was a hotspot of mosasaur discoveries on the same scale as western North America and the Netherlands- Belgium region. He identified four species from Zaire: Halisaurus, Mosasaurus, Plioplatecarpus, and Prognathodon. He also synonymized Angolasaurus with Platecarpus. He considered this genus to be the most widespread of any mosasaur. He interpreted Plioplatecarpus as a snake-like ratchet feeder that \\"walked\\" its jaws across large prey to swallow it. He also hypothesized that it swam using its flippers rather than relying on its tail fin. * Nicholls and Godfrey rejected Lingham-Soliar's reinterpretation of Plioplatecarpus marshi locomotion as underwater flight because there was no reason to believe that its tail was a less developed or effective means of propulsion than those of other mosasaurs. They suggested that its powerful shoulder region was actually an adaptation for shaking prey, like some modern shark species do. * Massare argued that mosasaurs were cold blooded, like their relatives the monitor lizards. January * Patrick Antuzzi discovered a mosasaur skull in the Chico Formation of California. The specimen is now catalogued as SC-VR59 and may have belonged to a species of Clidastes resembling members of this genus previously from New Zealand. 1995 * Theagarten Lingham-Soliar published the first truly thorough description of Mosasaurus hoffmani. He interpreted its preferred habitat as biodiverse coastal waters of depths from 40–50 m. In this paper he also argued that mosasaurs went extinct rapidly. * Gordon Bell and Martin reported a Mosasaurus conodon skull fossil bearing bite marks apparently inflicted by another M. conodon. * Michael Everhart discovered a series of five large mosasaur vertebrae with two Cretoxyrhina teeth embedded in it. He found evidence the bone material had been partially dissolved where it had not been exposed to the elements. This implies that these vertebrae had been partially digested before fossilization by the shark that fed upon it. The shark probably only scavenged the specimen, but Everhart could not rule out predation. * Pete Bussen discovered a specimen of Globidens in the Pierre Shale of Kansas. This was the first specimen of the genus to be documented in Kansas. Life restoration of the shark Squalicorax. Squalicorax teeth are often associated with mosasaur fossils 1996 * Gordon Bell reported the discovery of a specimen of Plioplatecarpus primaevus accompanied by two embryos of the same species. Both the remains of mother and young were accompanied more than two thousand of teeth shed by shark of the genus Squalicorax. These sharks probably only scavenged the mosasaurs and were likely responsible for the disarticulated state of the skeletons. This discovery proved that mosasaurs gave live birth. * Sheldon published additional research on mosasaur biostratigraphy based on Stewart's 1990 paper. One notable find was a P. planifrons fossil in the upper Smoky Hill Chalk, the uppermost known remains of this species. * Cowen disagreed with Lingham-Soliar's claim that Plioplatecarpus marshi was an underwater flyer and suggested that P. marshi's unusual traits were actually specializations for swimming near the surface of the water column by overcoming Carrier's constraint. * A man named Steve Johnson discovered a complete Platecarpus planifrons skull. * Schumacher and Varner observed more evidence for tail bends in the genera Clidastes, Platecarpus, and Tylosaurus. September * Michael and Pam Everhart excavated the skull and neck of a mosasaur in Kansas. Life restoration of the shark Cretoxyrhina. Cretoxyrhina teeth are often associated with mosasaur fossils. Fossils of the snake Pachyrhachis 1997 * Gordon Bell favorably assessed the mosasaur fossil record, finding its documentation of their evolutionary history nearly as complete as the fossil record of horses. * Bell published a detailed review of mosasaur biostratigraphy. * In contrast to Williston and Martin and Rothschild, Amy Sheldon interpreted Clidastes as a deep water diver because its bones were less dense than those of other mosasaurs, lending it neutral buoyancy during descents. Meanwhile, she argued that Platecarpus preferred shallower waters. * Michael Lee argued that mosasaurs and snakes were sister groups. * Caldwell and Lee argued that the new snake genus and species Pachyrhachis problematicus was more evidence for a close evolutionary affinity between mosasaurs and snakes. * Tom Caggiano discovered a partial jaw once belonging to a young mosasaur in Kansas. This specimen had been partially digested, possibly by the shark Cretoxyrhina mantelli. * Shimada reported evidence that mosasaurs were fed upon by sharks, although this may have been scavenging rather than active predation. * Richard P. Hilton and Antuzzi reported the possible Clidastes skull SC-VR59 from California to the scientific literature. Life restoration of Prognathodon saturator Fossil shell of the ammonoid Placenticeras, showing putative mosasaur toothmarks 1998 *Fossils of a mosasaur related to Tylosaurus were discovered on Vega Island, Antarctica. * Bardet and others reported the discovery of a partial Plioplatecarpus marshi near Liege, Belgium with a tail vertebra bearing grooves apparently inflicted by the shark Centrophorodes appendiculatus, which scavenged the mosasaurs remains before burial. * Ruud Dortangs discovered the skeleton of a new species of Prognathodon, P. saturator, in a Maastricht cement quarry. * Lingham-Soliar reported evidence of damage to the skull and braincase of an immature Mosasaurus hoffmanni. He observed that the area of trauma was similar in size and shape to the bony prow at the tip of the snout of a Hainosaurus. Lingham-Soliar believed that the larger Hainosaurus rammed the young Moasaurus to death with this snout prow. * Peter Ward argued that the supposed toothmarks on a Placenticeras shell described in 1960 by Kauffman and Kesling were actually limpet boreholes. He described how a graduate student named Erica Roux was unable replicate tooth-shaped punctures in the shells of modern Nautilus with a mechanical \\"jaw\\" because the shells were too brittle. * Kase and others also attributed the rounded indentations and puncture marks to limpets rather than mosasaurs. * Seilacher provided a third voice in favor of the limpet interpretation of punctured ammonite shells. * Bell and VonLoh reported the discovery of mosasauroids from the Boquillas Formation of Texas and the Greenhorn Formation of South Dakota. * Lingham- Soliar reported the discovery of a mosasaur called Pluridens walkeri from Africa with unusually long, toothy jaws. August 8th * An additional nearly complete skeleton of Mosasaurus hoffmani was discovered in the St. Pietersburg quarry of Masstricht and excavated by crews under the auspices of the Dutch Geological Society and Natural History Museum of Maastricht. Jaw and teeth of Carinodens 1999 * Holmes Caldwell and Cumbaa rejected the idea that Plioplatecarpus swam using its flippers to \\"fly\\" underwater. They noted however, that a specimen of the genus from Scabby Butte, Alberta, Canada seems to have been preserved in a relatively inland and freshwater environmental context, possibly an estuary. * Lingham-Soliar regarded Goronyosaurus as the most derived mosasaurid. He also speculated on the ecological conditions that allowed the mosasaurs to achieve dominance of the ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Lingham-Soliar observed that the evolution of swifter swimming fishes in the mid-Cretaceous would have challenged predators that actively chased them while yielding a competitive advantage to sneakier ambush hunters. He thought these conditions gave an advantage to mosasaurs and plesiosaurs over the ichthyosaurs and led to the latter group's extinction. * Lingham Soliar reconstructed the heterodont dentition of Carinodens. Teeth near the tip of the jaw were pointed, teeth near the rear were roughly rectangular and triangular teeth could be found between them. * Everhart reported physical evidence of shark bite in the mosasaur genera Clidastes, Platecarpus, and Tylosaurus. * Lingham-Soliar argued that the disappearance of the mosasaurs at their peak of size and diversity was evidence that the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous was a rapid event. * Lee and others argued that snakes were the descendants of mosasaurs. * Lee, Bell, and Caldwell argued that mosasaurs were the closest relatives of snakes among the traditional lizards. * Polcyn, Tchernov, and Jacobs described the new genus and species Haasia gittelmani. * Sakurai and Shibuya described the new species Mosasaurus prismaticus. * Kass described the species Prognathodon stadtmani. 21st century Life restoration of Halisaurus 2000s 2000 * Holmes and Sues argued that Phosphorosaurus was distinct from Halisaurus after all. * Lingham- Soliar disagreed with Russell's 1970 synonymization of Mosasaurus lemmonnieri and M. conodon. * Tchernov and others dismissed the snakes Haasiophis and Pachyrhachis, which had been previously put forward as evidence that snakes were close relatives of mosasaurs, as red herrings that were irrelevant to understanding the origin of snakes or any potential evolutionary ties linking them to mosasaurs. * Case and others published more research on mosasaurs from islands off the coast of Antarctica. * Páramo-Fonseca described the new genus and species Yaguarasaurus columbianus. Carsosaurus fossils 2001 * Caldwell and Lee reported the discovery of a pregnant aigialosaur specimen of the genus Carsosaurus containing four large embryos inside her. The embryos were oriented ready to be born tail-first, an adaptation seen in modern whales and in other extinct marine reptiles that helps prevent drowning during birth. * Tsujita and Westermann defended the idea of punctured ammonite shells as mosasaur prey in a contrarian position to the several 1998 papers that doubted this hypothesis. Based on a survey of Placenticeras shells from the Bearpaw Formation of Alberta, they concluded that the arrangements of the holes were too similar to the placement of teeth in a mosasaur's jaw to be the chance result of limpet activity. Their doubts were bolstered by the disparity of abundance in the relevant rocks between the scarce limpet shells and the frequent occurrence of the holes themselves. According to Tsujita and Westermann, the previous attempts to test the effect of a mosasaur bite on a shell experimentally with a simulated jaw assumed an overly simplistic interpretation of mosasaur feeding behavior, so its failure to replicate the shell punctures still did not discredit their putative mosasaurian origins. * Bardet and Superbiola restudied the Halisaurus remains first discovered in Kansas in 1918 and classified as Halisaurus by Russell in 1970. They found it to be both the oldest specimen referred to that genus and the most primitive member of the entire Mosasauridae. * Everhart serendipitously rediscovered Sternberg's report of a Tylosaurus with polycotylid stomach contents. Mounted skull of Kourisodon Skull of Prognathodon currii 2002 * Michael Everhart observed that young mosasaur fossils are actually fairly common in the Niobrara Chalk. * Caitlin Kiernan observed that different kinds of mosasaurs were found at different stratigraphic levels within the Eutaw Formation and Selma Group of Alabama. She described three biostratigraphic zones within this interval based on their mosasaur content: the Tylosaurus acme zone, the Clidastes zone, and the Mosasaurus acme zone. The Tylosaurus zone was deposited in shallow water, while Clidastes seems to have inhabited greater depths. * Bardet and Tonoglu reported the discovery of Mosasaurus hoffmanni jaw fossils in Kastamonu, Turkey. * Novas and others described the new species Lakumasaurus antarcticus. * Dortangs and others described the new species Prognathodon saturator. * Nicholls and Meckert described the new genus and species Kourisodon puntledgensis. * Thegarten Lingham-Soliar argued against Nathalie Bardet's attribution of ichthyosaur extinction to the loss of their preferred food sources in the Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event expanded on his own 1999 attribution of ichthyosaur extinction to biotic factors. During the Cretaceous the evolution of many fish groups trended towards faster swimming body types, making them harder to hunt for adult ichthyosaurs and harder to escape from for newborn ichthyosaurs. This ecological scene favored ambush predators like plesiosaurs and the newly evolved mosasaurs over the ichthyosaurs, who succumbed to the competition. September * Christansen and Bonde formally named the Negev desert mosasaur Prognathodon currii. Life restoration of Globidens 2003 * Caldwell and others published a study on the tooth replacement patterns of mosasaurs. They found that mosasaurs replaced their teeth continuously throughout their lives, with each replacing being slightly larger than its predecessor. * Polcyn, Tchernov, and Jacobs erected the new genus Haasiasaurus to house the species \\"Haasia\\" gittelmani because its generic name had been previously used for a different kind of animal and needed replacing. * Bardet, Suberbiola, and Jalil described the new genus and species Tethysaurus nopscai. Life restoration of Dallasaurus 2004 * Lindgren and Siverson argued that mosasaurs almost went extinct during the middle of the Campanian age, but subsequently recovered their lost biodivsersity. * Martin and Fox reported the discovery of crushed bivalve shells in the stomach of a Globidens specimen from the Pierre Shale of South Dakota. May * Gordon Bell and Mike Caldwell rediscovered the mosasaur snout fragment discovered by Harlan. Using photographs of the Goldfuss mosasaur skull by Takehito Ikejiri they were able to verify that the specimens did in fact come from the same individual. 2005 * Polcyn and Bell described the new genus and species Russellosaurus coheni. * Bardet and others described the new species Halisaurus arambourgi. * Everhart described the new species Tylosaurus kansasensis. * Bell and Polcyn described the new genus and species Dallasaurus turneri. 2007 * Martin described the new species Globidens schurmanni. Life restoration of Prognathodon, showing a shark-like tail fluke 2008 * Schulp and others described the new species Prognathodon kianda. * Polcyn and Everhart described the species Selmasaurus johnsoni. * Caldwell and others described the new species Taniwhasaurus mikasaensis. * Smith and Buchy described the new genus and species Vallecillosaurus donrobertoi. 2009 * Schulp, Bardet and Bouya described the new species Carinodens minalmamar. * Kaddumi described many new mosasaur taxa which may not be scientifically valid. 2010s 2011 * Konishi and Caldwell the new genus and species Latoplatecarpus willistoni and referred the species \\"Plioplatecarpus\\" nichollsae to the same genus. They also erected a second new genus, Plesioplatecarpus for the species \\"Clidastes\\" planifrons. 2012 * Leblanc, Caldwell and Bardet described the new genus and species Eremiasaurus heterodontus. * Makádi, Caldwell and Ősi described the new genus and species Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus. 2013 * Lindgren, Kaddumi, and Polcyn reported the discovery of a Prognathodon specimen from Jordan that preserved the soft tissues of its scaley skin, flippers and tail. Significantly, the tail resembled those of modern carcharinid sharks, although the bottom lobe of the tail fin was longest in the mosasaur whereas shark tails have longer upper lobes. * Páramo described the new species Eonatator coellensis. * Palci, Caldwell and Papazzoni described the new genus Romeosaurus and the new species R. fumanensis and R. sorbinii. 2015 * Konishi and others described the new species Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans. * Cuthbertson and Holmes described the new species Plioplatecarpus peckensis. 2016 * Longrich described the species Pluridens calabaria. * A study on mosasaur tooth implantation and its phylogenetic implications is published by Liu et al.

Built in 1865, it is a fine example of commercial Italianate architecture, and has long been a landmark retail site in the small community. Description and history The Patten Building is located in the center of Cherryfield village, on the east side of Main Street (Maine State Route 193), a short way north of its junction with United States Route 1. It is a 2-1/2 story, wood-framed structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and clapboard siding. The roof has an extended cornice, with paired brackets and dentil moulding. The first floor of the front facade is divided into three parts, with a storefront consisting of a double door on the left and a display window on the right, occupying the two right bays, and a single door providing access to the upstairs in the left bay. The bays are each flanked by pilasters, and are topped by decorative wood panels separated by brackets. A dentillated cornice separates the first and second floors. The second floor has paneled pilasters at the corners, and two windows with carved bracketed lintels, while the attic level has a single window with similar treatment. The building was erected in 1865 by Frank Patten, who was engaged in the manufacture and sale of boots and shoes. The building has also served in a variety of other commercial roles, including barbershop and meat market. The building is a regionally uncommon example of commercial Italianate architecture, and is now owned by the local historical society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 22, 1978.

Battle On the death of Sikander Lodi in 1518, his son Ibrahim Lodi succeeded him. He was engaged in putting down the revolts of his nobles, when news of Rana Sanga’s encroachments reached him. He prepared an army and marched against Mewar. The Maharana advanced to meet him and the two armies met near the village of Khatoli on the borders of Haravati (Haraoti). The Delhi army could not stand the onslaught of the Rajput’s, and after a fight lasting two pahars (five hours), the Sultan’s army gave way and fled, followed by the Sultan himself, leaving a Lodi prince prisoner in the hands of Sanga. The prince was released after a few days, on payment of a ransom. In this battle, the Maharana lost an arm by a sword cut, and an arrow made him lame for life.Duff's Chronology of India, p. 271 Aftermath The resources of Ibrahim were depleted by this war with Sanga so he could not renew the contest for some time. However, he sought vengeance on Maharana Sanga for the disastrous defeat inflicted by the latter at Khatoli.

Background Fairfield Sentry Ltd Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (referred to in the judgment as \\"BLMIS\\") was a New York-based fund manager controlled by Bernard Madoff. Over a period of at least seventeen years Madoff operated what was probably the largest Ponzi scheme in history, accepting sums variously estimated between $17 billion and $50 billion for investment. From at least the early 1990s there appear to have been no trades and no investments. Reports and returns to investors were fictitious and the corresponding documentation fabricated. On 11 December 2008, Mr Madoff was arrested, and in March 2009 pleaded guilty to a number of counts of fraud. Funds for investment were commonly entrusted to BLMIS by \\"feeder funds\\". The largest of these was Fairfield Sentry Ltd, an offshore fund incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Its liquidators stated that as at 31 October 2008 about 95% of its assets, amounting to some US$7.2 billion, were invested with BLMIS. Investors participated indirectly in these investments by acquiring shares in Fairfield Sentry at a price dependent on the net asset value per share published from time to time by the directors. Investors were entitled to withdraw funds by redeeming their shares under the provisions of the Articles of Association. Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds (called simply \\"Shell\\" in the judgment), is a Dutch pension fund incorporated in the Netherlands. Between 2003 and 2006, it subscribed US$45m for 46,708.1304 Fairfield Sentry shares, under five successive subscription agreements. These agreements were governed by New York law and contained submissions to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York courts. The Dutch proceedings On 12 December 2008 (the day after Mr Madoff's arrest) Shell applied to redeem its shares in Fairfield Sentry. However, no redemption payment was received and, six days later (on 18 December 2008), the directors of Fairfield Sentry effectively suspended share redemptions. Four days later, on 22 December 2008, Shell applied in the Amsterdam District Court for permission to obtain a pre-judgment garnishment or conservatory attachment over all assets of Fairfield Sentry held by Citco Bank up to a value of US$80m. An order in those terms was made on the following day. In accordance with that order, three separate attachments were made totalling about US$71m. The initial application for authority to attach was made ex parte. However, Fairfield Sentry was entitled to apply inter partes to lift the attachment and did so; that application was rejected by the District Court of Amsterdam on 16 February 2011. Shell had a four-month deadline for the commencement of substantive proceedings; this was extended several times, and the proceedings were ultimately commenced on 19 March 2010. The principal claim made was for US$45m damages for the alleged breaches of the representation and warranties contained in a side-letter. The BVI winding-up proceedings On 21 July 2009, Fairfield Sentry was ordered by the High Court of the British Virgin Islands to be wound up and Mr Kenneth Krys and Ms Joanna Lau were appointed as its joint liquidators. Shell submitted a proof of debt in the liquidation for US$63,045,616.18. This amount was said to represent the redemption price of Shell's shares, calculated by reference to the NAV per share published by the directors of Sentry at 31 October 2008. It was claimed as a debt due under Shell's redemption notice of 12 December 2008. The joint liquidators rejected Shell's proof on 21 August 2014, as a result of Bannister J's direction of 14 August, subject to Shell's right if it objected to the assets being distributed in accordance with that direction to put forward its objection in writing by 17 October 2014. Accordingly, the effect of the attachments is that if Shell was to succeed in its substantive claim in the Dutch courts, it is likely to be able to satisfy its judgment-debt in full out of Fairfield Sentry's assets frozen by the garnishee order, whereas others who have claims in the liquidation ranking with or ahead of theirs may recover only a dividend. On 8 March 2011, shortly after the District Court of Amsterdam rejected Fairfield Sentry's challenge to the attachments, the joint liquidators applied in the High Court of the British Virgin Islands for an anti-suit injunction restraining Shell from prosecuting its proceedings in the Netherlands and requiring it to take all necessary steps to procure the release of the attachments. The application was heard inter partes by Bannister J in July 2011, who rejected it in a judgment delivered on 9 August. His main reason, in summary, was that as a matter of principle the BVI court would not prevent a foreign creditor from resorting to his own courts, even if he was amenable to the BVI court's jurisdiction. The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and made an order in substantially the terms which the joint liquidators had asked for in their notice of appeal. The order restrained Shell from taking any further steps in the existing Dutch proceedings against Fairfield Sentry or commencing new ones, but did not refer in terms to the attachments. The Court of Appeal's reasons, in summary, were (i) that Shell was subject to the personal jurisdiction of the BVI court by virtue of having lodged a proof in the liquidation, (ii) the assertion by the Dutch courts of a jurisdiction to attach assets on the sole ground that it consisted in a debt owed to the insolvent company by a Dutch entity was exorbitant; and (iii) Shell should not be allowed to avail itself of that jurisdiction so as to gain a priority to which it was not entitled under the statutory rules of distribution applying in the British Virgin Islands. Judgment The only judgment was given as a joint judgment by Lord Sumption and Lord Toulson. Integrity of insolvency proceedings Their Lordships noted that under British Virgin Islands insolvency law (as in England), the making of an order to wind up a company divests it of the beneficial ownership of its assets, and subjects them to a statutory trust for their distribution in accordance with the rules of distribution provided for by statute.Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v C&K; (Construction) Ltd [1976] AC 167 This applies not just to assets located within the jurisdiction of the winding up court, but all assets world-wide. This, they held, necessarily excludes a purely territorial approach in which each country is regarded as determining according to its own law the distribution of the assets of an insolvent company located within its territorial jurisdiction. The Privy Council then recapped the fundamental principle applicable to all anti-suit injunctions, as stated at the outset of the history of this branch of law by Sir John Leach V-C in Bushby v Munday.Bushby v Munday (1821) 5 Madd 297 at 307 The court will not interfere directly with any foreign court, but may act personally upon a defendant by restraining him from commencing or continuing proceedings in a foreign court where the ends of justice so require. Their Lordships noted that the 'ends of justice' is a deliberately imprecise expression, but referred to the three main categories identified by Lord Cranworth LC in Carron Iron Company Proprietors v MaclarenCarron Iron Company Proprietors v Maclaren (1855) 5 HLC 415 at pages 437-439 These were: * simultaneous proceedings in England and abroad on the same subject-matter; * foreign proceedings which were being brought in an inappropriate forum to resolve questions which could more naturally and conveniently be resolved in England; and * where foreign proceedings are \\"contrary to equity and good conscience\\". Their Lordships referred to the case of Re Oriental Inland Steam CompanyRe Oriental Inland Steam Company, Ex p Scinde Railway (1874) 9 Ch App 557 where a creditor proved in the liquidation of the Oriental Inland Steam Company in England but attempted to obtain priority to other creditors by attaching property of the company in India. He was restrained by injunction from proceeding in India, but obtained the value of his debt from the liquidator in return for lifting the attachment, without prejudice to the question whether he should be allowed to retain it. The Court of Appeal affirmed an order requiring him to repay it. Sir William James LJ said: The Privy Council noted that in Re North Carolina Estate Co LtdRe North Carolina Estate Co Ltd (1889) 5 TLR 328 Chitty J applied the same principle, and did Millett J in Mitchell v CarterMitchell v Carter [1997] 1 BCLC 673 The Privy Council also noted that the same principle had been upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Cole v Cunningham.Cole v Cunningham (1890) 133 US 107 Anti-suit injunctions The Privy Council reviewed the leading modern case on the jurisdiction to restrain foreign proceedings, Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v Lee Kui Jak.,Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v Lee Kui Jak [1987] AC 871 and noted that in that case Lord Goff, also sitting in the Privy Council, noted that insolvency cases involved different considerations and proceeded on a different principle. They were based not specifically upon protecting litigants against vexation or oppression, but on the protection of the court's jurisdiction administer fairly and equally between claimants to an insolvent estate: Their Lordships felt that it was clear from Lord Goff's formulation that he was making the same distinction as Lord Cranworth had made in Carron Iron between cases such as the insolvency cases, in which there is an equitable jurisdiction to enforce the statutory scheme of distribution according to its terms, and cases in which the court intervenes on the ground of vexation or oppression. The Privy Council also reflected upon its recent decision in Singularis Holdings Ltd v PriceWaterhouseCoopers, at paragraph [23] where it was held that there is a broader public interest in the ability of a court exercising insolvency jurisdiction in the place of the company's incorporation to conduct an orderly winding up of its affairs on a world-wide basis, notwithstanding the territorial limits of its jurisdiction. In such cases \\"the court is not standing on its dignity\\", but it intervenes because the proper distribution of the company's assets depends upon its ability to get in those assets so that comparable claims to them may be dealt with fairly in accordance with a common set of rules applying equally to all of them, and there is no jurisdiction other than that of the insolvent's domicile in which that result can be achieved. Accordingly, the Board felt in principal that an injunction was justifiable. But two further subsidiary issues needed to be considered. Firstly, whether Shell, as a foreign entity, is subject to the court's jurisdiction. And secondly, whether, even on the footing that an anti- suit injunction is available in principle, it is right to make one as a matter of discretion. Jurisdiction The Privy Council followed the recent decision of the United Kingdom Supreme Court in Rubin v Eurofinance SA. Shell argued that it had not submitted to the jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands courts for all purposes; it accepted that it had submitted only for the purpose of claims under the Insolvency Act and Rules, and not for the purpose of claims governed by the general law. The Privy Council rejected that submission, stating \\"[i]n the Board's opinion, there is no such principle.\\" Discretion As with any injunction, their Lordships noted this is subject to the court's discretion to refuse relief if in the particular circumstances it would not serve the ends of justice. Their Lordships noted that in the present case, the Judge at first instance having concluded that the issue of an injunction would be contrary to principle, the Court of Appeal were entitled to overrule him and to exercise their own discretion. They exercised it in the liquidators' favour, and the Board should not interfere unless it is shown that they were guilty of some error of principle or misconception of fact, or that they were plainly wrong. Accordingly, the Privy Council declined to disturb the exercise by the Court of Appeal of their discretion in favour of the injunction. Commentary Commentary on the decision was generally positive, one commentator noting that \\"The judgment can be seen as a further endorsement of the restrained brand of the modified universalism developed in the Privy Council's recent decision in Singularis Holdings Ltd v PricewaterhouseCoopers\\", and \\"[i]t also clearly signals the BVI Court's willingness to intervene to protect the statutory scheme of distribution by means of anti-suit injunctions whilst providing useful guidance as to how the courts will exercise their equitable jurisdiction.\\" Another added \\"The judgment of the Privy Council provides clear guidance to litigants who have claims against insolvent companies in the BVI and who are considering whether to pursue other remedies in a foreign jurisdiction in addition to filing a claim in the liquidation.\\" See also *British Virgin Islands bankruptcy law *British Virgin Islands company law Footnotes Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from the British Virgin Islands 2014 in case law 2014 in the British Virgin Islands 2014 in British law British Virgin Islands company law cases ","title":"Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds v Krys"},{"id":"48718757","text":"borderless is a movement to unite humanity. docu-series that follows Stephan Said as he travels the world making music at the front lines and discovers stories that bring our world together.

It is one of the flagship diplomatic initiatives on South-east Europe of the third Merkel cabinet. It is complemented by initiatives relating to specific South-east European countries (eg, the German-British diplomatic initiative for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU accession). The initiative includes six Western Balkan countries that are candidates for EU membership (Montenegro, Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania) or potential candidates (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo), some EU members, i.e.: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Slovenia and one third country, the United Kingdom.

The victory of Rajput confederacy put them in control of most of the Malwa along with Chanderi fort. Medini Rai made Chanderi his capital and became a trusted Vassal of Rana Sanga. The conquest of Malwa became easier for Rana Sanga largely due to Support from Powerful Rajput Leaders like Silhadi and Medini Rai. Background Medini Rai was granted a fief by Rana Sanga who is having a Life and Death struggle for Throne of Malwa against Mahmud.The Malwa Sultan encroached on it. To teach him a lesson, Rana Sanga marched against the Sultan. Battle Rana Sanga advanced with a large army from Chittor reinforced by the Rathors of Merta under Rao Viramdeva, and met Mahmud Khalji II accompanied by the Gujarat auxiliaries under Asaf Khan. As soon as the battle started the Rajput Cavalry made a fierce charge and tore through the Gujarat Cavalry, the few remnants that survived fled in every direction that they could find. The Rajput cavalry after routing the Gujarat reinforcements turned towards the Malwa army. The Sultan's forces fought bravely but could not withstand the furious charge of the Rajput cavalry and sustained a complete defeat. Most of his officers were killed and the army was nearly annihilated. Asaf Khan's son was killed, and Asaf Khan himself sought safety in flight. Sultan Mahmud was taken prisoner, wounded and bleeding.Sarda, Bilas. Maharana Sanga: The Hindupat, the Last Great Leader of the Rajput Race. 1918. Reprint. London: Forgotten Books, 2013. 70-3. Print.

The prefix TWV is generally followed by a genre number, a letter indicating the key (in some cases), and a work number. The genre number indicates the general type or medium of the work. A major key is in upper case, a minor key in lower case. The second number is the work's number within the genre. For example, Telemann's Concerto polonois in B flat major for strings and basso continuo is TWV 43:B3. His Orchestral suite in D major is TWV 55:D18, and his Overture in G minor is TWV 55:g4. Vocal works were catalogued in a similar way by Werner Menke in the Telemann- Vokalwerke-Verzeichnis (Telemann Vocal Works Catalogue), abbreviated TVWV. For example, Telemann's Johannes-Passion is TVWV 5:42. His Times of the Day cantata is TVWV 20:39. Genre numbering Genres of vocal works are numbered from 1 to 25, and usually prefixed by TVWV. Genres of instrumental works are numbered from 30 to 55.

South Korean defectors are South Korean citizens who have defected to North Korea. After the Korean War, 333 South Korean prisoners of war detained in North Korea chose to stay in the country. During subsequent decades of the Cold War, some people of South Korean origin defected to North Korea as well. They include Roy Chung, a former U.S. Army sergeant who defected to North Korea through East Germany in 1979. North Korea has been accused of abduction in the disappearances of some South Koreans. Occasionally, North Koreans who have defected to South Korea decided to return. Since South Korea does not permit its naturalized citizens to travel to the North, they have made their way into their home country illegally and thus become \\"double defectors\\". From a total of 25,000 North Korean defectors living in South Korea about 800 are missing, some of whom may have returned to the North. During the first half of 2012, the South Korean Ministry of Unification officially recognizes only 13 defections. Background The propaganda value of defectors has been recognized even immediately after the Division of Korea in 1945. Defectors were used as tools to prove the superiority of the political system of the country of destination. North Korean propaganda has targeted South Korean soldiers patrolling at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Aftermath of the Korean War A total of 357 prisoners of war detained in North Korea after the Korean War chose to stay in North Korea rather than be repatriated home to the South. These included 333 South Koreans, 23 Americans, and one Briton. Eight South Koreans and two of the Americans later changed their mind. However, the exact number of prisoners of war held by North Korea and China has been disputed since 1953, due to unaccounted South Korean soldiers. Several South Koreans defected to the North during the cold war: In 1953, Kim Sung Bai, a captain in the South Korean air force, defected to North Korea with his F51 Mustang.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat;=19531025&id;=lh1WAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=t-IDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1692,3690157 In 1985, Ra il Ryong, a South Korean private, defected to North Korea and requested asylum.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat;=19850219&id;=EYZKAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=IpQMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3695,3111707 In 1988, a Korean employee at a U.S. army unit in South Korea defected to North Korea. His name was Son Cahng-gu, a transport officer.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat;=19880216&id;=GP5NAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=0osDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1399,2786555 During the Cold War, several U.S. Army servicemen defected to North Korea. One of them, Roy Chung, was born to South Korean immigrants. Unlike the others who defected across the DMZ, he defected by first crossing the border between West and East Germany in 1979. His parents accused North Korea of abducting him. The United States was not interested in investigating the case, as he was not a \\"security risk\\", and in similar cases it was usually impossible to prove that a kidnapping had occurred. There were several other cases of South Koreans mysteriously disappearing and moving to North Korea at that time, including the case of a geology teacher from Seoul who disappeared in April 1979 while he was having a holiday in Norway. Some South Koreans also accused North Korea of attempting to kidnap them while staying abroad. These alleged kidnapping attempts occurred mainly in Europe, Japan or Hong Kong. Double defectors There are people who have defected from North Korea to South Korea, and then have defected back to North Korea again. In the first half of 2012 alone, there were 100 cases of \\"double defectors\\" like this. Possible reasons for double defectors are the safety of remaining family members left behind, North Korea's promises of forgiveness and other attempts to lure the defectors back including propaganda, and widespread discrimination faced in South Korea. Both the poor and members of elite are dismayed to find out that they are societally worse off in South Korea than they were in the North. Half of the North Korean defectors living in South Korea are unemployed. In 2013, there were 800 North Korean defectors unaccounted for out of 25,000 people. They might have gone to China or Southeast Asian countries on their way back to North Korea. South Korea's Unification Ministry officially recognizes only 13 cases of double defectors . South Korea's laws do not allow naturalized North Koreans to return. North Korea has accused South Korea of abducting and forcibly interning those who want to and has demanded that they be allowed to leave. Contemporary South Korean-born defectors North Korea has targeted its own defectors with propaganda in attempts to lure them back as double defectors, but contemporary South Korean defectors born outside of North Korea were not welcome to defect to the North. In recent years there have been seven people who tried to leave South Korea, but they were detained for illegal entry in North Korea, and ultimately repatriated. As of 2019, there are reportedly 5461 former South Korean citizens living in North Korea.https://datosmacro.expansion.com/demografia/migracion/inmigracion/corea- del-norte There has also been fatalities as a result of failed defections. One defector died in a failed murder-suicide attempt by her husband while in detention. One person who attempted to defect was shot and killed by South Korean military forces in September 2013.

History  It was first dedicated solely to Honor on 17 July 234 BC by Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus after his victory over the Liguri.Cicero, De natura deorum, II.61 After the battle of Clastidium in 222 BC, Marcus Claudius Marcellus vowed to dedicate a temple to Honor and Virtue, a vow he renewed after the capture of Syracuse. In 208 BC he tried to fulfil the vow by rededicating the existing temple to Honor, but the pontifical college forbade it, since one cella could not be dedicated to both gods as - if a prodigy occurred in it - they would not know which god to sacrifice to in thanks.Temple of Honor and Virtue - on: Imperium Romanum. Marcellus instead restored the temple of Honor and built a new cella opposite it to Virtue, turning the existing temple into a double temple. This new double temple was dedicated by Marcellus' son in 205 BC.Livy, XXV.40.1‑3; XXVII.25.7‑9; XXIX.11.13; Valerius Maximus, I.1.8; Plutarch, Marcell., 28 It housed several art treasures looted from Syracuse by Marcellus,Cicero, De re publica, I.21; Verrine, IV.121; Livy, XXVI.32.4 though these had largely vanished by the time of Livy.Livy, XXV.40.3: quorum perexigua pars comparet It also housed the aedicula Camenarum, the ancient bronze shrine thought to date back to the time of Numa Pompilius, which was later transferred to the temple of Hercules Musarum.Servius, Commentarii in Vergilii Aeneidos libros, I.8 The temple was later restored by Vespasian and decorated by the artists Cornelius Pinus and Attius Priscus.Pliny, Naturalis Historia, XXXV.120 It is last mentioned in the 4th century, in the regional catalogues.

Indirubin is a chemical constituent of indigo naturalis (also known as qing dai), which has been used for hundreds of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It is produced by collecting the waste products from the bacterial degradation of specific forms of vegetation. Research Indirubin exerts its effects on the human body by downregulating expression of genes. Genes PLK1 and PIN1, both oncogenic, have been shown to be affected by indirubin. Indirubin has, in vitro and in vivo, been shown to reduce expression of the CDC25B gene, which codes for production of CDC25B enzyme. CDC stands for cell-division-cycle, and is used in cellular reproduction. Studies suggest that mouse cells are viable after the CDC25B (and CDC25C) genes are \\"knocked out\\", but removal of CDC25A results in non-viable cells. Indirubin has not been shown to prevent or treat cancer in humans. However, it is being studied for treatment of small-cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia, either alone or in conjunction with more typical cancer management treatments. It has also been studied for potential use in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, an immune- modulated disease process. Indirubin shows anti-inflammatory and anti- angiogenesis properties in vitro.

It was first published in Uralsky Sovremennik in 1938, and later included in The Malachite Casket collection. In this fairy tale, the characters meet the legendary zoomorphic creature from the Ural folklore called Silver Hoof. In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson. In the 1950s another translation was made by Eve Manning.Bazhov 1950s, p. 9. It was included in James Riordan's collection of stories The Mistress of the Copper Mountain: Tales from the Urals, published in 1974 by Frederick Muller Ltd. Riordan heard the tales from a headteacher when he was bedridden in Sverdlovsk. After returning to England he rewrote the tales from memory, checking them against Bazhov's book. He preferred not to call himself \\"translator\\", he believed that \\"communicator\\" was more appropriate.  Sources  Bazhov's stories are based on the oral lore of the miners and gold prospectors. The character of Silver Hoof is based on the Ural legends. Bazhov mentioned that he had heard tales about the mythical creature Silver Deer, also known as the elk Golden Horns and the goat Silver Hoof. The exact origin of the creature is unknown, but deer have significant roles in the mythology of various peoples located all over the world. In the folklore tales, the goat/deer can be either friendly or harmful.Shvabauer 2009, p. 64. Golden or silver deer/elk became popular at the Urals in the 18th century. According to the Bashkir folklore, dreaming about a goat is a good omen.Shvabauer 2009, p. 65. The Finno-Ugric peoples prayed to the Elk. The depictions of the animal were found among Permian bronze casts. While the character of Silver Hoof is in fact based on the legends, the actual storyline was penned by Bazhov.  Publication  The author heard the tales about the goat with a silver hoof at the Urals from the hunter named Bulatov. The tales seemed to originate from the area where many people were engaged in the searches for chrysolites. But Bazhov had to write the storyline for \\"Silver Hoof\\" himself. \\"Silver Hoof\\" was completed on 3 August 1938.Batin 1983, p. 5. The tale was not included in the first edition of The Malachite Box. But, inspired by its success, Bazhov continued working on his stories. The tales \\"Sinyushka's Well\\", \\"Silver Hoof\\", and \\"The Demidov Caftans\\" were finished before the publication of the collection.Batin 1983, p. 8. It was first published in 1938 in the 2nd volume of Sverdlovsk Publishing House's Uralsky Sovremennik. It was then released as a part of Sverdlovsk Publishing House's children's collection Morozko.  Plot  An old man Kokovanya has no family and decides to take an orphan into his house. He finds out that Daryonka (lit. \\"A gift\\"), a 6-year-old girl, has recently lost her family and invites her to live with him. She accepts, and when she asks about his profession, he reveals that he works as a gold prospector in summer, and in winter he's hunting a certain goat in the forests, because he wants \\"to see where he stamps his right forefoot\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 226. Kokovanya, Daryonka and her cat named Muryonka start living together. Kokovanya works to earn their living, the girl cleans the house and cooks. Winter comes, and Kokovanya decides to go hunting in the forest as usual. He tells Daryonka about the grey goat called Silver Hoof: > That's a very special goat. On his right forefoot he's got a silver hoof. > And when he stamps with that silver hoof he leaves a gem there. If he stamps > once there's one gem, if he stamps twice there are two, and if he begins to > paw the ground there'll be a whole pile. [...] Ordinary goats have two > horns, but this one's got antlers, with five tines.Bazhov 1950s, p. 237. Unlike other goats' horns, Silver Hoof's horns are not shed in winter, and that is how Kokovanya is planning to recognize him. Daryonka begs the old man to take her hunting, and he reluctantly agrees. The cat follows them too. In the forest, Kokovanya goes hunting every day and comes back with a lot of regular goat meat and skins. Soon they have so much meat that Kokovanya has to go back to the village to bring the horse, so that they could carry everything back. He leaves the girl in the forest for a while. Next morning Daryonka sees Silver Hoof passing by. That night, she sees her cat Muryonka sitting in the glade with the goat in front of her, as if they are communicating. They run about the glade for a long time. Next day Muryonka and the goat are gone, but Kokovanya and Daryonka find a lot of gemstones. \\"After that people often found stones in the glade where the goat had run about. Most of them were green ones, chrysolites, folks call them.\\" Bazhov 1950s, p. 231.  Analysis  Pavel Bazhov indicated that all his stories can be divided into two groups based on tone: \\"child-toned\\" (e.g. \\"The Fire-Fairy\\") and \\"adult-toned\\" (e.g. \\"The Stone Flower\\"). He called \\"Silver Hoof\\" a \\"child-toned\\" story. Such stories have simple plots, children are the main characters, and the mythical creatures help them, typically leading the story to a happy ending.Litovskaya 2014, p. 247. In Bazhov's tales chrysolites, unlike ill-omened malachite and emeralds, are meant for humans and bring happiness to their lives. They are \\"children's\\" stones that appear in the \\"child-toned\\" stories. Children play with chrysolites in the very first story from The Malachite Box, \\"Beloved Name\\". As an amulet, the chrysolite can banish demons, strengthen spiritual resistance, give courage and protect from night terrors. After his \\"conversation\\" with the cat, Silver Hoof gives the gemstones as a gift to Daryonka. This gift can be regarded as corporeal and spiritual at the same time, a sacred gift that is bestowed upon good people only. Bazhov himself did not believe that gemstones could bring luck or protect from envy, jealousy and the evil eye.Nikulina 2003, p. 79. Bazhov liked the idea of a child together with an old man contacting the mythical creatures. These people are traditionally portrayed as the closest to the otherworldly, but at the same time they are the least reliable narrators in the adult world. The cat Muryonka is a literary creation, not the folklore character, because such insignificant character couldn't have remained intact in the oral tradition. It is an \\"intermediary\\", a linking creature that ties the real world and the mythical world.Shvabauer 2009, p. 67. Cats in the literary tradition cats are often depicted as travellers between worlds.Shvabauer 2009, p. 68.  Adaptations  A 1947 children's play of the same name was written by Bazhov and Evgeny Permyak.Bazhov 1952, p. 248. Mariya Litovskaya criticized Permyak for oversimplifying an already simple story. She commented that he had been obviously trying to create a fun children's play, and therefore had added a clear antagonist and a lot of secondary characters, such as the fox, the bear, the eagle-owl. Litovskaya said that he had turned the \\"multilayered tale\\" into \\"the tale of friendship between humans and animals, and the battle between good and evil\\".Litovskaya 2014, p. 252. She also noted that Pavel Bazhov had not been opposed to the changes.Litovskaya 2014, p. 251. Lyubov Nikolskaya composed the children's opera Silver Hoof based on the story of the same name in 1959.Sokolskaya, Zh. \\"P. P. Bazhov i muzyka Urala П. П.

The series included the following films: Sinyushka's Well (1973), The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (1975), The Malachite Casket, The Stone Flower (1977), Podaryonka, Golden Hair (1979), and The Grass Hideaway (1982).

The see is first mentioned in the Council of Ephesus in 431, when Bishop Euprepius held the joint episcopacy of Vize and Arcadiopolis. The same arrangement is attested in the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The two cities probably did not become separate bishoprics until the end of the century.Raymond Janin, La hiérarchie ecclésiastique dans le diocèse de Thrace, in Revue des études byzantines, vol. 17, 1959, pp. 146-149. Arcadiopolis was originally a suffragan bishop of Heraclea in Europa, metropolitan see and capital of the Roman province of Europa, but became an autocephalous archbishopric by the late ninth century, and eventually a metropolitan see probably during the reign of Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185–95). Of its bishops, Lucianus was at the Council of Chalcedon (451), Sabbatius at the Second Council of Constantinople (553), John at the Second Council of Nicaea (787), and Basil at the 879 Photian Fourth Council of Constantinople. Bishop Peter is known from his seal dated to the 9th/10th centuries, and an archbishop John signed the decree against the Jacobites in 1032. Following the Fourth Crusade, and for the duration of Latin rule, a Roman Catholic episcopal see (Archadopolitanum) was erected alongside the existing Greek Orthodox metropolis, as a suffragan of the Catholic Archbishop of Heraclea. The see declined quickly thereafter: under Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) the metropolis fell to 101st place, rising to 86th under Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–41). A metropolitan Malachias is attested in April 1329, but following the town's conquest by the Ottoman Turks later in the century the see fell vacant and was abandoned.

This thought movement also could be considered as the continuation of islamic philosophy. Life Abû ‘Abdallâh Muhammad ibn ‘Alî ibn al-‘Arabî al-Tâ’î al-Hâtimî (referred to as Ibn Arabi, and not to be confused with Abu Bakr Ibn Arabi, the Andalusian jurist) is considered one of the greatest Muslim philosophers. He was born in Murcia in Spain around year 1165.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-arabi/#LifWor His father was a well-established person in Murcia and frequently visited with Averroes where during these visits, Ibn Arabi got to meet Averroes. Ibn Arabi's life in Andalusia was under the reign of Movahhedoun dynasty, under the flowering Islamic culture of that time. Politically, the period was marked with conflict between the Islamic Andalusia and the Christian North of the Iberian peninsula. He was educated in Eshbiliah under supervision of Ibn Safi, Ibn Qaleb and other great masters of the time. In his adolescent and youth period, there are many mystical currents in his production. He referred to nearly seventy teachers in one of his works. Ibn Arabi and Mystical theosophy Undoubtedly, he is counted as the founder of the great schools of mystical school of thought in the history of Islam. he had lived in the milieu which had a spiritual atmosphere full of mystical and esoteric experiences. Historical background Many mystical currents and movements were prevalent in Islamic Andalusia. Some such as Ibn Barrajan, Ibn Arif and Ibn Qasi give a dynamism to mysticism. Also, the social and spiritual atmosphere of Islamic East- such as Iran, Syria and Iraq- had affected these milieu. Among these conditions are schools such as Avicennism, Suhrevardi and Illumination school, Gnostic, etc. Principles Knowledge Ibn Arabi believes in three kinds of knowledge. The first kind is rational knowledge which is the conclusion of theoretical reason. This knowledge could be true and/or false.http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/2388 The second kind of knowledge is delight(dhawq) which is not acquired by rational reflection. In other word it is impossible to bring them into any argument or proofs for reason. The knowledge of love, pleasure or sexual intercourse are samples for second knowledge. The third knowledge is mysterious knowledge which is beyond boundaries of reason. This knowledge is dedicated to divine prophets and his disciples. This knowledge is also called a divine knowledge by Ibn Arabi. He believes that true knowledge, namely knowledge of something in itself, just belonged to God and every definition of knowledge is useless. Knowledge has a divine nature. According to him, real Being has eternal consciousness of its reality. This real Being has the One-many nature. In other words, God is named by many named whilst it is one singular reality. Imagination According to Chittick, little attention has been paid to the importance of imagination in Ibn Arabi. Before Ibn Arabi, imagination counted as one faculty among senses but Ibn Arabi tried to develop its concept. He interpreted imagination as follows: all beings are images of real Being and non-being. In other words, all things have two dimensions of being and non being. The universe and all other things counted as imagination which has a middle nature between sheer reality and utter nothing. All things, in fact, are considered as qualities and reflections of one thing in many ways. it refers to theory of the unity of existence.

Diversification rates can be estimated from fossils, data on the species diversity of clades and their ages, or phylogenetic trees. Diversification rates are typically reported on a per-lineage basis (e.g. speciation rate per lineage per unit of time), and refer to the diversification dynamics expected under a birth-death process. A broad range of studies have demonstrated that diversification rates can vary tremendously both through time and across the tree of life. Current research efforts are focused on predicting diversification rates based on aspects of species or their environment. Diversification rates are also subject to various survivorship biases such as the \\"Push of the past\\"  Methods for estimating diversification rates   Fossil time series  Diversification rates can be estimated time-series data on fossil occurrences. With perfect data, this would be an easy task; one could just count the number of speciation and extinction events in a given time interval, and then use these data to calculate per-lineage rates of speciation and extinction per unit time. However, the incomplete nature of the fossil record means that our calculations need to include the possibility that some fossil lineages were not sampled, and that we do not have precise estimates for the times of speciation and extinction of the taxa that are sampled. More sophisticated methods account for the probability of sampling any lineage, which might also depend on some properties of the lineage itself (e.g. whether it has any hard body parts that tend to fossilize) as well as the environment in which it lives. Many estimates of diversification rates for fossil lineages are for higher-level taxonomic groups like genera or families. Such rates are informative about general patterns and trends of diversification through time and across clades but can be difficult to compare directly to rates of speciation and extinction of individual species.  Clade age and diversity  Diversification rates can be estimated from data on the ages and diversities of monophyletic clades in the tree of life. For example, if a clade is 100 million years old and includes 1000 species, we can estimate the net diversification rate of that clade by using a formula derived from a birth-death model of diversification: Equations are also available for estimating speciation and extinction rates separately when one has ages and diversities for multiple clades.  Phylogenetic trees  Diversification rates can be estimated using the information available in phylogenetic trees. To calculate diversification rates, such phylogenetic trees have to include branch lengths. Various methods are available to estimate speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches. One can also use phylogenetic trees to test for changing rates of speciation and/or extinction, both through time and across clades, and to associate rates of evolution with potential explanatory factors.

In 1980 the association's name was changed to the American Saddlebred Horse Association. Registration All horses registered with ASHA are pure or half-bred American Saddlebreds. The association registers approximately 2,000 horses a year. Competition Most Saddlebred shows are held through the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) in partnership with ASHA. The association also partners with the United States Hunter/Jumper Association, United States Dressage Federation, United States Pony Clubs, and United States Driving Association.

The executive producer and driving force behind Trouser Bar is British screenwriter, playwright and producer David McGillivray, who famously collaborated with directors including Pete Walker and Norman J. Warren. There has been much controversy over the authorship of \\"Trouser Bar\\"; accord to McGillivray, the, \\"Authorship of the [Trouser Bar] screenplay has not been unequivocally established. The authorship of the script of this film is unattributed. The producers of the film firmly discourage any speculation as to authorship. Pathetique Films can confirm that the script was passed on to them by the late Peter de Rome.\\" Focusing on a single \\"situation\\" in a menswear boutique in 1976, the short film has been described as an “erotic fantasy\\" in the style of a 1970s British sex comedy and does not include hardcore sex scenes. It features British comedians Barry Cryer and Julian Clary in cameo roles, along with actor Nigel Havers and London-based entertainer, Miss Hope Springs. The production was first reported by Ben Beaumont-Thomas in an article in The Guardian newspaper on 26 November 2014, with David McGillivray quoted as saying \\"Nobody knows anything about this script. [The author]’s only screenplay. So next year, we are going to make... Trouser Bar. [The author] was obsessed with trousers, loved corduroy and leather. And so he wrote a film set in a menswear shop.\\" Cast Production Trouser Bar stars Denholm Spurr (Bobby), Craig Daniel (Joe), Zac Renfree (Larry), Ashley Ryder (David), Scott Hunter and Hans Berlin. Five days of filming took place in September 2015 on a specially-constructed set in a converted TV repair shop on the Caledonian Road close to King's Cross station in London. Production Design was by Lorna Gay Copp and Art Direction by Alan Gilchrist. The distinctive period costumes and clothing, notably corduroy, were sourced and supervised by Mark Harriott. The original score by Stephen Thrower combines disco-style music appropriate to the period with a 70's \\"porn film vibe\\". The location shoot was covered by The Londonist. Music McGillivray had previously announced that a limited edition collector's vinyl LP (long-playing) record of Stephen Thrower's soundtrack for Trouser Bar would be released along with other cues. The record is being released on the Abstract Raven label. The special edition was described on the film's Facebook page as \\"the sexy package you'll want to fondle.\\" It includes a green vinyl LP \\"lovingly wrapped in haute couture corduroy complete with lavishly illustrated insert, paisley hankie, badge and Peter de Rome's visiting card.\\" The album launch, presented on 23 October 2017 in Fitzrovia, was attended by composer Stephen Thrower, producer McGillivray and stars of Trouser Bar. Release Shown as an unattributed work, Trouser Bar received its world premiere on Sunday 20 March 2016 at the 30th BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival (formerly London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival) in the prestigious NFT1 cinema at BFI Southbank. The screening, introduced by the BFI's Brian Robinson and also including Peter de Rome's short film Encounter, featured numerous double entendres and an extended Q&A; with members of the Trouser Bar cast and crew. The audience response was extremely enthusiastic. The BFI had described the film as \\"a controversial slice of gay erotica\\" and commented \\"The script for the film was found in the collection of the late erotic filmmaker Peter de Rome, who made some of the most beautiful gay sex films ever produced, now available on DVD.\\" The BFI added, \\"Set in a gentlemen’s outfitters c. 1976 the film takes its inspiration from the emotions aroused by a fetishistic love of corduroy, leather and tight trousers... a cast of professional erotic performers star alongside some gifted amateurs.\\" The BFI Flare premiere of Trouser Bar was covered in the Londoner's Diary in the 900,000-circulation London Evening Standard newspaper on Friday 18 March 2016, which referred to \\"the mystery\\" of this \\"trouser drama\\". The \\"mystery\\" referenced in the Evening Standard diary is the fact that the author of the Trouser Bar script/scenario is officially unknown, despite earlier comments and claims to the contrary. The script is credited to \\"A Gentleman\\". In July 2016, it was announced on Twitter via the @trouserbar unofficial film account and other sources that the Pathetique Films production would be released and distributed by Peccadillo Pictures. This included a tour to venues across the UK as part of the Pout Fest \\"Time & Tied\\" British gay short films \\"Boys on Film\\" roadshow. The unattributed film was officially released by Peccadillo Pictures in the UK on 20 July 2016, with the DVD released on 22 August 2016. Trouser Bar has now appeared at film festivals around the world. The overseas premiere took place in Seattle, Washington, USA on 17 October 2016 at TWIST: Seattle Queer Film Festival, the largest LGBTQ Pacific Northwest festival - although that accolade may have been taken by a screening at the InDPanda International Film Festival in Hong Kong. Other screenings include: the 11th Pornfilmfestival Berlin in Berlin, Germany on 30 October 2016; as part of Les Gai Cine Mad in Madrid, Spain (21st Festival Internacional de Cine LGBT de Madrid); in Edmonton (Canada) for the Rainbow Visions LGBTQ film festival; and in Brazil for the 24th MixBrasil festival in São Paulo. MixBrasil voted Trouser Bar the Best International Short Film at the festival, with the trophy later presented to producer David McGillivray in London in December 2016 by Marcelo D'Avilla. The Fish&Chips; International Erotic Film Festival in Torino, Italy, screened Trouser Bar in January 2017. The film was also shown at the celebrated MIX NYC Festival in New York on 5 February 2017 - The New York Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film/Video Festival. MIX NYC is described on its website as \\"the longest-running queer film festival in New York City and a decisive launching pad for emerging talents - including some of the best-known names in cinema today.\\" Peter de Rome was a noted New York filmmaker. The film has since been booked for numerous film festivals around the world, including Shropshire (UK), Derby (UK), Turku and Helsinki (Finland), Brussels (Belgium), Hamburg (Germany) and Buenos Aires (Argentina). Controversy The 20-minute film was extremely controversial. Although in post-production by November 2015, a release was unclear due to legal issues. The situation was reported in The Guardian newspaper. The story was picked up in the USA by Entertainment Weekly and also reported by international news and lifestyle magazine Queerty. A detailed account on the film's background and the resulting controversy is by writer, producer and comedy awards sponsor, John Fleming in his So It Goes blog. High-profile supporters of the film on Twitter have included author Neil Gaiman, writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet and Lisi Tribble Russell. In July 2016, the film's producers commented that \\"All those referring to Trouser Bar in any medium are earnestly advised to refer to its screenwriter as 'A Gentleman'. Pathetique Films firmly discourage any speculation as to authorship.\\" On 18 October 2016, producer David McGillivray (@makeadelivery) tweeted: \\"My dispute with the John Gielgud Charitable Trust has been settled. Trouser Bar can continue to be shown throughout the world.\\" References External links British sex comedy films British films 2010s sex comedy films ","title":"Trouser Bar"},{"id":"48720022","text":"Maronite Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Jordan is an patriarchal exarchate of the Maronite Church[Libreria Editrice Vaticana, ed.

This was to be done for the purpose of selling a significant part of its non- permanent assets and using the sale proceeds to buy its own shares without having to pay the tax normally due on such transactions in the UK.

The type species was discovered in 1992 in Kuril islands, Russia and described in Aksenova, et al. It has been isolated in the sediments and water columns of brackish aquatic habitats of various ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. This organism is identified as a new species based on its unique ability to degrade cellulose, xylan, and other α- and β-linked sugars and use them as the sole carbon source by encoding many glycoside hydrolases. It is presumed to secrete cellulases to break down plant-matter around it but there has been little work on the characterization of the enzymes responsible for this.  Original description  The original description depicts single, helical, .2-.25 μm by 16-50 μm Gram-negative cells. The temperature range for survival of Spirochaeta thermophila is between 40° and 73° C with an optimum range between 66° and 68 °C. The pH range for survival was measured from 5.9 to 7.7 with an optimum of 7.5. The G + C content measured was approximately 52% in the 1992 description but has been measured around 70% since that time. The original description also noted that organisms of the same species isolated from different environments could have different optimum temperatures, optimum pH for growth, and optimum saline concentrations; these would change based on the environment in which the organism is living.  Glucose fermentation pathway  The fermentation process is the same Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway of glycolysis with the exception of one step. The phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate mediates the production of pyrophosphate-dependent (PPi-dependent) phosphofrucktokinase instead of the usual ATP-dependent phosphofrucktokinase. This appears to be a characteristic of Spirochaeta thermophila not found in other Spirochaeta species. It is suggested that this different product could be a regulatory mechanism for catabolic processes; with low levels of the ATP-dependent molecule, AMP is produced. AMP drives the production of PPi production for the step that is changed in the glycolysis pathway. The PPi-dependent phosphofrucktokinase sequences are only available from three organisms in the Spirochaetales order: Spirochaeta thermophila, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Treponema pallidum. Comparing the sequences, in a 2001 study by Rominus et al., it was determined that S. thermophila was most closely related to T. pallidum for this sequence and the sister to those groups was B. burgedorferi. This analysis showed the thermophily of S. thermophila and T. pallidum arose from a common ancestor between them and B. burgdorferi that was a mesophile. This was an interesting revelation because it was previously assumed that the thermophilic, free-living spirochaetes gave rise to all extant spirochaetes.

Active during the late Baroque and early Classical music periods, Zuccari worked mainly in Milan, Olomouc, and London. Personal life and career Zuccari was born in Casalmaggiore, Italy, a flourishing small town. He began studying the violin at a young age and demonstrated considerable talent. At the age of 19, he moved to Vienna to pursue his musical training. There, his skills garnered the attention of nobility. He eventually met the Milanese noblewoman Francesca Radaelli, an amateur singer, whom he married when he was 29. Immediately afterward, he spent years traveling Europe to build his fame as a virtuoso, serving for a time as a Kapellmeister before eventually settling in Milan. At age 43, he published his masterpiece Sonate a Violino, e Basso ò Cembalo, Opera Prima. He also served as the director of the Accademia Filarmonica Milanese and, in 1748, became a member of the Orchestra Ducale. In 1750, he was first violinist with the orchestra of G.B. Sammartini. In 1760, he ended up in London as a member of the Opera Italiana Orchestra. There, he published a method for violin in 1762 and, in 1764, the Sonate per due Violini e Basso. In 1778, Zuccari retired from the musical life of Milan and returned with his wife and five children to his native Casalmaggiore, where he taught music until his death. Works and musical style Zuccari's works were mainly of the Baroque style, despite his time in the early Classical era. As a violinist, Zuccari focused on intricate musical ornamentation for sonatas that relied heavily on his expertise. His sonatas emphasized the history of music with authentic sounds, as opposed to cantatas, which were generally sung. A majority of his prominent pieces were released between the late 1740s and the mid-1760s. His works include: * (, Milan) — the 10th of these 12 sonatas for violin and continuo was for some time attributed to Bach (BWV Anh. 184) * The True Method of Playing at Adagio (1762) * Four Manuscripts (1764, London) :* Concerti per Concertato Violino e strumenti :* Solo per Violino e Basso :* Sonata per flauto solo e basso :* Sonate per violoncello *12 Trio Sonatas (1765, Milan) References External links * Bibliography * Biography from bach-cantatas.com Italian composers 1703 births 1792 deaths ","title":"Carlo Zuccari"},{"id":"48720420","text":"Edward Hough (5 November 1879 – 22 November 1952) was a British trade unionist.

She has been called the \\"grand dame of southern cooking\\" and counted as good friends Duncan Hines and Julia Child. Hach catered functions for the United Nations, U.S. mayors and governors, military personnel and celebrities, and was the one of the pastry chefs at the wedding of Princess Diana. As a young flight attendant on international routes, she talked her way into the kitchens of top hotels in Europe on flight layovers, and was convincing enough to gain access to established chefs, in order to learn how haute cuisine kitchens operated. She hosted the first televised cooking show in the southern U.S., which ran on WSM-TV in Nashville from 1950 to 1956, and which won her a Zenith television award. Hach won the Food Arts Magazine \\"Silver Spoon Award\\" in 2009 and was the 2015 winner of the Ruth Fertel \\"Keeper of the Flame Award\\", given yearly by the Southern Foodways Alliance to the \\"unsung hero or heroine who has made a great contribution to food\\". Hach was keynote speaker at large conventions including the Culinary Institute of America. Southern food writer Betty Fussell said of Phila Hach, \\"What the 'Grand Ole Opry' did for country music, she has done for Southern food...\\" Early life Hach was born in Nashville, the child of innkeepers Sophia and Arthur Lee Rawlings. Her mother, who was Swiss, also worked as a home demonstration agent for the U.S. Government during the great depression. Her job was to provide hot lunches to local schools. As a teen, Hach spent the summers of 1942-44 learning from a Hungarian chef at a summer resort, the former Lookout Mountain Hotel in Chattanooga. Hach stated, \\"He taught me not to waste anything, and to start with fabulous ingredients. Nothing is better than what it starts out to be\\". She earned a degree in music from Ward-Belmont College in Nashville, and also a bachelor's degree in foods and nutrition in 1949 from Vanderbilt University. In her twenties, she became a flight attendant for American Airlines and Pan Am and flew international routes. In the late 1940s, that was considered a glamorous job for young women who were screened for attributes of youth, attractiveness, proper height and weight, and single marital status. The airlines depended on them and treated them well. On her flight layovers she was able to stay at fine hotels in Europe. Hach visited the kitchens of hotels such as the Savoy Hotel in London and the Georges V in Paris. She would ask their chefs to let her cook with them. Her success in gaining such access allowed her to learn techniques that gave her cooking a \\"worldly touch\\". Combining her airline experience with love of cooking, she developed one of the first in-flight catering manuals for the airline industry. As of 2009, Hach's in-flight catering business was still preparing 30,000 meals a year for military planes flying out of Ft. Campbell, Kentucky. She said, \\"When I started in the food business with the airlines, there were no women. It was a man's world.\\" Television show When television arrived in Nashville in 1950, the newly created WSM Television Channel 4 needed programming. Within their first few months on the air, the station hired Hach to create a culinary show—making her the first woman to host a television show in the southern U.S. The program Hach headed was called \\"Kitchen Kollege\\". In planning the 30-minute program, she chose as her assistant Martha Mormon, who she called \\"Miss Martha\\". Mormon was an African-American woman from Detroit who had previously worked as a maid at the television station and was the first black woman to appear on television in the southern U.S. The pair staged the show each weekday for the next five years. During this time, Hach continued working as a flight attendant on weekends. The show was popular with viewers, who reportedly loved the inevitable gaffes and surprises typical of live television of the day. Guests on the show included Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl, June Carter Cash, and Duncan Hines. Success During one of her Paris flight layovers, a young tobacco exporter visiting from the United States saw Phila and offered to help her with her luggage. He was a wealthy Sorbonne-educated businessman named Adolph Hach, Jr. Two years after he returned to his home in Clarksville, Tennessee, he happened to see her again, this time on television doing her cooking show. After writing to her, they met, a romance was sparked, and they were ultimately married in Clarksville in October, 1955. The wedding was a grand affair with a reception for 1,000 guests. Hach described her husband as a \\"darling, fabulous man who spoke five languages\\". He asked her to quit television and to give up flying; she asked him to sell his tobacco business. After each agreed, they began a year-long honeymoon, traveling all over the world before settling in Tennessee to build their dream: an inn modeled on the European style. It was first called \\"Hachland Hall Bed and Breakfast\\" (pronounced \\"holland\\"), and was located on Madison Street in Clarksville, Tennessee near Nashville. Soon after opening, they added lunch and dinner service and it became an inn in 1963. The Hachs later added Hachland Hill Vineyard on a 90-acre site in nearby Joelton, Tennessee for corporate retreats. They also developed the Spring Creek Inn, which adjoined the vineyard. In 2005 they sold the original Hachland Hall in Clarksville, and created a new version, \\"Hachland Hill\\" on the Joelton site, creating a venue which could, as of 2009, serve 1,500 guests. Hach made herself available for talk shows, newspaper feature articles, and public speaking engagements. With a young son at home, she did a radio show broadcast from her kitchen. She developed relationships with political leaders and celebrities, and her tables began to include the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Henry Kissinger. Hach said, \\"We get more business people for security reasons...small inns and bed and breakfasts are where people get back to earth, where they have a home experience\\". Anecdotes In 1976, the Governor of Tennessee and the Mayor of Nashville invited 1600 dignitaries of the United Nations – including over 100 permanent U.N. members – to come to Tennessee for a visit honoring Secretary Kurt Waldheim. A commemorative marker of the event now stands at the site. Tennessee Senator Howard Baker chose Hach to cater the affair, and she decided that mint juleps should be served; however, alcohol was prohibited at the site of the festivities, Nashville's Centennial Park. Hach arranged for Tennessee State Troopers to transport disguised cases of Jack Daniels' Whiskey from Lynchburg and, under the cloak of darkness, made the juleps at a nearby Coca- Cola bottling plant. During the visit, Hach gave her cookbooks to each of the delegates. In return, she asked them to send her their favorite local recipes. They responded with letters and recipes from around the world, which Hach later incorporated into \\"Phila Hach's United Nations Cookbook\\". Another Tennessee Governor, Lamar Alexander, hosted a dinner for Roots author Alex Hailey, catered by Hach. They remarked at how the house smelled just like freshly baked pies. The fact is that the original pies did not show up, forcing Hach to go to a nearby grocery store, then commandeer the kitchen and bake enough pies for 300 guests. In the early 1950s, the General Electric Co. sent Hach an electric mixer, which she used on her television show for the first time. When she put it into a bowl of egg whites, eggs were spattered everywhere. She said, \\"It was just funny. They thought it was supposed to be funny...the show was such fun and such a fiasco\\". In her later years, Hach became interested in the plight of refugees from Iraq, Iran and Kurdistan. Through Nashville's International Center for Empowerment she helped organize a series of cooking classes for such immigrants. Hach died on December 2, 2015 at age 89, after battling colon cancer for about a year. Hach's son, Joseph Karl Hach continues to operate all of the properties of Hachland Hill as of 2016.

In the late 1970s, a band named Stillwater came out with a song named -Mindbender \\"My Daddy was a Gibson. My Mama was a Fender That's why they call me Mindbender\\" about a guitar that could talk. This song may have started the SuperStrat battle, but in the early 1980s, when musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat they questioned and rethought everything about their instruments and the SuperStrat war began. Guitar buyers insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads, dive bombing, and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was a departure from Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice, and X stood for ten. They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the sturdy body and neck work by Chuck Burge, and the \\"multi-voice\\" pickups and electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler 2200 Tremolo System (required factory routing). The standard Victory MV's had the first seven- point top-adjust bridge designed by Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982 that worked for both right and left handed guitars. The three post holes in the underside allowed either side of the bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards allowing intonation of ultra light or extra heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles for fine adjustment of intonation and to affect tone. Note that the brass saddle inserts are almost impossible to find. String gauge affects sound and playability. If you are a professional with strong fingers, using heavier strings produces greater dynamic and timbral range, more sustain, & less buzzing using slide. The high tension also allows lower action. Using lighter strings allows easier bending, easier hammer-ons, pull-offs & very fast solos. Victories were built tough and stiff to easily handle the high tension of using much heavier string gauges (total set tensions of 140 pounds or more) without a truss rod adjustment. Tim Shaw engineered the Victory MV's with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups Kalamazoo Victory pickups were hand made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire, less scatter and a narrow magnetic aperture, Nashville Victory pickups were produced on the Meteor ME-301 PAF Pickup Winder to the same Tim Shaw specifications. Each pickup across the range is different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The MVX and MV2 do not have the same pickups, each guitar has its own sound. The location of the Victory MV's pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. The majority of harmonics coincide with where the twenty fourth fret would be located. If you want to play your Victory above the 22nd fret, use a ring slide. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV's have additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil, indistinguishable from traditional unshielded single coils minus the noise. Victory MVs are totally immune from \\"Strat-Itis\\" (simultaneous multiple discordant frequency syndrome) In some single-coil pickups, strat-Itis is an annoying out-of-tune harmonic, oscillating/warbling /shriek/dissonant sound. Gibson had established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world, and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than today because of new laws & limited natural resources. The Victory MV's two piece body & tri-laminated quartersawn neck were crafted from solid Eastern Hard Rock Maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1,450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch, & a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, harder than Walnut, Oak, or even Mahogany. Eastern Hard Rock Maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earth quaking sustain. Victory MV's are air-dried instruments; seasoning produces a higher quality, more stable wood allowed to reach equilibrium in its natural shape with minimal stress on the woods cellulosic fiber structures (that look like microscopic straws), however the air-curing process takes a lot of time. By comparison modern kiln-dried wood utilizes heat to dry wood much faster, but is more prone to cracking, twisting, warping & shrinkage. It is also hard on the hygroscopic substructure damaging the wood cells. Unless kiln dried lumber is kept in a fully climate-controlled building from the moment it comes out of the kiln, it will quickly re-absorb moisture from the ambient air, returning to the same moisture content as properly air- dried lumber. But the internal tensions remain. The Victory MV's have a stacked laminate alternating wood grain neck design crossbanding strengthens the overall neck, gives more tuning stabilization, and allowed the luthiers to eliminate the need for a scarf joint at the headstock. Contrasting laminated graining angles provides superior resistance against impact cracking over angled single piece necks, scarf joint necks, or necks with no break angle that require junky string tree clips to keep the strings in the nut. Wood improves with age because of the polymerization of sap over decades. Once the wood is removed from the living tree crystallizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages. Victory MV's have binding along the edges of the fretboard that cover the unfinished fret tangs, fret slot end gaps, and the nibs on the fret ends that can protrude. Binding is tedious painstaking work and requires skill to install properly, but provides a slick smooth feel, is especially nice for sliding your hand along the fretboard, and gives a dressy look. Not to be confused with undercut, fret over binding. As the decades pass the aged fingerboard wood reaches its natural equilibrium and fret sprouts on Victory MV's have become extremely rare when properly humidified. By comparison, If you read guitar forums, you will find many brand new kiln-dried beginner level guitars have major shrinkage problems with fret sprout causing the guitar to be uncomfortable or even unplayable. The fret board on Victory Mv's have Nacre inlay markers, also known as mother of pearl, or oyster shell. It is hard, wear resistant, and iridescent. Gibson Victory fretboards have a 12” radius, which allow string bends to ring cleaner with the action low, for example guitars with a 7.25\\" radius will buzz or “choke out” if you to bend the strings too far. Using glue that is stronger than the wood itself, the Victory MV's mortise-and-tenon Set-in neck has a tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound with a comfortable contoured low profile heel transition and silky smooth, very slick, fast playing, rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board that is absolutely unbeatable for its durability. Unfinished ebony will look new and last for generations without pitting. Ebony has a Janka Hardness of 3,080 pound-force that required hardened carbide steel tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft. In comparison, some guitars have a sticky glossy finish on a sealed fingerboard to keep moisture out that attracts dirt and grime. Also by comparison other guitars with weak \\"screw-on\\" necks have a thick clumsy heel that is covered with a metal plate and need adjustment shims, causing a creaky neck pocket / body gap. So called \\"bolt-on\\" necks have no proper neck torque specs, over-tightening the wood screws crushes the wood, cracks the finish, and strips the holes requiring a toothpick or dowel to be glued in the stripped hole, or on necks attached with machine screws and threaded Inserts under-tightening the screws can cause shift in the neck pocket, causing the strings to shift to one side of the neck. The Gibson Victory MV's elegant headstock shape has a fourteen degree stacked laminate \\"non-scarfed\\" break angle, made like a hockey stick. By comparison beginner guitars have the headstock cut off and then glued back on at an angle, with dowel pegs creating a \\"Scarf Joint\\" to save money. Gibson Kalamazoo luthiers pioneered laminated guitar necks. The Victory's tuning machine alignment allows for a \\"perfectly straight\\" symmetrical pull on the strings that provides optimum string down pressure on the nut for the string to seat in the nut slot but not pinch, bind, or rattle in the slot, transferring all the vibration into the nut instead of into the tuning machines. (Unlike beginner guitars that need string tree clips, retainers, or guides that cause friction and pings/cracking noise and string breakage). The Victory's chambered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. All Gibson Victory MV's came standard with the highly sought-after Posi-Lok Diamond Security Strap Buttons. (Stevie Ray Vaughan used these rare trademarked Posi-Lok buttons on his famous Lenny Guitar). According to Gibson, Victory MV's were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. (Only a small percentage were Twilight Blue) even more rare, sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX on display in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City. The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded \\"8170\\" dual lock and key padded hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number on the back of the headstock to determine if your Victory was hand made by finding the location and the date of its manufacture. History In order to respond to the superstrat craze, Gibson introduced new models such as the US-1, the US-2, M-III, Q-3000, and WRC models . Though the US-1 was one of Gibson's first mass-production superstrats the Victory MV is the true \\"FIRST\\" Gibson superstrat. The MV's were rare guitars when they were new. Only 1800 MVX and 200 MV2 were ever minted. They were distributed worldwide. Only the earliest of these exceptional Gibson Victory MV guitars (quantity unknown) were handmade by the 44 veteran luthiers in the historic 225 Parsons St. Kalamazoo factory, using the best methods, and highest quality materials, with reputations of caring about each instrument as a creative piece of art. They were also the last. In 1981 America was in terrible stagflation, the economy was miserable, Millions of union auto workers and steel mill workers lost their jobs due to cheap imported cars and steel, The OPEC oil cartel controlled the world oil supply and had America on its knees . Americans begged in long lines at gas station for overpriced gas, banks started to foreclose on family farms. At the same time factories in Japan, China, and Korea were producing cheap lookalike copies of classic designs from Fender, Gibson, and Rickenbacker putting American luthiers out of work, and forcing American guitar companies to make the change to automated mass production lines, and the Kalamazoo factory founded in 1894 by Orville H. Gibson was shut down. Les Paul himself came with a truck to rescue the KZ/LP-115 Pickup Winding Machine. and final minting of the MV's were sent to Nashville using automated milling and routing equipment and the \\"speedy\\" Meteor ME-301 PAF Pickup Winder Some of the master luthiers who made the last \\"Kalamazoo Victories\\" purchased the old Gibson factory, equipment, and tools, and started the Heritage Guitar Co. Emphasizing quality before quantity, the character of the two factories that Gibson ran in the early '80s was quite different. Nashville was set up to produce large quantities of a few individual models whereas Kalamazoo was more flexible and could design, specialize, and customize small runs and \\"one-of-a-kind\\" instruments. The MV's were superb guitars: a Victory, both in name and features, ahead of its time, but a defeat for Gibson in terms of sales. Due to the double-dip recession top shelf guitars were simply unaffordable to most professional musicians at the time. The Victory MV's were hard to find in music stores, and if you wanted to custom / special order one they took time to make. They were priced between the Les Paul Deluxe and the Les Paul Standard. The Victory MV's were not well marketed. In the late 70's getting a copy of the Gibson Guitar Catalog was on every musicians wish list. But in 1981 and 1982 there were no American catalogs. To save money on advertising, Gibson only publicized the Victories with a 5-page black and white paper leaflet. It was also very poor timing to market the Victory MV-2 as \\"Designed primarily for the discerning country player\\" during the worst farm foreclosure crisis in US history. It was not until 1983 that the Gibson Guitar Catalog showed a Twilight Blue Victory MVX with a Kahler tremolo in a full color high quality photograph. Over the decades many MV's have been played hard, need fret dressing or re-fretting, and have some scars. Only a small percentage of Victory MV's actually have the original Kahler 2200 Tremolo System invented in 1979 by Gary Kahler and Dave Storey, and an even smaller percentage have a \\"Gibson Branded\\" Kahler 2200 Tremolo. Shredder Danny Coralles from Autopsy/Abscess - one of the early breed of US death metal acts still plays his Victory MVX. The Kinks' Dave Davies also played a Victory MVX. There was at least one Gibson Victory/Q Series MV Twelve string prototype. There was also at least one Gibson Victory MV with a white scratch plate. The Victory MV guitars are perhaps some of the most underestimated, and short lived guitars in Gibson history. The bulk of production seems to have been limited to the second half of 1981, and the first quarter of 1982 in Nashville. Blink in the early 1980s and you would have missed them. The Victory Standard, Artist, and Custom bass guitar model were produced from 1981 to c. 1986. Models The Victory MV's were only available as a six string solid body guitar. Two models were produced: * MV2 - \\"Velvet Brick\\" neck humbucker, \\"Magna II\\" bridge humbucker, passive electronics with one volume and one tone knob and one three-position pickup selector, and a quartersawn Indian rosewood fretboard. It is important to note that the MV2 Velvet Brick pickup is NOT the same pickup as the later mass- produced Gibson Sonex Deluxe Velvet Brick pickup, they are clearly different but have the same name. Confusing, yes. Identifying, measuring and documenting these rare MV2 neck pickups for collectors should be done. * MVX - \\"Magna Plus\\" neck humbucker 7.79 ohms, \\"Magna Plus B\\" bridge humbucker 5.94 ohms, \\"Super Stack\\" middle humbucker, passive electronics one volume and one tone knob, a five-position pickup selector, a coil tap switch, and a quartersawn Madagascan ebony fretboard. Note: For many years quartersawn ebony boards have been unavailable because the farms of newly planted ebony trees are still small and need time to grow. Forest harvesting is greatly restricted. Currently less than 1% of ebony fret boards are quartersawn and pure-black ebony (unstained) is very hard to find. Gibson stopped using ebony and transitioned to synthetic Richlite in 2012/2013. Worldwide demand for high quality ebony fretboards has made restoring and refretting vintage guitars very popular.  Environmental sustainability and restoration  For over a century Gibson went to the ends of the Earth and into the deepest forests to obtain the finest wood on the planet to hand make their instruments. Generations of luthiers carried on the skills of their trade. As the guitar industry underwent the change to mass production more guitars were produced cheaper. The demand for old growth trees for premium specialty wood increased rapidly. Restoring a fine classic instrument to new, or better than new condition is by far a better environmental choice than buying a new guitar. Collectors want to keep their guitars as close to original as possible, however there are some popular modifications Victory owners have made without damaging the instrument. Change out those nylon inserts, they dampen sustain, Victories were engineered to ring like a bell. Look in to a Stetsbar tremolo system if your Victory does not have the original Kahler tremolo system. The Stetsbar tremolo system bolts right on to the original posts without any routing or drilling. Consider locking machine heads with automatic string trim, they are easy to do yourself and they keep your guitar in tune even better. If the frets on your Victory are worn out, have a luthier re-fret your fret board with stainless steel fret wire, the frets will last forever and you will never find better ebony. Re-fretting also allows you to choose new custom binding. Technology is now available with the use of a \\"PLEK\\" machine to analyze and repair even microscopic imperfections in your frets and fret board. Gibson Victory frets are comfortable, easy to slide your fingers up and down fret board, and properly set up have very low action, but like tires on a car, guitar frets are consumable and wear out. Eventually your Victory will need fret work. The idea that a professional re-fret makes a guitar less valuable is uneducated. Victory MV's came standard with .08 wide by .04 tall Nickel Silver fret wire. Comparable to Jescar 37080 fret wire, Dunlop 6230 fret wire, or StewMac Medium/Medium. By today's standards many professional guitar players feel Nickel Silver is too soft, however some luthiers do not like working with Stainless Steel because it ruins their tools. Finding an experienced luthier is a must. Re-fretting your Victory gives you lots of choices, you can use the exact same fret wire it came with originally, or go harder. The Vickers hardness test was developed in 1921 by Robert L. Smith and George E. Sandland to measure the hardness of materials. For example, If Vickers hardness is notated: 100 HV/5, it means a HV of 100 was obtained using a 5 kg force. Nickel Silver 200 HV/5, EVO Gold 250 HV/5, Stainless Steel 300 HV/5. You can also change fret wire size, but consider carefully. Jumbo frets are easier for bending but can feel like driving fast over speed bumps with your fingers walking a tightrope. With medium frets a light touch is all it takes, they are easier to chord and won't go sharp- plus light gauge strings are still easy to bend. Do you want more control over string height on your Victory? Install a string height adjustable brass nut, especially if you like to play slide and fret at the same time - you can get your string height perfect. Keep all of your original parts in a safe place. Exact match paint for your Victory can now be mixed with the use of a hand held \\"Spectrophotometer\\" at your local auto paint supply, just bring it in. CAUTION! If you a musician who travels internationally: Ambiguous trade rules apply to CITES-listed tree species, such as ebony and rosewood, enforcing restrictions on your instrument. To prevent your Gibson Victory from being impounded or confiscated going through customs by an overzealous customs agent make sure you have the proper accompanying CITES paperwork. Even then, it can still boil down to what country or who you are dealing with at customs, and how they interpret CITES. A slight misinterpretation and you could have to fight to get your instrument back.  Gibson Victory MV's designed by Tim Shaw  Tim Shaw was an engineer in the Kalamazoo custom shop. In 1980 he conducted a scientific study of the various PAF models and lab analyzed the materials, to design a pickup that was an exact copy, reissue, or replica of the 1959 PAF pickup. This is what people commonly refer to as a \\"Shaw Pickup\\", these have an Unoriented Alnico 5 and are ink stamped as: 137/138, 372/373, 498/499. The \\"Shaw Era\\" for Gibson was between 1980 and 1986. Tim Shaw's Victory MV pickups do not have ink stamps. For example, the Gibson Victory MVX center pickup is an extremely rare \\"stacked\\" humbucker, designed by Shaw, but clearly not what people now refer to as a \\"Shaw pickup\\". Tim Shaw is now chief engineer for Fender. In 2015 Fender released the American Professional instruments series using brand-new Shawbucker pickups. The Kalamazoo luthiers broke the mold and a century of tradition to build a radical new model that screamed. Because of automation and cheap imports, the survival Gibson was in question. This new guitar model required the most sensitive and focused pickups they could make. The “Magna 2, Magna Plus, and Magna Plus B” series of pickups each had their own unique tonal qualities. The super stack pickup was also a relatively new design. The MV's pickups have nickel-silver alloy baseplates, the formulation is unknown. Ni-Ag has a direct effect on the pickup's inductance. It is reasonable to estimate that only about 150 Gibson \\"Magna II\\" pickups are still left in the world. The \\"Magna II\\" pickups were overwound, with full magnet loading in both coils. One outside bar magnet loaded coil and a 6 internal pole piece magnet loaded coil. The MV2 Velvet Brick neck pickup was designed by Bill Lawrence. The Velvet Brick pickups were later mass-produced. This is from the Gibson brochure 1980. \\"The Velvet Brick features a distinctive black and cream combination finish. The exposed coil pickup produces higher output than our standard humbuckers, with extended treble response, increased mid-range and solid lows. Add more to your sound with the Velvet Brick. A pickup that looks as good as it cooks. Features: Inductance-4.7 Henries, Resonant peak-5.8kHz,DC Resistance 7.8k ohms, High Output Permanent Ceramic Magnet, 6 adjustable pole pieces, Exact replacement for Gibson and many other large humbuckers\\".  Optional Kahler 2200  In 1981 American Precision Metal Works Inc., a division of Kahler Systems International; unveiled the Kahler tremolo, Victory MV's were the first Gibson's to have them, but only a small percentage came new from Gibson with this option. These Victories can be identified by inspecting the routed area under the trem will have the same electrically conductive black paint used in the routed pickup area. Others Victories had aftermarket Kahler 2200's professionally installed by luthiers. Some of the Kahler trems were Gibson branded, some were not. Each individual saddle could be adjusted in six directions: up or down, for proper string height to follow the radius of the neck; a front-to-back saddle adjustment, to intonate the strings; and a side-to-side adjustment for spacing each string properly. The Kahler arm is sensitive to the touch and has a soft feel. They needed to be kept clean and lubed to work properly.  Victory Multi-Voice \\"CM\\" Option  Victory MV's were rare, but even harder to find is on the headstock of a small percentage of BOTH the Victory MVX and the MVII guitars there is a CM after the word Victory. The meaning of the CM may be lost to the winds of time forever. An extensive search of several guitar forums for the meaning of the \\"CM\\" came up with \\"Chick Magnet\\", \\"Costs More\\", or \\"CustoM\\"; but the CM Victories are visibly identical to the standard MV's. They look the same .\\"Country Music\\" could make sense on the MVII due to its marketing, but does not make sense for the MVX. Both the Victory MVX and the MVII had ALNICO magnets (Aluminum, Nickel, Cobalt) in the pickups, except for the MVII which had one ceramic magnet (strontium ferrite) in the Velvet Brick pick-up. So a possible clue to the meaning of CM is that Tim Shaw was experimenting with the electrodynamics of the Victories and used all \\"Ceramic Magnets\\" in the pick- ups to give them another flavor of sound. This is just a theory. It would be interesting to hear a standard Victory MVX or MVII played side by side with Victories that have the CM option. This theory could be proven or disproven if we could measure and compare the CM pickups for resistance and gauss. It is unknown how many CM Victories were made.

Two were built and flown with three different engines. Design and development The A-60 was an all-wood, low wing cantilever monoplane. Its wing was in three parts, with a rectangular centre section and two outer, gently straight tapered panels with semi- elliptical tips. These outer panels were mounted with 4° of dihedral and carried ailerons each of span, occupying most of their trailing edges. The wing was built around two spars and was plywood covered. The A-60's landing gear was of the tailskid type and each independently mounted mainweel was on a robust, rubber sprung, vertical duralumin leg attached to the forward spar of the outer extremities, with a lighter, angled bracing strut to the rear longeron. The gear had a track of and was often entirely contained within vertical trouser fairings. The prototype aircraft was fitted with a , five cylinder Walter NZ 70 radial engine in a rounded nose, with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. Behind the engine the fuselage, all wood like the wings, was rectangular in section and built around four longerons with plywood surfacing; the upper surface was subdivided longitudinally into a ridge with two sloping faces. There were two open cockpits with small windscreens, one centred at about one-third chord and the other over the trailing edge. Disengagable dual control was fitted. The fuselage tapered towards the tail, where the empennage was conventional. Its parallel chord horizontal tail with rounded tips was placed at mid-fuselage height and there was a quadrant shaped fin and curved rudder hinged at the extreme tail, sloping in below to allow elevator movement. Control surfaces were unbalanced. The A-60 first flew late in 1930. A second aircraft, the A-61 was built with a more powerful, uncowled Salmson 7Ac seven cylinder radial engine. This made its first flight on 9 September 1931. The A-60 was re-engined with a Renault 4Pb four cylinder upright inline engine and renamed the A-62. It was flying by September 1931. The extra power of the two new engines naturally improved performance figures : the A-62 was faster at maximum speed and faster cruising and could reach altitudes higher. Its range, though, was 25% less. Operational history Only nineteen days after the first flight of the A-62 it was competing in Le concours national d'avions de tourisme (The national contest for touring aircraft) along with the A-61, a Caudron C.232 Luciole and a Guillemin JG-10. Designer Edouard Albert flew the A-61 and Sautereau the A-62. The Guillemain dropped out early and at the end of the initial flying tests the order was Caudron, A-61 and A-62. The final challenge was a tour but during the first leg on 5 October the A-62 crashed, killing the engineer Paul Breyrich and seriously injuring Sautereau. At the end of the tour, at Orly on 15 October, the Caudron was the winner and the A-61 in second place. Not much is known about the later career of the A-61 but in 1999 its remains were rediscovered and it is being restored at the Musée Régional de l'Air at the Angers - Loire Airport in Angers.

The graben is located at the head of the outflow channel Mangala Valles, which is thought to have been formed by at least two catastrophic flood events during the same geological period, leading to the release of vast quantities of water from Mangala Fossa onto the Martian surface. The flooding was probably initiated by the emplacement of a dike radiating from the volcano Arsia Mons, resulting in the formation of the graben, Mangala Fossa, at the channels' head. This dike breached a pressurized aquifer trapped beneath a thick \\"cryosphere\\" (layer of frozen ground) beneath the surface. As the floor of the graben subsided, water found its way up one or both of the faults in the crust that defined the edges of the graben and spilled into the depression, eventually filling it and overflowing at the lowest point on the rim to erode the Mangala Valles channels.Carr, M. 1979.

It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities . History In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, \\"The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting too much on HTML as opposed to native\\". He promised that Facebook would soon deliver a better mobile experience. Inside Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate UI elements for iOS from a background JavaScript thread. They decided to organise an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able to build native apps with this technology. After months of development, Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015. During a technical talk, Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App. Implementation The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge. React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster. React Native does not use HTML or CSS. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS which make it even more flexible. Hello World Example A Hello, World program in React Native looks like this: import React from 'react'; import { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react- native'; const HelloWorldApp = () => Hello world!; export default HelloWorldApp; // Skip this line if using Create React Native App AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorldApp); // The React native code can also be imported from another component with the following code: import HelloWorldApp from './HelloWorldApp'; See also * List of rich Internet application frameworks * Multiple phone web-based application framework * NativeScript * Xamarin * Appcelerator Titanium * Apache Cordova * Flutter (software) References Mobile software development Software using the MIT license Facebook software ","title":"React Native"},{"id":"48720991","text":"Jimmy Kennedy (born July 7, 1988) of Fox lake, Illinois is an American wrestler for New York Athletic Club who represented the United States at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships.

Military career  At the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, Rodríguez entered military school. In 1914 Rodriguez became a soldier in the Constitutionalist Army, under the command of General Francisco Coss. In the twenties, he collaborated with General Abelardo L. Rodríguez of Baja California to remove Colonel Esteban Cantu. As head of the territory of Baja California, Abelardo Rodriguez appointed Ramon Rodriguez as his private secretary. In 1932, as interim president of the nation, he named Ramón Rodríguez as first deputy chief and later as his chief of staff.  Governor  Upon returning to Querétaro in 1935, he won the National Lottery and with the funds launched a campaign for governor of Querétaro against the unpopular incumbent Saturnino Osornio amid threats and provocations from Osornio's people. Relations between Osornio and Rodríguez reached a nadir when Rodriguez and his entourage were hunting in Colón, and they were warned of an ambush to kill Rodríguez. After receiving and engaging gunfire, Rodríguez and his party escaped unharmed. After winning the election, Rodríguez reversed many of Osornio's policies: he stopped political and religious persecutions, reopened the Civil College (precursor of the Autonomous University of Querétaro), distributed lands in the valleys of San Juan and Querétaro, restored the civil and criminal courts, and removed, one by one, the deputies and mayors loyal to Osornio. In the city of Querétaro, he created the Escobedo Market (relocated 25 years later) and the Municipal Stadium. With these changes, half the population which had left under Osornio (the population had dwindled from 60,000 to 35,000 in his four years as governor) returned to Querétaro.  Commander  Having improved the government and the prestige of Querétaro, Ramon Rodriguez delivered the governorship, he rejoined the army and attends various battlefronts in World War II. At the conclusion of this, he was appointed representative of Mexico in the victory parade in London with the general Eulogio Ortiz and Jose Beltran. He then held various positions in the Secretariat of National Defense: personnel director, quartermaster general of the Army, director of pensions and commander of the military zone of Aguascalientes and Puebla.

The festival features local, regional, and national musicians. The festival maintains strong ties with the local community and seeks to highlight the long, distinguished history of Bluegrass music in Baltimore. History The Charm City Bluegrass Festival was founded in 2013 as the Charm City Folk & Bluegrass Festival when Jordan August and Phil Chorney, partners in the Baltimore Music Agency, wished to \\"put on bluegrass for everyone to see, whether it was on the porch, at a show, or a bigger party,\\" as a way to highlight Baltimore's rich history of bluegrass music. Its name was shortened to the Charm City Bluegrass Festival in 2017. The inaugural festival was a sold-out event held on the grounds of the Union Craft Brewery and featured a line-up headlined by Tony Trischka and Tim O'Brien (musician). For the second installment August and Chorney, moved to the much larger grounds of Druid Hill Park. The line-up featured Jerry Douglas, Noam Pikelny & Friends, Sierra Hull, Chris Eldridge & Julian Lage, and Cris Jacobs and saw the attendance almost double from the first year. In 2015 for the event's third year, the festival again returned to Druid Hill Park and expanded its line-up by adding a second stage. The 2015 line-up included The Travelin' McCourys, The Wood Brothers, Frank Solivan & Dirty Kitchen, Cris Jacobs, the Seldom Scene, and many others. In 2016 the Charm City Bluegrass returned to Druid Hill Park for a third straight year with a line-up that featured Ricky Skaggs, Keller Williams and the Traveling McCourys, Steep Canyon Rangers, Cris Jacobs, Sierra Hull, Cabinet, Colebrook Road, Man About A Horse and Ampersand Stringband.

An eminent and prolific composer, his best known works include his choral works (Tomorrow the Fox Will Come to Town, Though Your Strangeness Frets My Heart) and his Essays for the Piano. Biography Background and early life The son of Archibald and Verna Jones Binkerd, Gordon Binkerd was born in the Ponca Reservation in Lynch, Nebraska on May 22, 1916. He was the eldest of three boys. His father, who worked for the Bell Telephone Company, resettled the family in Gregory, South Dakota. His talent was first discovered at age fifteen when he was chosen as one of the five best pianists in America at a national competition in Marion, Indiana. In 1933, Binkerd left home to attend Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota. There, he benefited from associations with musicians such as Gail Kubik and Russell Danburg. Binkerd was also influenced by teachers who nurtured his interest in literature and poetry. He graduated from DWU in 1937. In 1940, Binkerd started masters studies at the Eastman School of Music, graduating with a degree in composition in 1941. During World War II, Binkerd served in the US Navy. His talent for composition began to ripen when he entered Harvard College in 1946. As a candidate for the PhD in musicology, his absorption of music of the past provided a historical base of knowledge that framed his compositional perspective. His skills were refined as a student of Walter Piston and as teaching assistant to Irving Fine. During his Harvard years, he lived in an apartment that did not have a piano. This forced him to learn to compose away from the instrument. In 1949, Binkerd became a theorist and composer at the University of Illinois. Each summer he participated in retreats in New Hampshire and New York in order to compose. After composing a few works that used the serial technique, he abandoned this approach in 1955. His harmonic language became more tonal, but tonal centers remained ambiguous. In the mid 1960s, Binkerd entered into a contract for the publication of all his music with the New York publishing house Boosey & Hawkes. By that time, he had already written three symphonies; a piano sonata; two string quartets; a growing list of sonatas for wind and string instruments and a large quantity of chamber, choral and vocal music, which his publisher began to release in 1965. He retired from academia in 1971 in order to fully devote himself to composition. His writing was brought to an end by the onset of Alzheimer's disease in 1996. Death Binkerd died of Alzheimer's disease Friday, September 5, 2003 at his Urbana, Illinois home. Achievements As a blooming composer Binkerd was the first professor at the University of Illinois to become a member of its Center for Advanced Study in 1959, only having entered as a regular teacher in 1949. Also in 1959, he became a Guggenheim fellowship recipient. In 1964, Binkerd received the National Institute of Arts and Letters award. As a composer he received many commissions for music from such institutions as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, the University of Illinois, South Dakota State University, the Fromm Music foundation and the Ford Foundation in 1973. Dakota Wesleyan University honored Binkerd as Alumnus of the Year in 1987 and awarded him an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts in 1996.

O'Hanlon is best known for a fresco painted on the wall of Memorial Hall at the University of Kentucky in 1934 for the Treasury Relief Art Project. The fresco has repeatedly attracted negative attention for what many view as its romanticized depiction of African American slaves. In 2020 University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto announced the fresco would be removed. Early life and education Ann Louise Rice was born in Ashland, Kentucky, the oldest of five siblings. From a young age, Rice showed an interest in art. Rice graduated from the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky with a Bachelor of Art Degree as an art major in 1932. Rice attended the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco for two years of post graduate training. Rice met Richard 'Dick' O'Hanlon, an artist, from Long Beach, California while attending school in California. They married and relocated to Kentucky in 1934. Career as artist University of Kentucky, Memorial Hall fresco O'Hanlon began working as an artist during the Great Depression in the United States. In order to provide work for unemployed artist, the United States Federal Government commissioned art projects. Through the Treasury Relief Art Project of the U.S. Treasury Department, O'Hanlon was commissioned to create a fresco for the foyer of Memorial Hall on the campus of the University of Kentucky. O'Hanlon painted a fresco which tells the history of Kentucky from the time of settlement through the 19th century. The fresco has repeatedly attracted negative attention for what many view as its romanticized depiction of African American slaves. In a 1964 interview, O'Hanlon addressed the depictions of African Americans in the painting, but did not elaborate on her decision to include representations of slaves in the center of the mural. Further, she claimed that during her childhood, there was not much racism and that Kentucky was more \\"tolerant\\" than other Southern states. In 2006, the Student Government Association attempted to have the mural removed. In November 2015 after a meeting with minority students at the University of Kentucky, University President Eli Capilouto, announced on a blog post and by email that the wall with the fresco would be shrouded until the university community comes to a permanent decision about how to deal with the fresco. Career as educator O'Hanlon started and taught at the Art Department at Dominican College in San Rafael, California. Sight & Insight Art Center In 1942, the O'Hanlon's bought a dairy farm in Marin County, California, and converted it into an art studio and their home. They opened up the land and buildings to artists. On the property the O'Hanlon's founded the Sight & Insight Art Center in 1969. After their death the organization continues as the O'Hanlon Center for the Arts.

Founded in 2012 by Michael Bruce and Kenny Bruce, it is backed by investors that include venture capital firm DN Capital as well as Neil Woodford, Paul Pindar, and Errol Damelin.  History  Becoming Public In December 2015, The Guardian reported that Purplebricks was set for flotation, and would début on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on 17 December, with an anticipated valuation of £240 million. In December 2016, it was reported that Purplebricks had made its first profit of £300,000. In the U.K., profit has risen to £5.7 million in the first half of the 2019 financial reporting period. International Expansion Purplebricks has expanded internationally. In August 2016 it launched in Australia, and in September 2017, Purplebricks was officially launched in the US. In 2018, the company purchased DuProprio, a Canadian real estate company that offers commission- free real estate services, for $51 million. They also launched in Germany that year, as part of a joint venture with Axel Springer. They bought a 25.9% stake in German online estate agency, Homeday. International Financial Losses In May 2019, Purplebricks vowed to shut down operations in Australia due to lack of profitability, after reporting an $18m interim loss for the six months to October. This came days after the CEO, Michael Bruce was laid off after disagreements with Paul Pindar over the failed overseas expansion. In July 2019, new CEO Vic Darvey announced that Purplebricks would be shutting down operations in the United States, announcing that operating costs had risen to almost £52.3 million, said that it would focus its attention on Britain and Canada.  Controversy  Purplebricks has faced a variety of criticism since its launch, primarily around the validity of online reviews. In August 2017, Purplebricks was featured on BBC's Watchdog following an investigation into claims of misleading customers. On 14 September 2017, consumer review website Trustpilot issued an open letter clarifying its Purplebricks review policy following allegations concerning the 'validity of reviews of Purplebricks by customers'. In September 2017, the company was accused of 'corporate bullying' following suspension from estate agent review website allAgents.co.uk. Purplebricks threatened the consumer review website with legal action over the publication of negative reviews due to the site's lack of vetting for those leaving reviews. In August 2018, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported troubling management and lacklustre sales issues. In February 2019, Purplebricks' share price dropped sharply after it lowered its US and Australia revenue forecasts. In May 2019, the AFR reported that \\"increasingly challenging market conditions\\" and \\"execution errors\\" contributed to Purplebricks closure of Australian operations.

The film contains no dialogue, with the cast communicating entirely in animalistic grunts. It premiered in August 2015 at London FrightFest Film Festival. In 2016 the film was released on DVD, Blu Ray and VOD on Icon Productions's Frightfest Presents label Aaaaaaaah! DVD / Blu Ray / VOD at Frightfest Presents Plot Two men, Smith (Steve Oram) and Keith (Tom Meeten) arrive in a woodland clearing. Smith cries over a photograph of his estranged wife before he and Keith perform a ritual in which they urinate on the photograph. Keith dries Smith's eyes and penis and they head downhill towards a vast suburban sprawl. In the Ryan family household a young woman, Denise (Lucy Honigman), is preparing dinner with her mother, Barabara (Toyah Willcox). They watch a cookery show in which the topless host (Shelley Longworth) prepares a meat, potato and salt dinner. Barabara copies the recipe and tenderises a steak by bashing it on the kitchen door. Smith and Keith arrive in town and decide to follow a scruffy man, Og (Sean Reynard) who masturbates in an underpass using a mouse. Smith and Keith rough him up and scare him. Og returns to his 'alpha', Ryan (Julian Rhind-Tutt) to tell him about these new threatening males, but Ryan gives him a beating and forces him to set up the new widescreen television. Ryan and Og sit down to play a motorbike game on the games console. The family eats dinner, but Og tries to have sex with Denise and she leaves the room. In the kitchen she sees her father, Jupiter (Julian Barratt) looking sadly in at the kitchen window. She gives him a Battenburg cake and they share a tender moment before Jupiter returns to the garden where he now lives. He lies under a tree with his cake, a broken man. We see a Flashback of a previous time when Jupiter was the alpha male of the house. He serves a Sunday Roast human leg to Barabara, Denise and Og. But Og disrupts the happy scene by confronting him aggressively, an act that Jupiter fails to deal with properly. The washing machine breaks down and Barabara rounds on Jupiter also. Back in the dinner room, the family eats pudding. Ryan initiates a food fight and covers Barabara with blancmange. Barabara retaliates and they have a huge fight. Denise storms out of the house, fed up with them all. In the park Denise meets up with her streetwise cousin Helen (Holli Dempsey) and they drink vodka together. Helen has itchy VD and Denise suggests she pour vodka down her crotch which she does. They go shoplifting and are caught by a shop assistant, Carl (Noel Fielding). The shop manager (Waen Shepherd) interrogates them in the basement and masturbates in front of them before falling asleep on his desk. Carl then gets Helen to give him a blow job, but Helen bites his penis off. The girls flee with some money from the cash box. A debauched party is now going on at the Ryan house. Denise and Helen return and flaunt the money they stole in front of Ryan but he is paralytic on drink and drugs and passes out. Smith and Keith arrive at the party and piss on the walls, scent marking it. They graffiti Ryan's sleeping face, then Keith rests his testicles on Ryan's head and Smith photographs it on Ryan's phone, which he returns to Ryan's pocket. Smith and Keith disrupt the party and Smith has sex with Denise in the bathroom. Smith, Keith and Denise leave the party. They break into an unoccupied house where Smith & Denise perform a 'wedding' ritual to celebrate their union. Next morning Ryan awakes, hungover and graffitied. He smokes outside and Jupiter laughs at his face. We see another flashback which charts Jupiter's fall from 'alpha' status. Barabara and Ryan, the washing machine repair man, flirt. Ryan then forms an alliance with Og before Ryan and Barabara have sex on top of the washing machine in front of Jupiter. Ryan and Og then beat Jupiter senseless, goaded on by Barabara, while Denise looks on distraught. Ryan sees the photograph on his phone of Keith's testicles resting on his head and is furious. He and Og head out on the warpath and clash with Smith and Keith on some waste ground. Keith is stabbed by Og before Smith chases Og, smashing his head on the ground and killing him. Smith then rips Ryan's arm off and leaves him for dead. Smith and Denise return to the house. Smith smashes up the kitchen in a display to convince Barabara of his new alpha status, but she is unconvinced. He tries to have sex with her but can not get it up and Barabara laughs at him. Smith collects Keith's body and gives him a 'funeral' before placing his corpse in the wheelie bin. Barabara is also unimpressed by this. Smith invites Jupiter into the house and tries to involve him in the new 'family' group, but Jupiter only manages to wet his pants before sitting alone repeatedly watching an inane children's TV show involving an animated chicken. Smith repairs the house and gradually begins to win Barabara over. They all sit down to watch a sitcom starring two big comedy stars (Tony Way and Alice Lowe) which features slo-mo action replays of lame pratfalls. They all enjoy it and Jupiter seems to get his 'voice' back. This delights Denise and they seem to be a happy 'family' at last. In the night Jupiter stabs Barabara, Smith and Denise to death, then sits back down to watch the animated chicken on TV.

The primary objective is to seal off the northern Hama border with Idlib and \\"build a buffer-zone around the city of Khan Sheikhoun\\". It has been described as the first major Syrian-Russian coordinated attack since the start of the Syrian Civil War. The offensive was extended in the subsequent days to the al-Ghab plains, between northwest Hama and southwest Idlib, as well as to the edge of the Latakia governorate.  Timeline  Syrian Government offensive On the 7 October, the Syrian Army backed by the National Defence Forces and Russian airstrikes launched the offensive against the rebel-held villages of Kafr Nabouda, Qala'at Al-Madayq, Lahaya, Al-Mughayr, Latmin, Al-Lataminah, Kafr Zita and Markabah. According to the SOHR, eight vehicles and tanks of the Army were destroyed by the rebels in the initial phase of the offensive, while it also stated that rebel bases and vehicles were bombed at the same time. Later that day, the Army advanced in Latmin, while the rebels reportedly destroyed three more tanks on the shifting frontline. Meanwhile, rebels launched a counter-attack on Murak and reportedly captured a hill. The Russian Air Force conducted at least 40 airstrikes that day. Conversely, pro-government sources listed the destruction of 10 tanks and BMPs. The Army captured Al-Mughayr, Markabah, Tal Sakhar and Tal Uthman that day, while it was also claimed that the village of Al-Haweez and the town of Kafr Nabouda were temporally held before a strong rebel counter-attack allegedly pushed them back to Latmin. The next day, rebels downed a Syrian or Russian helicopter near Kafr Nabouda, with a possible second one nearby. The SOHR reported that the rebels regained some ground in the area of Kafr Nabouda and destroyed an APC in the progress. On the 9 October, the military captured most of the hilly Jubb al-Ahmar region. The SOHR also reported that the Army was still trying to capture Atshan (previously reported as captured), while the rebels destroyed and damaged six tanks that day. On the 10 October, the Syrian Army captured the strategically important villages of Atshan and Om Hartein and the Sukayk hill, while also making attempts to push onwards to capture Khan Shaykhun in southern Idlib province. A number of government tanks and APC's were targeted during the clashes. Hezbollah senior leader Hassan Hussein al-Haj and a rebel commander were killed that day during the takeover of Tal Sukayk. On the 11 October, Hezbollah backed by the Army captured al- Bahsa in the al-Ghab plains, while rebels destroyed a tank. In addition, the Army also advanced from Morek and Atshan. On the morning of the 12 October, the Army captured the southern part of Kafr Nabuda, which coincided with 30 Russian airstrikes and hundreds of shells and rockets fired by government forces. Soon after, the military secured the town and also seized the village of Mansoura, in the al-Ghab plain, and Sukayk, just inside Idlib province. However, a subsequent rebel counter-attack later in the day recaptured Kafr Nabuda. This came after jihadist rebel reinforcements arrived. At least 25 pro-government fighters, including 7 Hezbollah militiamen, had been killed since the assault on Kafr Nabuda started. Another 20 Hezbollah fighters had also been wounded. On the 13 October, government forces captured Lahaya, while clashes continued in the outskirts of Kafr Nabuda. That day, two Iranian colonels were killed on the Hama frontline. Beside the reinforcements, the rebels were deploying an \\"extensive amount\\" of BGM-71 TOW's along the frontline and announced a counter-offensive to \\"retake Hama\\". It was also reported that Hezbollah had concentrated all its fighters in the northwest of Syria for the offensive. On the 14 October, government forces captured the villages of Fawru and Sirmaniyah in the al-Ghab plain. By this point, in the opinion of the ISW, the Syrian government achieved limited success in the offensive's first week, capturing 6 villages while suffering heavy casualties. On the 15 October, government forces captured the village of al-Safsafah in the Ghab plains. In response to the Russian-backed offensive by the Syrian Army, the jihadist Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria sent fighters to the Ghab Plain to support rebels in fighting against the Syrian Army, Iranian, and Hezbollah forces. Photos of Uyghur fighters from Turkistan Islamic Party were released with captions in Arabic that said \\"standing up strongly to the Nusayri army and the Russians.\\" Jab al-Ahmar and Ghamaam in Latakia's countryside where Turkistan Islamic Party fighters were transferred from Idlib in response to the Russian intervention.http://www.tayyar.org/News/Print/42931 On the 19 October, the military restarted operations, after the offensive was paused for the weekend. Government fighters temporally captured parts of the Mansoura grain silos before a rebel counter-attack reversed their gains. A rebel brigade commander was killed at the silos. By the next day, 16 government fighters were killed. Rebel counter-offensive On the 23 October, rebels captured al-Dil and also launched attacks on Sukayk hill and village. That day, rebels continued to advance, while Russian airplanes bombed a rebel headquarters. Also a rebel spokesman claimed that the losses of the SAA reached 57 armored vehicles during the course of the Hama (Northwestern) Offensive. At the end of the day, rebels recaptured the villages of Maarkaba and Lahaya. The clashes led to the death of at least 12 rebels and 14 government fighters and the capture of two army vehicles. On the 24 October, Russian airplanes bombed a field hospital near al-Latamneh, killing a number of rebels and wounding medical personnel. Meanwhile, rebels were preparing to attack the Mork area. On the 25 October, three Hama-based Free Syrian Army linked groups merged into the Jaysh al-Nasr. Meanwhile, a Syrian colonel and three soldiers were killed in the Dorin-Isterbah area, while the experienced BGM-71 TOW operator Abu Omar \\"TOW\\" was killed in Hama. A sandstorm forcibly halted all military operations at the end of day. On the 26 October government forces, supported by heavy Russian airstrikes, reportedly recaptured Mansura in the Al-Ghab plain. A Jaysh al-Islam field commander was killed that day. On the 27 October, rebels destroyed at least two tanks and one APC in the northern countryside of Hama, while at least 10 rebels were killed. On the 28 October, fighting around Morek damaged two Army tanks, while another vehicle was also targeted. That day, rebels recaptured the village of Sukayk while government forces retreated from an area north of Morek. Two officers and a rebel leader were killed in the clashes. According to analysis by al-Masdar News, if the rebels can capture Morek, they will be in a good position to attack the two towns of Souran and Taybat Al-Imam which would allow them to begin their large-scale attack on the city of Hama. At the end of the day, government forces regained positions against ISIL at the Salamiya–Ithiriya highway. On the 31 October, 20 rebel factions attacked Morek. 7 Hezbollah fighters were killed in a case of friendly fire by the Russian air force amidst a series of bombing operations against the rebels, according to a Lebanese news source.\\"7 Hezbollah members killed by mistake in Syria by Russian airstrike\\", Ya Libnan News, Oct. 30 2015. On the 3 November, rebels captured Tall-Uthman hill, al-Janabra hill, Hamidid gas station and a position west of Morek. Rebels damaged two tanks with BGM-71 TOW, destroyed other vehicles and also seized two tanks and an APC. Five rebels, including a commander and a leader, were killed that day. At the end of the day, government forces bombed and shelled Khan Sheikhoun, killing four civilians. On the 4 November, rebels downed a Syrian MiG-21 above Tall-Uthman hill. The pilot was killed due to a failing parachute. In the evening, around 10pm, the Syrian army was forced to abandon the strategic town of Morek after a massive rebel assault. Government forces recaptured al-Bani and reportedly also Tall- Uthman hill. On the 5 November, rebels fully secured the town of Morek after repelling a number of Army counter-attacks. A rebel leader and a number of other rebels, as well as dozens of soldiers were killed and wounded around Morek. Analysis by a source close to the government (Al-Masdar) has attributed the quick collapse of SAA in Murak to the ISIL attack on the government's only supply route to the Aleppo Governorate. This loss caused an imminent emergency in Aleppo that subsequently forced the Military High Command to initiate a massive redeployment, which resulted in the thinning of the northeastern Hama line of defense. After this, the SAA line of defense stabilized north of Ma'an and Souran. At the end of the day, rebels advanced inside the village of Atshan and killed a number of soldiers and officers (including a brigadier general), and recaptured Tell Sukayk hill. 16 Hezbollah fighters were killed in a second friendly-fire incident after Russian Air Force bombed their position in Idlib province, while 5 rebels (mostly field commanders) were killed in Hama. On the 6 November, rebels recaptured Atshan, Umm Hartein, al- Hilal poultry farms, al-Naddaf poultry farms, al-Easawi checkpoints and al- Tawil hill. At least 16 soldiers and officers, as well as several rebels were killed in the clashes. The rebels continued their advance and further captured the villages of Qubaybat Abu al Huda, Tell Swan hill and Mantana in the Hama countryside while the Alawite village of Maan was besieged from the north and east. Later, Syrian troops in coordination with their allies reportedly captured the villages of Al-Kareem, Ramleh, Qabr Fidah and Al-Ashrafiyah after they reportedly secured Safsafa in the Al-Ghaab Plains. On the 9 November, rebels captured Al-Mughayr village and the Al-'Abboud Checkpoint south of Morek. Eight rebels (including a military leader) were killed that day. On the 10 November, NDF in coordination with the SSNP counter-attacked against the rebels and allegedly recaptured the village of Al-Mughayr, the hill Tal Al- Sakhr and Grain Silos directly south of rebel-held town of Kafr Naboudeh. Aftermath – Subsequent offensives In mid-October 2015, concurrently with the offensive in Hama and Idlib, government forces launched a large-scale offensive in the northern Latakia countryside. By late November, they had seized 200 square kilometers of territory. The objective of the operation was to take control of rebel-held territory in the Latakia Governorate bordering Turkey. Meanwhile, the rebels themselves launched an offensive in the northern part of Hama at the end of November, with the aim of capturing a string of villages along the highway to Damascus. After initially taking control of several villages and checkpoints, an Army counterattackأكثر من 30 استشهدوا وقضوا وقتلوا خلال معارك الكر والفر بريف حماة الشمالي وجرحي في انفجار قرب سراقب recaptured all areas lost. In addition, government forces also captured Tell Huwayr hill, overlooking the town of Morek. By mid-March 2016, the military captured over 750 square kilometers of territory in northeastern Latakia, which represented 64% of rebel territory in the province. In mid-April, the rebels, led by Jund al-Aqsa and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, started a new offensive to retake areas they had previously lost in the al-Ghab Plain, exploding a car bomb at a grain silos near the village of Mansura. Concurrently, an assault was launched in Latakia province where the rebels captured half of the Qalat Mountains and the village of al-Bayda.

She was one of the first women ministers to be granted sole authority over a large English church. She is remembered mainly for the strongly feminist biblical exegesis in her 1964 book Women and Religion. Early life Margaret Brackenbury Crook was born on 5 May 1886 in Dymock, England, the eldest of three children of Ellen Brackenbury Crook and Rev. L. G. Harris Crook, a Unitarian minister. He great uncle was the Liberal MP for Bolton, Joseph Crook. Her great-grandfather was another notable Unitarian minister, George Harris. Her father died when she was eight years old, an event that spurred in her a desire to carry on his ministry.  Education  Open Christmas letter from the Suffragettes of Manchester, signed by, among others, Brackenbury Crook. In 1910, Crook began college studies through the Society of Oxford Home Students, which later became St Anne's College, Oxford. At the time, Oxford did not grant degrees to women, so Crook received her B.A. (with first-class honors) from the University of London, in 1913. The following year, Oxford University awarded her a diploma in anthropology with distinction. In 1914, Crook sought admission to Manchester College, Oxford for ministerial studies but met with difficulties. College trustees accepted that she was intellectually qualified and showed potential as a minister, but questioned the \\"normalcy\\" of a woman attempting to become a Unitarian minister. She was eventually admitted and remained at the college for three years, graduating first in her class and gaining her certificate in 1917. While at Manchester College, Crook became a social activist, joining the Young Liberal Women in Wolverhampton and the Women’s Social and Political Union, both women's suffrage groups. She also worked with the Quakers on matters to do with court cases involving conscientious objectors to World War I. During the height of the war, in 1916-17, she went to France to carry out refugee work with the Friends War Relief Committee, later writing about her experiences in the story collection The Track of the Storm. Ministry and academic career After the war, Crook took up a posting as minister at the 18th century Octagon Chapel in Norwich, thereby becoming the first Unitarian woman minister to be given sole authority over a large church. During her tenure there, she reorganized the Sunday school and set up a play center for children. She left in 1920 to join her mother and two brothers, who had moved to America. In America, Crook had difficulty finding a posting because the president of the American Unitarian Association, Samuel Atkins Eliot, actively excluded women ministers. Crook instead took the post of executive secretary of the American branch of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, which was based in New York. Crook toured women's colleges, speaking to students about the league's objectives. When the president of Smith College, William Allan Neilson, heard her speak, he offered her a position in the Department of Religion and Biblical Literature. Her family joined her in Northampton, Massachusetts when she took up her associate professorship in 1921, and she supported them financially. Reinventing herself as a professor of religious studies—a position she would hold for 33 years—Crook specialized in biblical scholarship, especially the Hebrew Old Testament, and joined the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis (a scholarly organization) and the National Association of Biblical Instructors. She also served as president (1942) of the Corporation of the American Schools of Oriental Research. She published numerous articles and reviews in her area of research, some devotional poems, and four books. She wrote eight of the 20 essays in the 1937 anthology The Bible and Its Literary Associations, which she also edited. Crook's contributions emphasize the links between the Bible and the stories of other ancient cultures such as Egypt and Babylon, discuss the range of religious texts that were excluded from the Bible, and examine the difficulties of Biblical translation. Her 1956 book The Cruel God is a re- examination of the Book of Job in light of contemporary Biblical scholarship. Crook's last published book, Women and Religion (1964), offered an overtly feminist examination of the Bible and the ways in which it has been interpreted over the centuries. In her reassessment of the Scriptures and the history of women's participation in western religion, she argued that there was a significant theological cost to pursuing a path that kept women at a lower status within the church. Pragmatically, she noted how much damage Samuel Atkins Eliot and his kind had done to the Unitarian ministry in the United States, where women ministers had declined from 29 in 1900 to 2 active ministers in 1948. Crook acknowledged that Women and Religion was inspired in part by her reading of Betty Friedan’s 1963 book The Feminine Mystique. Reviews of the book were mixed, with praise centering on Crook's sophisticated scholarship; it would take another two decades for religious scholars to begin championing the book for its specifically feminist ideas. In 1923–24, Crook went on a speaking tour throughout the eastern United States, lecturing on subjects such as women in the ministry, Christian fundamentalism, and the peace movement. Crook was also supportive of the local Unitarian Church, where she worked with women and children in various capacities. Despite the fact that she was never able to get the American Unitarian Association to recognize her as a minister, she wrote at one point: \\"I have always considered my life- work in religion a ministry\\". In addition to her academic work, Crook was heavily involved in a variety of organizations. She was a member of the St. Anne's Society, the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, the National Association of Biblical Instructors, the American Association of University Professors, served as the Smith College representative on the Corporation of the American Schools of Oriental Research, was an honorary lecturer at the Jerusalem school of Oriental research during the summer of 1934, served as president and honorary secretary of the Alumni of the American Schools of Oriental Research in 1943, 1942. She also served as president of the Women's Alliance of the Unitarian Church of Northampton and Florence, Massachusetts. Crook retired from Smith College in 1954 but continued her scholarly research as an emerita professor for another eight years under the title of Sophia Smith Fellow. In that same decade, she returned to Manchester College, her ministerial alma mater, as a visiting lecturer.  Death  Crook lived in Northampton with her brother Waldo, who took care of her for the last few years of her life when her health began to fail. Crook died on 24 May 1972, just after finishing a book (still unpublished) on the Apostle Paul.

He earned his Ph.D. under S.F. Light and Ralph Smith at the University of California, Berkeley. Abbott was an expert on ascidian tunicates and an authority on all forms of invertebrate animals. He was an influential teacher, researcher, author, and student mentor. His wife, Isabella Abbott, was a world authority on marine algae of the Pacific. Personal life Donald P. Abbott was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States, on 14 October 1920. His father, a physician and professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, died in 1936 at the age of 52. Within months of his father's death, Abbott left Chicago. By 1937 he arrived in Hawaii and enrolled in the University of Hawaii at Manoa to study zoology. While there he met Isabella \\"Izzie\\" Aiona, a botany student. Abbott graduated in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in zoology and remained at the University of Hawaii as an instructor when his graduate studies were interrupted by the outbreak of WWII. Donald and Izzie married in 1943. That same year Donald enlisted in the US Army and was assigned to the Chemical Warfare Service. After the war, Donald and Izzie moved to California, where they both pursued graduate degrees at the University of California, Berkeley, Donald in zoology and Izzie in botany. Donald earned an M.S. degree in zoology in 1948 and a Ph.D. degree in 1950. Izzie earned her Ph.D. in botany in 1950. During the summers of 1948 and 1949 Donald worked as a teaching assistant for the University of California for its summer courses taught at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University. In 1950 he accepted an offer to join the faculty at the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA, where he spent his entire professional career. In 1953 Donald participated in a research cruise to Ifaluk Atoll, Micronesia, but was struck down by polio mellitus when he returned and nearly lost his life. As he recovered he feared that he may never walk again, though he eventually did, but with a slight limp. This brush with death gave him an intensity of focus and drive that became the hallmark of his life and work. When Donald retired in 1982 he and Izzie returned to Hawaii, where Izzie accepted a faculty position at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Donald died in 1986 after a prolonged battle with cancer. He remained active professionally right until the end, meeting with colleagues to discuss projects and manuscripts even the day before his passing. Abbott and Izzie have one child, a daughter, Annie Abbott Foerster. Professional career In 1950 Stanford University hoped to recruit the prominent British zoologist Charles Maurice Yonge to join the Faculty of Hopkins Marine Station. Dr. Yonge declined but recommended Donald Abbott to the search committee. Abbott was subsequently offered an instructorship at Hopkins (he was also offered instructorship positions at Yale and Columbia University). He accepted Stanford's offer and joined the faculty at Hopkins Marine Station, where he remained his entire career (1950–1982). Abbott was an active researcher, but his greatest legacy was as a teacher. His courses were among the most popular ever offered at Hopkins Marine Station. He influenced hundreds of students in his invertebrate zoology course (111H-112H) and the Hopkins \\"Spring Course.\\" Abbott was also an effective graduate student mentor, supervising 25 students who earned Ph.D. degrees and 10 more who earned master's degrees. In addition to his many research publications, Abbott contributed to two major books that are constantly used by invertebrate zoologists even now, decades after they were published. He was invited to contribute to the book Light's Manual: Intertidal Invertebrates of the Central California Coast and was the principal author and editor of Intertidal Invertebrates of California, which is often simply and affectionally referred to as The Big Book. In 1975 Abbott was awarded the Stanford University H&S; Dean's Award for Teaching. At the 1982 Commencement of Stanford University, Abbott was also awarded the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for Outstanding Service to Undergraduate Education. Abbott's career and his contributions to the fields of invertebrate zoology and marine biology were commemorated in a symposium held in his honor on 20–23 November 1987 at the Asilomar Conference Center, Asilomar, California, US. It was sponsored by The Hopkins Marine Station and Stanford University. More than 150 of Abbott's colleagues, students, and friends attended these scientific meetings and many of them presented research that covered the wide span of topics that would have interested him.

Founded in 2000, the group was formed in response to the decision of sister organization the 501st Legion to remain dedicated to Galactic Empire costumes. The Rebel Legion makes appearances at private and public events, including charitable events and official Star Wars promotional events. The organization does not charge a fee for appearances, instead encouraging a donation to a charity. It is divided into \\"bases\\" located throughout the world, and as of November 2019, the Rebel Legion membership is approximately 8,000 members. Though not affiliated with Lucasfilm, the organization is sanctioned by Lucasfilm.  History  In early 2000, the 501st Legion Star Wars costuming group chose to remain \\"Imperials only\\". This prompted 501st members Tony Troxell, Richard Fairbrother, Ed O'Connell, Ken Ograyensek, and Doug Fesko to create a separate \\"Rebels only\\" costuming group, officially announced to the 501st Legion forums in December 2000. Though not affiliated with Lucasfilm, the Rebel Legion is officially sanctioned by Lucasfilm.  Structure  The Rebel Legion is divided into detachments determined by the type of character costumes represent.

It was built by Augustus in honour of his wife Livia Drusilla and is located on the Esquiline Hill. Although little of its structure survives now, it was one of the most prominent porticos in the ancient city. The so-called Ara Concordia was located either in or near to the portico.  Location  Map of Regio III (Isis and Serapis) by Rodolfo Lanciani (The ruins & excavations of ancient Rome, London 1897) The portico is located in Regio III of ancient Rome, which is named for a sanctuary of Isis in the area, and includes parts of the Esquiline and Oppian hills. The structure itself was found between the Via delle Sette Sale and the Via in Selci (the latter was called the \\"Clivus Suburanus\\" in ancient times). The structure was built on the estate of a rich freedman named Publius Vedius Pollio, who left his house and land to Augustus upon his death. His large estate was in the midst of the fairly crowded Subura neighbourhood, and the new leisure space was probably welcomed by the residents of the area. The portico was so close to the Baths of Trajan that the north corner of the baths almost touched the southwest corner of the portico. To the north of the portico, a basilica was built in late antiquity (San Martino ai Monti), although there are remains of a Roman building below it that some say was a house-church on the property of an early Christian named Equitius. Nero's sprawling house, the Domus Aurea, was built just south of this portico as well.  Construction  Construction began on the portico in approximately 15 BCE upon the death of Vedius Pollio, and it was dedicated in January of 7 BCE. The dedication was connected with the celebration of a triumph of Tiberius, and both Tiberius and Livia hosted banquets for the occasion. Livia alone received credit for the Ara Concordia, which was dedicated separately from the portico on June 11, the feast day of Mater Matuta.  Structure and archaeology  There are no visible remains of the portico today, but its dimensions and basic structure are known. It was rectangular, measuring about 120 meters in length and 95 meters in width; one of the short ends was aligned with the Clivus Suburanus. The Severan Marble Plan (see image above) thankfully preserves parts of the portico, showing its large rectangular shape, the double colonnade, the rectangular enclosure in the middle, and the access points to the streets. The portico included gardens, walking space, and works of art such as paintings, creating a luxurious and leisurely area. It is notable that this was a public space, and its construction supported Augustus' ideals of reducing private displays of wealth in favour of public building projects. Archaeological excavations in 1984 show that the portico was almost completely destroyed; the only evidence that remains is the rough floor levels and later burials on the site.  Literary evidence  The portico is mentioned in a variety of ancient works. Ovid's description in his Fasti emphasizes Livia's piety in dedicating the Ara Concordia, as well as the significance of Augustus replacing a luxurious private house. Ovid also includes the Porticus of Livia in his Ars Amatoria list of good places to pick up women: Strabo the geographer names the portico as one of the most splendid monuments in central Rome. Suetonius lists it in his Lives of the Caesars as one of the monuments that Augustus built on behalf of his family members (along with the portico of Octavia, the theatre of Marcellus, and others). Cassius Dio also mentions the portico in his Roman History, which was written about 200 years after the portico was constructed. In Book 54 of his work he criticizes the character of Vedius Pollio, describing him as so wealthy and so cruel that he threw his slaves into a pool of carnivorous eels if they displeased him. Allegedly, Augustus visited Pollio and was displeased with his cruelty; therefore, after Pollio died and left the emperor his estate, Augustus' choice to tear down his house was based as much on spite as on the desire to build a public work in Livia's name. In Book 55 of his History, he also describes Tiberius' involvement with the portico and the festivities that accompanied its dedication. The temple of Concordia which Tiberius worked to repair was in the Roman forum, and it is not related to the Ara Concordia attributed to Livia. Pliny the Elder mentions the portico in his Natural History as well, but only in reference to a certain vine which grew over the walkways of the portico, supposedly capable of producing 12 amphorae of juice per year. Pliny the Younger also references the portico of Livia in his Letters simply as a private meeting place. The monument is also listed in Regio III of the Notitia, the 4th century Regionary Catalogues of Rome.  Ara Concordiae  Most scholars assume that the rectangular structure in the middle of the portico is the Ara Concordia, since Livia was strongly connected to the deity and the Ara is mentioned by Ovid in connection with this portico. The layout of the center structure is reminiscent of the Ara Pacis, with what seems to be an outer enclosure and an inner altar area; there were four fountains on the corners of the enclosure. However, the Ara Concordia is not named in the Severan Marble Plan, and it is not certain that this is the \\"magnificent shrine\\" (magnifica aede) to which Ovid is referring, or if the Ara Concordia was somewhere else nearby. Wherever it was located though, this altar would have been an important symbol of the traditional family values that Augustus so strongly supported during his reign. The \\"aede\\" of Concordia could be interpreted as a symbol of marital harmony between Livia and Augustus; the surrounding portico would have been another symbol of family unity due to its dedication by Livia and her son.  Later use  According to excavations carried out in 1984, there is evidence that the portico area continued to be used into the 5th century CE. These excavations discovered the Augustan-era paving, as well as post-Augustan levels (these levels being 10–6 meters below the current surface level). However, by the mid-6th century CE, the area was being used for burials instead.

In 1893–94, she toured the United States, Europe and Russia, performing for heads of state such as Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II. She married Honolulu Mayor John H. Wilson and was recognized as the \\"Honorary First Lady\\" of Hawaii.  Early life  Ana Kini Kapahukulaokamāmalu Kuululani McColgan Huhu was born in Honolulu on March 4, 1872, the fourteenth child of Hawaiian Kalaʻiolele and Irish tailor and sugarcane plantation owner John C. McColgan. She became the hānai daughter of Kapahukulaokamāmalu, a stranger who had passed by and assisted her mother in her birth. Because Kapahukulaokamāmalu and her husband Kuʻula were childless, Kalaiolele gave her daughter in hānai to the couple. She was called Kini Kapahu after her hānai mother. She grew up next door to King Kalākaua and attended school for just three years. She learned to dance the hula from her mother, a court dancer and chanter. When she was 14, the King invited her to join the court's hula dancer troupe, Hui Lei Mamo. Although Kapahukulaokamāmalu opposed the public performance of the dance at the time, Queen Kapiʻolani later convinced her to give her permission when Kini was 16. She was one of seven dancers for the King and received training in Hawaiian dance, ballroom dance, singing and ukulele.  Career   World dance tour  Kini Kapahu (standing center) with other members of Queen Liliuokalani's Hui Lei Mamo Singing Girls, 1894 Following the King's death in 1891, Kini learned Hawaiian dance from Kauaʻians Kapaona and Namakeʻelua. She learned the sacred, traditional forms hula pahu and hula ālaʻapapa. In 1893, she toured the United States, performing in San Francisco, in Portland, Oregon, and at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The following year she toured Europe, performing in Paris at the Folies Bergère, in Germany for Kaiser Wilhelm II and in Russia for Tsar Nicholas II. She returned to Chicago in 1895. Kapahu was the member of touring Hawaiian dance troupes in the following years. She performed at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898 and the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901. She related that she invented the tī leaf skirt.  Marriage, suffrage and politics  Kapahu married engineer John H. Wilson on May 8, 1908. They moved to Molokaʻi and lived in the Pelekunu Valley where Kapahu farmed taro and was postmistress. They returned to Honolulu in 1919 where Wilson was elected Honolulu's mayor. Following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Kapahu organized a meeting for the territory's women to \\"discuss the new sphere of womanhood as created by the equal suffrage amendment.\\" Thereafter she supported her husband's political career; he was reelected mayor and served as the territory's postmaster and administrator of Social Security and Public Welfare.  Death and legacy  The Hawaii State Legislature designated Kapahu as \\"Honorary First Lady\\" after the admission to the union in 1959. In December 1960, Kapahu went to ʻIolani Palace to cast one of Hawaii's four electoral votes for that year's presidential election. She died on July 24, 1962 at the Queen's Hospital in Honolulu following a mild stroke, aged 90. She was buried beside her husband at Oahu Cemetery in the Nuʻuanu Valley. In March 2017, Hawaiʻi Magazine listed Kapahu among a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.  References   Further reading  *Peterson, Barbara Bennett, ed. Notable Women of Hawaii.

Upon her death, she was accorded an official state day of mourning and was posthumously inducted into the Order of Merit of the State of Bahia. Early life and education Cleusa da Conceição Nazaré de Oliveira was born in 1923 in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil to Maria Escolástica da Conceição Nazareth (known as Mãe Menininha do Gantois or Mother Menininha) and her husband Álvaro MacDowell de Oliveira. As is customary among some of Brazil's Afro-Brazilian communities, her surname reflects her matrilineal descent. Cleusa's mother Menininha was one of the most celebrated Candomblé iyalorixás in Brazil: of royal Yoruba ancestry, she served as the high priestess of the Terreiro do Gantois for nearly 65 years. Cleusa grew up in the order, Ilê Ìyá Omi Àse Iyámasé (House of the Mother of Waters) of Gantois and though it is traditional for the oldest daughter to take over upon the Mother's death, she did not want a religious life. She enrolled at Federal University of Bahia and studied medicine, graduating with her degree in 1946. Career Shortly after graduation, she moved to Rio de Janeiro, and began working as an obstetrician. For seven years, she worked as a doctor in Rio and then in 1953, she married Eraldo Diogenes Millet, an officer in the Navy. They subsequently had three children and the family traveled around the world. When her husband retired, Cleusa closed her office in Rio in 1965 and they moved back to Salvador. For a while she continued practicing medicine in Bahia, but increasingly she found herself offering medical services for free, delivering babies at home, or helping in the neighborhood. The community and social work soon began to be the focus of her life and she stopped making rounds at the hospital, finding herself helping her mother more and more as she aged. Her mother died in 1986 and as per custom, three years would pass before her successor was named. In 1989, Cleusa became the priestess of the Terreiro do Gantois following the selection of the shells by the orisha. Once she became iyalorixá (sometimes translated as mother-of-saints, mother-of-orishas or priestess), Cleusa held the highest office of Candomblé and became a spiritual guide for her followers. She advised, made predictions, presided at ritual services, as well as performing community services, protecting the faith and preserving its traditions. Cleusa died on 15 October 1998 in the Alliance Hospital in Salvador. The governor of Bahia, César Borges, declared an official day of mourning for the state. She was buried in the Jardim da Saudade Cemetery. In 2008 she was awarded the Order of Merit of Bahia for her community service to the area surrounding the Terreiro do Gantois.

After an initial blooding from 23–27 March 1969 during Operation Duck, three Royal Lao Army irregular battalions trained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were launched on Operation Junction City Jr. On 28 July 1969, a Royalist force occupied the airfield at Vang Tai, to begin the offensive. Moving out in August under tactical air cover directed by Raven FACs and Nail FACs, elements of the Royalist force captured the Route 9/23 road junction near Pathet Lao- held Moung Phine on 4 September. After capturing Moung Phine, the Royalists extended the campaign in an attempt to neutralize Tchepone during September, foreshadowing the future Operation Lam Son 719. By 17 October 1969, Operation Junction City Jr. had been pushed back to its point of departure; however, it had destroyed supplies sufficient to have kept a communist division in the field.

Following the French defeat at Dien Ben Phu and the subsequent 1954 Geneva Agreements a neutral Laos gained its independence.

Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30-34. As the Laotian Civil War flared from 1961 onward, the CIA carried out a paramilitary program designed to foster a guerrilla army to support the Royal Lao Government (RLG). Paralleling that, the U.S. Department of Defense covertly supported the Royal Lao Army and other Lao armed forces through a sub rosa supply system, as the U.S. picked up the entire budget of Laos. The Annamese Cordillera in southern Laos became the haven for a communist logistics network, the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The communist war effort in South Vietnam depended on that supply route.Castle, pp. 107–110. In Military Region 3 (MR 3) of Laos a tacit nonaggression pact existed between Royalists and Communists. The Royalist stronghold at Savannakhet could threaten the Trail. In turn, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces guarding the Trail were strong enough to launch serious attacks against the Savannakhet Plains and the Mekong Valley if they wished. However, so long as the RLG maintained a minimal garrison, they were generally undisturbed. Then the CIA launched Operation Junction City Jr.Conboy, Morrison, p. 268. Preliminary action The CIA paramilitary agents in MR 3 were unique in the Laotian Civil War in the direct control they were allowed to exert on their irregular operations. In early 1969, MR 3 hosted three Royalist guerrilla battalions newly trained by the CIA at its Savannakhet base. On 23 March, two of Red Battalion's companies, with 115 men apiece, were tasked with the Operation Duck raid on an enemy complex housed in a cave southeast of Mahaxay. The purpose of the raid was to destroy the complex while gathering enemy documents for military intelligence analysis. Helilifted in by the 20th Special Operations Squadron (20th SOS) and Air America under air cover of U.S. Air Force (USAF) tactical fighter strikes, the guerrillas were heavily engaged by the PAVN. Four times the communist headquarters was struck by U.S. Air Force jets depositing napalm, cluster bomb units, and 2,000 pound bombs. After suffering four killed, and having killed 40 of their foe, the raiders noted an incoming thunderstorm that would halt air strikes and fled southwards.Ahern, p. 358. On 26 March, eight CH-3E helicopters of the 20th SOS began evacuating the Red Battalion troops. They removed 70, but received battle damage from heavy ground fire to five helicopters, and aborted the mission. The remaining Royalist troops evaded the communists and moved to Route 122 to be removed on 27 March. Despite these disappointing results, the new guerrilla force was deemed ready for further action.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 217–218. Operation Junction City Jr. On 28 July 1969, one company of Red Battalion was helicoptered in to Tang Vai on Route 111 and seized the airfield there with no opposition. As Tang Vai lay 31 kilometers from friendly forces, on the edge of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the lack of opposition was surprising. The next day, a battalion of the Royal Lao Army was flown in. On 2 August, Green Battalion was also helilifted in, they moved out east under an umbrella of air support from both the USAF and the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF). When they struck Route 111, Red Battalion headed northeast toward the communist positions at Muong Phine. Green Battalion moved southwards, then turned to the east.Conboy, Morrison, p. 218. Arrangements were made for RLAF T-28s and U.S. Air Force A-1E Skyraiders to fly air cover for the Royalist forces, amassing only 200 sorties in the month between 28 July and 28 August.Anthony, Sexton, p. 316. On 28 August, the offensive operation was extended, with the aim of occupying Moung Phine for a week and blocking the intersection of Routes 9 and 23 nine kilometers west of the town. As Moung Phine was the only Pathet Lao-held town in the Laotian panhandle, and served as a communist sanctuary, it was a prime target because it had been off limits to air strikes. The renewed operation was facetiously dubbed Junction City Jr. after both the 1967 operation in South Vietnam and the road junction objective.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 218 – 219. White Battalion was now lifted into Vang Tai. While it marched east to join Green battalion, Bataillon Commando 203 (BC 203) was airlifted in by RLAF Sikorsky H-34s to secure Vang Tai and its airstrip while White and Green Battalions moved toward the road intersection. As of 1 September 1969, air support was limited to 12 A-1 sorties daily, supported by a flareship by night and two forward air controllers (FACs) by day. On 2 September, Red Battalion was halted when it took 17 casualties in a brief clash with the communists. That same day, Green and White Battalions were halted by high water in the Se Thamouak River. Forcing a crossing two days later, they peacefully occupied the 9/23 intersection. On 6 September, Red Battalion joined them. At this point, the Rules of Engagement were changed to allow air strikes on Moung Phine.Conboy, Morrison, p. 219.Nalty, p. 119. USAF fighter-bombers seeded all routes into Moung Phine with Mk-36 area denial ordnance to block traffic—Routes 9, 23, and the combined 9/23. Early on 7 September, four USAF A-1E Skyraiders bombed the town; that afternoon, four more repeated the attack. That evening, the Royalist irregulars took Moung Phine. They captured 45 Pathet Lao soldiers, freed 165 detained Lao citizens from various jails and another 2,000 villagers from porterage. A cache of 2,000 small arms and copious documentation were also captured. In all, 2,000 tons of supplies were captured, and 1,500 villagers evacuated to government territory.Anthony, Sexton, p. 317. At this point, there was a controversy over whether to spray herbicide on standing rice crops around Moung Phine to deny them to the communists. Given the increasing communist antiaircraft weaponry opposing them, the need for rice to feed local populace, and fear of communist counterattacks in reprisal, only ten percent of the crops were sprayed.Nalty, pp. 120–121. Based on success to date, the decision was made to once again extend the offensive. The objective now became cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail near the transshipment point of Tchepone.Castle, pp. 108–109. Tchepone was garrisoned by six PAVN battalions defended by antiaircraft guns. Air support for the government forces would come from the numerous tactical air sorties already directed at the Trail, and would be directed by Nail FACs and Raven FACs. Although the Royalists realized that capturing the actual town was unlikely, they planned to occupy another road junction, Routes 9/91 ten kilometers northwest of Tchepone. They also planned to cut Route 9 between Tchepone and Vietnam, stranding the North Vietnamese garrison. However, they paused to refresh and realign their forces. On 13 September 1969, BC 203 moved forward to garrison Moung Phine. On 17 September, White Battalion was withdrawn from the operation, to be replaced by Yellow Battalion. By 23 September, Yellow Battalion occupied a mountaintop position overlooking Moung Phine. Green and Red Battalions were then withdrawn by 28 September. On 29 September, Blue Battalion replaced them.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 219–220. Blue Battalion marched toward the 9/91 intersection and occupied the intermediate junction of Routes 9/914, five kilometers short of 9/91. A PAVN counterattack pushed Blue Battalion southwestward into defensive positions on a nearby mountain.Conboy, Morrison, p. 220. On 4 October, an approaching crowd of refugees was mistaken for PAVN by BC 203; the Royalist regulars fled to Moung Phalan. Nearby Yellow Battalion followed suit, abandoning its hilltop stronghold. Early on 6 October, not knowing Moung Phine had been abandoned, a company from Red Battalion was airlifted into an ambush on the airstrip. Two 20th SOS helicopters were downed on the runway, stranding eight USAF fliers and 44 Lao troops. Scavenging four M60 machine guns from the crashed helicopters to beef up their defense, the fliers and the Red Battalion soldiers held off the PAVN all day. After being reduced to using sidearms for defense, the surrounded detachment was rescued at 18:30 by two helicopters swooping in under cover of an airdropped tear gas barrage.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 220–221.Anthony, Sexton, p. 321. Green, White, and Blue Battalions staged an eastward assault from Muong Phalane toward Moung Phine, while Red Battalion moved toward the 9/914 junction. By 17 October, the three battalion attack force had stalled six kilometers shy of the 9/23 intersection. Lacking both an overall operational commander to coordinate maneuvers, as well as support from CIA handlers distracted by Kou Kiet, the operation was terminated. The communists had regained all their lost ground.Conboy, Morrison, p. 221. Results Operation Junction City Jr. was credited with depriving an entire PAVN division of supplies, causing its withdrawal from the field. Besides the captured materiel, the operation was credited with killing an estimated 500 enemy troops. A total of 6,000 potential porters were eventually evacuated.Ahern, p. 360. Besides diverting manpower and supplies from North Vietnamese operations to engage the Lao forces, the PAVN was forced to extend its defensive perimeter further west from the Ho Chi Minh Trail and occupy more of the Lao panhandle.Nalty, p. 121. The Royalist forces held the line through January 1970. A battered Brown Battalion returned from operations in Military Region 2 and was assigned as security guards at Prince Boun Oum's personal tin mine. Two newly raised battalions did not join the Royalist front line formations, which became static. Encouraged by Junction City Jr.'s results, the CIA planned the Tchepone Operation.Conboy, Morrison, p. 271. Notes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

Jørgensen studied statistics and was conferred a Cand. Scient. degree in 1979 from Aarhus University followed by a Ph.D. in 1987 (Odense University) and Dr. Scient. in 1997 (Aalborg University). In 1987 he joined the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada at Rio de Janeiro, and from 1992 to 1997 he was affiliated with the University of British Columbia in Canada. His subsequent appointments were with Odense University and the University of Southern Denmark. Dispersion models serve as error distributions for generalized linear models and represent a broad class of distributions that allow for the analysis of data that go beyond the restrictions of the normal distribution. These models include both the proper dispersion models and the exponential dispersion models. Jørgensen identified a number of other classes of dispersion models which included the multivariate dispersion models, the dispersion models for extremes and the dispersion models for geometric sums. He had an interest in a class of exponential dispersion models identified by Maurice Tweedie characterized by closure under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under transformations of scale that are now called the Tweedie distributions. These models express a power law relationship between the variance and the mean which manifests in ecological systems where it is known as Taylor's law and in physical systems where it is known as fluctuation scaling. Jørgensen proved a number of convergence theorems, related to the central limit theorem, that specified the asymptotic behavior of the variance functions of the Tweedie models. These theorems would indicate that certain types of Tweedie models should have a role as equilibrium distributions in natural systems. They can be used to explain the origin of Taylor's law as well as 1/f noise and multifractality. Consequent to Jørgensen's work the Tweedie distributions and their convergence theorem have provided mechanistic insight into complicated natural systems that manifest features of self-organized criticality and random fractals.

Staudinger (born December 19, 1952, in Erfurt, East Germany) is a German artist who became involved in art after his escape from the GDR and the trial of a civil life. He is dedicated to the visual arts (sculpture and painting), performance and conceptual art, poetry and political arts,political arts is a video artist and arranges installation art.  Life   Childhood in Waltershausen (1952–1968)  Bayerischer Hof in Waltershausen – home Staudinger as a child, with his father's camera Staudinger was the son of a hotel and restaurant manager, Gerhard Staudinger (b. April 20, 1923, in Erfurt, d. February 3, 1988, in Waltershausen), and his wife Edeltraut (b. January 30, 1927, in Wandersleben, d. December 11, 2011, in Waltershausen). He grew up in the village of Schmira near Erfurt and from 1956 in Waltershausen, where his parents ran the Bayerischer Hof restaurant, a member of the state-controlled Restaurant Trade Organisation (German: HO). In Schirma they ran the Hotel Welcome, a private, independent business, but in 1956, about the time when Christian's brother Ulrich was born, they moved to the state-controlled hotel in Waltershausen, as they had to give up their independent operators' license. Staudiger had a happy childhood although there were arguments with his parents about politics. His parents were still influenced by the politics of the Nazi era, and were extremely critical of the GDR. The national flag was not flown when it was required to be and his parents never voted in GDR elections, although these were both officially required duties in the GDR. However, members of the Stasi hierarchy visited his parents' restaurant because of the good food. Christian Staudinger was an enthusiastic communist, avidly read communist literature, and was a keen drummer in the local marching band in Waltershausen, guided by his teacher Otto Müller. His paternal grandfather, Wilhelm Staudinger, was a German nationalist, who ran Hotel Welcome with his wife Paula, before his son took over. During the Nazi period he gave extra bread and milk to forced labourers. The village teacher betrayed him. He was arrested, tortured at Petersberg Citadel in Erfurt and died a few days later as result. Staudiger's maternal grandfather, Phillip Orth, worked for the German Railways and co-founded the Communist Party of Germany in Neudietendorf shortly after the First World War. To protect the family, he sent his daughter to the League of German Girls, a Nazi organisation. He was not bothered by the Nazis and died when Staudinger was 16 years old. His uncle, Sigmar Orth, was a liaison officer between the police and the Stasi, who encouraged Staudiger's interest in history and enthusiasm for the developing communist German state.  Youth and escape from East Germany (1968–1972)  At age 16, Staudinger left home and went to Erfurt, where he began his apprenticeship as a waiter after his original career aspirations of being a sailor in the merchant navy and, thereafter, the boatman on inland waters had been rejected by the Stasi. People in the GDR needed a permit from the state for their career aspirations. In Erfurt he fell into circles around Eberhard Häfner and others.Independent literature in the GDR They had passionate discussions about politics and art, listened to the music of the so-called imperialist Staatsfeind and he came in contact with THC and LSD-25. He read Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego and Totem and Taboo by Sigmund Freud, which he had received from Eberhard Häfner. He tried to use these writings in his final examination paper—then viewed as an affront. His teacher, Mrs. Richter, expressed her enthusiasm privately but could not vote because literature of the \\"State-enemy\\" had been cited. The day after his practical test, from which he made a parody and therefore failed, Staudinger went to escape from East Germany. He wished to leave his beloved home, because emerging and fast growing doubts about the integrity of the system were growing in him. He had read the classics, but all that did not stand in comparison with reality. In addition, he wanted to become a skydiver. He was in the Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik, but in order to jump one had to be in the National People's Army or in the Stasi. The Stasi began to be interested in him and tried to recruit him as part of the OPK (operational checks on persons). He felt honoured and loved those discussions with the Stasi officers who at home always encountered violent counter-arguments. But soon the Stasi was tired, wanted names that he refused to provide, prompting the never-forgotten threat received by many former GDR-citizens: \\"Either you are with us or against us. Join in and out you can be something. If not, you will croak on the machine!\\" GDR-document about act of dismissing At the age of 18, in 1971, Staudinger and a friend made their way to Bulgaria in order to leave the country to travel to Turkey. This was the route many so-called “Republic-refugees” had chosen, as Stefan Appelius,more about refugees from GDR over Bulgaria at Stephan Appelius a professor of Political Science, has researched. Only his brother was informed he was leaving so as not to endanger the family.

But Staudinger lived, unlike other refugees.Tod in Bulgarien. Bouvier Verlag, Bonn 2007 The Stasi in Bulgaria brought him back to East Germany, and he was put into the Stasi prison, Andreasstrasse,Stasi prison Andreasstrasse in Erfurt and sentenced to one year and seven months for his attempt at illegal emigration and fomenting anti-state-propaganda, which he served in Cottbus. With the help of the two lawyers Vogel & Stange (one east, one west, and in that time famous in Germany) he came straight from prison to the Federal Republic of Germany. By a tragic event, unlike many others in the GDR convicted for political offenses, came into possession of copies of the indictmentstaudinger's indictment and judgment.Staudinger's Judgment The experiences of the flight are published in German as an audio book on YouTube,Audiobook on YouTube about the experiences of Staudinger in his flight (in German) spoken by Erich Räuker.Erich Räuker, voice actor – see also his official website and his personal website Shortly before his flight Staudinger had fathered a child, which he learned about in prison after it was born. He managed to bring the mother and child using of family reunification to West Berlin. The West and the events of the recent past destroyed everything he had believed, so that he tried to kill himself in 1974 with 250 sleeping pills. The doctors succeeded in saving him from being clinically dead. His brother, Ulrich,Brother Ulrich later was sentenced to 4 years for reportedly subversive propaganda.

His own prison experience influenced him professionally and between 1981–1986 he worked in the women's prison in Berlin as a group leader with drug-addicted adult women. Severe migraine attacks forced him to give up. He then moved to the creative arts. His efforts to become member of the Professional Association of Visual Artists in Berlin (BBK)see also website of BBK failed—he was rejected because he did not want to be confined to the visual arts. He responded with a public debate in the former Open Channel Berlin, known today as AlexTV.see also Website of AlexTV The connection between art and sport is important to Staudinger.see for instance Staudinger's project Art & Sport In 1977 he went to Texel (Netherlands) and completed his training as a parachutist and 1992 in DeLand, Florida as a jumpmaster.

Russian drawing teacher Thiem promoted his artistic talent and looked after the missing talent for foreign languages. His father, who was an enthusiastic amateur photographer, introduced him to photography and filming. He used Super 8 film and recorded Staudinger's childhood which is well documented. Staudinger sold his first pictures at school and accumulated in pocket money, managed by his mother. He burned some of it in the context of his first performance outside the Theater of Friendship in Waltershausen. In his school the artist was in the Committee Film in the Theater of Friendship from the fifth to the tenth grade.Staudinger and the Theater of Friendship/Waltershausen, including poster of Spur der Steine In 1968 he wrote his first poems.Staudinger's volumes of poetry, see also here and following sites The illegal West TV in his parents home introduced Staudinger to Joseph Beuys and he read the GDR banned authors like Erich Fromm, Sigmund Freud, Laozi, Nietzsche, C.G.

At approximately 12:25 pm PDT, Powers contacted KNBC and stated he had completed gathering footage, was returning to Burbank, and believed he had enough fuel for the return trip. A few minutes later, Powers radioed the control tower at Van Nuys Airport requesting clearance to land there due to low fuel; permission was granted, but the aircraft failed to arrive. The helicopter was now at above ground level (AGL) and almost out of fuel. Realizing he would not make the airport, Powers began searching for a spot to land in the heavily built-up area. At 12:35 pm, Powers pointed the aircraft towards the Sepulveda Dam Recreational Area and prepared to auto-rotate down to an open area. The Bell 206 has superior autorotation characteristics, but as he descended, it is surmised that Powers saw a group of teenagers playing on a baseball diamond and made an abrupt maneuver to avoid them. Powers' last radio transmission was \\"TV four just lost -\\". At approximately AGL, the tail rotor fell off and Powers was ejected from the helicopter. At 12:36 pm, the aircraft hit the ground about from where the boys were playing, gouged a trench long in the earth, and flipped upside-down. Powers and Spears were both killed, but nobody on the ground was hurt. Aircraft The helicopter involved in the accident was a Bell 206B JetRanger serial number 433 built in 1969. It was powered by a single Allison model 250-C20B turboshaft engine, rated at 420 shaft horsepower. The aircraft Certificate Issue Date was September 19, 1974, and it had been modified with the addition of an externally mounted 360-degree video camera and video recording equipment. Registered as N4TV, it was commonly referred to as the \\"Telecopter.\\" Crew The helicopter pilot was 47-year-old Francis Gary Powers, who began flying the JetRanger when he joined KNBC in November 1976. Best known for piloting an unsuccessful reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union in 1960, Powers held a valid commercial pilot's license and was instrument rated with 7,193 total flight hours, including 381 in the Bell 206. Aftermath and investigation The half-million dollar helicopter was completely destroyed during the crash. When firefighters arrived, they removed the helicopter's smoking battery from the fuselage for safety. The wreckage was moved to the Wayne Airframe Aviation Company in Van Nuys. Found inside the helicopter were the video recorder and four video cassettes. The investigators hoped the tapes might have clues to the reason for the crash but apparently the recorder had not been operating at the time of the incident. The aircraft had not been equipped with a flight data recorder (FDR) or a cockpit voice recorder (CVR). During the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation, no evidence of failure or malfunction of the aircraft or any of its systems prior to the crash was found. Further examination of the engine found approximately five fluid ounces of jet fuel in the entire fuel system and that the engine had flamed out due to fuel starvation. The final report from the NTSB lists the probable causes as improper in-flight decisions and mismanagement of fuel by the pilot in command which led to fuel exhaustion. Also listed was improper operation of flight controls during the power-off autorotation. According to one report, the helicopter's fuel gauge had been reported faulty by Powers. The improperly operating fuel gauge would indicate empty when the fuel tank contained enough fuel for 30 minutes flying time. It has been alleged the gauge was repaired to function correctly without Powers being notified. This is a possible explanation why an experienced pilot such as Powers could have run out of fuel.

Bill and Mike go to California, where they are employed by \\"Lucky Jim\\" Morrison's stable. A flirtatious Janet turns up and draws interest from both men. Mike also is infatuated with Miss Ellen, a filly he believes could become a champion racehorse. Janet turns out to be a devious, scheming woman, attempting to make both men jealous. After she declines Mike's marriage proposal, he disappears to Mexico, where he gambles, drinks and neglects his career. Bill takes a chance by marrying Janet, but her lavish spending habits leaves them bickering and broke. Morrison's death from a heart attack results in his horses, Miss Ellen, coming up for auction. Mike returns and outbids Bill for the filly, then reluctantly accepts a loan and partnership when Bill lends him enough money to make the purchase. With a race coming up that offers a $400,000 prize, the horse is not in perfect health, but Janet wants the money and persuades Bill and Mike to enter Miss Ellen in the race. In the saddle, Mike has to ease up when the horse begins bleeding. Miss Ellen finishes second. A furious Janet derides both men as losers, announcing she and Bill are through. Unbeknownst to her, Bill bet on their horse across the board (win, place and show). He throws $40,000 worth of tickets in Janet's face. When she picks them up, he hits Janet with the horse's whip.

It lies close to the namesake Durusu lake and the Terkos Dam. History The village is attested since Classical Antiquity as Derkos/Delkos/Derkoi, but Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) raised it to the status of a city and rebuilt it as a forward stronghold for the defence of Constantinople. It was also probably at the same time created an episcopal see In the first half of the 6th century, Derkos was known as a stronghold of the Monophysites. After the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade and the partition of the Byzantine Empire among the Crusader leaders, Derkos became part of the new Latin Empire until 1247, when the Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes captured it. Derkos served as the base of Andronikos IV Palaiologos in his failed usurpation attempt in 1373 against his father John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1376, 1379–1391). By the 1420s, Derkos was one of the few cities still held by the Byzantines along the Black Sea coast. As such, it formed the appanage of the future Constantine XI Palaiologos (r. 1449–1453) in 1421, when his father Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391–1425) assigned various portions of the empire to his sons. The town was taken by the Ottomans during their preparations for their final siege of Constantinople, in early 1453 or perhaps even in 1452. The moats and earthworks erected by the Ottomans during this operation were allegedly still visible in the 1660s, when the traveller Evliya Celebi visited the city. In the late 19th century, the town had a Christian population of 400, many of whom were Bulgarians. A church dedicated to St. George still existed until the early 20th century, but today few Byzantine and ancient remains are visible; some Roman-era inscriptions are located in the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul. The medieval fortress still exists in a partially well-preserved state, some 1 km west of the settlement, close to the lake, although large sections were torn down in the late 20th century to furnish building material.

Bramham graduated from University of North Carolina and was admitted as a lawyer in Durham, North Carolina before showing his interest in baseball, as he helped stabilize the ballgame in the state in 1902 and was largely responsible for the creation of the Durham Tobacconists club, precursor to the legendary Durham Bulls.Durham Bulls History.

During this time, Bramham accumulated enough experience as organizer and was well-versed in factors caused by the Great Depression, which led him to create stability in the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, now known as Minor League Baseball, the governing body for all professional baseball teams in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean that are affiliated with Major League Baseball through their farm systems.

That number dwindled to 21 in 1930 and 16 in 1932. From there, the administrative duties were put in the hands of an executive committee for a period of one year, with orders to survey conditions and report back with recommendations and specific requests for changes. MiLB. Retrieved on December 3, 2015. Presidency of NAPBL At the Winter Meetings of 1932, Bramham was appointed as the third president of the NAPBL. Bramham treated it as a great opportunity, instead of a misfortune, and provided the strong leadership that the baseball industry needed to survive and eventually prosper in the 1930s, despite the turbulent financial times. The NAPBL office had been in Auburn, New York, since the organization was founded in 1901, but Bramham moved them to Durham, North Carolina, where he had a thriving law practice and was active in statewide Republican politics. Only five leagues committed to operate in 1933, but 14 actually opened and finished the season. As a result, Bramham soon found out that he had a full-time job and gave up his law business to devote all his energy to the organization during 14 years. That started an upward trend for the NAPBL guided by Bramham, which reached a peak of 43 leagues just prior to the start of World War II, as he inherited 14 leagues and 102 clubs, but turned over 52 leagues and 388 clubs to his successor George Trautman in 1947. Reforms One of the most significant reforms instituted by Bramham during these years was designed to eliminate the so- called \\"shoestring operators\\", who often did not have the financial support to survive a full season. Bramham insisted that new owners show moral integrity and back up their operations with guaranty deposits, and he rigidly held all NAPBL clubs to this standard. This led to improved stability and sounder policies, making it easier to bring in new investors. Bramham also was a strong backer of his umpires, protecting them from physical and verbal attacks from both uniformed and non-uniformed personnel. Among other of his ideas, he implemented by the mid-1930s a school of instruction for club business managers, and displays of promotional ideas at the Winter Meetings. World War II After that Bramham faced an even bigger hurdle, as was the start of World War II conflict. This not only drained the game of achievements, as ballplayers marched off to serve their country, but also created severe restrictions on the game through gas rationing and electrical power, travel cutbacks and the elimination of night games in coastal areas on both sides of the country. Despite the war threat, 41 NAPBL circuits operated in 1941, but many of them soon suspended operations. The number was down to 31 in 1942 and fall to just nine in 1943. But Bramham had one more major battle to fight during his term of office. Late in 1943, when he opted to run for reelection, there were rumors of a possible floor fight at the Winter Meetings. It would hinge on the issue of the existing NAPBL treasury upwards of $250,000. Some leagues, with operations suspended, wanted to divide up the money and liquidate the fund. The key issue was whether or not the suspended leagues or only those still active had the right to vote. Bramham prevailed, keeping the treasury intact for post-war operations, and was elected to a new five-year term as president. But time and responsibilities affected his health, and was forced to announce his retirement on the eve of the 1946 Winter Meetings. Bramham was retained as a consultant to the new president Trautman, but he died a few months later. Death Judge Bramham died from uremiaThe Associated Press (9 July 1947): William G.

She graduated from Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and Journalism and was later a student at the University of Pennsylvania. Gerety lived alone in Wayne, Pennsylvania for most of her life and died in Derby, Pennsylvania at the age of 83 on April 11, 1999 .  N. W. Ayers  Frances Gerety began working at the N. W.

Gerety helped to create advertisements that were published in Vogue (magazine), Life (magazine), Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, Look (American magazine), and Harper's Bazaar.  \\"A Diamond is Forever\\"  Due to the decline of diamond sales after the Great Depression, the diamond company De Beers was desperate to increase marketing strategies. De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. hired N.W. Ayers & Son to advertise their diamonds in 1938. Since women in advertising were generally assigned to cases that only pertained to women, Gerety was the prime copywriter for the job. In 1948, Gerety was assigned to create a slogan that encapsulates the security and eternal romance that comes with owning a diamond. Gerety scribbled the slogan “A Diamond is Forever” on a piece of paper late one night. The next morning, she presented the slogan to her associates at N. W. Ayers. Her associates were initially hesitant to use the slogan due to its strange grammar, but it eventually became one of the most recognized advertising slogans of its time. The slogan has been used in every De Beers ad since 1948 and continues to be used today. In 1989, Gerety was honored at the 50th Anniversary for N.W. Ayers and De Beer’s anniversary in London for her work with De Beers. Advertising Age named “A Diamond is Forever” the slogan of the 20th century in 1999.

The company's oncolytic virus product, called Cavatak, is currently in clinical trials in metastatic melanoma and other cancers. The drug was granted Orphan Drug status in advanced melanoma in December 2005. Corporate history Around 1999 a team led by the virologist Professor Darren Shafren at the University of Newcastle in Australia established that a Coxsackievirus called Coxsackievirus A21 was an oncolytic virus, in addition to being a common-cold virus causing mild upper respiratory tract infections. Shafren filed for patent protection over the use of the virus in oncology and the University of Newcastle subsequently formed a spin-out company called ViroTarg Pty Ltd. An ASX-listed biotech company called Psiron began to fund development of the ViroTarg project in June 2004 and in December 2006 acquired the Virotarg intellectual property. Psiron changed its name in the process to Viralytics to reflect the fact that oncolytic viruses were now its core focus. Shafren's wild-type Coxsackievirus A21, which Viralytics called Cavatak, was trialled in a Phase I in melanoma between 2007 and 2010 and in 2012 the product entered a Phase II trial in advanced melanoma called 'CALM', short for 'vatak in ate Stage elanoma'. This trial took place under an Investigational New Drug application. The trial completed in 2015 with favourable results and multiple trials are now underway to establish various indications for Cavatak. Viralytics stock is publicly traded on the ASX under the code VLA. In the US its ADRs have traded OTC since October 2006 and on OTCQX under the code VRACY since August 2013. The ratio of ADRs to the ordinary shares is 30:1. Board of Directors Viralytics' Non-Executive chairman is Paul Hopper, an Australian bioentrepreneur based in Sydney who has been a director since September 2008 and chairman since November 2008. The company's CEO is Dr Malcolm McColl, a former executive of the major Australian pharmaceutical company CSL and the biotech company Starpharma who joined the company in January 2013. Locations Viralytics' is headquartered in the City Mutual Building, an art deco icon in the Sydney CBD located at 66 Hunter Street. Darren Shafren has a laboratory in Newcastle. Cavatak Cavatak is the trade name for a preparation of wild-type Coxsackievirus A21, as manufactured by Viralytics. Within the Picornaviradae family of viruses, Coxsackievirus A21 is a member of the Human enterovirus C species. The virus consists of a single positive-stranded RNA genome within a capsid of approximately 28 nm in diameter. The virus is known to utilise the viral entry receptor ICAM-1 as its primary entry receptor, with DAF as a co-receptor to infect host cells. Mechanism of action The firm argues that Cavatak has a dual mechanism of action. As well as oncolysis through the preferential targeting of cells that over-express the molecules ICAM-1 and/or DAF compared to normal cells, there is also an immunological involvement in which the infection promotes tumour inflammation, which in turn prompts the patient's immune system to attack the infected cancer cells. Pre-clinical evidence of efficacy Shafren et al. first published data showing that Cavatak could destroy malignant melanoma cells in the journal Clinical Cancer Research in January 2004. A June 2005 paper in the International Journal of Oncology showed that this effect worked as well for melanoma exhibiting a highly vascular phenotype. In April 2007, in a paper in the British Journal of Haematology, the Shafren lab showed that Cavatak could work in multiple myeloma and over the next two years papers in The Prostate (May 2008) and Breast Cancer Research and Treatment (January 2009) suggested similar pre-clinical efficacy in prostate and breast cancer respectively. What these cancers have in common is that they all have high levels of ICAM-1 expression. 2007–2011: Early clinical work In January 2010 Viralytics reported favourable results from a nine patient Phase I trial of Cavatak in Stage IV melanoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00438009) where the virus was administered intratumourally. In this trial, which was initiated in May 2007 but was not completed until 2009, all patients were given two Cavatak doses of the same size 48 hours apart into a single cutaneous melanoma lesion. Three patients received a low dose, three a middle dose and three a high dose. * Five of the nine patients, or 55.6%, experienced transient/stable reductions in injected tumour volume or tumour stabilization. No objective responses were observed, however, two patients displayed stable disease as assessed by RECIST following CT scan evaluation; * Two of the patients that had enjoyed large reductions in lesion volume registered elevated levels of serum GM-CSF, suggesting that there had been an anti-tumour immune response. These results were presented at the May 2011 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, held that year in Chicago. 2012–2015: The CALM study The Phase II CALM study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01227551) took a considerable period of time for Viralytics to initiate – the pre-IND meeting with the FDA was held in June 2010 and Viralytics lodged its IND in November 2010, however the trial wasn't cleared until June 2011. This meant that the study didn't dose its first patient until after January 2012. However this open-label trial was eventually able to evaluate 57 patients with stage IIIc or stage IV melanoma. Each evaluated patient received 10 intratumoural injections of Cavatak over 18 weeks. The dose level was 3x108 TCID50 virus with the investigators measuring response rates as well as Progression Free Survival at 6 months, and tracking the immune response of the patient. The trial was one of the first in the world to make use of the new Immune-Related Response Criteria. * Immune- related Progression Free Survival. CALM's Primary Endpoint, reached in September 2013, was 10 patients from a total of 54 evaluable patients experiencing immune-related Progression Free Survival (irPFS) at six months, that is, their tumour had not 'progressed' (i.e. worsened) as determined by the Immune-Related Response Criteria. In September 2014 Viralytics was able to report a 39% irPFS rate at six months (22 of 57 evaluable patients). * Survival and Response Rate. In June 2015 final survival data from CALM showed a 73% one-year Overall Survival rate in the CALM patients (43 out of 57 patients). The Overall Response Rate in the study from the final data was 28% (8 complete and 8 partial responses out of 57 patients). The Durable Response Rate, where the response continued more than six months, was 21% (12 out of 57 patients). The investigators also noted activity in non-injected distant lesions including lung and liver metastases. Current clinical trials * CALM Extension Study. This Phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01636882) is giving patients from the CALM study who have not experienced an immune-related progression event another nine intra-tumoural Cavatak injections in order to allow biopsies taken from both injected and non- injected melanoma lesions. These biopsies are being examined with a view to better understanding how Cavatak triggers an immune response. Data from 13 evaluated patients in the study, reported in June 2015, has shown tumour- infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 upregulation in the area of the lesions, the latter phenomenon suggesting that Cavatak may be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors. * STORM (ystemic reatment f esistant etastatic Disease). This Phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02043665), which commenced in March 2014, is recruiting patients with treatment-resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and treatment-resistant melanoma and bladder cancer to receive intravenous injections of Cavatak. Under a November 2015 agreement with Merck & Co. the lung and bladder cancer patients will receive Cavatak in conjunction with the checkpoint inhibitor drug Keytruda. * CANON (vatak in -Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.) This Phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02316171), which commenced in the UK in January 2014, is evaluating Cavatak in superficial bladder cancer. This two-part, open label dose escalation study will evaluate the safety and optimal dose of Cavatak as a monotherapy and in combination with the standard of care drug mitomycin C. * MITCI (elanoma ntra-umoural avatak and pilimumab). This Phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02307149), initiated in December 2014, will see intra-tumoural Cavatak combined with the Bristol-Myers Squibb drug Yervoy, another checkpoint inhibitor, in metastatic melanoma. * CAPRA (vatak and embolizumab in dvanced Melanoma). This Phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02565992), which initiated in September 2015, will see intra-tumoural Cavatak combined with Keytruda in metastatic melanoma.

Playing career Atkins was a pitcher at Wake Forest University, and was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 69th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. In the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, the Cleveland Indians selected him in the 38th round, and he signed with the team. He played 5 seasons in Cleveland's minor league organization before retiring, compiling a career 37–32 win–loss record, 4.13 earned run average (ERA), and 340 strikeouts in 512 innings pitched. Executive career Cleveland Indians The Indians hired Atkins in 2001 as assistant director of player development, and was promoted to director of Latin American operations in 2003. In 2006, they promoted him to director of player development. The Indians promoted Atkins to vice president of player personnel after the 2014 season. Toronto Blue Jays Mark Shapiro, who was hired as the Blue Jays' team president and CEO on October 31, 2015, hired Atkins as general manager on December 3. He replaced Tony LaCava, who served as interim GM in November. During the offseason leading into the 2016 season, Atkins made several moves, including selecting Joe Biagini in the Rule 5 draft, trading Ben Revere to the Washington Nationals for Drew Storen, and signing several players to minor league contracts with invitations to spring training. In his first draft as GM, Atkins selected T. J. Zeuch in the first round. Atkins made several additions to the Blue Jays roster prior to the trade deadline, acquiring Melvin Upton Jr., Joaquín Benoit, Scott Feldman, Francisco Liriano, and others, which aided the Blue Jays in making the postseason for the second consecutive season with an 89-73 record. Atkins' second season was a disappointing one for the Jays. They finished 76-86 despite early season hopes of a third consecutive playoff berth. 2018 was a lot of the same for the team. They stumbled to a 73-89 record and a second straight season out of the postseason leading to Atkins beginning a rebuild of the roster.

They had their final matches with NJPW on January 4, 2018, at Wrestle Kingdom 12, and January 5, 2018 at New Year's Dash.  WWE   NXT (2018–2019)  On January 16, 2018, Rowe and Hanson signed a contract with WWE and reported to the WWE Performance Center. During a TV taping before NXT TakeOver: New Orleans, Rowe and Hanson debuted as faces, now under the name \\"War Raiders\\", interfering in a match between Heavy Machinery (Tucker Knight and Otis Dozovic) and Tino Sabbatelli and Riddick Moss, causing it to end in a no contest. Over the following weeks, they started a winning streak, defeating NXT teams such as The Mighty and Heavy Machinery. On the October 17 episode of NXT, they challenged The Undisputed Era (Kyle O'Reilly and Roderick Strong) for the NXT Tag Team Championship, but won by disqualification after Bobby Fish attacked them with a steel chair; thus, they did not win the titles. War Raiders would go on to main event NXT TakeOver: WarGames II in Los Angeles teaming with Ricochet and Pete Dunne against The Undisputed Era in the WarGames match. At NXT TakeOver: Phoenix, Rowe and Hanson defeated The Undisputed Era to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. They successfully defended their tag team championships at NXT TakeOver: New York against the team of Ricochet and Aleister Black.  Raw (2019–present)  On April 15, 2019, they debuted on Raw as \\"The Viking Experience\\", with Rowe and Hanson now called \\"Erik\\" and \\"Ivar\\". This new name was very negatively received on social media. Pro Wrestling Insider reported that another name considered was \\"The Berzerkers\\".https://www.pwinsiderelite.com/article.php?id=125793 They teamed with The Revival to defeat the team of Aleister Black, Ricochet, Curt Hawkins, and Zack Ryder. The next week, the team was renamed \\"The Viking Raiders\\" while their finisher was renamed to \\"The Viking Experience\\". They relinquished the NXT Tag Team Championships at the May 1 NXT television tapings (aired May 15). After relinquishing the championship, however, The Viking Raiders were challenged to one final NXT match for the titles by Street Profits. The match, however, ended in a disqualification after The Forgotten Sons attacked Ivar, followed by an ensuing brawl between the teams.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/results/ongoing-spoilers-nxt- television-tapings-full-sail-51 On the September 9, 2019 episode of Raw in Madison Square Garden, The Viking Raiders saved Cedric Alexander from The O.C.. https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/wwe-raw-live-results-return- madison-square-garden-292046 On the October 14 episode of Raw, Erik and Ivar captured the Raw Tag Team Championship from Robert Roode and Dolph Ziggler. However, they suffered their first loss as a team in WWE at Crown Jewel in a tag team turmoil match for the WWE Tag Team World Cup, ultimately losing the last match against The O.C. At Survivor Series, they defeated The New Day and The Undisputed Era in a champions triple threat tag team match, scoring Raw's only victory at the event, which was ultimately won by NXT. On the January 20th episode of Raw they lost the titles to Seth Rollins and Buddy Murphy ending their reign at 98 days. On the May 4 episode of Raw, The Viking Raiders defeated The Street Profits in a non-title match. In the following weeks, The Viking Raiders would feud with The Street Profits as they faced each other in several competitions such as basketball, axe-throwing, golf, bowling, and a decathlon which was later dubbed as the \\"Anything You Can Do, We Can Do Better\\" series. A running gag in these segments would see the women involved in the competitions flirting with Ivar and ignoring Erik much to Erik's disgust. The series would end with a 3–3 tie between the Street Profits and The Viking Raiders. This led to a match scheduled between the two teams for the Raw Tag Team Titles at Backlash. However, the match never began as The Street Profits and The Viking Raiders brawled backstage which also saw them work together to fend off Akira Tozawa and a gang of ninjas on motorcycles. The Street Profits and The Viking Raiders continued brawling afterwards until they fell into a dumpster. On the June 22 episode of Raw, The Viking Raiders finally received their Raw Tag Team Title match against The Street Profits where they were defeated. On September 7, 2020, on Raw, The Hurt Business defeated Crews, Ricochet, and the Raiders in an eight-man tag team match, with Alexander scoring the pinfall over Ricochet, with the match being forced to an abrupt ending due to Ivar suffering a legitimate cervical injury during the match.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/results/wwe-raw-9720-results-live- coverage-discussion-8pm-esthttps://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/ivar-injured- during-eight-man-tag-match-wwe-raw-319641 On September 14, Ivar underwent successful surgery to repair a neck injury thus rendering him out of action and putting the team on hiatus.

The Franklin First United Methodist Church is a historic church in downtown Franklin, Ohio, USA. A Methodist affiliated church since its founding, it is the oldest church in the city and one of the oldest churches in Warren County. The church is a member congregation of the United Methodist Church.  The Church's bBeginning  In 1798, the Methodist Episcopal bishop Francis Asbury sent John Kobler across the Ohio River and into the Northwest Territory \\"to form a new circuit and to plant the first principles of the Gospel\\" in the frontier region of the Great Miami River. He as well as other circuit riders made frequent stops in Franklin and the town became a regular stop for itinerant ministers until 1853, when a permanent pastor was assigned to the town. In 1825, a permanent Methodist Episcopal Society was formed in the town, with the church building being constructed in 1832. A new brick building was constructed in 1836 at the site of the present church building, but was torn down thirteen years later. In early 1860, prominent members of the church raised a sum of $12,000 to construct a permanent church. The new church was dedicated on September 16 that year and construction was finished in 1861. The new building is \\"in Gothic style; having buttresses exteriorly and having a steeple which rises 120 feet from the ground\\". The original sanctuary and bell tower remains to this day.  Merger into the United Methodist Church  Throughout its foundation, until 1939, the congregation in Franklin was known as the Methodist Episcopal Church. During that year the church added the prefix, First, to distinguish itself from other denominations in the area such as the Free Methodist, Bible Methodist, and African Methodist Episcopal Churches. The congregation decided to align with the mainline Methodist Church (USA). On April 23, 1968, the congregation's name officially changed to the Franklin First United Methodist Church when the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church merged to form the United Methodist Church.  The education building addition and the bell  Construction of the 3-story education building was started in 1954 on land to the south and west of the original church. The cost for the addition's construction totaled $109,000, or $950,000 in today's (2014) buying power. The first bell was donated to the church in the early 1830s by Ransom Seely Lockwood. A second bell was purchased in 1841 to replace Lockwood's bell which had been damaged over the years. The present bell was installed in 1862 and manufactured by the G. W. Coffin & Co.

Benjamin first appears in 1297, when, following the death of the Prince of Achaea, Florent of Hainaut, his widow, Princess Isabella of Villehardouin withdrew to the castle of Kalamata. To govern the Principality, Isabella appointed Richard Orsini to rule in her stead as bailli and named Benjamin, who had been the protovestiarios of the Principality—an office equivalent to a Western chamberlain and charged with keeping the list of fief-holders—as the new chancellor. Benjamin was succeeded as protovestiarios by a Greek named Vasilopoulos. In 1300, Richard Orsini was replaced as bailli by Nicholas III of Saint Omer, on Benjamin's advice. Hereditary marshal of the Principality and one of its most powerful barons, Nicholas was also Benjamin's close friend. This began a period of rivalry between Richard and Benjamin. In 1301, Princess Isabella married her third husband, Philip of Savoy. The new Prince quickly made himself unpopular in Achaea by his arrogance, despotic manners, and disregard for the principality's feudal customs. Immediately after his arrival, acting on the advice of a partisan of Richard Orsini, Philip arrested Benjamin on charge of treason and imprisoned him at Andravida. Nicholas of Saint Omer immediately confronted the new prince at Glarentza and vehemently protested this act; violence was averted through the intervention of Isabella and Philip's counsellors. Benjamin was released after a payment of 20,000 hyperpyra, and received in exchange possession of a fief at Perachora near Corinth. Despite this inauspicious start, Benjamin nevertheless quickly managed to win Philip's trust and esteem; on his advice, the Prince now forced Richard Orsini to purchase a fief for the same sum of 20,000 hyperpyra, which, given his own death and the death of his sole heir soon after, reverted to the Achaean fisc. In 1304 he was one of the witnesses at the marriage of Richard Orsini's son and heir, John I Orsini, and Maria Komnene Doukaina. In December 1320, Benjamin became a citizen of the Republic of Venice, and in June of the next year, was among the Achaean magnates who sent a letter to the Doge of Venice offering to hand over the Principality to him. He still occupied the post of chancellor In June when a letter from Prince Philip of Taranto was addressed to the Achaean nobility and magnates.

Life She was the daughter of king Dúngal mac Fergaile (r. 802-842) of Osraige, a kingdom which witnessed a dramatic rise to power under the rule of her war-like brother Cerball mac Dúnlainge (r. 842-888), in which she had a hand. She was married three times to successive kings, and as such appears to have had a central role in cementing alliances between rival Irish kingdoms, but also in urging her husbands towards hostilities against Viking threats. As queen, she became the mother and grandmother to several noteworthy Irish kings, and is remembered as an exemplar for female nobility in Irish verse and genealogical texts.http://sbaldw.home.mindspring.com/Ireland/Osr/lists/Osraige.htm After the death of Cerball in 888, her brother Riagan mac Dúnlainge succeeded the Ossorian throne. Marriages Princess Land had three famous husbands, who were kings in their own right; two of which reigned as High King over Ireland. She first married king Gáethíne mac Cináeda of Loíchsi from a territory neighboring her home region of Osraige by whom she had a son, Cennétig mac Gáethíne, (d. 903),AU 903.3 who also later reigned as king of Loíchsi. She was married again to the famous High King of all Ireland, Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid (r. 846 to 862) and gave birth to his formidable son Flann Sinna who was also High King from 879 to 916. She is thus also the grandmother of Flann's son, High King Donnchadh Donn mac Flainn. Her marriage to Máel Sechnaill is largely seen as part of a political alliance between the Dál Birn of Osraige and the Clann Cholmáin dynasty of Southern Uí Néill, as her brother Cerball mac Dúnlainge, king of Osraige also wedded Máel Sechnaill's daughter as an agreement in alienating Osraige away from the greater polity of Munster.AU859.3, FA 246, FA 260 The dual marriages however did not cease fighting between the two dynasties.FA 265 Máel Sechnaill died in 862. On Máel Sechnaill's death, the Uí Néill kingship passed back to the northern branch, represented by Áed Findliath mac Néill, son of Niall Caille, who began his reign by marrying Máel Sechnaill's widow, (and Flann Sinna's mother) Land, which was Áed's second marriage and Land's third. Áed died in 879. Land ingen Dúngaile, princess of Osraige and queen of Tara, died in piety and penance at the monastery of Clonmacnoise in 890.AU 890.5, M886.8 Legacy The Book of Uí Maine contains the following short genealogy of Land inserted into an entry of the Ban Shenchus: \\"Land ingen Dungaili m.

Áed had a great victory over the Norwegians at Loch Febail. The learned related that it was his wife who most incited Áed against the Norwegians—namely Land, daughter of Dúnlang: and she was the one who was Máel Sechlainn's wife previously, and the mother of Máel Sechlainn's son, i.e. Flann. She was the mother of Cennétig son of Gáethíne, king of Loíches. Now the ills that the Norwegians suffered this year are noteworthy, but the greatest they encountered were from Áed Findliath son of Niall.FA 227 The Banshenchas mention Land, saying: \\"Land daughter of Dungal son of Fergal, king of Ossory of the steeds, was called the mother (no mistaken delay) of Fland son of Mael Sechlaind of the swathes.\\" The Annals of the Four Masters state concerning her repose in 886: Flann, daughter of Dunghal, wife of Maelsechlainn, son of Maelruain, King of Ireland, and who was the mother of Flann Sinna, died after a good life, and after penance at Cluain Mic Nois; and she was there interred.

The field is used by the Arras Football club and the Women's Arras Football Club.  Organisation  The facilities at the stadium are mostly composed of a main grandstand backing on to a petrol station. The Grandstand houses the locker rooms of the teams. A courtyard is located on the edge of the lawn. It offers shelter, in particular, to those with reduced mobility. The display panel is positioned at the opposite end of the court. Refreshment stalls and a bar are located within the stadium. The grass of the pitch has been redone during the summer of 2009, following problems in the subsoil.Invasion de vers de terre puis dégel : soigner le stade Degouve avant samedi During a Municipal Council meeting in the town Hall of Arras in the spring of 2014, the council announced the \\"symbolic\\" takeover of the Total petrol station attached to the Stadium Degouve-Brabant. The station would be closed permanently by April–May 2015 ; after which all the vats of oil that are stored under the Grandstand would be emptied. This demolition and then construction is expected to begin in the Summer 2016, or even before that as soon as the championship of the CFA is completed in early June. However, everything will depend on, when the service station closes permanently, if the reserves of gas and oil are to be completely emptied. Regarding the new building of the Arras Football Club Association, it will be more impressive in terms of number of seats (15,000 approx) featuring red seats and blue fold- down (the club colours), as well as a new refreshment room, a bright refurbished court, as well as a box office/reception area that is more enjoyable. There will also be an official shop and a club house for V. I. Ps, in particular, to accommodate the patrons of the club in the best facilities. The possibility of another covered grandstand, opposite the main grandstand, is not to be excluded, if during the work, the playing area is extended by several metres to the Boulevard du General de Gaulle ; If that happens it will certainly be less imposing (5000 to 7000 seats) but would provide a stadium worthy of receiving teams of League 1 in the Coupe de France for example. These last possibilities should be confirmed, and discussed in the coming months.

Cancer drugs and therapies all have very low selective toxicity. However, with the help of nanotechnology and RNA silencing, new and better treatments may be on the horizon for certain forms of cancer.  Considerations  The main obstacle in using RNAi technology for the treatment of cancer is protecting the RNAi. It is very fragile, quickly metabolized, and it has to efficiently be delivered to the target cells in vivo. This is why nanoparticles are being used. The nanoparticles currently used in experimental trials are usually nanoplexes, polyplexes, lipoplexes, or micelles. These four major types of nanoparticles are all nonionic lipids. Nonionic lipids are safe, nontoxic and biocompatible. Nanoplexes involve the nucleic acid (RNAi) being associated with the particle or encapsulated by it. Polyplexes are core-shell type nanoparticles. Lipoplexes are liposome structures characterized by a bilayer lipid membrane. Lastly, micelles result from electrostatic interaction between nucleic acids and copolymers.  Current research   Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma  Chemokines are used in the communication between cells. In the case of ovarian clear cell carcinoma, gro-α and its receptor have been found to be overexpressed. This pro-inflammatory cytokine, when found in excess, is involved in tumor cell migration, invasion, and eventually metastasis. A modified nanoparticle with siRNA is now being researched and has been shown to effectively shut down the expression of gro-α. They are modified with FSH β which has a high selectivity for FSHR-positive ovarian cancer cells. The nanoparticles are aiding in delivery of the siRNA to the correct place, giving them a high selective toxicity.  Multidrug-resistant cancer cells  Multidrug resistance in cancer cells is thought to be the primary reason for the poor efficacy of cancer chemotherapy. Drug resistance is due to expression of the gene MDR-1. These gene codes for membrane-bound proteins called ABC transporters. One example of an ABC transporter is P-glycoprotein (P-gp). These transporters use ATP to efflux drugs out of the cell before they can exhibit their cytotoxic effects. Nanoparticles with MDR-1 silencing siRNA along with a cytotoxic drug PTX. Using this nanoparticle for delivery, silencing of the MDR-1 gene was achieved. Also, the cytotoxic effect of PTX was enhanced, probably due to an increase in intracellular drug accumulation.  Prostate cancer  In prostate cancer, the androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in progression of the cancer. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are being considered for delivering siRNA to silence AR. The most effective LNP to be found in vivo contains an ionizable cationic lipid 2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-KC2-DMA). Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an antigen that is present in high levels in prostate cancer. PSA levels following injection of these nanoparticles decreased and AR gene expression in tumors decreased.  Papillary thyroid cancer  Papillary thyroid carcinoma is targeted using a polyplex nanoparticle. The core consists of biodegradable poly isobutylcyanoacrylate polymer and a shell of chitosan. After intravenous injection of this type of nanoparticle loaded with antisense siRNA, tumor growth was almost stopped entirely. All other control experiments showed a ten-times increase in tumor size.

Establishment  Williams established the company in 1990 when the company she was working for, Allen & Unwin, was sold. She purchased the titles which she had developed as Allen & Unwin's managing director and started her own publishing company. Williams' vision for the company was for it to publish \\"good books that sell\\" – books with significant messages. Her personal interests in women's and Māori history, and New Zealand general history, have influenced the books that the company publishes. From 1995 to 1998, the company published under a joint imprint with Auckland University Press, before returning to independent publisher status in 1998.  Development  In 2006, the company established the Bridget Williams Publishing Trust, which applies for grants from philanthropic organisations to support publication of specific titles. For example, in 2013 the J.R. McKenzie Trust provided funding towards the publication and promotion of Inequality – A New Zealand Crisis. In 2011, Tom Rennie was hired as Associate Editor, and began to develop a digital publishing strategy for the company. As a result, in 2013, BWB Texts were released – a series of short texts on topics of New Zealand interest, published first as e-books and later as paperbacks.

It is about the events that occur after a girl is thrown into a well by her classmates and their lives afterwards. The manga was serialized in Ohta Publishing's Quick Japan magazine from 2003 to 2005. It is licensed in North America by Fantagraphics Books. Plot The story jumps back and forth between years and events, allowing the reader to piece together how the nonlinear events are correlated. The focal point of the story is the character Arie Kimura, a pretty fifth grade student with pale skin and long hair. She enjoys telling her classmates a scary fairy tale in which a girl is sent by God to warn a village of a monster that will destroy them. The villagers fear her predictions, and seven of them decide to sacrifice her to appease the monster. The girl is reborn over and over, doomed to repeat the cycle, with the monster growing larger every time due to its stomach getting fuller with bodies. This fairy tale foreshadows the general structure of the manga. Arie claims the monster hides in Nijigahara tunnel, a dark tunnel close to their school. The students' teacher, Sakaki, explains that the Nijigahara embankment was named for a legend about a , a \\"cow with a human face\\" known to predict plagues and suffering before mysteriously dying. Arie's classmates bully her, disturbed by her tale while also repressing their own individual personal problems, and seven of them eventually push Arie down a well leading into Nijigahara tunnel to appease the \\"monster,\\" mirroring the fairy tale. The children convince the adults that it was an accident, and Arie ends up comatose and stays this way for the majority of the story. Shortly after, ominous glowing cabbage butterflies begin to swarm the town. Arie's classmates grow up and try to move on with their lives, but still find themselves haunted by the incident and the guilt of their actions. They are plagued by internal monsters: guilt, pain, trauma, etc., and are unable to rid themselves of their painful memories and deeds. These repressed emotions continue to have an influence throughout their lives in all timeline versions of themselves, whether they appear as adults, parents, or old people. However, many of the characters act on their dark emotions through the alternate timelines as well, as a way to purge themselves of their dark thoughts and temporarily affix blame on others. Their internal monsters follow them throughout their lives and are shown to always plague them. In all alternate timelines, Arie mirrors the sacrificial girl from the fairy tale, being murdered, raped, abused, or even committing suicide. Major characters Some of the major characters affected by their actions directly or indirectly inflicted upon Arie include: * Kohta Komatsuzaki (also romanized as \\"Kouta\\" in some translations): a bully who had an obsessive crush on Arie and is plagued with guilt over not being able to protect her. He is ultimately consumed by pain and anger over losing her (to bullying at that). As he grows up, Kohta becomes more violent, physically taking out his unconscious anger on the people around him. As an adult, Kohta works at a supermarket, along with Arie's father. He frequently visits Nijigahara and occasionally hangs out in the well below. A symbolic item in the manga associated with him is a switchblade, used more and more as he becomes increasingly dangerous. * Hayato Wakamatsu: a fellow bully who was friends with Kohta. He was one of the children who pushed Arie into the well that day. This unconsciously creates a strain in Hayato and Kohta's friendship, with Kohta going so far as to cut Hayato's face with his switchblade during a fight, and Hayato retaliating by smashing Kohta's head with a cinderblock and throwing him down the same well where Arie was thrown. The incident left Kohta mentally disturbed, and led to him being frequently hospitalized as an adult. Hayato grows up to become a policeman, marked by a scar on his face from Kohta's attack. * Kyoko Sakaki: the students' fifth grade teacher during the year Arie was thrown into the well. Prior to these events, Sakaki once saw a man raping Arie in a field, and tried to stop him. In defense, the man grabbed a cinderblock and struck her in the eye, an injury that led to blindness. Bitter about the incident, Sakaki vowed to never get involved in the children's affairs, and thus did not intervene during the time Arie was being bullied, even though she was aware of it and strongly believes the well incident was an act of bullying rather than an accident. She married a fellow teacher and had a pair of twins, but having repressed emotions of anger and guilt made her hate her family and become abusive to her children. She ends up divorcing her husband and neglecting her children. * Father Kimura: Arie's father. He is a loser of a man. It is stated that his wife left him and Arie for another man six years prior to the events of the manga. The mother's dead body was found near Nijigahara tunnel prior to Arie's incident at the well. Throughout her childhood, Arie's father regularly raped her, as she reminded him of his wife. In the present timeline, he worked at the same supermarket as Kohta until Kohta stabbed him in the neck with his switchblade, leaving him hospitalized. He shows remorse for his treatment of Arie and seems to be waiting for fate to bestow some type of punishment upon him. * Amahiko Suzuki: an extremely suicidal and depressed boy, having tried to commit suicide multiple times during his childhood, which caused him to change schools often. He is emotionally neglected by his foster parents, with his stepmother going so far as to tell him to die. The only people who showed him affection were Sakaki and his classmate Higure Narumi, who had a crush on him. During one of the timelines, he assaults and attempts to rape and murder Arie, at which point he learns that Arie is his biological sister. As an adult Suzuki is still depressed, and spends his time having existential crises and caring for his cancer-ridden father. * Narumi Higure: Narumi was in the same class as Arie and the others. She was a very quiet and obedient student, preferring to observe her classmates and write notes in her diary instead. Narumi had a crush on Suzuki, and was one of the few people who truly cared for him. She actively tried to make him a better person with things like inviting him to her house to play video games and preventing him from bullying another student. She was the younger sister of Makoto, and was murdered by him when he intentionally started a house fire. * Makoto Higure: the older brother of Narumi. On the surface he appears friendly and carefree, but he is actually an extremely dangerous and demented person. As a child, it is implied that he often abused Narumi, and eventually murdered her along with his parents in an intentional house fire. When Arie was younger, she befriended Makoto and would meet with him every day to write out the fairy tale of the monster. Makoto became obsessed with Arie and one day raped her in a field. He was the man who blinded Sakaki during her attempts to stop him. It is hinted that Kohta may have seen him running away from the incident. Makoto was never caught for his crimes, but he is haunted by his actions and his loss of Arie, who never came to see him again after the assault. As an adult, he is the owner of Prism Cafe and is Maki's boss. The symbolic item associated with him is an umbrella, as he was carrying one the day he raped Arie. Makoto is later murdered by Kohta by being stabbed through the heart with an umbrella. * Maki Arakawa: a jealous girl in Arie's class, and arguably the one who set off the chain of events leaving Arie in a coma. Maki had a deep crush on Kohta since childhood, but he did not reciprocate her feelings because he was in love with Arie. Out of revenge, Maki became the main perpetrator of Arie's well incident. As an adult, she is shown to be cold and manipulative, attempting to use men for her emotional needs and fairly fickle in relationships. She aspires to be a painter, but her emotional coldness is symbolized in her failed art career, as her art patrons complain about a lack of emotion in her work. Thus she works part-time at Cafe Prism, with Makoto as her boss. In adulthood she finally seduces Kohta into a relationship, her wish to be with him finally coming true, or so she thinks. In reality, Kohta at this point is so mentally disturbed by the events of the past and suppressed anger that he is emotionally gone, to the point where he hourly forgets who Maki even is or that they are even in a relationship. Though he had a few casual sexual encounters with Maki, he does not love her and is still aware of her involvement in Arie's death, making Maki's crime against Arie a useless act of violence since she will never have Kohta's love. Maki eventually becomes disturbed by Kohta's obsession and comfort of hanging around Nijigahara tunnel. While depressed about Kohta, Maki begins a relationship with Makoto, thinking she has found some peace with him. In reality Makoto does not love Maki either, and possibly agreed to the short relationship to fill the void and obsession he feels for Arie. During an obsessive tirade comparing how Maki is pathetic compared to Arie, Makoto attempts to assault Maki in the same field where he raped Arie. Maki is saved when Kohta, who had been hanging out in Nijigahara tunnel, murders Makoto. While Maki committed her violence against Arie out of vengeance for love, she ultimately did not find love from anyone. Release The manga was serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Quick Japan by Ohta Publishing from November 2003 to December 2005. Ohta Publishing collected the 13 chapters into a single volume on July 25, 2006. Fantagraphics Books announced that it had licensed the manga in North America on January 1, 2013. Fantagraphics noted that the manga would be darker than their previous two releases, but still be part of their initiative to publish \\"unique artistic voices,\\" adding that it would be translated by Matt Thorn. The manga was subsequently published on March 19, 2014. The manga has also been published in France by Panini Comics, in Spain by Ponent Mon and Milky Way Ediciones (republisher), in Italy by Panini Comics, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Brazil by JBC, and in Taiwan by Taiwan Tohan. Reception Asano at Toronto Comic Arts Festival 2018, holding a copy of the Fantagraphics translation of the manga Jason Thompson of Anime News Network found the manga to be confusing and dark, but said: \\"manga is about flow, but it takes skill to play with that flow as much as Inio Asano does in Nijigahara.\\" He also likened the manga's portrayal of the dark sides of people to David Lynch's films. Comparing the manga to Asano's previous works, Johanna Carlson of Comics Worth Reading said that it has \\"the same strong focus on character, but with much more emphasis on the creepy and violently destructive.\\" She concluded that \\"the complex, multi-layered storytelling rewards attention.\\" Ng Suat Tong of The Hooded Utilitarian felt that the quality of the manga which required looking at it as a whole was atypical in the industry, which emphasizes ease of reading. They called the manga as a whole \\"a marvel of narrative needlework and one of the best comics to have been translated in recent years.\\" In a starred review, Publishers Weekly called the manga a \\"dark and twisted psychological horror story\\" which is \\"equal parts beautiful and highly disturbing\\", adding that it is \\"impressive and will leave readers puzzling about it, with many likely returning to dig deeper and discover further meanings.\\" Hillary Brown of Paste compared the manga to the film The Butterfly Effect, finding the manga more favorable, saying: \\"the book is interesting—even as it frustrates—with its complicated timelines and penchant for big reveals.\\" Laura Hudson of Wired called it a \\"haunting graphic novel\\", categorizing it as a horror story, saying: \\"it's not a particularly easy story, or a nice one, but it is unflinching and beautiful.\\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club described it as \\"a challenging title that forces the reader to confront terrifying situations without offering much comfort afterward\\", concluding that \\"Asano's skill delivers a haunting story that ultimately delivers substantial rewards, even with its unsolved mysteries.\\" Kevin Church of Comics Alliance found that the story didn't feel cheap, \\"even with the unrelenting bleakness of the narrative\\" due to Arié's impact on the lives around her. He also complimented the story's focus, its balanced symbolism, and Asano's detailed art and depiction of facial emotion. Lastly, he found the manga much more difficult than Solanin, but called it a worthwhile challenge that \\"carries a palpable dread that will haunt you well after you put it down.\\" David Berry of the National Post found fault in Asano's over-indulgence in implying that everything in the manga is connected, but called the story \\"one that can still capture a unique moment with piercing emotionality, leaving feelings lingering like evening shadows.\\" The manga charted on The New York Times Manga Best Sellers list, being the sixth best-selling manga for the week ending on March 8, 2014. The manga was nominated for the 2014 Diamond Gem Awards—which are selected by comic book retailers based on sales—for the category Manga Trade Paperback of the Year. Paul Gravett listed the manga as his tenth top manga of 2014, sharing the spot with one other work.

Donald Mitchell, The Independent, 23 October 2011. The guide was an ambitious attempt to give a picture of the arts as a whole in each age of Britain and to allow comparison between the ages and of how the different arts had treated the themes of their age. Ford wrote in his general introduction to the series that \\"the degree to which the individual arts have flourished are not fortuitous, but are bound up with the social aspirations and characteristics of the age, with its beliefs and preoccupations and manners, which may favour expression in one art rather than another.\\"Vol. 1, p. x. Each volume of the guide takes the form of an introduction by Ford followed by essays on each branch of the arts by other contributors and finally an extensive bibliography. Publishing history In 1992, the series was republished in paperback as The Cambridge Cultural History of Britain with revised titles that made each volume more suitable for sale on its own.

It was established in 1921, soon after the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929). In peacetime, the division consisted of two cavalry brigade headquarters commanding a total of four regiments, but its wartime organisation specified one cavalry brigade headquarters commanding two or three regiments, as well as divisional-level combat and support units. Along with the rest of the Yugoslav Army, the 1st Cavalry Division began mobilising on 3 April 1941 following a coup d'état, and was still engaged in that process three days later when the Germans began an air campaign and a series of preliminary operations against the Yugoslav frontiers. By the end of the following day, the division's cavalry brigade headquarters and all of the division's cavalry regiments had been detached for duty with other formations of the 1st Army Group. The divisional headquarters and divisional-level units remained in the vicinity of Zagreb until 10 April, when they were given orders to establish a defensive line southeast of Zagreb along the Sava River, with infantry and artillery support. The division had only begun to deploy for this task when the German 14th Panzer Division captured Zagreb. The divisional headquarters and all attached units were then captured by armed Croat fifth column groups, or surrendered to German troops. alt=a colour map Background alt=Map highlighting the location of Yugoslavia The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created with the merger of Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav-inhabited areas of Austria- Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the immediate aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as a means by which to secure political hegemony for the large Serb minority. The army's development was hampered by the kingdom's poor economy, and this continued during the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army was renamed the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ). The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in their invasions of Poland and France. The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše but also from the country's Slovene and ethnic German minorities. Formation and composition Peacetime organisation The 1st Cavalry Division was established soon after the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and was part of the army order of battle formalised in 1921, at which time it consisted of four regiments. According to regulations issued by the VKJ in 1935, the 1st Cavalry Division was headquartered in Zagreb during peacetime, and was under the control of Cavalry Command in Belgrade, as was the 2nd Cavalry Division, which was located in southeastern Yugoslavia at Niš. The division's units were manned by a mixture of full-time and part-time personnel. In peacetime, the 1st Cavalry Division comprised: * Headquarters 1st Cavalry Brigade in Čakovec near Zagreb * Headquarters 2nd Cavalry Brigade in Subotica in the Banat north of Belgrade * 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Virovitica on the Drava River in Slavonia * 3rd Cavalry Regiment, based in Subotica * 6th Cavalry Regiment, based in Zagreb * 8th Cavalry Regiment, based in Čakovec Wartime organisation The wartime organisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army was laid down by regulations issued in 1936–1937, which introduced a requirement to raise a third cavalry division for war service. The strength of a cavalry division was 6,000–7,000 men. The theoretical war establishment of a fully mobilised Yugoslav cavalry division was: * headquarters and headquarters company * a cavalry brigade consisting of 2 or 3 cavalry regiments * an artillery battalion of four batteries, one of which was motorised and equipped with anti-tank guns * a bicycle-mounted infantry battalion with three rifle companies and one machine gun company * a signals squadron * a bridging squadron equipped with pontoons * a chemical defence platoon * a divisional cavalry battalion consisting of two cavalry squadrons, a machine gun squadron, an engineer squadron and a bicycle company * logistics units, including a transport battalion Each cavalry regiment was to consist of four cavalry squadrons, a machine gun squadron, and an engineer squadron. Shortly before the war, an abortive attempt was made to motorise the 1st Cavalry Division, but this was stymied by a lack of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence. The 1st Cavalry Division was also never equipped with the planned motorised anti-tank battery, and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with World War I-vintage pieces. Two peacetime components of the division, the Headquarters of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised, so the primary fighting formation of the 1st Cavalry Division was the 1st Cavalry Brigade, commanding the 2nd, 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments. Deployment plan In case of war, Yugoslav planners saw the 1st Cavalry Division as forming the reserve for the 1st Army Group. The 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia, the 4th Army for defending the eastern sector along the Hungarian border, and the 7th Army for the German and Italian borders. The 1st Cavalry Division was to be deployed around Zagreb. On the left of the 4th Army, the boundary with the 7th Army ran from Gornja Radgona on the Mura through Krapina and Karlovac to Otočac. On the right of the 4th Army was the 2nd Army of the 2nd Army Group, the boundary running from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka. The Yugoslav defence plan saw the 1st Army Group deployed in a cordon, the 4th Army behind the Drava River between Varaždin and Slatina, and the 7th Army along the border region from the Adriatic in the west to Gornja Radgona in the east. The planners estimated that cavalry formations would take four to seven days to mobilise. Mobilisation After unrelenting pressure from Adolf Hitler to join the Axis powers, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, a military coup d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force commander, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. The same day as the coup, Hitler had issued Führer Directive 25, which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state; on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and the command structure for the invasion, which was to commence on 6 April. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki. The commander of the 1st Cavalry Division was Divizijski đeneral Dragoslav Stefanović. While the divisional headquarters and other divisional-level units were mobilising in Sesvete near Zagreb, the headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Brigade had been designated to command Detachment Ormozki, and the 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments and the divisional artillery battalion had also been allocated to that formation. This reduced the main fighting elements of the division to a single cavalry regiment (the 2nd), which was mobilising in Virovitica. The rest of the 1st Army Group reserve comprised an independent artillery battalion mobilising in Zagreb, and the 110th Infantry Regiment which was moving to Zagreb from Celje, a distance of to the northwest. By early morning of 6 April 1941 when the invasion commenced, the 110th Regiment had reached Zidani Most, still some from Zagreb. Operations Stripped of most of its subordinate units, the 1st Cavalry Division remained in reserve near Zagreb during the first few days of fighting. On 10 April, due to the critical situation on the front of the 4th Army, the division was directed to take under its command the 110th Infantry Regiment and the independent artillery battalion, and defend against crossings of the stretch of the River Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb, while collecting stragglers and organising resistance. These orders were quickly overtaken by the rapid advance of the 14th Panzer Division to Zagreb when it broke out of its bridgehead across the Drava River at Zákány on the Hungarian border. By 19:30 on 10 April, lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb, having covered nearly in a single day. Armed fifth column Ustase groups and German troops disarmed the division and its attached units before they could establish any coherent defence along the Sava. On 15 April, orders were received that a ceasefire had been agreed, and that all VKJ troops were to remain in place and not fire on German personnel. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis; Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania all annexed parts of its territory. Almost all of the Croat members of the division taken as prisoners of war were soon released by the Germans; 90 per cent of those held for the duration of the war were Serbs.

Administered by UC San Diego, the site is owned by the University of California and managed for teaching and research. The reserve protects some of the last remaining coastal salt marsh in Mission Bay. The city of San Diego’s adjacent Northern Wildlife Preserve expands this wetland habitat to approximately 40 acres (32 hectares). History In 1952, Lena Kendall and the A. H. Frost estate donated two parcels of the upper marsh to the University of California. In 1965, the site became one of the first seven reserves in the newly established Natural Lands and Water Reserve System, now known as the University of California Natural Reserve System. Ecology The reserve ranges from high marsh to submerged shoreline and include coastal salt marsh, mudflats, tidal channels, and salt flats. Subtidal habitats feature eelgrass beds that shelter juvenile fish and invertebrates. Algae and bacterial mats coating mudflats exposed by high tide feed shorebirds and other species. The salt marsh supports California cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) and perennial pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica). Slightly higher in elevation is the midmarsh zone, with salt-tolerant plants such as sea lavender (Limonium californicum) and saltmarsh daisy (Jaumea carnosa). The drier high marsh is dominated by plants such as rambling sea- blite (Suaeda californica) and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). As one of few wetlands in the San Diego area, the reserve attracts many bird species. These include many shorebirds such as long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus) and one of California's rarest birds, the light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes). Artificial nesting platforms at the reserve were established for the rail in 1987; these keep eggs and chicks dry during high tides yet safe from land predators such as feral cats and raccoons. The tidal channels of the marsh shelter native fishes such as the California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis), which live in hypersaline pools, and longjaw mudsuckers (Gillichthys mirabilis), while arrow gobies (Clevelandia ios) live in burrows often occupied by ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis). Use The marsh is used by students and scientists to study salt marsh ecology and practice field research techniques. Restoration efforts, such as a project to rid the marsh of invasive mangrove, have helped to improve the functioning of the habitat and improve conditions for native species.

He is a gunslinger named Snipe Harding, who has been hired by Stragg to kill the sheriff and the witness. Snipe recognizes that killing Ward will be difficult, knowing him to be a fast draw. After he kills Miller, he persuades Stragg to challenge the sheriff to a showdown in front of everyone in town. When the men draw, Snipe shoots the sheriff from a hiding place. Doc Carter and others can only conclude that Ward was shot in a fair fight. Faron, however, is suspicious, and Doc's examination proves that the sheriff was shot with a rifle, not a pistol. He goes gunning for Snipe, killing him, and the townspeople come to his aid when Stragg attempts to flee.

He amassed great wealth with partner Herman D. Aldrich as the co-founder of McCurdy and Aldrich, a commission firm which traded Southern cotton and other dry goods prior to the Panic of 1857. He lost his bid for Congress as a Whig in the late 1850s, and served as Commissary-General for the State of New York during the American Civil War. Early life Robert Henry McCurdy was born in 1800 in Lyme, Connecticut. He was the son of Ursula Wolcott (née Griswold) McCurdy and Richard McCurdy, a Yale graduate who served in the Connecticut House of Representatives. His older brother, Charles Johnson McCurdy (1797–1891), went on to serve as Lt. Governor of Connecticut as well as the United States Chargé to the Austrian Empire from 1850 to 1852. He was of Scotch Irish descent on his paternal side; as early as 1503, King James VI leased the vast majority of the Isle of Bute to the MacKurerdy family (later McCurdy). His paternal grandfather, John McCurdy, emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1745 prior to the Declaration of Independence. His mother's family was of English descent and his maternal great-grandfather, Matthew Griswold, served as the 17th Governor of Connecticut from 1784 to 1786.

Additionally, McCurdy made contributions to the Union Defense Committee of New York. It was also during the war that he became a founding member of the Union League Club of New York. McCurdy was a co-founder of the Continental Fire Insurance Company. He was also a founding trustee of the Mutual Life Insurance Company. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Merchants Exchange Bank and the American Exchange National Bank. Personal life McCurdy married Gertrude Mercer Lee (1809–1876), niece of Theodore Frelinghuysen, a United States Senator and former vice presidential candidate.

It was a party of the German-speaking bourgeoisie, had anti-clerical positions and sought to defend the privileges of German-speakers vis-à-vis the rising national movements of the Slavic minorities in the Habsburg monarchy. It supported the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, transforming the Austrian Empire into the Austro-Hungarian Dual monarchy and the 1867 December Constitution, which is why it received its name. Afterwards it became the strongest political group in the Imperial Council (the parliament of the Cis- Leithanian, i.e. Austrian-dominated, part of the empire) until 1879.

The song was released as the fifth single from his debut studio album Blue Neighbourhood (2015). It was written by Sivan, Alex Hope, Jack Antonoff and Claire Boucher. The song's official lyric video was released on 17 October 2016. The video was released on 19 January 2017. Background The song details Sivan’s struggle with coming out as gay. He explains “When I first started to realise that I might be gay, I had to ask myself all these questions—these really really terrifying questions. Am I ever going to find someone? Am I ever going to be able to have a family? If there is a God, does that God hate? If there is a heaven, am I ever going to make it to heaven?” He refers to the track as “the most important song” he has ever made. In an interview with Vulture magazine, Sivan said; “I came to the point where I wanted to delve into something a bit more specific about my experience as a gay man. I went into the studio and had to revisit some pretty uncomfortable and sometimes painful memories of what it was like to be 15 years old and in the closet. I started writing this song called \\"Heaven\\" about that experience.” Sivan added he was inspired by the documentary How to Survive a Plague.  Music video  The music video for \\"Heaven\\" was directed by Luke Gilford and released on 19 January 2017. According to a representative, Sivan was going to release the video on 20 January, to coincide with Donald Trump's inauguration. However, the release was forward a day due to an overwhelming response from fans to teasers for the clip. The black and white clip, sees Sivan being embraced by a man whose face is not shown, although it was later proven that it was the singer's boyfriend, Jacob Bixenman, while being soaked in the rain and pays homage to the LGBTQ movements and accomplishments that have come before him. The clip shows assassinated gay rights leader Harvey Milk alongside footage of Pride parades and same-sex weddings. Sivan's message that accompanied the clip read; “We have always been here. we will always be here. this video is dedicated to all who’ve come before me and fought for our cause and those who now continue the fight. in dark and light times, let’s love forever.”  Reception  Jenna Romaine from Billboard called the video \\"powerful\\" and \\"stunning\\".

The site is owned by the University of California and managed for teaching and research. It is adjacent to Long Marine Laboratory. The reserve encompasses a pocket beach, seasonal lagoon, wetlands, and coastal prairie on the western edge of the city of Santa Cruz. Other features include a sea stack, sea caves, and tidepools. History Donald and Marion Younger, whose family had owned a ranch in the area for over a century, donated the reserve to the University of California in 1972 to enable development of Long Marine Laboratory and protect the lagoon. The reserve was made part of the UC Natural Reserve System in 1987. The University added 47 acres of adjacent farm fields, an area known as Terrace Point, to the 25-acre reserve in 2008 as part of the establishment of its Coastal Science Campus.Fiedler, Peggy Lee; Rumsey, Susan Gee; Wong, Kathleen Michelle, eds. (2013). The Environmental Legacy of the UC Natural Reserve System. University of California Press. . Geography The reserve sits on the lowest and southernmost of the series of marine terraces that make up the Santa Cruz coastline. The lagoon was formed by a coastal stream when ocean waves eroded the sea caves beneath the coastal bluffs. The Y-shaped lagoon is seasonal, filling with winter and spring rains until winter storms erode the sandy berm at its mouth. At this point, the entire lagoon drains over the course of a few hours. Ocean waters fill the lagoon until waves reform the berm, enabling rain and runoff to freshen the waters again. Ecology The federally endangered tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) is the most abundant fish species in the lagoon. Surrounding terrestrial habitats feature willow thickets, dune plants, and pickleweed marsh. Common animals range from brush rabbits and striped skunks to coyote and bobcat. Shorebirds such as willets and sanderlings forage on the beach. Restoration efforts Younger Lagoon deploys interns and students to restore native vegetation around the lagoon and along the coastal prairie. Their experiments revegetating bluffs covered with non-native iceplant and remnants of brussels sprout fields inform research on habitat restoration. Cape Ivy has spread throughout some areas.

Contents The book begins with an introduction in which Lazreg had outlined her previously published statements, in which she criticized the ideas that women needed to be rescued from the veil or Muslim men, and she criticized the concept that Islam oppresses women. After the introduction, there are five chapters. Chapter 1 discusses wearing the hijab to show modesty. Chapter 2 discusses whether the hijab prevents men from making advanced towards women. Chapter 3 discusses using the hijab as a marker of a Muslim identity. Chapter 4 analyzes the issue in regard to religious conviction and piety. In Chapter 5 the author states her belief that women should not wear the hijab. The book has a strong focus on Algeria and her own experiences growing up, and according to Varisco it does not broadly cover the whole Muslim world and all social classes.Varisco, p. 217-218. The book includes content from interviews of Muslim women in the Middle East and North Africa as well as France and the United States; these women also discuss their experiences. Irina Vainovski-Mihai of Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University in Bucharest, Romania stated that the book is \\"not a scholarly treatise, but a very personal inquiry\\". Varisco stated that \\"Those who are looking for more fodder for Islam-bashing, as in the mass media accounts of Irshad Manji and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, will not find it in this book.\\"Varisco, p. 216. Reception Varisco described it as \\"an engaging book, challenging both those who would ban the veil as secular heresy and those Muslim women who consciously reduce their religion and their sex to the futile attempt to avoid a self-serving male gaze.\\" Faegheh Shirazi of the University of Texas stated that \\"writing is honest and easy to read, and she raises crucial points that must be examined further.\\"Shirazi, p. 412. Shirazi argued that women should be able to have a choice of whether to veil or not on their own terms, and that even though there are women who do not want to wear the veil and wear it \\"for the wrong reasons\\" there are many women who want to wear the veil and do not question it. Vainovski-Mihai stated that the book is \\"most readable and powerful\\" and that \\"Marnia Lazreg’s book is a rich and committed contribution to the current debate on the veil.

History The earliest direct predecessor of Frankford Friends School was the one-room “Spring House School,” built by Oxford Meeting in 1768 at the corner of Waln and Spring Streets. It was attended by both Quaker and non-Quaker children. Frankford, along the King's Highway between New York and Philadelphia, was a bustling area, frequently visited by members of the Second Continental Congress, including John Adams, Benjamin Rush, and Thomas Jefferson. Frankford Friends School was established on its present site in 1833. The school originally served students from pre-Kindergarten through sixth grade. In 1868 the meeting house was enlarged and the second story removed. Additional classrooms were built above the horse sheds on the property. Sometime during the late 1880s or early 1890s, a new brick schoolhouse was built. In 1924, a social room was added to the rear of the meeting house, and a few years later the porch was enclosed for the use of the Kindergarten. In the early years of the twenty-first century, grades seven and eight were added to the school, and the first eighth grade class graduated in 2004. In 2012, the Margaret Passmore Trickey building was built to house the expanded Middle School program. A half acre outdoor classroom/nature-based playscape and a STEM building was added in 2016 References Schools in Philadelphia Quaker schools in Pennsylvania Frankford, Philadelphia ","title":"Frankford Friends School"},{"id":"48724031","text":"Sir Ronald William Mack (20 May 1904 - 12 February 1968) was an Australian politician.

The Lowder's Ferry site, in Morrow Mountain State Park, was the first of three excavated in North Carolina to provide dating and divisions for the Middle Archaic period (6000-3000BC) in the Piedmont; specific styles of spear points in the various sites have given rise to the specific divisions now used by archaeologists. Tests in 1948 by Paul Strieff, a graduate student from Michigan, revealed evidence of Archaic deposits. The site was to become a parking lot, and grading the soil in the spring of 1949 exposed a number of pits. Work was halted for a brief investigation, which proved the site was so rich that archaeological work continued through the summer, with five trenches excavated.

Appadurai poses that when considering the financescape framework, we must consider how global capital today moves in an increasingly fluid and non-isomorphic manner, thus contributing to an overall unpredictability of all the five aspects of global cultural flows as a whole. The four other aspects Appadurai mentions in his article are ethnoscapes, technoscapes, mediascapes and ideoscapes. Appadurai further states that despite disjunctures having always existed between the flows of people, machinery, money, ideas and images, the world is at a crossroads where this is happening to a larger extent; pointing to the importance of studying the \\"-scapes\\". These disjunctures also contribute to the central idea of deterritorialization which Appadurai describes as the main force affecting globalization in the sense that people from different countries and socioeconomic backgrounds are mixing with one another; namely the lower class of some countries integrating in to wealthier societies via the work force. Subsequently, these people reproduce their ethnic culture, but in a deterritorialized context. The fluidity of capital has been expounded on further by sociologists such as Anthony Giddens who in his 1999 BBC Reith lecture on \\"Globalization\\" claims that the advent of electronic money has rendered the transfer of capital and finance around the world subject to an increasingly easy process that posits a major paradigm shift. Giddens suggests that this ease has the potential to destabilize what would be considered prior as stable economies.

He served under the Vichy government during the occupation of France in World War II (1939–45), and as a result was barred from politics until 1950. In the immediate post-war period he distributed funds from industry to support right-wing politicians running for election. He was elected to the senate in 1952 and was briefly Minister of Health in 1953 before being forced to resign by the communist deputies. Life Early years (1905–39) André Boutemy was born on 21 December 1905 in Bécherel, Ille-et-Vilaine. He was the son of a primary school inspector. He earned a degree in law, and was admitted as a rédacteur to the Ministry of Finance in 1929, where he was seconded to the Finance Committee of the chamber of deputies. In 1925 he entered the office of Jammy-Schmidt, undersecretary of state of Finance in charge of the liberated regions. At the start of World War II (1939–45) he was a subaltern civil servant in the Ministry of Finance. World War II (1939–45) During the war the Vichy authorities named Boutemy deputy prefect of Thonon-les-Bains in October 1940. On 29 November 1941 he was appointed director of General Information. In this office, where he served under Pucheu and Pierre Laval, he was responsible for tracking all real or potential opposition movements. On 14 May 1943 he was appointed prefect of the Loire, and on 11 June 1944 regional prefect of the Rhône. The German authorities explicitly approved his appointment as super-prefect for the Lyon region. Later he was accused of being directly responsible for killings of French Resistance fighters. Boutemy worked with Georges Villiers, who had been appointed mayor of Lyon after Édouard Herriot was dismissed. He saved Villiers from being executed by a German firing squad. He was removed from office during the Liberation of France and detained in Saint-Étienne, then in Fresnes Prison. Boutemy had assisted members of the Resistance, and therefore did not receive serious punishment after the Liberation. However, as late as 1948 the Council of State stated that whatever good deeds Boutemy had done during the war, \\"he had associated himself in the exercise of his functions in an intimate and active fashion with the policies of the government.\\" Post-war politics (1945–59) General Charles de Gaulle would not allow Boutemy run for election to the senate in 1948 on the Gaullist ticket, and this may have led to Boutemy's later hostility to the Gaullist Rally of the French People (RPF). Boutemy's civil rights were finally restored in November 1950. The Centre d'Études Economiques (CEE) was established in 1945 as a vehicle for distributing funds from industry to political parties. Boutemey and Maurice Brulfer headed the CEE, which gave funding to the right- wing Republican Party of Liberty (PRL). Boutemy worked with Georges Villiers, now president of the newly created Conseil national du patronat français (CNPF, National Council of French Employers). The CEE was closely associated with the CNPF, although Villiers would not attend meetings at the CEE offices since he did not want to appear involved in politics. According to Georgette Elgey, Boutemy was responsible for the \\"stupefying\\" role of business in the 1951 elections. A PRL leader wrote, \\"This support called or nothing in return ... He [Boutemy] dispensed his envelopes with the pride of a nabob in splendid surroundings, but he was poorly rewarded for his generosity.\\" An incomplete list of 160 deputies assisted in this way was circulated in parliament after the 1951 elections. On 18 May 1952 Boutemy was elected to the Council of the Republic for Seine-et-Marne on the Union of Republicans list. He continued to support the interests of the employers movement while a deputy. Boutemy's position as their former paymaster would later give him considerable influence among deputies who had been helped. He was named Minister of Health and Population on 8 January 1953 in the cabinet of René Mayer. His appointment was highly controversial due to his wartime record. It was asserted but not proved that his appointment was due to pressure from the chemical industry, which was concerned about the efforts Boutemy's predecessor had made towards allowing free competition in a European market for pharmaceutical products. He was forced out of office by the communist deputies. After a hostile reaction to the budget he submitted for his ministry he resigned on 9 February 1953. Boutemy represented France at the European Parliamentary Assembly in 1957. On 2–3 June 1958 he voted for the constitutional revision that would create the French Fifth Republic. He was reelected to the senate in June 1958 at the head of the list of the Republican Union. Boutemy was reelected on 26 April 1959, and was active in the senate until shortly before his death. André Boutemy died on 14 July 1959 in Combs-la-Ville, Seine-et-Marne.

This power, as she describes in her 1978 essay “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power”, is a sense of deep satisfaction – beyond the sexual deceptively portrayed in the pornographic – elevated by a profound feeling that lives in the joy and fulfillment of a woman's being. This fulfillment becomes, as Lorde describes, the conscious decision in a woman's work, the power that embodies and manifests change in the fight against the oppression of women, especially Black women and women of color. This power of the erotic is a lifestyle, a potentiality that has been recognized as a threat, treated as suspect, and therefore suppressed out of fear, because as Lorde writes, “women so empowered are dangerous”. Lorde demonstrates in redefining and reclaiming the erotic – a profound feeling of knowing, an empowering knowledge, “a lens through which we scrutinize all aspects of our existence” – that the erotic is a critical element in dismantling the social and political hierarchy situated in a white patriarchal power structure that reproduces the erotic as pornographic. Lorde writes: “The erotic has often been misnamed by men and used against women…[confused] with its opposite, the pornographic…[and] pornography emphasizes sensation without feeling”. For the erotic to simply be the pornographic, would require the woman's experience to be reduced into a spiritual “world of flattened affect” thus rejecting the derivative of the very word erotic altogether, which “comes from the Greek word eros, the personification of love in all its aspects” [emphasis added]. To speak of the erotic as Lorde does, is to “speak of the lifeforce of women; of that creative energy empowered, the knowledge and use of which [women] are now reclaiming in our language, our history, our dancing, our loving, our work, our lives…[and exemplify] how acutely and fully we can feel in doing”  Beyond pornography  As Lorde writes, “the erotic has often been misnamed by men and used against women…made into the confused, the trivial, the psychotic, the plasticized sensation” Buried under this destructive social guise, the erotic gets confused with the pornographic, resulting in an interchangeable use within Western societies. Lorde challenges this misuse and labors to dismantle its foundation by explaining the two are not interchangeable, but are in fact, opposite one another. As Lorde writes: “Pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling” Whereas what the erotic more appropriately represents, is a power in knowing and feeling, “those physical, emotional, and psychic expressions of what is deepest and strongest and richest within each of us…the passions of love, in its deepest meanings…the self-connection shared…the measure of joy” The erotic is, as Lorde eloquently writes, “the nurturer, or nursemaid of all our deepest knowledge” The erotic is the spiritual powerhouse within the woman, the driving force housed within the manifestation of joy, true sensation, a profound sense of feeling, not simply a forced impression of feeling as the pornographic moves to sway understanding. This misrepresentation and misnaming in Western culture “gives rise to [the] distortion which results in pornography and obscenity” resulting in the absolute “abuse of feeling”.  Further discussion  American legal scholar, Catharine MacKinnon, builds upon Lorde's concepts that underscore the pornographic as a form of oppression by emphasizing that pornography not only works to oppress the erotic power of women, but also suppresses women's freedom of speech in her piece “Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech”. Pornography eroticizes “the unspeakable abuse: the rape, the battery, the sexual harassment, the prostitution, and the sexual abuse of children. Only in the pornography it is called something else: sex, sex, sex, sex, and sex, respectively” which thus contributes to the perpetuation of inequality between men and women, promoting a sense of normalization for these atrocities of abuse The erotic power that Lorde describes, a resource that “lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane” becomes twisted, perverted and used against women to maintain female subordination in the pornographic. In her work, MacKinnon draws connections between pornographic depictions of sexual acts and documented cases of sexual assault in which the abusive actions of the male perpetrator demonstrate a direct correlation between the pornographic depictions of sexuality and sexual acts of aggression. In this same work, she quotes a study detailing cases of men who watched pornography depicting acts of sexual assault confessed self-reported to being more inclined of committing aggressive acts of behavior towards women to include the greater likelihood of engaging in acts of sexual assault. These images create a desensitization regarding this particular type of aggressive behavior constructing a reality that silences women and the violence committed against women's bodies. When women report instances of sexual assault or violent sexual behavior, their voices are dismissed, as pornography has distorted the reality of sexual aggression. Pornography becomes another way of silencing women, another way of distorting their experiences. Pornography becomes the snatching away of credibility, sexual violence replaced with a westernized version of ‘eroticism’.

Since 1987 it has been the seat of the Archbishop of Camerino-San Severino Marche, having been the seat of the Archbishops of Camerino from 1787 and previously that of the Bishops of Camerino. History The present church was built in 1802-1832 based on designs by Andrea Vici and Clemente Folchi. It was erected on the site of the previous medieval Romanesque-Gothic cathedral, destroyed in the 1799 earthquake. The sacristy still houses works such as a 13th-century painted crucifix, a 15th-century icon of the Madonna della Misericordia, and other paintings. The church once housed a large polyptych by Carlo Crivelli, which was disassembled and sold: the central panel is now in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan.Turismo Marche, entry on cathedral.

He is the current Leader of the Civic Party and member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, representing New Territories East after winning the 2016 by-election. Background Yeung was born in Yuen Long, Hong Kong in 1981 as the only child to a restaurant owner and a jewellery dealer. He and his parents emigrated to Canada in the early 1990s after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Yeung graduated from the University of Western Ontario with a degree in political science and obtained a master of laws in constitutional and administrative laws from the Peking University around 2003. Political career Inspired by the major 2003 July 1 march, Yeung joined a group called \\"7.1 People Pile\\". He campaigned for Alan Leong Kah-kit, a barrister-turned-politician, in the 2004 Legislative Council election. From the following year, he studied for a master of arts in legal studies at the University of Bristol and became a certified barrister in 2008. He joined the Civic Party in 2011 and ran in the 2011 District Council election in Tai Po Market but was defeated. He was later elected to the Election Committee through the legal subsector in the 2011 Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector election. In 2012 Legislative Council election, he partnered with Ronny Tong to run in the New Territories East and successfully got Tong re-elected. He gave up his Canadian citizenship for the candidacy in the election. Yeung is currently chairman of the New Territories East branch of the party and member of the Appeal Panel (Housing), and also co-host of the political talk-show \\"Teacup in a Storm\\" on D100 radio station. He was recommended by Ronny Tong when Tong resigned from the Legislative Council in June 2015 to take up the seat in the February by-election. He retained the seat for the Civic Party by defeating Beijing-loyalist DAB candidate Holden Chow Ho-ding and localist Hong Kong Indigenous candidate Edward Leung Tin-kei, receiving 160,880 votes in the New Territories East constituency. In the September general election, Yeung sought re-election in New Territories East. From his leading position in opinion polls, he cooperated with Labour Party's Fernando Cheung and later on with other pan-democrat candidates to split the votes evenly to maximise the block's chances of winning seven out of the nine seats. He was re-elected with 52,416 votes, along with six other anti-establishment candidates. Following the election, he succeeded Alan Leong as party leader, in an acting capacity from 1 October and formally, through a party election, in November. Disqualification Five weeks ahead of the 2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council Election, on 30 July, as Yeung prepared to defend his seat, the government stated that he was among a dozen pro-democracy candidates whose nominations were 'invalid', under an opaque process in which, nominally, civil servants - returning officers - assess whether, for instance, a candidate had objected to the enactment of the national security law, or was sincere in statements made disavowing separatism.Hong Kong bans Joshua Wong and 11 other pro-democracy figures from legislative election, HKFP, 30 July 2020 References 1981 births Living people Hong Kong emigrants to Canada Peking University alumni Alumni of the University of Bristol University of Western Ontario alumni Barristers of Hong Kong Civic Party politicians Hong Kong radio personalities HK LegCo Members 2012–2016 HK LegCo Members 2016–2020 Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Members of the Election Committee of Hong Kong, 2017–2022 ","title":"Alvin Yeung"},{"id":"48724780","text":"British Motor Museum, Gaydon 1946 Allard J1 Whittingham & Mitchel of Fulham United Kingdom were motor coach and body builders.

Written by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, it stars Dolph Lundgren as Jebediah Woodley, a demon hunter who travels to Mississippi in the hopes of destroying an ancient, homicidal demon. Kristina Klebe, Tony Bentley, James Chalke, and Miles Doleac appear in supporting roles. Mendez was attached to direct for over four years. Originally set in Alaska, once green-lit the script was altered and filming moved to Mississippi over financial concerns. The budget was less than $1 million, with $15,000 of it raised via the crowdfunding website Indiegogo. Lundgren was cast around 9–10 months before filming commenced, whilst Klebe only had one-to-two weeks notice. After being postponed twice, principal photography commenced over the 2015 Christmas holiday season in Lexington, Mississippi. Filming concluded after 17 days of shooting, with the film having its premiere at the Fantasy Filmfest in Hamburg, Germany, on August 27, 2016. This was followed by the North American premiere on September 26, 2016, at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. A limited theatrical release followed on March 3, 2017, via AMC Theatres. Opening to mostly positive reviews, Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times, described Don't Kill It as one of Lundgren's \\"most entertaining movies in years.\\" Plot While chasing deer on a hunting trip in southern Mississippi, Gabriel's dog discovers and opens a small, unusual golden container. When Gabriel finds his dog, it acts strangely before violently attacking him. After shooting and killing the dog in self-defense, Gabriel returns home, displaying the same unusual behaviors and black eyes. In the wake of killing his family, Gabriel enters a neighboring house and begins to slaughter everyone in sight before being shot dead by his neighbor, Marcus, who immediately gets the same black eyes and completes Gabriel's task; by murdering his own family. A few days later, demon hunter Jebediah Woodley hears of the murders on the radio and travels to the small town to investigate. At the same time, FBI agent Evelyn Pierce, who grew up in the area, has been assigned to investigate the case for possible links to domestic terrorism. Woodley travels to the local police station to express his concerns. However, Pierce - along with Dunham, the local police chief - quickly dismiss Woodley's claims of demon activity and order him to be detained under the assumption that he is mentally ill. Whilst Pierce leaves to interview a witness to the most recent series of murders, Woodley advises her to ask about the killer's eyes. Upon interviewing the witness, it is explained to Pierce that Gabriel entered the witness' home and killed her daughter before being shot by her husband, Marcus. Marcus then executed their son and attempted to murder her before she escaped. Pierce learns that the husband's eyes also turned black before he went into a murderous rampage; thus realizing Woodley is in fact telling the truth. Back at the station, Woodley is released by Pierce and Dunham. At a nearby café, Woodley explains to them that the demon possesses the body of whomever killed its last host. He goes on to say: the only way to defeat the demon is by killing the host whilst simultaneously ensuring your own death; his own father captured the demon when he was a child and poisoned himself before killing the host. Woodley held onto the captured demon for decades before it escaped. After stocking up on weapons and ammunition, Woodley and Pierce's investigation takes them to a nearby cabin in the woods. Woodley and Pierce mistakenly capture a drunkard living in the cabin, who says he shot the demon in the stomach and that it was his friend, Glen, that executed the demon's host; and ran off into the woods immediately following the incident. Woodley and Pierce proceed to track the demon through the woods, which ends with Pierce being attacked by the demon. Instead of killing her, the demon shows an interest in Pierce and attempts to get her to kill it, giving her horrible visions of an apocalyptic future. Woodley tries to subdue the demon, but before he can do so, it manages to escape. Later, Pierce visits her old home with Woodley and tells him that she drowned to death in her garden pool as a child, but was mysteriously brought back to life. This resulted in her family being persecuted and run out of town by superstitious citizens. Dunham organizes a town hall meeting, late at night, to warn citizens of the danger. During his speech, Dunham is interrupted by the demon, who slaughters the congregation and rapidly changes bodies before Woodley can get to it. It flees to a nearby house, where it manipulates a young girl into killing its host; thus taking over the girl. Dunham flees the town; at the same time Woodley enters a church, where the local pastor, Erikson, who remains suspicious of him, accuses Woodley and Pierce of being evil and the cause of mayhem. Woodley reacts by punching Erikson, and leaves to rejoin Pierce. The father of the now-possessed girl, Emmett, encounters Woodley and Pierce in the middle of the anarchy; urging both to help him. Woodley and Pierce travel to Emmett's home, where it is revealed Emmett has locked his daughter in a backroom. Woodley convinces Emmett to poison himself and kill his daughter, ending the demon's trail as before. However, the FBI - who have been called there secretly by Pierce - storm the home before Emmett can carry out the killing, and Emmett dies uselessly; the head agent, Deacon Shepherd, has Woodley arrested for poisoning him. The possessed girl slaughters the FBI agents except for Shepherd, who mortally wounds the demon before it flees. Fleeing farther into the woods, the demon's host eventually dies and it possesses Shepherd; given he mortally wounded the demon minutes prior. The demon once more goads Pierce into killing it. Woodley risks his own life to successfully capture the demon and prepares to poison himself in an effort to kill the demon, like his father before him. Before completing the ritual, Woodley and Pierce are interrupted by Erikson, who has tracked them down with an angry mob of congregation members; under the assumption Woodley is evil and has captured an innocent man. Erikson attacks Woodley as the mob frees Shepherd, who immediately begins to murder everyone present. Erikson kills Shepherd and is possessed. As the demon tries to kill Woodley, Pierce grabs a vest covered in grenades from a dead FBI agent's corpse and pulls the pin out before killing Erikson. As the demon takes over Pierce, apocalyptic phenomena from Pierce's earlier visions begin to occur. Whilst possessed Pierce levitates off the ground, but the grenade in her hand detonates, killing both her and the demon. Some time later, Woodley is seen on a boat in the middle of the ocean. Having captured the remains of the demon in a flask, Woodley drops the flask into the ocean. The flask is quickly consumed by a great white shark, implying the events will repeat in the near future.

Producer Robert Yocum introduced the script to Mendez, having seen his previous work and believing Mendez's \\"frenetic energy\\" to be well suited for the project. The script was set in Alaska and had a \\"30 Days of Night [and] Fargo feel\\" to it. However, when Don't Kill It was green-lit, it was a case of: \\"great, we're shooting in Mississippi.\\" Due to the small budget, Mendez knew they weren't \\"going to cover the town in snow and pretend it's Alaska\\", so he had to adapt \\"very quickly\\" to the situation at hand. In order for them to create the \\"final elements\\", producer Scott Martin raised over $15,000 for the film via Indiegogo; his initial aim was to raise $100,000 through crowdfunding. Casting Dolph Lundgren in 2015, around the time he was cast as Jebediah Woodley Dolph Lundgren was cast in the lead role of Jebediah Woodley, his debut in the horror movie genre. He found out about the role 9–10 months before shooting began on the film. He rehearsed different pages of dialogue and monologues in a short space of time while production was postponed on two occasions, which caused the character to grow on him. On his character, Lundgren said: \\"Jebediah Woodley is one of those guys that when I'm sitting in my rocking chair one day, thinking back, I'll remember that guy. He was a fun guy to play.\\" Kristina Klebe portrays FBI Agent Evelyn Pierce. Just before Thanksgiving and about two weeks before shooting began, Mendez gave her a call and said he would send her the script. Despite working with Mendez on Tales of Halloween (in 2015) and The Last Heist (the following year), Klebe still had to \\"put herself on tape\\" because they were auditioning a few people. She did not hear anything back until four days before filming. The delay was because of a failure to agree, not the point at which she was cast. On Klebe's performance, Lundgren said: she \\"plays her character pretty straight\\", which worked \\"quite well\\" in retrospect due to Woodley's \\"crazy and colorful\\" nature. He went on to say: \\"Kristina really loved the part, so she was very accommodating and willing to explore it and work hard.\\" Ryan Zweers and Tony Messenger portray Jebediah Woodley (aged 12) and Jebediah Woodley Sr., respectively. A casting call from Morgan Casting went out via Backstage magazine in December 2015, advertising pay for both roles as being $100 per day. Filming Principal photography lasted 17 days in Lexington, Mississippi, over the 2015 Christmas holiday season. Mendez said they had 12 days to prepare beforehand, during which time he was \\"lucky\\" to get five or six hours sleep each night. The town initially sought for filming refused to grant permission, so the production crew had to move \\"20 miles out.\\" Mendez claims the \\"town [used for filming] had never had a movie shot\\" there before, and went on to say: \\"it's actually one of the poorest suburbs in America, to be honest.\\" The city and public were very interested in the production and the presence of Dolph Lundgren within their community. Furthermore, the local authorities were helpful and provided the production crew with access to different locations, including the local church, as well as \\"police cars [to shut down] streets for filming.\\" Release Archstone Distribution acquired the worldwide distribution rights on May 27, 2015, at which time it was announced they would launch sales at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. Don't Kill It received its worldwide premiere on August 27, 2016, at the Fantasy Filmfest in Hamburg, Germany.\\"Fantasy Filmfest Catalogue (August 17–28, 2016)\\". Fantasy Filmfest. August 8, 2016. Retrieved June 30, 2017. This was followed by its North American premiere on September 26, 2016, at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. On March 3, 2017, the film had a select theatrical release and was made available through video on demand.

Domestic box office takings are not known, however the film did gross $8,196 during a cinematic release in the United Arab Emirates on January 25, 2018. Critical response Initial reactions Don't Kill It reportedly premiered to \\"rave\\" reviews at many major film festivals around the world. Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle, attended the US premiere in Austin, Texas. In a positive review, he described \\"this horror-comedy [as a] gutbuster [of] belly laughs.\\" Unlike Lundgren's other movies, Don't Kill It \\"revels in his dry yet goofy sense of humor, rather than the taciturn killer he was born to play.\\" Lundgren was the component Mendez \\"really needed\\"; \\"perfectly\\" self-aware; his \\"perfect muse/foil for his brand of smartly/silly horror spoof\\". Bloody Disgustings Trace Thurman came to the same conclusion as Whittaker, stating: there is \\"plenty of tongue in cheek\\" in which \\"Dolph Lundgren [is given] a chance to shine.\\" According to him, Don't Kill It \\"plays like a B-movie version of Fallen, but without the class of that latter film; that's a compliment. Who knew that Lundgren was such a comedian? There were some moments in the film that had to have been improvised, and they're such treats to watch.\\" Unfortunately, the film \\"peaks early\\" with the church shootout. The scene is \\"so fantastically entertaining that nothing that comes after it is able to measure up to it.\\" Contrarily, Thurman took aim at Klebe, stating: \\"[she] is serviceable as Pierce but she is stuck playing the Felix Ungar to Lundgren's Oscar Madison. Woodley needs a foil but Pierce spends the first half of the film being a stick in the mud. One wishes that she was given more to do.\\" On the other hand, Ari Drew of Dread Central said: \\"On the surface, Don't Kill It has all of the makings of a standard Syfy original action-horror offering; the dialogue is often ridiculous, the action sequences outrageous, and the characterization is relatively thin. However, the plus side here is that Mendez’s film most definitely knows what it is and how to have a blast with it. This is particularly evidenced in its opening scene, which is a rollicking exercise in over-the-top hyperviolence.\\" General consensus The film received mainly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 92% based on 13 surveyed critics, with an average rating of 6.6 out of 10. Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times, called the film one of Lundgren's \\"most entertaining movies in years.\\" He praised screenwriters Dan Berk and Robert Olsen for their \\"clever story about a supernatural force that turns its human hosts mindlessly homicidal\\". On the contrary, he criticized Mike Mendez for his editing, claiming \\"his many, many set-up scenes are to clunky\\", but on a positive note gave him praise for the fast pace and \\"lightness\\" of the film. Matt Donato of We Got This Covered, awarded three out of five stars, stating: \\"Don't Kill It is some DIY insanity that leaves more scattered limbs than an overturned Halloween decoration truck\\". He praised Lundgren for his \\"enjoyable comedic wit\\", saying he carries it \\"a lot farther than you'd expect\\". Hayleigh Foutch of Collider, said the film \\"is a cheeky camp parade with buckets of low-rent charm, and for fans of camp cinema and Lundgren's B-Movie fare, Don't Kill It will fit like slipping into something cozy and familiar with a few surprises along the way.\\" Agreeing with Donato, she said: Lundgren \\"rarely gets to have so much fun\\" in his movies. And like others, she spoke of the \\"lull [in the] second act\\", during which time the movie falls into \\"exposition and back story\\". Michael Nordine of The Village Voice, gave a somewhat negative review, stating: \\"[Lundgren] seems to hover just above the material, aware of its silliness but willing the indulge it all the same. Those who favor gore above all else will be at home amid the blood and guts, but anyone hoping for more than a VOD time-killer that's occasionally in on the joke of its own ridiculousness is barking up the wrong tree.\\" Potential sequel Lundgren said he would be open to returning for a sequel, but would prefer any potential sequel will have better planning and \\"more resources\\" at hand. On a similar note, Mendez said: \\"People are reacting to the film so much, and what we constantly hear is, 'Will there be another one?' What more could you ask for? We're finding [Jebediah] at a moment in time. There have been adventures before and there will be adventures afterwards, so I'm hoping we'll find a financial partner that wants to explore that and take that ride, because we'd love to explore that, too.\\" Notes References External links  2016 films 2016 horror films 2010s comedy horror films 2010s supernatural horror films American films American comedy horror films American supernatural horror films Crowdfunded films Demons in film Films set in Mississippi Films shot in Mississippi Indiegogo projects 2016 comedy films ","title":"Don't Kill It"},{"id":"48724865","text":"Karl Kehrbach (22 August 1846, Neustadt an der Orla - 21 October 1905, Charlottenburg) was a German pedagogue best known as editor of the multi- volume Monumenta Germaniae Paedagogica.

Malagapo founded the Philippine Community School in Al-Khobar (PhilCoSa) in December 1994 and the school was organized the following April; its first academic term began in June 1995, with 104 initial students. The school was established during a crisis at the International Philippine School in Al Khobar. It was renamed to Asia International School (AIS) in 1999 as it got a temporary license, no. 40/s from the Saudi Ministry of Education (MOE). The school experienced problems since the license did not cover the school's curriculum and due to periods when there was no Saudi sponsor. The ministry attempted to close the school while no sponsor was present but the principal's wife prevented the closure. The ministry granted license no. 133/s after Prince Bandar Al-Saud Al-Kabeer and his wife Mishael agreed to sponsor the school. In the 2003–2004 school year it was known as Al- Khobar Asian International School () because even though license 133/s stated that the school would be known as Al-Andalus International School, its current name, there was another school with the same name in Riyadh, so the Saudi Ministry of Commerce did not permit the school to use its current name. The school began using its current name after the Saudi MOE stated that the school's license would not be renewed if the school did not change its name to the current one.

He also served as the chairman of the Virginia State Board of Education from 1975 to 1978. Biography Thomas, who was born in Norfolk to Minnie Allison Thomas and Vincent Graves Thomas on September 20, 1922, was a lifelong resident of the city. He graduated from Maury High School in 1939. In 1943, Thomas received a degree in electrical engineering from the Virginia Military Institute. In 1960, the Norfolk City Council appointed him to the city's school board. He became chairman of the Norfolk from 1962 to 1972, when he was appointed to the statewide Virginia State Board of Education. In 1971, the Norfolk Public School system began busing students to schools across the city to fulfill a school desegregation initiative which had been ordered by the courts. Speaking at a rally in opposition to the busing, Thomas, who was chairman of the Norfolk School Board, pledged to keep his children in public schools and urged other parents to support the desegregation busing plan. One month later, Thomas published a 17-page press release. In his statement, Thomas called the busing initiative a failure, lamenting the flight of white families and students to the suburbs, \\"I was greatly disturbed that the so- called solution to Norfolk's problem resulted in the loss of about 20 percent of our white children.\\" Thomas then served as the chairman of the Virginia State Board of Education from 1975 to 1978. Thomas won election to the Norfolk City Council in 1976, as part of a group of candidates backed by Norfolk's business leaders. The city council also elected the Norfolk's mayor at the time. The city council elected Thomas as the new mayor in 1976 by a 4–3 margin on the 27th ballot. He was re-elected as mayor by the city council for three additional term, each unopposed from 1976 to 1984. Thomas supported the construction of the Waterside development, as well as the downtown revitalization efforts. Mayor Vincent Thomas held a meeting with the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1983 to discuss Norfolk's controversial school busing plan. The busing program was discontinued in 1986. Thomas actively supported the candidacy's of Norfolk's second African-American city council member. He declined to seek re-election in 1984. Shortly after his decision not to seek re-election, Thomas called for an increase in African-American representation in the city government. Vincent Thomas died at the Harbor's Edge retirement community in Norfolk on November 7, 2015, at the age of 93.

Part of the Australian frontier wars, the most recent scholarship indicates that it is likely that it resulted in the deaths of tens or scores of Aboriginal people. The events leading up to the fatal clash included the killings of three European settlers by Aboriginal people, the killing of one Aboriginal person, and the death by poisoning of five others by European settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three Aboriginal people were killed or died of wounds from the clash and five were captured, although accounts of the killing of up to 260 Aboriginal people at the cliffs have circulated since at least 1880. Aboriginal people from the west coast of South Australia have oral history traditions that a large-scale massacre occurred. In the 1920s and 1930s, several historians examined the archival record and concluded that there is no formal or direct evidence of a massacre on a large scale, and opined that the recorded events were exaggerated by storytellers over time. More recently, another historian concluded that the rumours relating to a massacre are founded in fact, and that some form of punitive action did take place on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay, but that it had been embellished into a myth. An attempt in the 1970s to build a memorial for the Aboriginal people killed in the massacre was unsuccessful, as the District Council of Elliston demanded proof that the massacre occurred before permitting a cairn to be placed on the cliffs. The deaths of the European settlers killed in the lead- up to the clash have been memorialised to some extent; in 2017 the Elliston District Council erected a memorial to acknowledge what occurred. In recent years authors have concluded that, whether or not a massacre occurred on the large scale suggested by some accounts, the clash has become something of a \\"narrative battleground\\" between the documented and imagined history of European settlement and the Aboriginal oral history of the frontier. In May 2018, the Elliston District Council received a national award for their work in memorialising the massacre. Background alt=a map showing the boundaries of South Australia within Australia In March 1839, European settlers arrived from Adelaide, the capital of the colony of South Australia, to establish Port Lincoln on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula. There were significant clashes between settlers and Aboriginal people in the years that followed, as settlers spread out to establish pastoral runs around the township. This fighting formed part of the Australian frontier wars. In 1842, soldiers were sent to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to help protect the settlers, but the remoteness from Adelaide, and the vaguely defined powers and limited policing resources of the Government Resident, the local representative of the colonial government, meant that there were serious limitations on the rule of law in the region. This was especially true with respect to Aboriginal people, who were supposed to be treated as British subjects in the same way as the settlers. In common with other areas of South Australia, and Australia as a whole, settlers on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes resulted in violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man, the only such sentence in South Australia's pioneer history. This frontier violence has been described by the authors Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck as an undeclared covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people. Between June 1848 and May 1849, there were a series of incidents between settlers and resident Aboriginal people in the Elliston district, located northwest of Port Lincoln. This region was inhabited by Aboriginal Nauo, Kokatha and Wirangu people. In the first of these incidents, John Hamp, a hutkeeper on the Stony Point sheep station, was speared and clubbed to death by Aboriginal people on 23 June 1848. The second incident occurred in August when at least one Aboriginal person was shot by the overseer of the same station for stealing a shirt. In May 1849, five Aboriginal peopletwo adults, two boys and an infantdied after eating poisoned flour stolen by an Aboriginal man from William Ranson Mortlock's station near Yeelanna. The man from whom the flour was stolen was arrested and charged with murder, but sailed for the United States soon after being released by the authorities. According to the Commissioner of Police, this poisoning may have led to two Aboriginal revenge killings of settlers later that month. On 3 May, James Rigby Beevor was speared to death at his hut, and four days later Annie Easton was speared to death on an adjoining lease. Her unharmed infant was found beside her body. Recorded events According to official records, on 27 May 1849, stores were taken from a hut on Thomas Cooper Horn's station and a hutkeeper and shepherd were threatened by Aboriginal people, who left with the goods they had taken. The station owner and some of his station hands pursued the group, and when they caught up with the fleeing party of Aboriginal people shots were fired and spears thrown. The Aboriginal group split in two, and Horn and his men followed one party to the Waterloo Bay cliffs, which the group tried to climb down to make their escape. Horn and his men opened fire, and two Aboriginal people were killed and one fatally wounded; several more were captured. The Government Resident and the police inspector from Port Lincoln both wrote detailed accounts of the incident, neither mentioning the many casualties. One specified that only two Aboriginal people were killed. In September, a group of Aboriginal men were transported to Adelaide for trial. Two were convicted of Beevor's murder and were transported back to the Elliston district, where they were hanged outside his hut. Three were charged with the murder of Easton, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. Others were charged over the confrontation at the hut on Horn's station. Shortly after this, two more Aboriginal men were arrested in Port Lincoln by the police and charged with the murder of Hamp. Found guilty and sentenced to death, they were later released when doubts were raised about the testimony of Aboriginal witnesses located by the police. In February 1852 another Aboriginal male was arrested as an accomplice in Hamp's murder, but after being transported to Adelaide, he too was released for lack of evidence. He tried to walk home to his country, and was murdered by four Aboriginal men for trespassing. Later accounts of a massacre On 14 August 1880, an account of the events of the late 1840s on the Eyre Peninsula, written by the adventurer, journalist and preacher Henry John Congreve, was published in the Adelaide Observer, a weekly newspaper, as \\"A Reminiscence of Port Lincoln\\". The authors Robert Foster, Rick Hosking and Amanda Nettelbeck describe this as a \\"fanciful and sometimes wildly inaccurate fictionalising\\" of what occurred. It ascribed four murders to one Aboriginal male, stated that Easton's infant had also been murdered, said that many Aboriginal people were shot and survivors driven over a cliff, and mixed up several of the recorded details. In a letter to the editor, a correspondent noted several errors in the account, and Congreve was asked to respond. He stated that he never intended the story to have the \\"weight of a historical document\\", and that it was written merely as \\"illustrative of the trials and dangers of the early settlers\\". According to Foster and his co-authors, Congreve's account was \\"not history, but fiction designed to illustrate\\", which had \\"exaggerated and distorted what had (probably) happened\\". The next account of the 1848–49 events in the Elliston district was a short story called \\"Doctor\\" written by the author Ellen Liston, and published in the Adelaide Observer of 17 June 1882. It was based loosely on the murder of Annie Easton, although the protagonist was pregnant and was not herself killed, but lost her baby as a result of the attack. In Liston's story, the \\"hands\\" from surrounding stations then undertook a \\"crusade against the natives\\". Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck note that the Government Resident's clerk reported on 16 May 1849 that three parties of volunteers were out looking for the Aboriginal people responsible for the Beevor and Easton murders. Liston's story was reprinted twice in 1936, the centennial year of South Australia. In the first case, Liston's story was reprinted with the removal of three paragraphs—one about \\"troublesome blacks\\", another about the protagonist's sense of a \\"vast and terrible stillness\\", and the third about the \\"hands\\" conducting a \\"crusade against the natives\\". In the second case, Liston's story was reproduced verbatim. By the turn of the century, what has been described by a Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck as a \\"well-developed local legend\\" was circulating about the \\"Elliston incident\\". In 1906, a travel guide, The Real West Coast: A Picture of a Rumour-Damaged Country, was published by E. W. Parish. In it, Parish related that while travelling in the area he had heard different versions of a \\"tragic legend\\" regarding a massacre. The key elements of this legend were that Hamp's severed head was found in a camp oven at his hut by his 12-year-old son, John Chipp Hamp, that the Aboriginal people responsible for the murders had been rounded up by a group of horsemen and herded over the cliffs, and that there were many Aboriginal casualties. In 1915, a former policeman from the district who had served there well after the events described had his recollections published in the South Australian Register newspaper. His version included all the now- familiar aspects of the legend, including the head in the camp oven, but also the detail that Hamp's son had been held captive by Aboriginal people for three months before he was rescued. There was no evidence given in the Supreme Court trial of his murderers that supports the idea that Hamp was decapitated, or that his son was present when his body was discovered or that he was abducted. In 1926, a letter to the editor of the Register asking about the origin of the name Waterloo Bay sparked a lively exchange between a Register journalist and west coast local Archie Beviss and others. According to Foster and his co-authors, Beviss was relying on local hearsay about the massacre, and he is now associated with the \\"most bloodthirsty versions of the legend\\". Beviss claimed to have been told about the massacre by several people, including Hamp's son, as well as James Geharty, one of the police officers involved in investigating the murders. Beviss stated that Hamp's son was a 16-year-old shepherd at the time of his father's murder, and that he had found his father's head, which had been cut off with a crosscut saw, in a camp oven. According to Beviss, after the murder of Easton, Geharty urged the government to take action, and after approval was given, a force of 160 men was raised. The force then drove about 260 Aboriginal people over the cliffs. Finally, Beviss stated that Geharty named Waterloo Bay after the massacre. Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck have identified several inconsistencies in Beviss' account: Geharty did not name Waterloo Bay; Beviss named Easton's husband as being involved in the drive against the Aboriginal people, but James Easton went to Adelaide after his wife's murder and never returned; there is no evidence that the government sanctioned the raising of a force; and if 160 men participated in the drive, the authors question why no first-hand accounts of the massacre exist. Despite its inaccuracies, the Beviss account had a strong influence on later retellings of the story. For many years, both John Chipp Hamp and Geharty figured prominently in stories of the massacre. According to several accounts, Hamp's son was also involved in spreading the story of his father's death, including the episode of the head in the camp oven, and that he was the one who discovered the body. Geharty was also mentioned by several of those telling the story but, again, there are serious questions about the accuracy of his statements. In 1932, a version was told in The Advertiser in which a party of 200 bushmen drove a group of Aboriginal people to the cliffs, but there was possibly only one victim. The writer claimed he had been told this by Geharty. From 1926 onwards, most accounts of the massacre usually referred to the archival and newspaper record and noted that there was no evidence for a massacre on the scale of that claimed by Congreve, Beviss or John Chipp Hamp. In 1936, the historian James Dugald Somerville wrote a series of articles in the Port Lincoln Times regarding early settler life on the Eyre Peninsula, in which he concluded that \\"it is a certainty that the Waterloo Bay 'massacre', as pictured by H.J.C. [Congreve],.. A. Beviss and others did not occur, and that the natives did not cut the head off Hamps' body and place it in the camp oven\\". In 1937, it was suggested by the Adelaide newspaper, The Chronicle, that the gazetted name for the bay around which Elliston is built, Waterloo Bay, is a reference to the Aborigines who \\"met their Waterloo\\" there in the 1840s. The presence of adjacent landmarks with gazetted names associated with the Duke of Wellington's defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, such as Wellesley Point and Wellington Point, and the fact that the names were not associated with those places until 13 years after the massacre, raise questions about this interpretation. In 1969, local author Neil Thompson published a book, The Elliston Incident, which included the camp oven story and said that Geharty (spelled Gehirty in the book) was involved in rounding up Aboriginal people and driving them over the cliffs south of Elliston, resulting in 20 deaths. For many years, Aboriginal people from the west coast of South Australia have retold the story of a massacre at Elliston as part of their oral history. Memorialisation The 2017 memorial plaque at Elliston commemorating the massacre In 1970, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and the South Australian Aborigines Progress Association (SAAPA) unveiled a plan to build a cairn on the cliffs at Waterloo Bay to \\"commemorate a massacre of 250 Aboriginal people by white settlers in 1846\\". It was intended that the cairn would be part of a national mourning campaign by Aboriginal people, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of the landing of Captain James Cook at Botany Bay in New South Wales in 1770. John Moriarty, the deputy president of SAAPA, said that \\"the Elliston massacre was part of the history of the West Coast Aboriginal population, despite strenuous efforts by the relatives of the whites involved to discredit what is a well-known fact\\". The chairman of the District Council of Elliston, J. B. Cameron, said that the council would agree to the cairn being built if it could be proved that the massacre took place. He also said that a memorial to Aboriginal people who lost their lives in the early development of the area might be built. Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck note that this offer was presumably on the condition that there would not be any reference to the alleged massacre at Waterloo Bay. This story, published in The Advertiser, resulted in a series of letters to the newspaper, from people with a range of differing viewpoints about the massacre story. These included assertions of the existence of an oral history among Aboriginal people of the west coast that a massacre did occur. In December 1971, a small granite memorial to Hamp was erected at the site of his hut, and in the early 1970s the locations of events leading up the alleged massacre were marked by P. J. Baillie. These included the sites of the Beevor and Easton huts, the tree from which Beevor's murderers were hanged, and Easton's grave at Lake Hamilton. Until 2017, no memorial to the Aboriginal people killed in the lead-up to or during the fatal clash had been erected. In May 2017 it was reported that a memorial to these events at Waterloo Bay had been unveiled by the local council at Elliston, and after some discussion in the district over whether what happened there should be referred to as a massacre or an incident, the council agreed on including the word \\"massacre\\" on the plaque. The Elliston council's work to acknowledge the massacre through the memorial was recognised in the 2018 National Local Government Awards in the \\"Promoting Indigenous Recognition\\" category. The mayor who presided over the sometimes rancorous process through which the memorial was established, Kym Callaghan, later said that he was very proud that the massacre had been properly recognised, and observed that \\"it's like a big dark cloud has been lifted off the town\\". He ascribed his defeat in the November 2018 mayoral election to a backlash over his role with the project. Authenticity and interpretations According to Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck, the most rigorous inquiries into the alleged massacre have been made by four professional and amateur historians, A. T. Saunders, Somerville, Baillie, and Greg Charter. Saunders was the Register journalist who engaged with Beviss in the pages of that newspaper in 1926, and relied on the official records made by the Government Resident and police inspector, which do not support the massacre story. Somerville examined the limited records held by the South Australian Archives, and concluded in 1936 that there was no formal evidence of a massacre, and that the confrontation at Horn's hut precipitated the \\"myth\\". Baillie worked with Somerville and agreed with his conclusions, adding that the facts of the incident at Horn's hut had been used by \\"ambitious raconteurs [to] superimpose ... the massacre story, elevating modest fact to unbridled fancy\\". In 1989, Charter re-examined the archival evidence, and concluded that it \\"appears likely that the rumours relating to the Elliston Massacre have a foundation in fact, and that some form of punitive action did take place on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay, upon which an exaggerated myth had developed\\". In 1993, Aboriginal people from the west coast were still relating their oral history regarding a massacre, with the recorder of these interviews, Pat Sumerling, stating that, \\"[a]s the Aboriginal oral tradition is of crucial importance to their culture, with traditions handed down from generation to generation, one cannot dismiss their disturbing claims\\". Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck also interviewed Aboriginal people from the west coast on several occasions about the incident, with broad agreement in several aspects; the location near Elliston, that about 250 were herded together and forced over the cliffs, and additionally, that not all of the Aboriginal group were killed, the majority concealing themselves at the foot of the cliff until the settlers left. In 2000, the author Iris Burgoyne wrote of the oral history about the massacre: As part of the investigations that led to the establishment of the memorial, the Elliston council engaged an anthropologist, Tim Haines, to examine the event. He concluded that \\"[w]e won't ever know for certain what exactly happened on the cliffs overlooking Waterloo Bay\\", but indicated that while it was unlikely that hundreds of Aboriginal people were killed there, it was likely that tens or scores were killed. Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck conclude that whether or not the scale of the bloodshed equaled the massacre described in some versions of the story, the fact that it continues to be retold reflects a \\"deep unease about the communal memory of frontier history\\" in South Australia. Quoting the observation of the historian J. J. Healy that incidents such as this have become \\"narrative battlegrounds\\", they stress that these competing narratives are divided into people who are sympathetic to the plight of the Aboriginal people on the frontier, and those who wish to praise the \\"bold, resolute and resourceful\\" actions of the early settlers facing the threat Aboriginal people posed to settlement. One conservative estimate holds that 80 settlers died in South Australia during the frontier wars, while a highly speculative estimate of Aboriginal deaths places that toll between 400 and 800.

The larvae reach a body length of up to , they are yellow-colored with black markings. Like many ground beetle larvae they are elongated with two extensions (urogomphi) at the rear end. They have characteristic double-hooked mandibles. The larvae feed exclusively on amphibians, which they lure by waving their antennae and making prey-like movements. The larvae can often evade the first strike of the amphibian by being alert, and then strike back at once, while the amphibian is in close proximity. Latching on with their mandibles, they suck the body fluids of their new host, progressing to chewing its skin and eating its tissues. Eventually they may kill their host. Even if they are taken into the amphibian's mouth at the first strike, they may survive; one young frog appeared to find the larva it caught distasteful, failed to spit it out, swallowed it, only to regurgitate it a couple of hours later, covered with mucus but apparently unharmed. When the larvae molt, they drop off their host and need to find a new one. The adult beetles are generalist predators and scavengers, but can also feed on amphibians much larger than themselves.

Minn. 1976), was a United States District Court for the District of Minnesota case that determined the Reserve Mining Company was responsible for amphibole asbestos fibers found in the public drinking water of Duluth, Minnesota and other North Shore (Minnesota) communities. After the discovery of taconite in the late nineteenth century, scientists struggled to find ways to extract iron ore from this sedimentary rock, which contains 25 to 30 percent iron. The process that was eventually developed involves crushing the hard rock into a powder-like consistency. The iron ore is then removed with magnets and turned into pellets. By 1955, the Reserve Mining Company complex was built to extract iron from taconite. A new town, Silver Bay, was constructed to support it. For every ton of iron ore produced, however, two tons of waste material was leftover. The Reserve Mining Company dumped the waste material, called tailings, into Lake Superior. Permits to do this were approved by the state. The waste material was initially considered no more harmful than sand. But by the late 1960s, local environmental groups, commercial fishermen, and sport-fishing groups began to complain about the taconite sediment. They argued that the tailings were killing fish, permanently clouding the pristine waters, and spoiling Lake Superior as a freshwater source for Duluth and the surrounding communities. Environmental organizations, scientists, and lawyers made the case that the tailings not only polluted Lake Superior but that they contained cummingtonite-grunerite. This substance is found in asbestos, a known carcinogen. On February 17, 1972, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the Reserve Mining Company in U. S. District Court in Minneapolis. This led to a trial that would last over a year. Appeals dragged the case on until 1980. Judge Miles Lord presided over the court. Pretrial arguments took a turn in June 1973. The federal government called a specialist in asbestos exposure, Dr. Irving Selikoff, from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Dr. Selikoff argued that the lake contained asbestos-like fibers. He also said he thought a thorough study should be done on the effects of the lake water on the human body. Judge Lord put Dr. Selikoff's testimony under an order of secrecy, but the information wasn't contained. Eventually, the Lord allowed the EPA to issue an asbestos warning to the public. The asbestos issue defined the trial when it officially began in August 1973. The public, already alarmed by reports of asbestos deaths around the country, was fixated on the trial. It was also covered in the national press. The Reserve Mining Company claimed that it was impossible to dump the tailings on land. During the trial, however, subpoenaed documents showed that Reserve had already examined dumping the sediment on land as an alternative method of disposal. Both the federal government and Reserve relied on a prestigious lineup of scientists to buttress their case. After months of testimony, Judge Lord decided that dumping the tailings into Lake Superior posed serious health and environmental threats. In April 1974 he ordered the plant shut down. The plant was closed temporarily. But a federal appeals court allowed Reserve to reopen the mine and to continue dumping in the lake until the company could find a new disposal method. In 1980, Reserve began to deposit waste in an inland pond. This practice continues with the companies that mine taconite today. The ruling in United States of America v. Reserve Mining Company was considered a landmark decision. It gave the EPA broader powers to regulate corporate pollution, a practice was unheard of before the lawsuit.

It was incorporated on 25 October 1883, prior to the 1888 establishment of the rural District Council of Kanyaka, which surrounded the town for most of its history. It consisted of a 171 acre area in Quorn township itself, with parkland surrounding the town subsequently serving as the boundary with the Kanyaka council. It was divided into four wards: North, South, East and West, each represented by two councillors. It gained a small section of the cadastral Hundred of Pichi Richi on 18 April 1888. The council was based out of the Quorn Town Hall from the building's opening in 1891 until 1953, when it moved to a purpose-built standalone council chamber in Seventh Street. The council was responsible for water supply in Quorn from 1898 to 1943, and responsible for electricity supply from 1923 onwards; it generated its own electricity until 1959-60, and resold power purchased from the Electricity Trust of South Australia for the remainder of its existence. Its population in 1936 was reported to be 1,080. It merged with the District Council of Kanyaka on 1 April 1969 to form the District Council of Kanyaka-Quorn. Both former council chambers survive, with both its successor councils (Kanyaka-Quorn and the Flinders Ranges Council) based out of the 1953 building, and the former town hall remaining as a heritage-listed public hall.

Raqqa in Syria became its headquarters. The Wall Street Journal estimated that eight million people lived under its control in the two countries. In June the group proclaimed a \\"worldwide caliphate\\" and shortened its name to just \\"Islamic State\\" (IS).  Timeline   January 2014  * 3 January: ISIL proclaims itself as an Islamic state in Fallujah. After prolonged tensions, the newly formed Army of Mujahedeen, the Free Syrian Army and the Islamic Front launched offensives against ISIL in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo and Idlib. These groups, proclaiming a \\"second revolution\\", attacked ISIL in many village areas, attacking up to 80% of those in Idlib and 65% in Aleppo. * 4 January: Fallujah was captured by ISIL after several days of fighting which left more than 100 dead.

Iraqi forces and their tribal allies recaptured Albu Farraj and Al-Nasaf near Ramadi. * In late January, Haji Bakr, ISIL's then second-in-command, was reported to have been assassinated by Syrian militants. Haji Bakr had previously been head of al-Qaeda's military council and a former military officer in Saddam Hussain's army. They were unaware that they had killed the strategic head of the group calling itself \\"Islamic State\\".  February 2014  * 3 February: al-Qaeda's general command broke off its links with ISIL, reportedly to concentrate the Islamist effort on unseating President Bashar al-Assad. * By mid-February, al-Nusra Front had joined the battle in support of rebel forces, and expelled ISIL forces from the Deir ez-Zor province in Syria. * 19 February: An ISIL leader, Abd Khaliq Mahedi, surrendered to the Chairman of Sons of Iraq Council, due to disagreement with other ISIL leaders on the killing of Iraqi soldiers and bombing of civilian houses. * 23 February: ISIL carried out a suicide attack in Aleppo, killing a commander of Ahrar ash-Sham (Abu Khalid al-Suri) and six other members of the group. * 28 February: The pro-government Sunni tribal Sheikh and councilman, Fleih al-Osman, and six of his men were killed by a suicide bomber in Haditha.

Events such as the Black Saturday bushfires, the Christchurch earthquakes, Cyclone Yasi and the extensive flooding that blanketed Australia resulted in the tragic loss of both life and property. In many cases, those affected were underinsured, or not insured at all. Know Risk aims to counter this issue and improve community resilience. Know Risk was conceived in 2011, and launched with Insurance Tracker on 12 June 2013 by The Hon Bill Shorten. Know Risk was named the winner of a 2012 Resilient Australia Award and was highly commended at the National Resilient Australia Awards. Know Risk was shortlisted in the Industry category for the 2014 MoneySmart Week Awards. Products and services Know Risk covers all lines of insurance, including auto, health, house, life, travel as well as addressing technological risk, small business coverage and weather and disasters information.

It was added to the South Australian Heritage Register on 12 January 1984; it is also listed on the Register of the National Estate. It was built by the Corporate Town of Quorn in 1891 to a design of Adelaide architect F. W. Dancker, and erected by Port Augusta contractors Moran Bros. The hall had dimensions of 68 ft by 40 ft, and 20 ft high. The foundation stone was laid on 7 February that year by the wife of mayor Richard Foster; at that time, it had cost £854 10s., and was expected to run to £1,000 for the building itself, with another £350 to fit out and furnish the hall. An acetylene gas lighting system was installed in 1904. In that year, the building contained the main hall, an office shared between the Quorn council and the District Council of Kanyaka, a public reading room and library, and a room for the Institute Committee. By 1910, concerns were being raised about the hall being inadequate for the needs of the town, as it repeatedly proved too small for events held there. Councillor Hudson, in that year, stated that \\"the lodge room was not large enough to swing a cat in, the institute was too small, as was also the stage and body of the hall, they had no room for holding small meetings in, and the lack of dressing rooms made Quorn a laughing-stock to more up-to-date towns\\". The council struggled at the time to find the funds for necessary extensions, while acknowledging their necessity. A cinema was conducted in the hall in the years prior to World War II. Both councils vacated the building by the 1950s, the Quorn council building a new chamber in Seventh Street (the modern Flinders Ranges Council building) in 1953, and the Kanyaka council converting a house in Eighth Street for their office; however, it remained in use as a community hall. Several additions were made during the twentieth century, and the building was remodelled in 1978, with the stage removed to enlarge the hall. In 2016, it continues in use as a hall, and houses a bar in the former ladies' rest room, council archives in the former library reading room, and a supper room in the former council offices.

She studied to be a teacher but instead apprenticed to a photographer. By 1901 she owned and operated the Standiford Photographic Studio in Louisville, Kentucky. In the early part of the 20th century she experimented with early photographic techniques such as the autochrome Lumiere and photo-viewing devices such as the diascope. An example of her early photography is the autochrome Lumiere diascope of two of the children of Eleanor Silliman Belknap Humphrey. 2015-12-02 1405 photo file for EBH Standiford-Mehlingan moved the Standiford Photographic Studio from Louisville to Cleveland, Ohio in 1919, locating first in the Gage Gallery of Fine Arts, then in the Chilcote Building (1925), and subsequently in the Hickox Building at 1030 Euclid Avenue, where she worked into the 1930s. She was awarded prizes for her photographs of Cleveland's elite of the 1920s and 1930s at the Cleveland Museum of Art exhibitions. A collection of her work, including photographic portraits of important citizens of Cleveland, is held by the Western Reserve Historical Society. One of her portraits and a statement about the portrait may be found in The American Annual of Photography. A photo of Louis Rorimer (1872-1939) by Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan appears in an article about him in an interview with his grandson from The Plain Dealer. Ethel Standiford's portrait of Louis Rorimer is of the patriarch of this family, the father of James Joseph Rorimer (1905-1966) who is the man upon whom the role of Lt. James Granger was loosely based in the film The Monuments Men. James Rorimer was one of the Allied special forces in the Monuments, Arts, and Special Archives program who helped recover confiscated art from the Nazis during World War II. James Rorimer later became the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a major force behind the creation of The Cloisters. His character as a young American soldier is played in the film by Matt Damon. The interviewee in The Plain Dealer article by Steven Litt is also named Louis Rorimer, but he is the grandson of the subject of the Standiford portrait shown in the article and the son of James Rorimer. Two photographs of Anna Burge Muir, attributed to Standiford studio and borrowed from a 1927 Louisville Herald-Post article, appear in a website about The Little Colonel, a series of stories for children by Annie Fellows Johnston. One photo is of Anna Burge Muir as a child and one is of her as the grownup wife of lawyer Edward Porter Humphrey. Anna Burge Muir Humphrey was the real-life model for the character Anna Moore (Rob Moore's cousin) in the stories. A portrait of Lily Belknap, daughter of Colonel Morris Burke Belknap and Lily Buckner, is included in the Louisville Herald Post collection of photos of prominent Louisvillians from Standiford Studio. Generally, Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan preferred men as subjects for her portraits and discussed her reasons in a 1932 interview published in the Middletown Times Herald in Middletown, New York. Faced with financial failure, she filed for bankruptcy and closed the Standiford Studio in 1936. She presented a portfolio of 500 autographed photographs of prominent Cleveland residents to the Cleveland Public Library. Clevelanders are represented in the collection through newspaper photographs and portraits by George Mountain Edmondson and Ethel Standiford.

It was started in response to Black Lives Matter after the homicides of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York on December 20, 2014. A golf cart participating in a Blue Lives Matter rally held in The Villages, Florida in June 2020. Criticized by the ACLU and others, the movement inspired a state law in Louisiana that made it a hate crime to target police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical service personnel. This law has been heavily criticized for extending hate crime law protections outside of characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, or gender identity, to include career choice. Also, evidence that violence against police officers is decreasing has been used to call into question the motivations for the law. History Thin Blue Line American flags emblazon a coffee house in Boise, Idaho in 2016 On December 20, 2014, in the wake of the killings of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, a group of law enforcement officers formed Blue Lives Matter to counter media reports that they perceived to be anti-police. Blue Lives Matter is made up of active and retired law enforcement officers. The current national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter is retired Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Randy Sutton. In September 2015, over 100 Los Angeles police officers took part in a Blue Lives Matter rally in Hollywood to \\"show support for the department at a time when. . .the ambush killings of police officers in cities elsewhere have left authorities across the nation feeling under siege.\\" Legislation Louisiana passed legislation in May 2016, making it a hate crime to target police officers or firefighters. The legislation, authored by state Representative Lance Harris, was signed into law by Governor John Bel Edwards. The law allows for hate crime felonies to carry an additional $5,000 fine or five years in prison, while hate crime misdemeanors to carry an additional $500 fine or six months in prison. Criticism A sign at one of the George Floyd protests Some critics of Blue Lives Matter state that one's job can never reach a deep identity significance and source of solidarity that one's racial identity can. Others state that black identity and history is constantly under threat of erasure while police officers do not face this threat. Another source of criticism is police officers are typically respected and honored in communities while African Americans in urban areas are suspected of being thieves and freeloaders. Finally, some state that supporters of Blue Lives Matter are intentionally or unintentionally supporting a system of discriminatory policing and racial profiling. Some critics of Blue Lives Matter laws state the laws are redundant as attacking or killing a police officer would already result in a harsher punishment than attacking a non-police officer. Others, such as St. Martinville Police Chief, Calder Hebert, say these laws will make resisting arrest a hate crime which has drawn criticism as hate crimes are crimes in which victims are targeted because of identity-based characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, or gender. Finally, according to FBI data, violence against police officers, as well as crime in general has decreased without these laws, calling into question their necessity.

The climate is hot and dry, apart from the southeastern coast, and the country offers a variety of habitats for wildlife including mountains, valleys, deserts, coastal plains and sea coasts. Geography Fog-shrouded Dhofar Mountains in southern Oman, near Salalah To the north of the country is a small exclave with a rugged coastline beside the Strait of Hormuz. This is the Musandam Peninsula, and is separated from the rest of Oman by part of the United Arab Emirates. The country in the north of the main part of Oman is mountainous, Al Hajar Mountains reaching almost to . They run parallel to the coast of the Gulf of Oman, with a narrow coastal plain in between. This is crossed by a number of wadis and has several oases. Central Oman consists of a tableland bounded to the west by the Rub' al Khali desert of Saudi Arabia. The coastline in eastern and southern Oman is barren. In the south of the country in the Dhofar Governorate, the mountains run in an easterly-westerly direction and include Jabal Samhan and Jebel Qamar. The climate in general is very hot, with temperatures rising to or more in mid-summer. About of rain falls annually in the Hajar Mountains in the north but the bulk of the country is very dry, with the exception of the southeastern coastal area which is humid and is subject to the khareef, a seasonal southeastern monsoon that brings rain and fog to coastal areas. In the summer, the weather pattern over the whole of the Arabian Peninsula is very static with a low pressure weather system stationary over the area. The low-albedo desert interior heats up and the hot air rises, but the humidity is so low that no clouds form. Dust however does get wafted aloft giving rise to the hazy conditions often seen here. Flora Over four hundred species of plant have been recorded in eastern Arabia. The most famous is probably Boswellia sacra, the frankincense tree, which only grows in the mountains of southern Oman, Yemen and northern Somalia. Though many parts of the coast are rocky, the coastal plains of the Al Batinah Region and the Dhofar Region are edged with dunes and saline marshes. Here salt-loving plants flourish and the dominant species include Zygophyllaceae, sea-lavender and white mangrove. Many of the salt-tolerant plants of Al Batinah differ from those of the south coast, and plants like Salsola drummondii, Bienertia cycloptera and Salsola rosmarinus are also found in the Irano-Turanian Region. Sabkhas (salt flats) with hypersaline conditions are typically marked by an absence of vegetation. In some cases plant life can be accommodated on small sandy mounds in these sabkhas known as nabkhas due to their relatively lower salinity levels. In the south of the country, the monsoon rainfall creates a wealth of vegetation that is not present in more arid regions. Fauna Arabian humpback whales off Dhofar One of the last places in which the Arabian leopard survives is the Dhofar mountains in southern Oman, and the Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve has been set up to protect these critically endangered big cats. Other carnivores present in the reserve include the striped hyena, Blanford's fox and Arabian wildcat. The central section of Oman has vast stretches of gravelly desert with very little vegetation. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was set up here to aid in the conservation of the Arabian oryx, and it is also a refuge for the sand gazelle, the mountain gazelle, the Nubian ibex, the honey badger, the red fox, the caracal, the sand cat and the Arabian wildcat. Over five hundred species of bird have been recorded from Oman. Some of these are resident, others arrive in spring to breed, departing by autumn. Still more are in transit, on migration routes between the Palearctic realm, Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent. The east coast with its mudflats and lagoons is visited by many species of wader, and the mangrove areas are home to the red-wattled lapwing and the collared kingfisher. The coast and offshore islands are home to gulls, terns and cormorants. The mountainous north of the country attracts many passerines in passage, the desert areas are home to the endangered houbara bustard, sand partridge, four species of sandgrouse, desert larks, pipits, wheatears and buntings. The mountains additionally attract golden eagles and Egyptian vultures. The Dhofar region in the south has a great variety of breeding and migratory species. The Omani owl (Strix butleri) is a species of owl discovered in 2013, and is believed to be the only bird endemic to Oman. Oman has about sixty-four species of reptile; these include lizards, skinks, geckos, agamas and a single species of chameleon. Most of the approximately one dozen or so snake species in the country are harmless, but the uncommon horned viper, carpet viper, puff adder and cobra are venomous. There are just three species of amphibian, one of which is the Dhofar toad. The number of freshwater fish found in the country is limited because there are few bodies of permanent water. The Oman garra is one fish found in the northern mountains, and it also has a blind version that lives in caves. Oman is also rich in marine diversity, especially cetaceans. There is a population of humpback whales that may be the most isolated, possibly the most endangered, and the only non-migratory population in the world. Off Muscat there are other humpback whales, pygmy blue whales, Bryde's whales, sperm whales, false killer whales, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins, and the occasional killer whale. Conservation Oman is more aware than some of its neighbours of the need to conserve its wildlife. It is a signatory to a number of treaties on global issues, and a number of areas have been set aside as nature reserves. Measures have been put in place to protect the beaches where the endangered green sea turtle breed, a leopard conservation trust has been set up, and the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was established and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. However, the Omani government later reduced the size of the protected area by about 90% to allow for oil prospecting, and in 2007, the sanctuary became the first ever World Heritage Site to be delisted.

If they are flying at night, it takes two or three days to reach their summer destinations. Research suggests that they are using winds as a passive means to help migrate. The direction of the winds influence their distribution within their summer range. Typically, the winds blow in a north-northeast direction towards Northern and Midwest United States. Factors such as warm temperatures and lack of Precipitation increases their range. Cold temperatures, major precipitation, and unsuitable environmental conditions are factors that will stop migration to continue more north. In late summer, cold fronts start to appear sending cues for them to leave. As they leave they get caught up in these fronts which carry them south to southwest to their overwintering range. Habitat and range Winter Due to their inability to tolerate the cold winter temperatures they must migrate south. Adults overwinter on hosts in the pine and mixed hardwood forests along the Gulf of Mexico and in the Southern United States.”Taylor, P., & Sheilds, E.

(2015). “Population Dynamics of Empoasca fabae (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in Central Iowa Alfalfa Fields.” Journal of Insect Science 15(1): 1-6. The entire population remains in this state for its migration and overwintering period. This diapause period ends from mid-January through February, and they begin to sexually mature. Egg laying During the spring migration north, the majority of the individuals are females. When they return if temperatures are above 10 °C they can start oviposition and populations grow and re-establish themselves. Empoasca fabae arrives back to their summer ranges during April or early May depending on the location.”Bentz, J., & Townsend, A. (2004). “Spatial and temporal patterns of abundance of the potato leafhopper among red maples.” Annals of Applied Biology 145(2): 157-164.

(1932). “Biology of the Potato Leafhopper, Empoasca Fabae (Harris), and Some Closely Related Species of Empoasca.” Journal of Economic Entomology 25(3): 639-646. Peak population densities occur during late May to late June. Many overlapping generations appear. After this their population densities begin to decline slowly. Individuals have a tendency to aggregate as their populations increase. At the end of the summer, individuals either die or migrate south.”Taylor, P., E, Sheilds., M, Tauber., & Tauber, C.

ENT facts http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef115.asp Retrieved 28 November 2015 The egg’s incubation period ranges from 4 through 23 days, the hatchings are called nymphs. New hatchlings are white in colour and develop their green colouring as they age. The nymphs undergo five instars before becoming adults. As they develop, they lose their skin and develop their wings. Empoasca fabae develops into adults in 8 through 37 days. Their entire lifecycle is one month long. As a pest Hopperburn The visually descriptive term hopperburn is used for a distinct type of damage on plants by E. fabae's feeding on its hosts.”Maletta, M., M, Henninger, & Holmstrom, K. (2006). “Potato Leafhopper Control and Plastic Mulch Culture in Organic Potato Production”. HortTechnology 16 (2): 199-204. As they feed their saliva mechanically injures the phloem and parenchyma cells. The plant also suffers damage to its vascular cambium, and to its vascular bundles. Within 24 hours of being infested, rates of photosynthesis, and transpiration are reduced, leaves accumulate starch, and transport of photoassimilates are reduced. The first symptoms of hopperburn is that a leaflet's margins start to curl up. As a plant's infestation increases, its leaves cup downward, and they start to turn from green to yellow.\\"Murray, J., M, Paul., & Schaafma, A. (2001) “Determination of traits associated with leafhopper (Empoasca fabae and Empoasca kraemeri) resistance and dissection of leafhopper damage symptoms in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)”. Annals of Applied Biology. 139(3): 319-327. In severe infestations this leads to leaf necrosis in which the leaf margins and intervein areas turn brown. Older plants completely lose their leaves. Young plants display tip-wilting and will be stunted in height. Plants that were damaged by stem feeding suffered more damage to their physiologies than those which were damaged by leaf eating. Research has shown that water- stressed plants increase nymph's development time. This causes severe hopperburn due to the increase plant stress response. Economic impacts Hopperburn leads to reduced plant growth and reproduction. In some heavily infested fields up to 75% of the yield is lost, it depends on what stage of development the plants are in. Obviously, this leads to reductions in crop yields and large economic losses. For example, in 1988 the losses of alfalfa crops in Northeast United States ranged from $32-$66 per hectare.Lamp,W., Nielsen, G., & Dively, G. (1991)“Insect Pest-Induced Losses in Alfalfa: Patterns in Maryland and Implications for Management.” Journal of Economic Entomology 84(2): 610-618.. The amount of crop damage is directly proportional to the population density. Most crop damage comes from the future generations of the initial arrivals back to the summer range. Climate change Research has indicated that over the last 62 years that they have been arriving back to their summer range earlier by ten days.” Baker, M., P, Venugopal., & Lamp, W. (2015). “Climate Change and Phenology: Empoasca fabae (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) Migration and Severity of Impact”. PLoS ONE 10 (5): 1–12 Warmer temperatures increases the time and speed of egg hatching and nymph development.”Sidumo, A., E, Sheilds., & Lembo, A. (2005). “Estimating the Potato Leafhopper Empoasca fabae (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) Overwintering Range and Spring Premigrant Development by Using Geographic Information System.” Journal of Economic Entomology 98 (3): 757–764. There is increasing concern that climate change will shift the overwintering and summer ranges more northward. This will exacerbate the problem of pest management and increase economic losses. . Pest management Usually, crop detection of E. fabae is too late as hopperburn is the first visual symptom of a major infestation. Regular crop inspections with a sweep net are essential to help reduce massive economic losses. Another visual cue is the death of leaves with small pits holes throughout them resulting from their eggs. Host expansion is likely caused from the loss of natural resistance through extensive plant breeding. Currently, the only effective method that exists for controlling E. fabae's infestations is the heavy application of insecticides. Short-lived insecticides such as carbaryl are commonly used; however they require costly reapplications. Research is indicating the possibility of being able to control populations by increasing E. fabae's natural enemies as part of pest management plan.”Erlandson, W., & Obrycki, J. (2010). “Predation of Immature and Adult Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) by Three Species of Predatory Insects.” Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society 83(1): 1-6. Percent mortality has been shown to be highest in individuals in younger instars. Research has shown that natural resistance and pesticide use are just as effective, but neither is capable to fully contain populations.Ghidiu, G., D, Douches., K, Flecher., & Coombs, J. (2011). “Comparing Host Plant Resistance, Engineered Resistance, and Insecticide Treatment for Control of Colorado Potato Beetle and Potato Leafhopper in Potatoes.” International Journal of Agronomy 11(6): 516–523 To create more effective management programs and reduce pesticide use it is essential to understand their dispersion, temporal and spatial patterns.

He was an expert in tropical botany and an authority on Batak language and culture. Early life Bartlett was born in Anaconda, Montana on March 9, 1886. His family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana in 1899, and he was enrolled in Shortridge High School. It was here where he cultivated his interests in botany, geology, and chemistry. After his graduation, he remained at the school as an assistant in botany and chemistry. Bartlett studied chemistry at Harvard University, receiving his A.B. in 1908. He was brought on as an undergraduate assistant at the Gray Herbarium, working under Merritt Lyndon Fernald and Benjamin Lincoln Robinson. Career Bartlett was hired by the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture, where he worked on plant nutrition and biochemistry as well as taxonomy. Inspired by botanist Hugo de Vries, he began publishing on the genetics of the genus Oenothera. After an invitation from Frederick Charles Newcombe, Bartlett joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1915. He made his first collecting trip abroad in 1918 when he was sent to Sumatra with United States Rubber Company to search for high-yielding sources of rubber. In 1919, became director of the University of Michigan's Botanical Gardens, and in 1922, he became head of the Department of Botany. Bartlett served as president of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters from 1924 to 1925, and president of the Botanical Society of America in 1927. Bartlett returned to Sumatra in 1927, and became fascinated by the culture and language of the Batak of Asahan. He became a leading authority and an adopted chief of the tribe. He made many collecting trips to South America, as well as in Taiwan, Haiti, and the Philippines. Between 1934 and 1935, Bartlett was an exchange professor at the University of the Philippines. In 1948, he was named educational consultant for the Philippines in the United States, and a chairman of the Commission on the Philippines. He continued to study rubber production, and introduced high-yielding rubber plants from the Philippines into Haiti and encouraged the cultivation of guayule in parts of South America. Bartlett retired from the University of Michigan in 1956, but he remained as Professor Emeritus of Botany and Director Emeritus of the Botanical Gardens. Bartlett was the author of 179 publications. Bartlett died of a heart attack at the age of 73 on February 21, 1960, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Legacy He is commemorated in the name of one genus, Bartlettina, and many species, including Anemia bartlettii, Buxus bartlettii, Rhipsalis bartlettii, and Panicum bartletii. The herbarium at the University of Michigan holds his collections of over 60,000 specimens. In 1955, the Department of Botany established the Harley Harris Bartlett Plant Exploration Fund as a way to finance botanical field trips.

His collusion with the government, scholars claim, came close to destroying his sect during the war. Ogasawara had served important roles within his school. He was the chief editor of Nichiren Shoshu's doctrinal magazine “Seikaino Nichiren” (Nichiren of the World) and was also the supervisor of proselytization for Nichiren Shoshu. Ogasawara used these roles to promote his version of syncretism—the attempted merging of Nichiren Buddhism and Shinto. Distinct from Honji suijaku which declared Kami as the manifestations and teaching mechanisms of the Buddha, Ogasawara proposed the theory “Shinto is Absolute; and the Buddha, Transient,” which held that Shinto deities are primary and the Buddha is secondary. For this reason he was described by the Japanese religious newspaper Chugai Nippo as a “venomous priest.” Ogasawara was active in directly colluding with the military government. He was a member of the Suigyo-kai (Fish and Water Society), a group of army, business and religious figures who attempted to promote national mobilization by unifying all Nichiren schools into one sect, regardless of their unique histories and doctrines. On March 10, 1941, at a joint conference of Nichiren Shoshu priests and laymen, Ogasawara called for the immediate approval of the merger with other Nichiren sects but his resolution failed to carry.Ikeda, Daisaku (2004), p. 745. A few months later he then pressured the executive leaders of Nichiren Shoshu to resign under the guise of sect reform and encouraged governmental authorities to indict Nichiren Shoshu's then High Priest and Chief Administrator Nikkyo Suzuki and his administration for Lèse-majesté, the crime of dishonoring the emperor. He also instigated the imprisonment of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda, the respective president and general director of what now is known as the Soka Gakkai.Montgomery, Daniel B. (1991), p. 182. \\"The High Priest at Taiseki-ji and his assembled clergy were willing to accept this stratagem, but Makiguchi resolutely refused. He was summoned to Taiseki-ji and ordered to obey; still he refused. A few weeks later he and 20 leaders of his organization were arrested. Within a few days all recanted except two: Makiguchi and his faithful friend Josei Toda. They were incarcerated for the duration of the war.\\" Ogasawara was surreptitiously reinstituted as a Nichiren Shoshu priest soon after the war in 1946 without having publicly denouncing his wartime theories; some allegations exist that he continued to expound them after the war.Ikeda, D. (2004). p. 707 His reappointment was hidden from the Soka Gakkai leadership and public announcement of his reinstatement and appointment to a high priestly ranking of dai-sozu was not made until April 30, 1952. This gap in communication led to the “Ogasawara Incident” of April 27, 1952, in which his presence at Taisekiji was uncovered by Soka Gakkai youth who severely reprimanded him and his theories. The aftershocks from this incident lasted for six months. On September 9, 1952, he was rebuked by the Nichiren Shoshu leadership and threatened with expulsion unless he fully and openly denounced his wartime theories. He also faced the loss of support from his own local temple's parishioners.Ikeda, Daisaku (2004), p. 792. He capitulated to this demand on October 31, 1952.Ikeda, Daisaku (2004), p. 804. In the final years before his death, he reconciled with and supported Josei Toda and the Soka Gakkai. In 1954, when the Soka Gakkai had a dispute with a priest of Renge-ji temple in Osaka, Ogasawara voiced strong support for the former. On May 25, 1955 Ogasawara wrote the book “Introduction to Nichiren Shoshu” (Nichiren Shoshu Nyumon) in which he acknowledged his mistaken doctrine of “Shinto is absolute; the Buddha, transient” and highly praised Josei Toda.
